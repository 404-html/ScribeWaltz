00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.830
Jesus fucking Christ.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.553
Put It on the wall.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.370
Episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.600
Just started.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.843
Hey fuckers,

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.630
uh,

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.010
what did we brought to you about today?

8
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.020
Today we're brought to you by stamps.com stamps.com is a great resource.

9
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.730
If you a great service,

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.170
if you run your own business,

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.281
do you run your own business?

12
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:30.420
You know what a pain in the ass it is to go to the fucking post office with a

13
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:35.421
box of shit and have someone who doesn't really want to be their way it all out

14
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.640
for you and it takes a long time to wait in line.

15
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.630
It's a pain in the ass.

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
The beautiful thing about stamps.com is that you can do it all directly from

17
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:44.874
your own house.

18
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.811
You weigh your shit,

19
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:47.190
they give you your free digital scale.

20
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:47.791
You weigh it,

21
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:47.921
you,

22
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.370
you print up the stickers for the postage,

23
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.720
right on your home computer.

24
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.210
You leave them out for the post man and you're done.

25
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.223
It's beautiful.

26
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.180
If you buy any of Brian's kittycat tee shirts from death squad.tv,

27
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.650
that's how Brian sends him.

28
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680
He sends him off from stamps.com and for him it's like the difference between it

29
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:11.310
being really easy to do and a huge fucking pain in the ass hours,

30
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.720
hours difference.

31
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.260
Next,

32
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.350
you just print out the whole thing at once because essentially with the desk

33
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.760
squad artwork and all that stuff,

34
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.800
you've started your own business,

35
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.251
you know,

36
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:20.611
and you,

37
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:21.800
you really don't have any employee.

38
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:22.710
So it's like,

39
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.850
yeah,

40
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.030
it's a lot of work and man,

41
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.700
you're so every time we go to these shows,

42
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:28.170
I see these fucking tee shirts everywhere.

43
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.190
So it makes it way easier for Brian and a,

44
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.930
if you go to stamps.com and click on the microphone in the upper right hand

45
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:37.764
corner,

46
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.720
you enter in the code word j,

47
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:44.721
r e and you get this $110 value where you get 55 bucks and postage coupons,

48
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.650
a free digital scale,

49
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.580
$5 supply kit and a four week trial.

50
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.841
It's a,

51
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:55.080
it's really cool service.

52
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.370
And uh,

53
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.851
like I said,

54
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.241
if you,

55
00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:57.750
uh,

56
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.370
if you have your own small business,

57
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.211
it's awesome.

58
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:02.370
And if you don't have your own small business start when you were.

59
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.581
Yeah,

60
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.890
you worked for somebody really fucking figure it out.

61
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.140
He said create something.

62
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.910
I bet you want to.

63
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.050
If you do,

64
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.883
you should do it.

65
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.731
And if you do it,

66
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.690
use stamps.com.

67
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.860
Use The code word j r e and save yourself some cash song.

68
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.690
Do you ever check the mail anymore?

69
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.171
Like what's,

70
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:19.411
what's,

71
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.180
what's your frequency for checking the mail?

72
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.860
Uh,

73
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.141
you know,

74
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:23.610
if I had to get something delivered,

75
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.650
you know that's it,

76
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.840
right?

77
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.140
Yeah.

78
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.640
I mean like letters and shit.

79
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:27.510
Like what are you doing?

80
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.950
How many emails too?

81
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:30.750
But it's getting really bad though where I'm like,

82
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:31.380
seriously,

83
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.830
just ignoring my mailbox and it shouldn't do that because what if there's like

84
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:35.880
some legal shit in there?

85
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.743
Especially you,

86
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.310
you've scandal a son of a bitch.

87
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.740
I know and knows what kind of nonsense you've gotten yourself into.

88
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.360
Tell the truth,

89
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.180
son told the truth.

90
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.260
Uh,

91
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.710
we're also brought to you by Ting Tang is a,

92
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.740
a cell phone company and wasn't rogan.ting.com they use the sprint.

93
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.280
If you ever,

94
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.300
if you heard this before,

95
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.530
tough shit.

96
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.363
All right,

97
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.413
let me say it again.

98
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.350
I don't want to think I want to to fuck soon.

99
00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:01.171
Soon commercials.

100
00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:02.340
I'm tired of saying them bitch.

101
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.270
Okay.

102
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.290
We're both tired of this.

103
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.350
However I got to get through them and I'm not sure there's another way to do it

104
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.690
and if you're tired of hearing me talk period,

105
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.190
I fucking understand it.

106
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.240
I'm not exactly thrilled with you and myself either after all this fucking

107
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.540
hours.

108
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.230
All right.

109
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.250
If you're getting annoyed at me,

110
00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:18.450
it's totally understandable.

111
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.580
I would get annoyed at me to take a break,

112
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:21.414
man.

113
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.100
I said a couple of weeks off the show notes.

114
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.371
Go,

115
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:24.240
go do something else,

116
00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:24.980
man.

117
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.520
No podcasts for a month for you.

118
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:27.354
How about that?

119
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.100
If you're into the cell phone,

120
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.610
if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash.

121
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.350
<v 1>Rogan,</v>

122
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.180
that's the,

123
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.690
they have the HTC one asa,

124
00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:36.440
which is a,

125
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.310
it's kind of interesting.

126
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:39.020
It has speakers in the front of it,

127
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.470
which,

128
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.290
which you know like most phones have them like underneath and stuff.

129
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:44.900
So it makes sense and actually has like a,

130
00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:46.610
it looks like an old Mac book.

131
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.983
The design of it.

132
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.080
<v 0>It has a very,</v>

133
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.700
very good sound supposedly.

134
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.180
Yeah,

135
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.850
but who the fuck place speakerphone phones.

136
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.371
You know,

137
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.920
like unless you're showing someone a video.

138
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.251
Yeah.

139
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:57.270
Which I guess it's possible.

140
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.410
It happens like once a week.

141
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.980
Right.

142
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.510
It does look dope as fuck though.

143
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.950
I went to galaxy s four.

144
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.610
Yeah.

145
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.920
Well with the point about this,

146
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:05.430
um,

147
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.430
this website haven't really talked about is there and less sort of a small

148
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:11.311
company,

149
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:12.750
but they use the sprint backbone.

150
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.730
It's not really that small anymore.

151
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.010
But what I mean by small as it's not 18 t,

152
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:18.070
it's not Verizon,

153
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:18.930
it's not sprint.

154
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.070
It's not one of the big ones.

155
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.350
But they use sprint service.

156
00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:24.600
So you get the same service he would get if you were on sprint.

157
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.480
But you also have the advantage of not having any contracts.

158
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.160
You also have the advantage of the way they have the pricing structured.

159
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.030
It's really sweet.

160
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.690
If you don't use as many minutes as you thought you would,

161
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.320
they credit you on your next bill and drop you down to the next level.

162
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.981
I mean,

163
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:42.270
what fucking company does that?

164
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.811
It's,

165
00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:43.151
it's,

166
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:43.984
it's beautiful.

167
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.880
No contracts,

168
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.743
great phones,

169
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.590
great service.

170
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.813
Check them out.

171
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.980
And if you go to Rogan,

172
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.630
no tin.com forward slash.

173
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:52.411
Rogan is that what it is?

174
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:52.670
God,

175
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.503
Dad,

176
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.533
I should know that.

177
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.040
I think it's four inch slash.

178
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:56.874
Rogen.

179
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.090

hmm.

182
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.180
Checkout Ting has all sorts of great URLs.

183
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.170
This isn't one of them.

184
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.250
<v 1>broken.ting.com I think that might be,</v>

185
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:12.100
it actually sounds right.

186
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.211
You would sink.

187
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:14.260
We do this every week.

188
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.180
We should know we're going to get it right.

189
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:17.650
Fucks his bloody up.

190
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.980
Yeah,

191
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.480
it's Rogan.

192
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.791
Not 10.

193
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:19.624
Got comp.

194
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.213
<v 0>Sorry.</v>

195
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.010
I didn't want to be so pretentious and it's put my own name in front of the

196
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:24.844
company.

197
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.650
It's our fuse to believe that it was structured.

198
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:27.790
So anyway,

199
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.190
go to [inaudible] Dot com save yourself 25 bucks.

200
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.280
That's rogan.ting.com and you get a $25 credit either on a new device or on

201
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:37.504
their service,

202
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.403
which is excellent.

203
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.921
It's great,

204
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:39.521
cool phones,

205
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.040
cool company and that's it.

206
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.670
<v 1>And great for international.</v>

207
00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:45.140
If you traveled to different countries,

208
00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:47.150
I found Brian had a party in Canada.

209
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.660
Yeah,

210
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.010
cost him $5 on his phone.

211
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.830
He was on sex lines.

212
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.210
Am I believe it's still sex lines,

213
00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:53.600
man.

214
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.180
That's the one of the weirdest things about going on the road as you get like

215
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:56.781
local,

216
00:05:56.781 --> 00:05:57.020
uh,

217
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.980
television commercials

218
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.900
<v 2>and every now and then like a sex line thing will come up.</v>

219
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.190
Like,

220
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.701
come on man.

221
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.534
Really?

222
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.720
2000 and fucking 13 you're calling strangers and jacking off.

223
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.860
So weird.

224
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.720
That seems like man,

225
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.830
they can't be a lot of people.

226
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.090
This is the fucking Internet.

227
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:12.770
Why were you paying someone to talk to you?

228
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.080
<v 3>What demographic is dialing those roadmaps?</v>

229
00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:17.460
Maps is so much cheaper than that.

230
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.130
<v 2>Rum,</v>

231
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.970
rob maps.

232
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.700
That's Brian's site and go jerk off powers the best spots.

233
00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:23.891
All right.

234
00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:26.090
It's all Brian posting with 30 different screen name.

235
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.943
Hi Guys.

236
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.050
It's Brian closing as a bunch of people arguing with each other all about who

237
00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:35.120
gives the best hand job.

238
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.060
And then it will create a website for it.

239
00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:38.640
Like Brian in a website.

240
00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.900
It's one of my favorite pranks of all time.

241
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.270
And it was a called step Pepsi Spice.

242
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.530
We've talked about it before.

243
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:44.831
It was,

244
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:49.390
it's literally one of my favorite pranks of all time when Pepsi was dumb enough

245
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.950
to buy Pepsi Spice and make that start making that stuff but not smart enough as

246
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:56.780
well to get the Url Pepsi Spice and that God.

247
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.270
So psycho over here gets Pepsi spice.com and starts,

248
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.070
starts printing this fucking blog about how he's been drinking Pepsi Spice and

249
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:09.730
his health is eroding and he's only tricky.

250
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:12.060
Pepsi space does.

251
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.430
Yeah.

252
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.510
And he's like dying.

253
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.540
It was really funny man.

254
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.770
It was really funny.

255
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.120
This was before you even work.

256
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.163
No

257
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.020
<v 3>dirty work.</v>

258
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.370
And this is where I uh,

259
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.730
I brought up that I was hanging out with Lindsay Lohan at one point and we were

260
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:30.230
chopping up mushrooms and snorting it and she caught him o'kane and then Doug,

261
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.610
Stan hope actually tried it doing that like,

262
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.870
like a couple of months later.

263
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.143
Terrible.

264
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.880
That's a terrible idea.

265
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.810
Yeah.

266
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.640
This is actually just only half of it.

267
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.920
The other half got deleted but I might have it somewhere

268
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.270
<v 2>and coke together.</v>

269
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.930
Sounds like a fucking mistake.

270
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.550
Yeah I have people do that shit.

271
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.900
Candy flipping that he would do it though.

272
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.470
Like with other drugs available.

273
00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.840
It's normally when you're a little kidney like lets smoke banana peels.

274
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.763
What are you doing Doug?

275
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.810
Well I think it's probably a proven thing though.

276
00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:02.700
It's probably got a very specific effect.

277
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.840
I mean I don't know what it is but I bet the mushroom and coke club like the

278
00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:08.130
people that are really down with that shit,

279
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.960
they'll probably tell you you're out of your mind.

280
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.853
That's the way to go.

281
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.760
Wow.

282
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.090
There's not really many pro coke advocates so you know,

283
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.283
is it still up there?

284
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.880
Everything's up on Pepsi's place.com

285
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.320
<v 3>or is it that it got to wait but there's a lot of websites talking about like</v>

286
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.120
the Museum of hoaxes.com

287
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.643
dude,

288
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.720
<v 2>I've got to fucking give you</v>

289
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.250
those.

290
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.100
Outstanding.

291
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.810
He's one of my favorite things you've ever done.

292
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.020
I was hoping the story would have ended in and then Pepsi bought it from Brian

293
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:37.854
for a million.

294
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.830
<v 3>They only did it for one year.</v>

295
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:43.790
I actually kept it and I was planning it for the holiday season the following

296
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.791
year.

297
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:47.430
I was going to have it like a different version of it and uh,

298
00:08:47.431 --> 00:08:47.740
they,

299
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.220
they didn't bring it back though.

300
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.560
It was discussed.

301
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.200
It was one of the most gross doing fucking brilliant idea.

302
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.183
You know what Brian,

303
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.060
you really should

304
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.440
<v 2>be talking about this on stage.</v>

305
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.240
That would be a really funny bit.

306
00:08:59.270 --> 00:08:59.720
Really?

307
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.260
Yes.

308
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.740
Relaying the whole Pepsi Spice Story and then like breaking down all the

309
00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:05.850
different shit that you said it was going to do to you too.

310
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:07.730
That was really funny stuff.

311
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.590
That's like perfect type of material for stand up that you've always been in

312
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.490
doing pranks like and then just go into it.

313
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.230
I took like,

314
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.650
it's really funny story for your new clean show and it really does taste like

315
00:09:18.651 --> 00:09:19.484
dog shit.

316
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.830
Like utter complete total dog shit.

317
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.310
Yeah.

318
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.080
This was the commercial for the Pepsi Spicer.

319
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.253
Right.

320
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.570
<v 4>I'm giving myself blow jobs and</v>

321
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.930
that's a great man.

322
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.730
<v 2>The next morning put so much effort into this.</v>

323
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:39.870
It's so crazy.

324
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.843
Yeah.

325
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.270
You're out of your mind man.

326
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.673
I was really,

327
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.210
really funny flag.

328
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.520
It's kind of amazing.

329
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:48.961
Oh,

330
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:49.420
I know.

331
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.670
You know somebody actually Mandarin Mandarin actually sent me a cease and desist

332
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:54.080
letter.

333
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.770
It looked like it came from Pepsi.

334
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.050
That's hilarious.

335
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.040
Did you listen to it?

336
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.340
I don't remember.

337
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.840
I think I did for like a day,

338
00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:03.280
but then I figured it out or something.

339
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.270
Oh that's funny.

340
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.650
That's fucking hilarious.

341
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.250
Yeah.

342
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:06.550
Uh,

343
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.470
last sponsor on it.

344
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.313
Dot Con.

345
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.161
If you go to o,

346
00:10:09.161 --> 00:10:13.330
n n I t and use a code name rogue and you'll save 10% off any of the supplements

347
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.320
and a,

348
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.580
we don't just sell supplements.

349
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.600
We have a lot of shit now.

350
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.200
It started out,

351
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.220
it's really just supplements,

352
00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:22.840
but what we're trying to do is become like a human performance website.

353
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.980
We're trying to sell you shit.

354
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:24.940
It's good for your body,

355
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.980
whether it's good athletically or good in terms of a supplement or a mood

356
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:34.981
enhancer or a good source of hemp protein or walnut almond cashew butter,

357
00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:36.630
which is trying to sell you cool ship.

358
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.660
And we even have Dave Asprey's bulletproof coffee.

359
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.500
Yes,

360
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.800
carry it in a store,

361
00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:42.634
bitches.

362
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.450
Um,

363
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.141
lots of cool shit.

364
00:10:44.141 --> 00:10:46.600
Lots of strength and conditioning equipment,

365
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.650
kettlebells,

366
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.420
things of the like battle ropes,

367
00:10:49.421 --> 00:10:50.254
weight vests,

368
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.570
just stuff to get you fit son.

369
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.010
So I use a code name,

370
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:57.040
Rogan save 10% off any and all supplements.

371
00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:57.580
Boom.

372
00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.413
Anything else Brian?

373
00:10:59.330 --> 00:10:59.690
All right.

374
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.700
And fucking hit the music.

375
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.840
Let's get this bitch cracking

376
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.893
<v 4>experience.</v>

377
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.850
<v 2>Powerful Tait Fletcher.</v>

378
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.660
Oh Gee.

379
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.070
Death Squad is in the House,

380
00:11:18.071 --> 00:11:19.000
Ladies and gentlemen.

381
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.343
Oh Gee.

382
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.500
And of course Mr Dave Asprey's.

383
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.110
Well,

384
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.030
Tate Fletcher is probably your biggest fan dude.

385
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:25.720
This guy,

386
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.260
he touts your virtues and he was the one that came into the ice house.

387
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:29.740
Uh,

388
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.180
when he did the podcast last,

389
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.260
he had this fucking gigantic beer keg sized,

390
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.040
the mugs my size because I figured you guys would have their setup.

391
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.360
I trusted these two fully lit.

392
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.820
He's got two canteens of it with,

393
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.270
I mean it's huge.

394
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.430
I love you take and you're so fun.

395
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.710
You're always always so fucking enthusiastic about shit.

396
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.841
<v 5>You will get eaten.</v>

397
00:11:54.841 --> 00:11:56.760
You so excessive like to the brain,

398
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.930
like Costco buying coffee,

399
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.280
ice an animal.

400
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.440
Tate and I lived together for like four months.

401
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.960
Yeah,

402
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.421
that was fun.

403
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:05.860
I hope you learned a lot during that time.

404
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.560
I learned you live like a bear.

405
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.673
Like

406
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.050
Kyle's everything in his corner and they just go in there and hibernate.

407
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.070
The best part was the,

408
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.690
was the tank to go down in that.

409
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.720
I never really appreciated every little,

410
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.000
every little scratch and cut that you get grappling,

411
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.330
but you really do when you get in one of those things where you got to learn how

412
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:29.200
to deal with that stink.

413
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:29.890
But it's only lasts,

414
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.400
lasts for four or five minutes at the most and it's going somewhere else.

415
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.961
But man,

416
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:37.130
it's one of those things where I really wish more people knew about.

417
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.550
I talk about it so much that people tell me to shut the fuck up.

418
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.120
They're like,

419
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.440
we stopped talking about the tank.

420
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.240
He tried it.

421
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:43.880
It's like it's,

422
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.740
it's safe,

423
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:45.640
it's legal.

424
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:45.881
It's,

425
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:47.110
there's no worries.

426
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:47.681
It's good.

427
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:49.180
It's a great source of magnesium.

428
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.650
Just getting to that,

429
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.890
when people talk about wanting to get the benefits of yoga and stuff like that,

430
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.730
like you were the first one that I ever heard talk about like all those poses

431
00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:59.370
leading to a place of,

432
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.550
of kind of like a supernatural experience with yourself and all that kind of

433
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:03.731
thing.

434
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:05.950
What yogis were originally trying to do and,

435
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.230
and that's a lot of discipline do that,

436
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:08.471
you know,

437
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:12.790
but like to get into to and like to have the benefits of like a massage or real

438
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:17.760
deep relaxation of all that stuff come and just getting into a tank and that's,

439
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.600
that's fair.

440
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:18.820
You know,

441
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.660
that's available.

442
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.081
Yeah,

443
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:22.240
you can have and you don't have to be good at anything.

444
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.220
You can just lay there in bed and the best part,

445
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.710
especially if you learn how to relax,

446
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.371
that's a thing.

447
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:28.530
Like I've had people tell me,

448
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:28.720
Oh,

449
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.980
when the Turkey during the dark,

450
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:31.720
right.

451
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.081
And I'm like,

452
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:32.990
God damn dude,

453
00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:33.340
Dude.

454
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.990
Do you know how to use your brain at all?

455
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:35.883
Like how did you not,

456
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.700
how did,

457
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.170
how did it do nothing for you.

458
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.921
I feel like too,

459
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:42.790
if you're living in a way that you're just dawned on me the other day,

460
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:43.330
I was like,

461
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.040
you live kind of an aggressive life tape.

462
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.290
Like I've never thought that before.

463
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:48.220
It never dawned on me.

464
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.323
But uh,

465
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.480
but if you're really attacking life in a way,

466
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:53.560
like you're after stuff,

467
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:54.670
you're using your intellect,

468
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:55.980
your using your artistic side,

469
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.200
you're,

470
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.040
you're really going into things full fledged and you need a relaxation.

471
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:00.874
You need that.

472
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.460
If you're just kind of secondary all the time and you get a tank,

473
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.510
maybe I can see that.

474
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:07.300
But like if you really need that release on the other side of things,

475
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.221
<v 0>yeah,</v>

476
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:08.940
maybe.

477
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.930
I just think it's a good time for self reflection and I don't think people don't

478
00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:13.620
get that enough.

479
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.010
People don't.

480
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.740
You don't get enough time where you can actually just sit and do nothing.

481
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.880
We try to multitask,

482
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.050
try to watch TV while we relaxed while we look at our Twitter while we talked to

483
00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:24.360
someone who's near us and we think it's relaxing,

484
00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:26.100
but there's still a lot of shit going on.

485
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.720
It's just a lower vibration.

486
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.460
When you get in a tank,

487
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:29.741
it's,

488
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:30.690
there's nothing going on,

489
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.110
man.

490
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.680
There's nothing.

491
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.610
There's no life anymore.

492
00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:33.361
It's disconnected.

493
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:34.350
If you can just ignore,

494
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.090
just start learning how to stay still.

495
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.953
Stop moving,

496
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.530
ignore the fact.

497
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.030
Have the tank,

498
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.080
except the fact that it is.

499
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:42.990
I can just be just be and breathe in this state.

500
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.741
<v 5>Here's the thing,</v>

501
00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:47.510
you guys are pretty into your bodies.

502
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.540
That's what I'm talking about.

503
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.180
Talk

504
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.013
<v 3>to me.</v>

505
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:53.920
I noticed,

506
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.180
I'm not saying that each other's bodies,

507
00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:56.460
that's a different animal all together.

508
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.750
Talking about chuck and fuck jerking off in front of a mirror.

509
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.950
If you're in,

510
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.510
if you're in there though and you get nothing from it,

511
00:15:04.511 --> 00:15:07.540
and it's probably because your brain is mostly not connected into your body.

512
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:09.050
So for a throat

513
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.400
<v 0>it could be anxiety.</v>

514
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.000
She can be tweak about shit and they can never get comfortable.

515
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.200
It's hard to get comfortable,

516
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.660
so you start thinking about a lot of stupid shit that's bugging you.

517
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:18.690
It's distracting,

518
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.610
you know,

519
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.750
managing the mind is one of the most critical things that you need to learn in

520
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:25.850
this life that learn how to manage your shit.

521
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.890
The first time in my life,

522
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.611
I couldn't remember,

523
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:32.390
like when I realized that I didn't always have to get mad when something

524
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:33.170
happened,

525
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.430
I could cut my shit together.

526
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.050
It was a beautiful feeling.

527
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.470
Yeah.

528
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.771
It's like,

529
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:38.180
and to actually pull it off,

530
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:41.690
like the pull it off when someone's being incredibly country to you and you just

531
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.980
never get upset.

532
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.180
That's beautiful feeling.

533
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.540
Yep.

534
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.920
<v 3>I had the best one of those ever.</v>

535
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.160
I finished this Shaman class just planning three first of all,

536
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.100
how dare you say I finished the Sharman class with a straight look in your city.

537
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.910
I spent a week learning about and stuff and,

538
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:56.744
but here's the thing,

539
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.040
I was in this weird state,

540
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.820
I got pulled over somewhere down by Joshua tree by a cop.

541
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.151
Right.

542
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:02.781
And I was like,

543
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:05.390
I'm doing 70 in a 65 like whatever.

544
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.850
They just assume everybody out there is high on meth.

545
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.131
Yeah.

546
00:16:08.131 --> 00:16:09.900
Pretty much comes out with this guy.

547
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.220
We better check calmness about me.

548
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.911
This guy,

549
00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:14.210
you know,

550
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.640
normal attitude and all of a sudden he just like,

551
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.020
like does something and cause,

552
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.883
oh.

553
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:19.490
Uh,

554
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.890
and he starts completing the car and then when he's done,

555
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:24.500
he writes me for like five over or whatever and says,

556
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.960
you're a really nice man and shakes my hand.

557
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:27.740
Wow.

558
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.150
I've never had a cop.

559
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.050
I mean even pulled over like,

560
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.351
I don't know,

561
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:31.041
50 times,

562
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:32.090
I tend to get tickets,

563
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.020
but this guy,

564
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.790
you could tell he didn't even know what to do with themselves and let that

565
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.310
non-reaction thing you're talking about,

566
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:37.640
they're like,

567
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.530
I wasn't pissed off with him and he's just doing his job,

568
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:40.340
whatever.

569
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.240
But yeah,

570
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.670
there's something that happens when you do that and they treat you different.

571
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.341
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

572
00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:47.730
It's possible to turn a situation around with the right attitude.

573
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:52.080
It's like there's a lot of people that we all know that always got into trouble

574
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.000
and you always had to look back and go,

575
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:56.040
could that motherfucker have avoided that trouble?

576
00:16:56.041 --> 00:16:58.290
Like what did that shit really have to go down?

577
00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.311
And they lay man,

578
00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:01.800
if you would've done the same thing if you were in that situation and then you

579
00:17:01.801 --> 00:17:02.150
go,

580
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.360
I don't know if I would have.

581
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:03.870
Right.

582
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.740
I don't know if I would have,

583
00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:06.150
I think maybe you caught us.

584
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.070
Maybe it caused her a little bit.

585
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.820
<v 6>Well and those kinds of reflections that you wouldn't be present to without</v>

586
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:13.091
that.

587
00:17:13.091 --> 00:17:13.670
You know what I mean?

588
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.940
And until you empty it out everything else and you're like,

589
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:16.151
oh,

590
00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:17.260
this is another occurrence.

591
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.820
What I think of it all the time is,

592
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.900
is in myself.

593
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:21.400
It's not just how I reflect to the world,

594
00:17:21.401 --> 00:17:23.200
but like how do I feel about it?

595
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:26.800
Like if somebody like somebody at my gym,

596
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.340
they didn't show up for class one morning and then there's no classes and people

597
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:32.320
are there and it's like a freak out,

598
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.830
you know?

599
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.150
But like,

600
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.201
and somebody said,

601
00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:35.411
God,

602
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:35.591
you,

603
00:17:35.591 --> 00:17:35.961
you react,

604
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:36.210
reacted.

605
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.090
You were just,

606
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:37.871
you're like,

607
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:38.231
okay,

608
00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:39.100
well I know that it's got,

609
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:40.300
it's gotta be gutting for you.

610
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.650
I'm sorry that happened.

611
00:17:41.651 --> 00:17:43.310
Let's look at how we can mitigate the,

612
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.830
the response of everybody else here and go on with them.

613
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.664
They're like,

614
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:47.921
what happened?

615
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:48.371
There's nothing.

616
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:48.531
You're,

617
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:48.780
you,

618
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.140
you in such a nice way.

619
00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:50.740
And I'm like,

620
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.070
well,

621
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.030
it doesn't change anything for me to get all like all amped up about it.

622
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.530
And so why?

623
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.540
Why do I want to feel ugly inside?

624
00:17:58.541 --> 00:17:59.590
Why do I want to have that?

625
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.700
That kind of cause that's a damper on your soul,

626
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.981
man.

627
00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:03.520
And I'm like,

628
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.110
I can be happy or I can be shitty.

629
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.140
I'm going to choose to be happy about it.

630
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.870
<v 2>The only time it becomes a problem is when you actually have to deal with</v>

631
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:10.704
someone.

632
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.240
Like it's like they're being aggressively cunty.

633
00:18:14.241 --> 00:18:14.790
Yeah.

634
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.870
I've got a great story with

635
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.570
the Hallway Story.

636
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.433
Oh yeah.

637
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.850
We were in a,

638
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.030
this is a perfect example,

639
00:18:22.031 --> 00:18:22.370
it tapes,

640
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.250
but that's a good thing.

641
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:24.084
Listen,

642
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.240
I'm going to put up with,

643
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.220
this is a perfect example of,

644
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.170
it's like Jujitsu.

645
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:32.790
I feel like Jujitsu is like,

646
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.150
I'm going to dig you some holes and I'm going to offer you a bunch of bad

647
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:39.420
choices and you're going to have to go on one of my holes like the and and so

648
00:18:39.421 --> 00:18:40.021
the same thing.

649
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:44.160
As long as everybody's clear about this is an eventuality that will happen if

650
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:45.170
you choose doré.

651
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.820
So that's all I'm going to say.

652
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.120
I let people make their own choices.

653
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:49.820
I'm here for whatever kind of party you want to throw.

654
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.750
We were hanging out in Las Vegas and I know that if you've ever been to Las

655
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.751
Vegas,

656
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:56.850
he know that there's some dudes that just don't know how to,

657
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.103
yeah,

658
00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:58.950
they can do it.

659
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.270
You give him too much freedom,

660
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:01.140
too much booze.

661
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.210
This kid was like six foot six.

662
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:04.330
He was really exhilarating.

663
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.850
It was a big fuck.

664
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.860
And because of that he was like super confident that he could just go around

665
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.220
pushing people around and even Tate like taints a big motherfucker.

666
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.140
I wouldn't minister this stupid Dick.

667
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:18.420
He was probably like four or five inches taller than you.

668
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:18.670
Right.

669
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.230
He's a big boy fucker.

670
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.930
He was big.

671
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.763
His buddy

672
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:22.320
<v 6>my size,</v>

673
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.970
his buddy was,

674
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.330
and that was like normal.

675
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:27.390
And then there's this giant with him and we come out of the hotel

676
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.590
<v 2>coming out on the elevator and take trying to put his card in the room and the</v>

677
00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:33.131
kids like,

678
00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:34.990
that's my room and tell you,

679
00:19:34.991 --> 00:19:35.350
it's like,

680
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.010
oh no,

681
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.000
I'm pretty sure it's mine.

682
00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:37.241
Look.

683
00:19:37.241 --> 00:19:37.511
Yup.

684
00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:38.470
See I got the key,

685
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.453
take it easy.

686
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.120
Like literally like give the kid all the fucking room in the world.

687
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.193
And uh,

688
00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.410
I was in the room next to him and all of a sudden we hear bang,

689
00:19:47.411 --> 00:19:47.681
Bang,

690
00:19:47.681 --> 00:19:47.891
Bang,

691
00:19:47.891 --> 00:19:48.281
Bang.

692
00:19:48.281 --> 00:19:49.600
So after take one in his room,

693
00:19:49.601 --> 00:19:54.010
that dude like decided that he was pissed off and he knew Tate was in there.

694
00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:55.870
She's banging on the door to get taped,

695
00:19:55.871 --> 00:19:56.351
come out.

696
00:19:56.351 --> 00:19:59.710
So Tate opens a door and I hear them talk and Eddie and I run out into the

697
00:19:59.711 --> 00:20:00.544
hallway.

698
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.710
And so this big fuck is standing in front of Tate.

699
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.170
And there was a lot of talking,

700
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.450
but nothing that looked like nothing was going to happen.

701
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.040
And the guy started to back away.

702
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.270
And Eddie Bravo goes,

703
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:10.481
well,

704
00:20:10.481 --> 00:20:12.360
you're the one just standing there talking shit,

705
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.463
right?

706
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.091
<v 6>There's the,</v>

707
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:15.924
the guy,

708
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.890
the guy's friend is,

709
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.370
is more sober,

710
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.533
cooler.

711
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.140
And he's like,

712
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.591
hey dude,

713
00:20:20.591 --> 00:20:20.921
come on.

714
00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:21.521
Let's just go,

715
00:20:21.521 --> 00:20:21.761
man.

716
00:20:21.761 --> 00:20:21.970
Let's go.

717
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:22.301
Let's go.

718
00:20:22.301 --> 00:20:25.780
And he's trying to get him to the elevator and our doors right where it t's off.

719
00:20:25.781 --> 00:20:27.430
And so I'm looking out the window,

720
00:20:27.431 --> 00:20:28.900
there's elevator elevator,

721
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.590
and then we're standing there and Eddie's over here and Joe's over here kind of

722
00:20:32.591 --> 00:20:33.340
flanking me.

723
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.173
And,

724
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:34.631
and I was like,

725
00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:34.961
dude,

726
00:20:34.961 --> 00:20:35.531
just relax.

727
00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:36.071
It's my room,

728
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:36.281
you know,

729
00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:36.740
and all that.

730
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.511
And the guy's like,

731
00:20:37.511 --> 00:20:37.661
yeah,

732
00:20:37.661 --> 00:20:38.141
let's go.

733
00:20:38.141 --> 00:20:39.280
And he turns to his friend and he,

734
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.203
and he shoves him,

735
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.330
his friends back on his shoulders inside the elevator at that point.

736
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.531
So at that point,

737
00:20:44.531 --> 00:20:46.690
those cameras caught that.

738
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.620
And then the,

739
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:47.980
and then the

740
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.401
<v 2>guys going,</v>

741
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:51.440
you fucking baldheaded had [inaudible] son of a bitch,

742
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.660
all this kind of stuff.

743
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:53.441
All right,

744
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:53.681
dude.

745
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:53.991
Cool.

746
00:20:53.991 --> 00:20:54.311
I said,

747
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:54.830
we're done.

748
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.663
Are you going to go?

749
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.470
And he's like,

750
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.681
no,

751
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:57.401
fuck you bitch.

752
00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:57.890
And I'm like,

753
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.300
I was,

754
00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:58.991
I dunno.

755
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.150
I just started hanging out with Joe Really?

756
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:01.984
And I was like,

757
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.093
you know what,

758
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.960
there's not a present danger.

759
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:05.980
What can I really do hear?

760
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:06.400
You know?

761
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:06.671
And,

762
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:06.971
and,

763
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:08.020
and Eddie was just like,

764
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:09.820
Eddie just dropped the leash and he was like,

765
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.571
what dude?

766
00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:10.781
You're,

767
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:11.020
you're,

768
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.950
you calling him a bitch,

769
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:13.120
you're the one that keeps backing away,

770
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:13.541
whatever.

771
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:14.200
And I'm like,

772
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.050
I guess it's on,

773
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.730
right fucking.

774
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:17.883
Oh.

775
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.360
And then the dude comes at me.

776
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:19.631
I was like,

777
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:19.781
yeah,

778
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:20.201
come at me.

779
00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:21.034
See what happens.

780
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.140
Let's go swing on me.

781
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:24.420
And then the dude stepped forward,

782
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.460
hit them with an inside leg kick and then hold guard.

783
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.820
He pulled guard wrap is dude up an Alma Plata so quickly that too,

784
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.760
had no idea what the fuck was going on.

785
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.410
He was drunk off his ass.

786
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:37.240
He couldn't believe what was happening.

787
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.250
He had this dude's feet in his face.

788
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.090
Okay.

789
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:40.923
And then,

790
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.410
um,

791
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.080
I don't know who said it or security guard.

792
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.660
The security guard came here.

793
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:47.740
Why was all going on?

794
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:48.460
And I said,

795
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:48.851
dude,

796
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:49.511
relax.

797
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:49.931
I said,

798
00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:50.600
don't worry about.

799
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:50.891
I go,

800
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:51.730
he's going to be fine.

801
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:52.564
He's not going to hurt him.

802
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.990
He's just going to put them to sleep and then take over.

803
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.890
I guess I'm going to put them to sleep.

804
00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:58.090
There's my boss.

805
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.320
I got to put them to sleep and I'll say,

806
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.280
I got to transition.

807
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.290
So Tate,

808
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.370
while he still has the duty to normal plot,

809
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:05.650
does sinks a rear naked on him and chokes him out.

810
00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:06.611
Oh,

811
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:07.444
it was ruthless.

812
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.360
And then so he gets away and didn't hurt him at all.

813
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.310
Didn't the guy didn't get hit nothing.

814
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.990
You were so kind to him,

815
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.530
you know?

816
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.450
And then he wakes up,

817
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.090
his friends get them up and they pick them up.

818
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.230
They push them in an elevator.

819
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:21.490
He has no idea what happened.

820
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:21.731
He's like,

821
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:22.271
what happened?

822
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:22.900
What happened?

823
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.010
They all go in the elevator.

824
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.120
The elevator door shuts.

825
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.350
He disappears from life.

826
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.453
That's it.

827
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.750
Thanks us.

828
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.010
And all we could size is like,

829
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.940
that dude is probably picks on his friend.

830
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.020
He picks on everybody.

831
00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:34.120
I like that all the time.

832
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.120
She was so ruthlessly douchey and drunk,

833
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.433
but he was a giant,

834
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.190
giant mother fucker and I guess he just thought that he could just get away with

835
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:42.580
doing that.

836
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.260
But that's how the universe works.

837
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.650
If you're a big giant evil motherfucker,

838
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.130
you run into a dude like Tate is bumps in the road,

839
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:51.964
bitch.

840
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.923
It's true.

841
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.420
That happens with road rage a lot.

842
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:56.650
Like I've got this mini Cooper now.

843
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.620
Before that it was a bowling ball and dude's trip.

844
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:02.830
And then I'll wait in the parking lot or whatever,

845
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:05.970
where I'm going to go into a store and they pulled around and then I pop out and

846
00:23:05.971 --> 00:23:06.071
like,

847
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:06.251
hey,

848
00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:06.661
how are you doing?

849
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:08.050
And you having a good day and night.

850
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.290
All the windows out of there.

851
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.750
Get back in their car now.

852
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.790
Like big giant,

853
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.121
bald,

854
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:15.250
tattooed do with a fucking pirate beard.

855
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.440
A little mad.

856
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:16.721
I'm like,

857
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:19.580
you were expecting my mom or a little kid or something to get old.

858
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.500
The son of a bitch.

859
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.350
And then you're going to bully him and now it's a gorilla.

860
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:24.790
So what you need to get a shit?

861
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.040
People get real identical.

862
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.571
I should meet.

863
00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:27.460
They're driving.

864
00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:30.400
You know it's because there's a disconnect that doesn't happen when it's just

865
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:31.240
people to people.

866
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.920
When it's people to people out there in the street,

867
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:33.461
it's very rare.

868
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:35.560
You'll find a guy like that bridge bag from that hotel.

869
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.860
It's very rare when you think of all the interactions you have with people.

870
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.090
But when you rent cars,

871
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:40.421
men,

872
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:43.600
so many fingers are flying so many fuck you's so many.

873
00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:45.020
I'm looking at someone mouth thing,

874
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.811
fuck you to me.

875
00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:46.290
And I'm like,

876
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:46.950
oh great,

877
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.750
great fuck you.

878
00:23:48.751 --> 00:23:49.111
What?

879
00:23:49.111 --> 00:23:50.400
Because what is it?

880
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.580
Cause I didn't let you cut in front of me or because you're driving like a dick

881
00:23:54.581 --> 00:23:55.980
head and I'm trying to avoid you.

882
00:23:55.981 --> 00:23:58.710
Like which one is it scary?

883
00:23:58.711 --> 00:24:03.060
I love that whole idea of like I used to get mad if I'm trying to hold my place

884
00:24:03.061 --> 00:24:03.541
and then I was like,

885
00:24:03.541 --> 00:24:04.590
what are you hanging on to?

886
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.150
How about you can choose right now,

887
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.040
let him in Tate and then you're a hero.

888
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:08.821
You know what I mean?

889
00:24:08.821 --> 00:24:10.080
I can and then everybody,

890
00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:10.750
it's all good.

891
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.450
And when it doesn't happen,

892
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:12.871
the other side,

893
00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:13.380
you're like,

894
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.011
seriously,

895
00:24:14.011 --> 00:24:16.230
like you've got to block this is several feet.

896
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:16.690
Yeah.

897
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.390
Sometimes it's just not safe.

898
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.460
Like someone's trying to move and they were like trying to get you to move back

899
00:24:21.461 --> 00:24:21.691
to like,

900
00:24:21.691 --> 00:24:22.410
look,

901
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.310
what are you fucking doing?

902
00:24:23.311 --> 00:24:24.910
You driving like a dick man.

903
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.150
I'm not going to let you in if you're driving like a deck,

904
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:27.481
you know,

905
00:24:27.481 --> 00:24:28.840
just calm the fuck down.

906
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.100
Yep.

907
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.000
<v 3>All that stuff is like reptile and then million survival fight or flight stuff.</v>

908
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:33.860
Yeah.

909
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.960
<v 2>Generally like when,</v>

910
00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:36.440
when I involve the,

911
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.370
a situation like that,

912
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:38.780
I usually just lay back.

913
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.830
I just start going even like below the speed of them and like just go on just to

914
00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:43.910
get the fuck away from me.

915
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.440
Go ahead and go down your road.

916
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:45.980
Yeah.

917
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.810
But I feel like it's theirs.

918
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.600
Every now and then there's a guy behind the wheel,

919
00:24:50.601 --> 00:24:53.570
it's driving so fucking crazy.

920
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.980
Some asshole.

921
00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:55.740
The other day,

922
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.090
uh,

923
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.210
in the valley and like Encino was driving a Mercedes.

924
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.630
I've never seen anybody drive like this and like really crowded streets.

925
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:02.841
I mean,

926
00:25:02.841 --> 00:25:07.670
he was just fucking nailing it and swerve and in between cars,

927
00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:08.780
car to car to car to car.

928
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.470
I mean you had to be going a hundred miles an hour plus on a busy street.

929
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:13.490
It was really crazy.

930
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:15.290
You know,

931
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:15.740
there's,

932
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.150
there's a lot of Douche bags out there.

933
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:18.550
<v 3>So I,</v>

934
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.770
I decided I try to work on this calmness and all that.

935
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.570
And for me,

936
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:23.930
driving and road rage was the worst.

937
00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:25.400
I used to have the worst road rage ever.

938
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.060
Really?

939
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:26.893
Oh Dude,

940
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.950
I was terrible man.

941
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.813
You would not,

942
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.230
you're not recognize me.

943
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.820
I once got taken to the police station because someone accused me is,

944
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.170
this is a while back,

945
00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:38.630
but they accuse me of a exposing myself well driving.

946
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.770
Uh,

947
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.950
and what the truth of the matter is that someone cut me off and I got pissed off

948
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:43.341
and I said,

949
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:43.790
you don't want it,

950
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.060
you know,

951
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.320
Hong Kong Bobo here and uh,

952
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.530
so uncommon Bobo here,

953
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.790
you made a,

954
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.740
you made it like a blow job,

955
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.590
sort of a case against you.

956
00:25:53.591 --> 00:25:54.051
And I'm like,

957
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:54.201
yeah,

958
00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:54.711
here you go.

959
00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:55.590
Write us a new hash.

960
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.780
You exactly.

961
00:25:56.781 --> 00:25:57.614
Hong Kong,

962
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.510
you said the people while they were driving,

963
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.020
I made that I made the,

964
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:03.380
the,

965
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.930
the graphical motion to have them blow you.

966
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.471
Exactly.

967
00:26:06.471 --> 00:26:06.681
Yeah.

968
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:07.101
Like basically,

969
00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:07.341
you know,

970
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:08.410
blow me f you.

971
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:09.703
And uh,

972
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.150
so what did the same

973
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.250
exactly.

974
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.083
Anyway,

975
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.320
I was kind of like,

976
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:18.760
I forgot about it and this police officer leaves her business card on my,

977
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.230
my front porch and apparently whoever cut me off,

978
00:26:22.231 --> 00:26:26.390
it was just a complete idiot of a driver and like really apparently thought I

979
00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:27.224
did this.

980
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:27.830
So this,

981
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.540
this little police officer,

982
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:30.081
woman is like,

983
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:30.820
Hey,

984
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.220
uh,

985
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.050
I know at the beginning of a porno,

986
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.543
I swear to God,

987
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.930
like in the police station,

988
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.501
she's like,

989
00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:37.040
I know,

990
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.880
I know you did it.

991
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.170
And I started laughing.

992
00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:39.850
I looked for cameras.

993
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:40.730
So I thought it was a joke.

994
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:43.080
Like I thought some friends of mine had really seriously hooked me up on this

995
00:26:43.081 --> 00:26:45.300
because there's no way it was so far from my reality.

996
00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:46.380
And she goes,

997
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:46.561
no,

998
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:47.310
I know you did.

999
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.300
I have witnesses and I'm like,

1000
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.250
you can't have witnesses.

1001
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:50.670
It didn't happen like you're lying.

1002
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.340
And we went back and forth for two hours about this.

1003
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:54.500
This is how bad my road dredge was.

1004
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.190
Two hours she was full on,

1005
00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:56.911
I'm going to go to the DA.

1006
00:26:56.911 --> 00:26:57.121
I'm like,

1007
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:57.901
you can't go to the DA.

1008
00:26:57.901 --> 00:26:58.830
There was no evidence.

1009
00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.813
And furthermore,

1010
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:00.840
anatomically,

1011
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.530
okay,

1012
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.370
this is my lap,

1013
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.920
this is the side of the car and this where the steering wheel is.

1014
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:06.540
So unless I'm like hung like a horse,

1015
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.510
it is not possible to drive and expose yourself at the same time.

1016
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.410
I'm in the car next to you.

1017
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.071
I'm like,

1018
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:11.904
you can't do that.

1019
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.410
So finally I did this lie detector test and I passed out and do a lie detector.

1020
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.211
I volunteer to go.

1021
00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:17.431
I'm like,

1022
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:17.880
I got,

1023
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.870
there's nothing going on here.

1024
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.100
Larry was so gestapo like,

1025
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.943
can't even tell you.

1026
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.220
But that's how bad my road rage was.

1027
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:23.401
Like,

1028
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:24.021
no wait.

1029
00:27:24.021 --> 00:27:27.250
He had to go to the station to get it light or did they have a lie detector?

1030
00:27:27.251 --> 00:27:28.290
You're testing the car?

1031
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:28.650
Uh,

1032
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.340
James got one.

1033
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:29.671
Oh No,

1034
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:31.620
this is bad.

1035
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.420
This is a month after it happened.

1036
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:33.750
Like,

1037
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.530
Oh shit.

1038
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.460
It was scary actually.

1039
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:36.270
I was,

1040
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.640
I realized I was absolutely guilty,

1041
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.730
frightening rotary story ever.

1042
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:40.853
Sure

1043
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.710
<v 6>are finally horrible New Mexico,</v>

1044
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.860
a couple of buses that are really Nice restaurant at your animal there.

1045
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.150
They're driving home and they live like 20 minutes out of town in a little town

1046
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.690
and there there's some road rage thing happened in at midnight or one in the

1047
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:54.901
morning,

1048
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:55.680
trouble in New Mexico.

1049
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.461
Road rage is crazy.

1050
00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:58.770
I grew up there and uh,

1051
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.671
and so anyway,

1052
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:01.610
they get away from this car that is and,

1053
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:02.101
and they're,

1054
00:28:02.101 --> 00:28:03.030
they're like stalking them.

1055
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.260
It's like you can't go slowly,

1056
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:05.010
they're going to slow down.

1057
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.920
He can't go through faster and all that shit.

1058
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.680
Right.

1059
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.950
They pull off their exit and they go home and they're two brothers and their,

1060
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.371
I don't know,

1061
00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:16.371
20 to 25 in there and they go into their house and then a car pulls up,

1062
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.443
lights are on.

1063
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.530
Hey motherfuckers,

1064
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.430
we know you're in there and hey,

1065
00:28:20.431 --> 00:28:21.660
we know you're at something like that,

1066
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:22.410
right.

1067
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.040
And they say,

1068
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.341
Hey,

1069
00:28:23.341 --> 00:28:23.881
fuck you,

1070
00:28:23.881 --> 00:28:24.714
we got a gun.

1071
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.060
They've got a shotgun in there and don't,

1072
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.890
and get the fuck off our property please.

1073
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.791
Next thing,

1074
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:30.061
you know,

1075
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:30.331
Ding,

1076
00:28:30.331 --> 00:28:30.541
Ding,

1077
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:30.841
Ding.

1078
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:34.350
One of the brothers takes one in the head and drops the other brother goes,

1079
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.610
holy fuck,

1080
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.200
and runs out the back door.

1081
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.540
It's two state cops that have opened fire and then their hunting him.

1082
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.620
He won't come out until he,

1083
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:44.454
here's the comps,

1084
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.750
here's more cops come.

1085
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.940
And then he comes out and he goes to jail,

1086
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.080
sits for the weekend.

1087
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.690
He gets charged with resisting arrest.

1088
00:28:51.691 --> 00:28:53.220
A few things on him or whatever.

1089
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.060
The state cops that killed his brother don't even get suspended.

1090
00:28:57.061 --> 00:28:59.160
I don't think they're there.

1091
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:01.710
The brothers of the girl that was road raging them,

1092
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.000
they call up the brother.

1093
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:05.640
They're on the job and that's how New Mexico is too.

1094
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.250
It's like fucking this serious grotesque.

1095
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.520
This girl who was road rage roles,

1096
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.373
rotation,

1097
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:12.061
her brother,

1098
00:29:12.061 --> 00:29:13.790
others speaking assholes.

1099
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.030
Fucking a road rage in me.

1100
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:16.590
Come and arrest them or scare them.

1101
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.551
So the cop goes,

1102
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:17.971
oh fuck,

1103
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:18.271
whatever.

1104
00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:20.040
I'll go pull over and it escalates to that.

1105
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.013
Whoa.

1106
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.170
No repercussions.

1107
00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:23.790
The brothers traumatized forever.

1108
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:24.511
God bless him.

1109
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:25.830
I mean the whole thing.

1110
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:26.490
I'm like,

1111
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.990
and that's what can happen.

1112
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.261
You know,

1113
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:28.680
what is,

1114
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.400
what are you thinking is that causes people to do that in a way that they very,

1115
00:29:32.401 --> 00:29:35.910
very rarely do and person and the cop would probably never behaved that way

1116
00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:36.391
otherwise.

1117
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:38.940
And just all these series of events happened and Kaboom.

1118
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.250
Do you think we're not designed to interact with people being close to them?

1119
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.240
<v 3>It's not that the,</v>

1120
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.950
the mammal brain that you've got is 10 times faster than you can think about

1121
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:48.490
stuff.

1122
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:48.911
So you know,

1123
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:49.541
you should do something,

1124
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:52.120
but the reaction you get to someone cutting in front of you,

1125
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.420
it's the same thing like a laboratory throw a piece of meat in front of it.

1126
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:57.640
It eats it before it really knows what's going on.

1127
00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.710
So there's this whole set,

1128
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.140
even though it could be poisonous or whatever though.

1129
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.101
Exactly.

1130
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:03.371
So,

1131
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:05.440
so the reason we get in trouble,

1132
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.480
almost everything we do is what dogs do,

1133
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:07.930
right?

1134
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:08.140
Like,

1135
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.231
oh,

1136
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:09.340
there's a leg all hump it,

1137
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:09.881
there's a stick,

1138
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:10.541
I'll chase it.

1139
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:11.740
This distractability right?

1140
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:12.430
And then,

1141
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.650
oh,

1142
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.080
there's a cat poop and I'll eat it.

1143
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.230
Those are the three big behaviors that mess everyone up because all of them

1144
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:19.060
happened 10 times faster than you think about them.

1145
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.590
So for me,

1146
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.380
road rage was like one of the last things to go and this was still a problem.

1147
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.820
Number two,

1148
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.810
the eat and cat poop.

1149
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.840
Did you ever see your dog?

1150
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.770
They think if you're a dog,

1151
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.880
I don't know if you've ever been around dogs.

1152
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.730
I mean it doesn't matter what it is.

1153
00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:38.731
So like basically later it's like it's covered in glitter bulldog that would do

1154
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:41.050
that and I'd pull it out of his jowls and I was like,

1155
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.351
oh,

1156
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:44.410
I don't know what work or task you eating it or me pulling it off buddy.

1157
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:46.931
But that's,

1158
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:49.330
that's like the wiring in your brain that you share with all these other

1159
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:49.601
animals,

1160
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:49.900
right?

1161
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.920
Someone cuts in front of you.

1162
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:51.760
It triggers that,

1163
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:53.703
trigger it in,

1164
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.540
in that way in a car.

1165
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.680
Why is it in the car?

1166
00:30:56.681 --> 00:30:57.910
Why is it so intense?

1167
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.030
Is it the stress of driving and dealing with a bunch of people?

1168
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:02.140
We get self absorbed.

1169
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.000
I think it's an arrogance that I go,

1170
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:04.900
I'm going somewhere.

1171
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.450
And you're in my path of getting there.

1172
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.101
Something like that.

1173
00:31:08.101 --> 00:31:09.040
And we don't get more open.

1174
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:09.460
And when you,

1175
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.330
when you drive that fast,

1176
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:12.880
you have to have that part of your brain turned on because it's reaction time is

1177
00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:14.290
10 times faster than you can think about it.

1178
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.750
Imagine if every time you want to put the brake on and you had to go,

1179
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.000
I guess I'll think about whether I should put the brake on.

1180
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:21.490
I guess I'll think and maybe I'll do some math to figure out how much time I've

1181
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:21.940
got it.

1182
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.040
So you're driving using your nervous system,

1183
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:25.330
not using your conscious brain.

1184
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:27.220
So you're reacting with your nervous system there.

1185
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.910
So I finally hooked to actually putting in Reps.

1186
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:32.530
It's like when I pulled guard on that dude,

1187
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.191
all we've been,

1188
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:38.191
all we've been drilling was going into that Omoplata like I can't,

1189
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.520
if I drive him back,

1190
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:40.331
we'd go through the window,

1191
00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:41.980
I can just do it and I just went there.

1192
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.110
But it's like it's putting in the reps the same thing.

1193
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:45.490
Where did you get to a kickboxing?

1194
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:46.210
It's like,

1195
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:46.811
I need this,

1196
00:31:46.811 --> 00:31:49.270
I need this to be second nature that I'm going to protect myself.

1197
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:49.720
You know,

1198
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:49.880
and,

1199
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.010
and that's going on.

1200
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.670
Interesting.

1201
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.010
I hooked a sensor up to my ear when I was driving.

1202
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:57.280
I did this for about two weeks and every time I fight or flight response gets

1203
00:31:57.281 --> 00:31:57.790
kicked off,

1204
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.623
it turns red.

1205
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.600
So when I put it there on the dashboard and I'd drive there in Silicon Valley

1206
00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:02.920
and in bad traffic,

1207
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.240
every time someone cut me off,

1208
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.980
my nurses would be like,

1209
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.520
kill him.

1210
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.870
Like you could see it turn red.

1211
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.980
So then I'd make it turn green and after about a week I learned I could just

1212
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:12.561
keep that thing green.

1213
00:32:12.561 --> 00:32:13.600
It didn't matter what anyone did,

1214
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:16.000
but I had to train that part of myself just like you train a dog,

1215
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.200
I don't have any road rage now.

1216
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.370
I don't care what someone does in the road,

1217
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.100
I'm not gonna get mad.

1218
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.260
And like that's is having a spiritual consciousness like that where I go

1219
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.630
regardless of my external conditions,

1220
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.440
I'm,

1221
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:26.980
I'm again,

1222
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.450
I'm going to be unchanged inside.

1223
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:29.920
Like that's the goal.

1224
00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:31.420
But you have to get conscious to that.

1225
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.020
You can't,

1226
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.550
if you're not a thinking person,

1227
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.960
you're default is rage.

1228
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.060
Perhaps there's an iPhone app for that now.

1229
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.760
Like that's how insane this stuff is.

1230
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.930
That's why I love this stuff because this isn't an iPhone APP for road rage.

1231
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.310
It's an iPhone app for what I did there.

1232
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:44.600
That thing that I clicked on my ear.

1233
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.050
If all you do is you breathe in and breathe out it space as you're breathing and

1234
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:49.820
tells you when your heart rate changes,

1235
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:51.410
like an animal going into fight or flight.

1236
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.230
As soon as that change happens is second by second change,

1237
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.100
you just,

1238
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.611
Oh look,

1239
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:56.240
it happened again.

1240
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.200
I guess I'll turn that off.

1241
00:32:57.201 --> 00:32:58.040
And after a while your,

1242
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.830
your nervous system gets tired of going into fight or flight and getting no

1243
00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:01.491
satisfaction.

1244
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:02.324
So it just stops.

1245
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.740
Just like so just in recognizing it,

1246
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:04.910
it,

1247
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.340
it allows you to control it to a point where you can stop it from happening.

1248
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.081
Just two steps.

1249
00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:12.170
The first is there's a feeling when it happens that you don't know what that

1250
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:13.760
feeling is unless you're trained to sense it.

1251
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:16.160
So first you know the feeling and then you know how to turn it off and they're

1252
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:17.150
like different skills.

1253
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.540
That was a beautiful thing because I mean like a heightened accountability

1254
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:21.710
because so often we go,

1255
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.730
oh well I'm powerless over what I eat or I feel like that are just my feelings.

1256
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.670
But to really get super accountable for like,

1257
00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:29.421
this is my life,

1258
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:30.320
these are my emotional,

1259
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.520
and I can change all that.

1260
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:32.570
And knowing they happen,

1261
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.260
they happen before you can think about them and it doesn't matter what they are

1262
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:37.670
because they're not really you.

1263
00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:39.650
They're just like an automated defense system.

1264
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.150
Makes Sense about driving,

1265
00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:42.470
putting you in that heightened state.

1266
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:42.680
Yeah,

1267
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.071
totally.

1268
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:44.000
Completely make sense.

1269
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.270
Because you're going fast and you have to think quickly.

1270
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.740
A friend of mine used to say,

1271
00:33:48.741 --> 00:33:49.071
he says,

1272
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:49.281
you're,

1273
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:51.050
you're not responsible for the first thought,

1274
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.120
but you're responsible for stroking it.

1275
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:53.640
After that,

1276
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.790
it's like shit's gonna pop in your head.

1277
00:33:56.791 --> 00:33:57.470
That's a good friend.

1278
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.303
Whatever you're going to,

1279
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.971
whatever you're gonna do.

1280
00:33:58.971 --> 00:33:59.691
After that with it,

1281
00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:00.560
you can either say,

1282
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.831
okay,

1283
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:04.470
I'm going to go with this thought and coax it up into a huge problem or

1284
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.353
whatever.

1285
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.200
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1286
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.060
it's really important evaluation of your situation,

1287
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.620
especially thinking about it that way,

1288
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.470
thinking about the fact that you're,

1289
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.770
you're on a very sort of animalistic high rev state because you're driving a

1290
00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:18.220
car.

1291
00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.420
That actually really makes sense.

1292
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.630
My feeling was always that it was,

1293
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.150
there was not enough connection between people that are in cars.

1294
00:34:25.151 --> 00:34:29.230
Like you don't feel bad if you cut them off the way you would feel bad if he did

1295
00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:31.010
something to someone in the grocery store.

1296
00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:32.350
Yeah.

1297
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.530
Like if you kind of got off of the grocery store with your cart and you stuck

1298
00:34:35.531 --> 00:34:36.760
right behind them in line,

1299
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.620
you would feel fucking terrible,

1300
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.461
you know?

1301
00:34:39.461 --> 00:34:39.880
Right.

1302
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.680
But if you cut a guy off in a car,

1303
00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:42.820
it's like this slow bitch.

1304
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.920
It's just in a way it doesn't even bother you.

1305
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.373
Yeah.

1306
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.940
I just want to get past you'd stupid.

1307
00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.230
It's uh,

1308
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.521
for,

1309
00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:51.520
for whatever reason,

1310
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.261
especially for men,

1311
00:34:53.261 --> 00:34:54.760
I think it's just easier to be Dickey.

1312
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.070
I see a lot of women tweak and cars to,

1313
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.070
well everybody that they shouldn't drive.

1314
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.940
I had an ex girlfriend that was nuts in her fucking cough.

1315
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.840
She would cut dudes off.

1316
00:35:04.841 --> 00:35:06.940
They cut her off and she would do it with you in the car.

1317
00:35:06.941 --> 00:35:07.091
I mean,

1318
00:35:07.091 --> 00:35:08.680
it was like a fucking competition with her.

1319
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:09.820
And you know,

1320
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.500
she likes guys fight.

1321
00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.420
That's who that is.

1322
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.091
Oh yeah.

1323
00:35:13.091 --> 00:35:13.930
She was crazy.

1324
00:35:13.931 --> 00:35:14.650
She was crazy.

1325
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.310
She was great.

1326
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.143
But she was crazy.

1327
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.750
But uh,

1328
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:17.290
yeah,

1329
00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:17.920
I have to tell her,

1330
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.400
stop,

1331
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.360
I'm going to get out of your car.

1332
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.010
I hate it when anyone kind of die.

1333
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:21.461
I'm like,

1334
00:35:21.461 --> 00:35:22.294
you're going to get shot.

1335
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.860
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1336
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.550
<v 3>You've had some thing about being a woman too.</v>

1337
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:26.930
You don't know who's going to follow you home gifts,

1338
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.290
gifts,

1339
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.110
give the wrong guy the finger and watch life,

1340
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:30.944
get terrified

1341
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.460
<v 2>the hat.</v>

1342
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.760
But when you're a super aggressively douchey driving that way,

1343
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.790
like you could pick the wrong guy and you don't want that person in your life

1344
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.510
ever.

1345
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.230
And all of a sudden now they're in your life in a very even and very intense

1346
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:43.780
way.

1347
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.000
Now you've invited the men.

1348
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.110
That's a stupid idea.

1349
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:46.621
It's dumb.

1350
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:48.180
And that's comes from,

1351
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.320
I think a lot of women.

1352
00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:49.520
It's,

1353
00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.290
it's very rare for them to experience firsthand violence.

1354
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:52.770
Yeah,

1355
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:53.190
no,

1356
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.570
I mean I think you got,

1357
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.330
uh,

1358
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.620
the possibility of sexual stuff and you know,

1359
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.830
things along those lines like from men.

1360
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:07.230
But I think like men probably see a lot more physical violence like young men.

1361
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.123
Not Anymore.

1362
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:08.970
You don't think so?

1363
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:09.380
I don't that,

1364
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.770
do they have cops in schools now?

1365
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:11.221
When I was a kid,

1366
00:36:11.221 --> 00:36:14.320
I kind of like 75 fist fights because you're still getting in fight.

1367
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.490
So it seems like you're still dicky each other.

1368
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:18.900
It's important though to,

1369
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:20.070
I think it was part of growing.

1370
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:22.500
I remember the first time I got socked in the mouth and I was like,

1371
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.161
Oh shit,

1372
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:24.120
that's very real.

1373
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.081
You know what I mean?

1374
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:25.481
And I was like,

1375
00:36:25.481 --> 00:36:26.340
and I needed that,

1376
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.800
pat me in the face like that.

1377
00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:29.210
And,

1378
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.520
and I,

1379
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.220
and you can just see the dudes too that are in their 20s and you're like,

1380
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:33.990
that guy never got punched in the face.

1381
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:34.430
I bet.

1382
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.740
Yeah,

1383
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.690
and that's the problem he's having today,

1384
00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:37.321
currently,

1385
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:38.460
right now in front of me.

1386
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.383
Absolutely.

1387
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.320
That's all a lot of,

1388
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.740
well,

1389
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.670
a lot of guys too.

1390
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:42.890
It's like you're,

1391
00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:47.891
you're whole stupid body's designed for chaos and the chaos and never shows up.

1392
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.490
It's like you're just work all day.

1393
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.450
Where's this chaos?

1394
00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:52.650
I'm designed for this,

1395
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:54.870
this mad world that I like.

1396
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:55.780
You know,

1397
00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.310
if you're,

1398
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.970
uh,

1399
00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.040
if you're fucking a healthy male,

1400
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.720
life can be challenging.

1401
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.530
You know,

1402
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.100
if you're a healthy testosterone film mail and you don't have a release,

1403
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.220
if you don't have something that lets you burn off energy,

1404
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.121
well guess what?

1405
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:09.270
This,

1406
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.740
the world doesn't need you like that.

1407
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.011
You know,

1408
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:11.400
you're,

1409
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.050
you're stuck in a situation where you're,

1410
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:16.440
you're bouncing around in a world that doesn't need cavemen anymore.

1411
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.011
What to do,

1412
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:17.844
what to do.

1413
00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.690
They're also used to be like a rite of passage,

1414
00:37:19.691 --> 00:37:21.570
like the ceremonies to tell you like you're in a dollar.

1415
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:24.420
You've got accurate once you're 18 you can vote.

1416
00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:24.901
You can't drink.

1417
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:25.510
Sorry,

1418
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.520
but there's nothing else.

1419
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.600
I think that's big.

1420
00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:28.860
We've talked about that before.

1421
00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:31.350
I think there needs to be a rite of passage for men,

1422
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:31.951
you know,

1423
00:37:31.951 --> 00:37:33.210
and it should be something that you,

1424
00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.413
I mean it,

1425
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.590
whether it's a physical accomplishment or a mental accomplishment,

1426
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.210
it's almost like graduating,

1427
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.780
like graduating from high school.

1428
00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.940
If you graduated from high school,

1429
00:37:41.941 --> 00:37:42.241
I know.

1430
00:37:42.241 --> 00:37:43.980
Well at least the guy graduated from high school.

1431
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:45.030
She graduated from college.

1432
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:45.530
Like wow.

1433
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:46.650
Having graduated from college,

1434
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:47.641
they should be.

1435
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:48.990
I graduated from med school.

1436
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.280
I went to band school.

1437
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.570
I is a two week course.

1438
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:52.770
Everybody designed to take it.

1439
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.330
Let's see if you call that like boy scouts,

1440
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:55.320
but who goes into this house?

1441
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.223
Looks fast.

1442
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.830
I did like the boy scouts.

1443
00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.673
Brian.

1444
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I in the boy scout scout too.

1445
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.030
But how many you eagles?

1446
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.550
That's the most important one.

1447
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.980
I quit like the month after I became one os patch.

1448
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:09.510
Yeah,

1449
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.171
it's a big deal.

1450
00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:11.070
Become an eagle scout.

1451
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:11.851
I remember.

1452
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:12.810
I'd see guys that did it.

1453
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.673
Yeah.

1454
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.191
Yeah.

1455
00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:16.170
I did one year in the boy scouts.

1456
00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.260
The Boy Scouts in Jamaica Plain.

1457
00:38:19.261 --> 00:38:21.960
It was a fucking sketchy area outside of Boston.

1458
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.050
And I went to the woods of New Hampshire with fucking criminals.

1459
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:25.711
That's what it was.

1460
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:29.190
It was me and a bunch of kids who want to fucking criminals.

1461
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.740
And they were ganking kids the middle of the night,

1462
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:32.910
they were tying them to their bed,

1463
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:34.080
covering them with toothpaste.

1464
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.860
It was some shit like you had to be on point at any moment.

1465
00:38:36.861 --> 00:38:39.920
You might have to be wrapped with some kids you don't even know well from an

1466
00:38:39.921 --> 00:38:40.860
even worse neighborhoods.

1467
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:41.660
Yeah.

1468
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.110
<v 3>I barely remembered mine.</v>

1469
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.560
Like it was a church based boy scouts too.

1470
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.251
Most of it.

1471
00:38:46.251 --> 00:38:50.060
And so I don't know if I was just molested while being a boy scout.

1472
00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.020
And that's why I don't remember.

1473
00:38:51.021 --> 00:38:53.580
Cause I should remember more from being a boy scout.

1474
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:58.010
<v 2>Could you imagine one day you will like masturbating or something and then you</v>

1475
00:38:58.011 --> 00:39:00.610
had this flash in front of your face of,

1476
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.090
of uh,

1477
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.040
a priest cock right before your mouth and you went,

1478
00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:04.874
I knew it.

1479
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.950
I knew there was something I was missing.

1480
00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:07.460
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1481
00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.180
Or that's why I've never been to like a football game or a baseball game with,

1482
00:39:11.181 --> 00:39:11.660
you know,

1483
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.520
my uncle because maybe every time I see

1484
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.850
<v 2>flashes of a whole locker room full of football players throwing a pounding to</v>

1485
00:39:17.851 --> 00:39:18.150
you,

1486
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.060
it's a dark mystery.

1487
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.811
Slashes.

1488
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:20.630
No denying it.

1489
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:21.790
Flash flash

1490
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.300
<v 3>pens over there.</v>

1491
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:27.970
I had a friend on ecstasy at 25 tripping right in the middle of like a first

1492
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:28.810
time I used the,

1493
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.560
uh,

1494
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.460
it all came back to him.

1495
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.270
Absolutely remembered he'd been abused for like eight years.

1496
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.000
Knocked out that that shouldn't happen.

1497
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:37.660
It does.

1498
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.430
It's real.

1499
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.780
Yeah.

1500
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.330
Those repressed memories is scary stuff,

1501
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:40.510
Matt.

1502
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.160
Yeah.

1503
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.400
So every time Brian takes me,

1504
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.330
it's just like therapy.

1505
00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:45.110
He's just trying to get to the root of thing.

1506
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.610
<v 2>Boils down to the same thing.</v>

1507
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.391
It's Shitty.

1508
00:39:48.391 --> 00:39:50.100
Humans create shitty humans.

1509
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.210
You know,

1510
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.410
so many shitty humans have created more shitty humans because of the shittiness

1511
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:56.960
<v 6>thing too is like you got it.</v>

1512
00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:59.680
Like when you're talking about there's no right of passage or there's no man's

1513
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:02.480
school or it's like I sometimes,

1514
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.440
like a little while ago I did a self defense thing down on the bluffs for people

1515
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.670
and always is shocking to me of like here's a bunch of grown people that don't

1516
00:40:10.671 --> 00:40:13.460
know the first thing about how to take care of themselves in a physical.

1517
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.010
It should be a responsibility.

1518
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.400
It should be responsibility to know like that's why I'm so like a fan of Dave's

1519
00:40:19.401 --> 00:40:21.530
or rob wolf or mark Sisson and all those guys.

1520
00:40:21.531 --> 00:40:25.160
It's like it's a responsibility to know how to take care of your body and to

1521
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:25.994
know how to,

1522
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.940
to know how this thing operates and all that and what it's capable of.

1523
00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.320
And also I think as a man,

1524
00:40:30.321 --> 00:40:33.410
it's your responsibility to take care of weaker people or women or whatever like

1525
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:33.880
you.

1526
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.880
You should know those,

1527
00:40:34.881 --> 00:40:35.870
you should know those things.

1528
00:40:35.871 --> 00:40:36.591
You should know math,

1529
00:40:36.591 --> 00:40:37.430
you should know how to read.

1530
00:40:37.431 --> 00:40:38.400
You should know how to draw a pic.

1531
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:39.620
You should try all that shit.

1532
00:40:39.621 --> 00:40:43.520
You should have a true liberal education and there's not a set up for that.

1533
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.931
Maybe know how to say,

1534
00:40:44.931 --> 00:40:46.280
if you can't meet a button on yourself,

1535
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.660
please stop embarrassing yourself.

1536
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:48.763
Get it together.

1537
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.990
<v 2>This isn't like a,</v>

1538
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.450
there's a weird intellectual thing where people like to pretend they don't care

1539
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:54.284
about their body.

1540
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.353
Like they're above it.

1541
00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:56.920
Yeah.

1542
00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.030
So it's actually going to fuck you.

1543
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:03.620
Well,

1544
00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:03.831
yeah.

1545
00:41:03.831 --> 00:41:04.290
This is,

1546
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:04.761
there's a thing,

1547
00:41:04.761 --> 00:41:06.410
a manly thing about being a fat fuck.

1548
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.270
You don't give a shit and you just let your,

1549
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:10.750
your gut grow at all.

1550
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.630
Like a boss.

1551
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.190
Yeah.

1552
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.950
That would be like,

1553
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.341
you know,

1554
00:41:13.341 --> 00:41:13.951
a picture of you,

1555
00:41:13.951 --> 00:41:14.061
what?

1556
00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:15.200
Your gut hanging over your belt.

1557
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:16.910
Like a boss,

1558
00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.800
like a boss.

1559
00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.930
But the people who listened to your show,

1560
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.110
I don't get the impression there's a lot of that going on.

1561
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.740
Like some people that do,

1562
00:41:24.741 --> 00:41:25.461
I'm sure you know,

1563
00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:25.730
it just,

1564
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.820
it takes all kinds of people in all kinds of different,

1565
00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:29.001
you know,

1566
00:41:29.001 --> 00:41:33.260
some people absorb some things and some people did some parts about their life,

1567
00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:34.220
they just don't want to change

1568
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.950
<v 5>or they haven't mustered up the urge to change it yet.</v>

1569
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.821
You know,

1570
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:41.280
but there's also a lot of people that listen to this podcast where I have the

1571
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:41.551
mountain.

1572
00:41:41.551 --> 00:41:41.930
They were like,

1573
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.020
I lost a hundred pounds since I started listening to the podcast stuff.

1574
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:45.530
All that.

1575
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.610
That's fucking crazy.

1576
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:47.970
That's insane.

1577
00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:49.060
Crazy.

1578
00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:49.340
When,

1579
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.960
I mean you talk about bulletproof coffee,

1580
00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.240
put that out there and I don't know if you ever have yet,

1581
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:56.630
but like to put out a thing about like what are your results?

1582
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.700
The results are fucking astonishing.

1583
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.660
Hundreds,

1584
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.930
the breadth of them is incredible and those are just people that we'll talk

1585
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:04.520
about it and a lot of it's like up here,

1586
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:09.521
like I'm getting a mental focus and the energy and and brand quality natural

1587
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:12.860
speed dude is

1588
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.950
talking about like it's so much,

1589
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.831
it's awesome.

1590
00:42:18.831 --> 00:42:19.430
But B,

1591
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.930
people that get off of Paxil,

1592
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:21.561
Zoloft,

1593
00:42:21.561 --> 00:42:22.670
shit like that that are like,

1594
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:23.511
I just feel more,

1595
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:26.930
even all the time now that I eat a high high level of fats all the time in my

1596
00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:28.040
system or whatever.

1597
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.120
It's like that's when people don't think that that's the heaviest drug that

1598
00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:32.980
you're taking most.

1599
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.390
I mean a couple people here excluded perhaps,

1600
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.590
but like food is maybe the number one ha,

1601
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.560
heaviest drug that anybody takes in the world and we do it all the time without

1602
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:43.394
thinking about it.

1603
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.970
And I would just have you consider that if you think about it just a little bit,

1604
00:42:46.971 --> 00:42:49.520
you can have a drastically different experience with life.

1605
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.590
There's so many people that have a nutrient deficient life and it's really

1606
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:56.870
terrible or sugar independent or whatever.

1607
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.190
Your moods are up and down.

1608
00:42:58.191 --> 00:43:00.980
When I went to just all fats basically like,

1609
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.760
dude,

1610
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.421
I'm even,

1611
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:02.751
I'm like,

1612
00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:03.410
wow,

1613
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.430
like all day long,

1614
00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:07.520
I feel great even and I don't have these horrific mood swings,

1615
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:07.880
you know,

1616
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.990
and bagels lost their power,

1617
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:09.350
didn't they?

1618
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:09.861
Oh God.

1619
00:43:09.861 --> 00:43:10.630
There's none of that.

1620
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.250
Just are out of your fucking mind.

1621
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.860
I will never lose the love for Bagels,

1622
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.870
some lox and cream cheese.

1623
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:18.351
Talk to me.

1624
00:43:18.351 --> 00:43:23.351
Brian and I did have some [inaudible] I need to Goddamn cheat day.

1625
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.000
No croissants with chocolate will fuck a big dude over on third street.

1626
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:30.050
There's a great spot.

1627
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.970
The Real French folks.

1628
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.680
Not that they're useful for much else,

1629
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:34.970
but making croissants.

1630
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.200
They're good.

1631
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:36.981
Do you rocket cheat,

1632
00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:37.281
Dang.

1633
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.114
Do eat healthy.

1634
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.690
That was the first time that I had wheat and two years was I wouldn't have those

1635
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:43.460
croissants and yeah,

1636
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:44.360
I just don't fuck with it.

1637
00:43:44.361 --> 00:43:45.050
I don't know if I,

1638
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.380
if it's not going to make me feel better or perform better,

1639
00:43:48.381 --> 00:43:49.700
I got zero use for it.

1640
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.630
It's a funny one Max.

1641
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.480
People think you fucking crazy for saying that.

1642
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:54.320
Weed's bad for you.

1643
00:43:54.321 --> 00:43:54.860
Horrible.

1644
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.530
Especially when you start looking at it like the advent of Gliadin or things

1645
00:43:57.531 --> 00:43:58.880
like that that are in wheat now.

1646
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.430
Like it's fucking crazy.

1647
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.440
My chiropractor or a friend actually who's a chiropractor told me that one of

1648
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:09.300
the reasons why people get an inflammation as far as like disks,

1649
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.310
things like that.

1650
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:10.641
She's like,

1651
00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:13.200
we've been able to help people launch just by cutting wheat out of their diet.

1652
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:14.660
Like that's insane.

1653
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:19.940
More known cause they trade it on the fucking stock exchange because there's big

1654
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:22.911
money in it.

1655
00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:25.700
I mean there's a reason why the FDA or whatever.

1656
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:26.190
It's like,

1657
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.340
well,

1658
00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.250
it's also nine to 12 servings a day.

1659
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.420
It's so yummy.

1660
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.991
Okay.

1661
00:44:29.991 --> 00:44:31.130
It's not just as bad.

1662
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.250
I love

1663
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.580
<v 3>Spaghetti and you can go first.</v>

1664
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:35.860
<v 5>I will love Spaghetti</v>

1665
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.330
squash with some meat sauce over the top.

1666
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:40.960
Ended off,

1667
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.440
fuck.

1668
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.150
I'm tired ass shit.

1669
00:44:43.151 --> 00:44:45.020
He start this banana sense,

1670
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.730
absolute talking

1671
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.030
nonsense out of your fucking mind.

1672
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.880
Wheelhouse slams a little linguine with clams or light sauce.

1673
00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.310
Fucking sense squash.

1674
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.130
I like a light sauce with linguine and clams.

1675
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.143
A little,

1676
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.790
a little bread with some butter on the side.

1677
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:08.563
Whites.

1678
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.160
No

1679
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:09.511
<v 3>tape.</v>

1680
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:10.540
My queef proof.

1681
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.380
You were telling me that there's a a way to upgrade my Kale shake.

1682
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:18.271
What does it Bruce,

1683
00:45:18.271 --> 00:45:19.450
that was to kill shake upgrades.

1684
00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.000
I wrote a post for you guys.

1685
00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.840
Here's the thing about rock Kale and it's full of oxalic acid,

1686
00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.760
which is what makes kidney stones.

1687
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:28.690
Oh,

1688
00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.100
and maybe on you bitch.

1689
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:30.993
I don't want those.

1690
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:31.840
I've only got,

1691
00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.210
I've only got one kid so I know about this stuff.

1692
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:34.901
Wow.

1693
00:45:34.901 --> 00:45:35.261
So,

1694
00:45:35.261 --> 00:45:35.700
um,

1695
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.760
gave me other shakes.

1696
00:45:36.761 --> 00:45:38.490
Can give you a kidney stones as well.

1697
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.340
Take my notebook.

1698
00:45:39.341 --> 00:45:39.730
Oh,

1699
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:40.840
I'm going to tell you how to fix it.

1700
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:41.560
Okay.

1701
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.990
So I did a bunch of research cause I was a raw Vegan,

1702
00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.250
like I've had more than my fair share of Kale waiting.

1703
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:47.501
Will you?

1704
00:45:47.501 --> 00:45:48.430
A road raging,

1705
00:45:48.431 --> 00:45:49.150
raw vegan.

1706
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:52.310
I was a road raging ravigo absolutely events.

1707
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.680
I've tried everything I can find Julie on the side.

1708
00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.431
It's an odd one.

1709
00:45:57.431 --> 00:45:58.000
And the tape,

1710
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:58.960
oxalic acid,

1711
00:45:58.961 --> 00:46:02.140
that's oh x a l I c I take somebody taking notes.

1712
00:46:02.141 --> 00:46:04.270
I just put a post up with the recipe for this,

1713
00:46:04.271 --> 00:46:05.840
but I'll walk you through why it works.

1714
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.010
So oxalic acid also is tied to Vulvodynia,

1715
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.450
which is painful sax.

1716
00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:10.660
It's,

1717
00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.450
it's basically extreme sensitivity of the vagina in women.

1718
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:14.781
And what happened?

1719
00:46:14.781 --> 00:46:15.614
No concern to me.

1720
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:18.123
Trust me.

1721
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.200
You are married to someone with it.

1722
00:46:20.201 --> 00:46:20.860
It would be,

1723
00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:21.041
oh,

1724
00:46:21.041 --> 00:46:21.874
you're so sweet.

1725
00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.173
Uh,

1726
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:23.951
it's more,

1727
00:46:23.951 --> 00:46:25.520
but sex is this,

1728
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.530
what if you call your effects also if you're juicing it or only if you're

1729
00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:29.791
blogging,

1730
00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:30.510
if you're juicing it,

1731
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:31.480
it doesn't matter either way.

1732
00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:35.290
So it turns out that this is the way that the plant protects itself.

1733
00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.060
So for B,

1734
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:37.690
Yeah.

1735
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.310
So basically if you're a Kale,

1736
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:42.650
you don't want to get eaten by snails and bugs and you're nice soft green plant,

1737
00:46:42.651 --> 00:46:43.750
so you put this stuff in you.

1738
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.100
It's the same thing that like aspergillus and Candida that mold to give you

1739
00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:47.741
yeast infections.

1740
00:46:47.741 --> 00:46:51.100
Those things also make oxalic acid is one of their ways of protecting their

1741
00:46:51.101 --> 00:46:51.580
turf.

1742
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.180
So we had something like that and it to where it attacks your bowels as you're

1743
00:46:55.181 --> 00:46:55.941
digesting it.

1744
00:46:55.941 --> 00:46:56.050
It,

1745
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.130
it's a different chemical and wheat,

1746
00:46:57.131 --> 00:47:00.790
but it's the same idea like most starch sources and a lot of like soft green

1747
00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:03.580
vegetables have a defense mechanism and a salary.

1748
00:47:03.581 --> 00:47:04.414
It's nitrite,

1749
00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.860
but here it's oxalic acid.

1750
00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.670
So in Vulvodynia what they believe,

1751
00:47:09.671 --> 00:47:11.200
and this is a sort of a mystery illness,

1752
00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:12.850
but what they believe,

1753
00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.120
at least in one group of researchers is that this stuff,

1754
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.380
the acid form of oxalic acid gets into the body and it goes into tissues

1755
00:47:20.381 --> 00:47:23.380
including muscles and your GI system and things like that.

1756
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.010
It complexes with calcium and then it forms a little crystals kind of like gout

1757
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:27.790
does,

1758
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.110
and then this is a trigger.

1759
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.990
There's also a group of people looking into oxalic acid is one of the

1760
00:47:31.991 --> 00:47:33.130
contributors to autism.

1761
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.000
Whoa.

1762
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.660
So I'm not saying you can't eat kale when I'm smell shakes could turn you

1763
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:38.840
autistics is that what you just said?

1764
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:39.990
That's not what I can,

1765
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.530
can you just sing to the cow first and like relax it and the throat in your

1766
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:46.600
mouth real fast before it finds out it's getting eaten.

1767
00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:47.010
Uh,

1768
00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:47.250
you,

1769
00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:48.083
you could try that.

1770
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.733
So here's what you do.

1771
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:49.941
Yeah,

1772
00:47:49.941 --> 00:47:50.590
that's what you do.

1773
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:51.680
Poison Bryan.

1774
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.613
Talk Nice to

1775
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:54.611
you.

1776
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:56.710
Picked Dinosaur Kale instead of curly,

1777
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:57.544
frizzy cow.

1778
00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.440
Because Dinosaur Dinosaur Kale,

1779
00:47:59.441 --> 00:47:59.801
it's called,

1780
00:47:59.801 --> 00:48:00.700
it has like bigger,

1781
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:03.880
broader leaves that are less ridged and it was kind of like you'd imagine

1782
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:04.481
dinosaurs can,

1783
00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.160
would look instead of like the real frilly stuff.

1784
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.210
Where do you find that shit?

1785
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:08.180
You find it at whole foods.

1786
00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:10.570
There's different varieties that frilly shit.

1787
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.513
Yeah.

1788
00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:11.710
No,

1789
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:12.543
Lacey Kale.

1790
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.630
That's why we have an aversion to lace the coolest clothes,

1791
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:17.880
but put laces all of them.

1792
00:48:17.881 --> 00:48:18.101
I'm like,

1793
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:18.311
bitch,

1794
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:21.940
what are you doing day Romaro and then you'll wear that.

1795
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:26.560
You take girl wears the same shorts and you put lace on them and you're like,

1796
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:26.741
oh,

1797
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:27.820
look at this dirty bitch.

1798
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:31.120
I see a little lace at the bottom of the shorts.

1799
00:48:31.121 --> 00:48:31.631
You could the,

1800
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:33.760
the lease could actually make the shorts a little longer,

1801
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.761
but you see the lady,

1802
00:48:34.761 --> 00:48:35.050
she's like,

1803
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:35.411
oh,

1804
00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:37.660
look at this little dirty bitch walking around with Lacey.

1805
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.330
We get the vegans that they've actually put Kale on their shorts and they get

1806
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:41.170
all excited about that.

1807
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.230
Do they do this weird cats does that in the carry your pants?

1808
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:45.370
He just happened to see me.

1809
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:46.270
All right,

1810
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.410
so you picked the right kind of Kale.

1811
00:48:47.411 --> 00:48:49.330
It's going to cut your oxalic acid by about half.

1812
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.010
Then you steam it,

1813
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.270
cook it a little bit.

1814
00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:53.650
Listen,

1815
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:54.461
you've cooked it a little bit,

1816
00:48:54.461 --> 00:48:54.670
you know,

1817
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:55.503
dumped the water,

1818
00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.230
dump the water because the water is what absorbs the oxalic acid.

1819
00:48:59.231 --> 00:49:00.900
So you get rid of two thirds of the oxalic acid.

1820
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.270
That way you keep the vitamin K and you increase the bioavailability of the

1821
00:49:04.271 --> 00:49:05.104
other stuff in there.

1822
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.250
When you boil it,

1823
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:06.671
it doesn't,

1824
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:09.290
when the water comes off of that doesn't take vitamins out of it.

1825
00:49:09.291 --> 00:49:10.300
It doesn't take many vitamins.

1826
00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:12.230
It takes more oxalic acid than it does by.

1827
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:13.840
Be careful of how long you boil it.

1828
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:14.150
You want,

1829
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.260
yeah,

1830
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.880
you just want to boil it for like five,

1831
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.280
seven minutes studies.

1832
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:18.071
Like how did they,

1833
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:18.221
uh,

1834
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.031
they test this.

1835
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:19.864
There's two of them.

1836
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.190
There's two of them up there.

1837
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.130
Basically oxalic acid awareness foundations and guys like that.

1838
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:25.090
I don't have the exact name.

1839
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.410
I reference it on my blog bite.

1840
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.520
I linked to the original studies.

1841
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:27.911
So,

1842
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:28.870
so what you do is you boil it,

1843
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.250
toss it in the blender,

1844
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:31.210
Kale,

1845
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.043
check this out though.

1846
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:33.460
You can still have Kale.

1847
00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:34.300
Kale is good for you.

1848
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.343
So you take,

1849
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:36.750
it's become a process.

1850
00:49:36.751 --> 00:49:37.660
You gotta steam it.

1851
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.770
It's like five minutes.

1852
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.090
It's just this much water.

1853
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:40.781
Throw the candle.

1854
00:49:40.781 --> 00:49:42.190
If I only have a Kale shake once a week,

1855
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.730
how much you know much what to do if you're like in the month,

1856
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:47.920
it is cumulative so you have an oxalic acid burden in your body.

1857
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:49.060
If you have like you know,

1858
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.380
Dandruff and yeast problems,

1859
00:49:50.381 --> 00:49:51.400
that's going to raise your burden.

1860
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.440
If you do other high oxalic foods,

1861
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:54.161
that's going to be a burden.

1862
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:54.761
So most people,

1863
00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:55.870
you're going to be fine if you do it once a week,

1864
00:49:55.871 --> 00:49:56.704
it doesn't matter.

1865
00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:57.640
But here's the trick.

1866
00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.870
If you're going to do it regularly,

1867
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.990
boil it and do calcium loading,

1868
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:06.670
which is a term that I just finally made up because there's two studies.

1869
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:07.810
One,

1870
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:10.270
they actually give calcium tablets to people when they eat Kale,

1871
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:14.950
and 97% less oxalic acid goes into the system because it forms calcium oxalate

1872
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:16.180
in the gut and you poop it out.

1873
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:17.590
Instead of getting it in your kidneys,

1874
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:19.330
are you getting it somewhere else in your body?

1875
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:24.250
Or there's another study that says mineral water full of minerals.

1876
00:50:24.251 --> 00:50:25.084
If you do that,

1877
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.380
it also reduces it.

1878
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:28.280
So what I'm is we in the blender,

1879
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.180
steam the stuff,

1880
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.170
add butter,

1881
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.000
add MCT oil to it,

1882
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.860
add your hemp force protein,

1883
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:34.730
any kind of protein you want.

1884
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:35.780
You can still do the same thing.

1885
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:37.640
Now it's a hot drink instead of a cold drink.

1886
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.020
It's actually really good that way.

1887
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:39.160
I,

1888
00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.830
I do it quite a lot even for lunch and then add a little bit of calcium to it.

1889
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.300
You do that when you blend it,

1890
00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:47.150
the calcium is going to stick to the oxalic acid and when you're not gonna

1891
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:47.984
absorb any of it,

1892
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.220
so what are you going to get?

1893
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:50.540
You get less muscle weakness,

1894
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:54.410
which can happen if you get these crystals forming in your muscles and you're

1895
00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:57.080
going to get less risk of kidney stones and that kidney stones stuff.

1896
00:50:57.081 --> 00:50:58.490
There's solid research on that,

1897
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:00.200
so you've got to put calcium in there.

1898
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:01.040
Even if it's raw.

1899
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.360
Blew my mind to all the people out there that have been eating Kale shakes every

1900
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.193
day because of me.

1901
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.050
No,

1902
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.780
I'm not saying kills bad kills really good for it.

1903
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:09.614
You're totally right people.

1904
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.020
Do you think you're going to have an issue with this is a small percentage?

1905
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:12.351
No,

1906
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:13.400
I think it's a big percentage,

1907
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.880
but you don't know like Vulvodynia is considered a mystery condition.

1908
00:51:16.881 --> 00:51:17.660
Maybe it's emotional.

1909
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.210
Maybe you should never eat raw kale.

1910
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:22.870
Then when Ross finish is just as bad rust,

1911
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:24.471
calcium,

1912
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:25.350
you should be substance.

1913
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:26.750
You should have that in your diet anyway.

1914
00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:28.300
Even if you take Zma and all that,

1915
00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:29.270
you need to take calcium.

1916
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.210
I don't suggest supplemental calcium for anyone unless you're doing something

1917
00:51:32.211 --> 00:51:32.811
like Kale shakes.

1918
00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:33.800
Most people need magnesium.

1919
00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:35.090
There are way too high in calcium.

1920
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:36.170
If they eat almost everything.

1921
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.640
I take Zma all the time,

1922
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:38.773
but good,

1923
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.711
I wouldn't do calcium.

1924
00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:42.860
Then your body needs a two to one ratio of calcium to magnesium.

1925
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:44.540
So just take magnesium.

1926
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:45.261
You've got enough calcium,

1927
00:51:45.261 --> 00:51:48.210
there's not a problem unless you're pregnant or you're dealing with like,

1928
00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:48.650
you know,

1929
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.450
osteoporosis and even osteoporosis.

1930
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:50.871
You need k,

1931
00:51:50.871 --> 00:51:51.770
two vitamin D,

1932
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.693
stuff like that.

1933
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:53.751
Much more than you need.

1934
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:54.740
Just extra calcium.

1935
00:51:54.741 --> 00:51:56.600
The calcium doesn't stop osteoporosis by itself.

1936
00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:56.900
Okay,

1937
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.890
so for the record,

1938
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.340
if you want to drink kale six you should drink it with calcium,

1939
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:02.480
with calcium and magnesium.

1940
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.200
Actually take a bullet for five minutes or five minutes,

1941
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:07.034
steam it,

1942
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.451
steam or boil.

1943
00:52:08.451 --> 00:52:09.530
It seems better I think,

1944
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.840
and then just drain off that water that's done,

1945
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:12.650
that's there.

1946
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:16.010
Toss it in the blender and there's the hostile water and the throw the throw the

1947
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:16.311
water out,

1948
00:52:16.311 --> 00:52:17.290
but towards the calendar,

1949
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:20.780
I'm telling you when you do it with butter and MCT oil and you just blend it,

1950
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:23.240
it's like the hot creamiest soup.

1951
00:52:23.241 --> 00:52:26.390
Like I love it and I put like upgraded Collagen in it.

1952
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.740
I'd put the MCT in there.

1953
00:52:27.741 --> 00:52:28.431
So you're still getting,

1954
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:30.920
the fats are getting whatever protein you want you can do with him for us,

1955
00:52:30.921 --> 00:52:32.180
which is really delicious.

1956
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:33.740
And all of a sudden then you're like,

1957
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.431
wow,

1958
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:37.940
I feel great and it takes no more time than making a cold smoothie with ice and

1959
00:52:37.941 --> 00:52:41.630
all that other crap and you're protecting yourself a lot from this oxalic acid

1960
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:42.770
that's going to build up over time.

1961
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:43.623
Wow.

1962
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.960
That's a mindblower dude.

1963
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.430
Why am I not hearing about this?

1964
00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:47.900
How come you're the guy out there?

1965
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.701
I'm a bio hacker.

1966
00:52:48.701 --> 00:52:50.100
That's I think about this though.

1967
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.990
But shouldn't that be,

1968
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:53.420
I mean you think about how much people eat Kale these days.

1969
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:53.841
It's so it's,

1970
00:52:53.841 --> 00:52:56.180
I think it was like a super food and they've been saying a lot,

1971
00:52:56.181 --> 00:52:56.370
Jay.

1972
00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.640
I've been saying you shouldn't eat raw kale.

1973
00:52:58.641 --> 00:53:00.230
I've been saying that for like the last couple of months.

1974
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:02.670
I heard the same thing where the raw kale,

1975
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:03.050
yeah,

1976
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.310
you need to cook it first.

1977
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.930
They were looking at something I route it was,

1978
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.770
there was another issue.

1979
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:10.161
There was a,

1980
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:10.851
it was a different,

1981
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:11.690
also bacteria.

1982
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:15.260
It's just not healthy is there's bacteria also that grows on raw kale.

1983
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:15.670
Oh,

1984
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:16.503
it was wonderful.

1985
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:17.940
It was raw vegetables.

1986
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.550
I mean I just trying to figure out what the other thing was,

1987
00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:24.290
but it was a fungus that we were talking about.

1988
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:24.561
Yeah,

1989
00:53:24.561 --> 00:53:25.620
that's a issue.

1990
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:26.990
You get gut fungus going on it.

1991
00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.950
That stuff will ruin you and we don't even measure it.

1992
00:53:28.951 --> 00:53:29.640
We just figured out,

1993
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:29.731
oh,

1994
00:53:29.731 --> 00:53:32.070
there's a whole bunch of fungus with all those probiotics in the gut.

1995
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.040
And so when you're just stuff,

1996
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.830
how should you boil everything that you're doing a little bit or what you should

1997
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:39.060
boil everything that you do.

1998
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:40.740
I'm not opposed to ignite salad.

1999
00:53:40.741 --> 00:53:41.670
Add some salad today.

2000
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:42.180
So,

2001
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.070
but raw vegetables for their own sake.

2002
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.420
You've got to look at what that vegetable is.

2003
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.800
A lot of stuff like a mock of root in Makkah.

2004
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.740
It's really good for you.

2005
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:51.060
But he got my coffee all the time.

2006
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:52.320
You want to cook Maka route.

2007
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:54.200
I actually it was about to launch Maca root.

2008
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.660
Uh,

2009
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.260
but the,

2010
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.850
the source I had was super high end.

2011
00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.710
It was raw hand crafted,

2012
00:53:58.711 --> 00:53:59.544
all that stuff.

2013
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:04.320
And then I did the research and it turns out Raw Makkah is not safe to consume

2014
00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:06.120
and traditional people always gelatin has it.

2015
00:54:06.121 --> 00:54:07.260
They cooked the heck out of it.

2016
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:10.770
Yeah they cook it until it makes like a sticky gelatin cause the raw stuff has

2017
00:54:10.771 --> 00:54:12.240
all these like anti nutrients in it.

2018
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:13.620
So what's the powder that I'm drinking?

2019
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.600
I don't know if it makes sure it's processed.

2020
00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:17.880
Maka this Gel Tonies not the raw stuff.

2021
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.571
Cause I also,

2022
00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:21.510
I sent mine through my lab because I test everything for mycotoxins.

2023
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:24.110
13 parts per million of aflatoxins.

2024
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.983
Got A lab.

2025
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:26.201
It's awesome.

2026
00:54:26.201 --> 00:54:26.940
So I got a quick,

2027
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.773
it's a Camry,

2028
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:28.733
a lot of rappers

2029
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:32.703
to Camry.

2030
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:35.840
It's beautiful.

2031
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.350
I mean my two two liter bottles,

2032
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.493
I love the

2033
00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:42.813
sun

2034
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.600
and so it's bad.

2035
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.070
Obviously you run Mancha is,

2036
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:47.550
yeah.

2037
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.290
What about um,

2038
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.101
celery fellow?

2039
00:54:49.101 --> 00:54:51.770
Real kitty is okay to eat raw ginger.

2040
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:53.161
Ginger's okay.

2041
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:56.700
Raw Ginger has problems with mold in it because it's a root in roots.

2042
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:57.601
They spoiled,

2043
00:54:57.601 --> 00:54:57.781
right?

2044
00:54:57.781 --> 00:55:00.210
So if it's dried properly and harvested well it's great if it's,

2045
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.170
if it's done right,

2046
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.780
but if they cut corners like big food loves to do,

2047
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.840
then you get all this stuff you're not supposed to be getting in your body.

2048
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:07.941
Same thing with celery.

2049
00:55:07.941 --> 00:55:09.480
I just buy from the farmer's market.

2050
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:10.740
That's fucking grocery store.

2051
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.681
But you wouldn't know this,

2052
00:55:11.681 --> 00:55:12.391
but wild celery,

2053
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:13.230
we'll can kill you.

2054
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:14.610
It's so hostile.

2055
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.540
I dare it.

2056
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.780
Delta wild.

2057
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:22.620
What does wild salary look like?

2058
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.880
It looks just like normal salary,

2059
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:25.560
but when bugs and stuff eat it,

2060
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:27.090
it makes so many nitrates.

2061
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:27.751
So when you bite it,

2062
00:55:27.751 --> 00:55:29.370
it's almost like a poison ivy.

2063
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:30.810
Like it can cause swelling here.

2064
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.480
So the celery that we eat as like treated gently.

2065
00:55:33.481 --> 00:55:35.670
So it doesn't make a lot of toxins to fight off bugs.

2066
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.230
But you ever see that?

2067
00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:38.064
Like Bacon,

2068
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.170
the real expensive bacon that's cured and they celery powder and the,

2069
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:42.090
it's nitrate free.

2070
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.111
It's total bs.

2071
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:44.970
Salary is so high in nitrite,

2072
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.810
not nitrate,

2073
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:48.000
that when they powder the salary and they put that on the vacant and they're

2074
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:49.620
doing the same thing as putting nitrate in there,

2075
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.300
they just don't have to tell you it's nitrate.

2076
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.050
So salaries,

2077
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:54.720
the source of that nitrate isn't a problem unless you've got bad bacteria in

2078
00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:55.470
your gut.

2079
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.850
That's not gonna be a problem if you're eating right.

2080
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:59.610
But I thought there was like all these studies and so the nitrates are terrible

2081
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:00.444
for it.

2082
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:00.871
Well,

2083
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:02.210
nitrates and nitrites,

2084
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.430
it's bioabsorbables slight difference,

2085
00:56:05.431 --> 00:56:08.130
but the real difference is they're only bad for you if you have the bacteria in

2086
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:09.360
your gut that make it bad for you.

2087
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:13.110
So bad bacteria in your gut and make nitrosamines which mess you up.

2088
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:13.980
But you can make nitros.

2089
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:14.081
To me,

2090
00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:15.180
he's out of the gut too.

2091
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.350
Like I cure my own bacon,

2092
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:19.050
but I blocked and I trust him me information when I do it that way,

2093
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.580
I would never talk to you.

2094
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.690
If you're talking to a guy,

2095
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:22.820
he's like a cure my own bacon.

2096
00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.361
But like bitch,

2097
00:56:23.361 --> 00:56:23.770
I got it.

2098
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:24.603
Can

2099
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.310
<v 5>you tell the right kind of woman that you carry on Bacon?</v>

2100
00:56:28.311 --> 00:56:28.761
And they're like,

2101
00:56:28.761 --> 00:56:29.594
I want to go home with you.

2102
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:30.463
Oh

2103
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:34.820
yeah.

2104
00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:36.020
Well you never do shack.

2105
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:38.360
You can call them the right kind of women.

2106
00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.120
One of the definitions are honest about cholesterol.

2107
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.720
Like I've been my own experiment now for some years.

2108
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.130
And like you said,

2109
00:56:49.131 --> 00:56:49.701
starting out,

2110
00:56:49.701 --> 00:56:52.670
like I go pretty aggressively in deep into whatever it is and I'm like,

2111
00:56:52.671 --> 00:56:53.271
let's do this.

2112
00:56:53.271 --> 00:56:54.580
Then let's find out what happens.

2113
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:55.873
And uh,

2114
00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:57.860
so a couple things would happen.

2115
00:56:57.861 --> 00:56:58.790
I want completely,

2116
00:56:58.791 --> 00:56:59.624
uh,

2117
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:01.063
uh,

2118
00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.160
ketogenic for maybe six months.

2119
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:05.210
Now what does that mean exactly?

2120
00:57:05.211 --> 00:57:07.340
Is that when you don't eat any carbs?

2121
00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:10.680
So that's the a hundred grams a day for a prolonged period of time,

2122
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.290
like an Atkins style.

2123
00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:13.183
Is that

2124
00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:15.190
like that?

2125
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.540
<v 3>Here's the thing about Atkins,</v>

2126
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:17.530
Atkins Diet.

2127
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.810
He just said eat less carbs,

2128
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:23.230
but he didn't differentiate between types of fat and he let you eat way too much

2129
00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:25.720
protein because too much proteins inflammatory too.

2130
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.160
So if you've got people on the Atkins Diet,

2131
00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:30.100
they lose half their weight and they get stuck and the second half won't come

2132
00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:30.281
off.

2133
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:30.821
That happened to me.

2134
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:31.631
I lost 50 pounds.

2135
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:33.640
Is it gonna be another three or four years to get the other 50 off?

2136
00:57:33.641 --> 00:57:38.230
Cause I didn't understand moderate protein ketosis from eating not too many

2137
00:57:38.231 --> 00:57:40.240
carbs and a ton of the right kind of fat.

2138
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:41.800
And when you do that,

2139
00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:45.040
your inflammation goes away and all of a sudden you can lose a hundred pounds.

2140
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:46.540
Like I didn't keep it off for 10 years.

2141
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:48.153
That's the trick.

2142
00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.700
<v 5>I use it with that.</v>

2143
00:57:49.701 --> 00:57:52.280
Then I find that after what happened for a while,

2144
00:57:52.281 --> 00:57:53.114
for me anyway,

2145
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.700
was that for sure my cortisol level changed.

2146
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:58.390
Like I got higher,

2147
00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:59.241
higher cortisol,

2148
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:00.620
I got more stress like,

2149
00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:00.981
and,

2150
00:58:00.981 --> 00:58:01.814
and I,

2151
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:02.360
it was,

2152
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.740
it was like overtraining for me.

2153
00:58:03.741 --> 00:58:04.550
When you're overtraining,

2154
00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:05.870
one of the biggest things that you can find,

2155
00:58:05.871 --> 00:58:07.160
like if you're doing two or three days,

2156
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:09.470
is that you'll wake up with your heart racing or something.

2157
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.450
If you do that fucking,

2158
00:58:10.451 --> 00:58:11.450
you've got to pump the brakes.

2159
00:58:11.451 --> 00:58:11.961
You know what I mean?

2160
00:58:11.961 --> 00:58:12.111
You're,

2161
00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:12.591
you're just,

2162
00:58:12.591 --> 00:58:14.720
you're in a state where you need a few days off or whatever.

2163
00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.680
So the same thing was happening and it was just dietary for me and uh,

2164
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:21.810
and so then I backed off and I do huge re feeds of,

2165
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.540
of just cross and and things like that and fruit but a cycle in and out.

2166
00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:30.380
And what else should I have done and how long should he stay in Ketosis?

2167
00:58:30.381 --> 00:58:33.380
Like just a couple of weeks and then re feet or or what are you talking about?

2168
00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:37.230
<v 3>I recommend for guys every seven to 10 days to refeed and for women as often as</v>

2169
00:58:37.231 --> 00:58:37.861
every four days,

2170
00:58:37.861 --> 00:58:39.270
if they can get into ketosis between it,

2171
00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:40.660
women do not do well on,

2172
00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:42.720
on a little short time to get there isn't,

2173
00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:44.640
it takes like three days or something to get there.

2174
00:58:44.641 --> 00:58:46.530
Three or four days using MCT oil,

2175
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.420
you're going to get justice real fast with it and stuff.

2176
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.081
If not,

2177
00:58:49.081 --> 00:58:49.980
you go a little bit longer.

2178
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:52.150
But with the coaching clients I've got the,

2179
00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:52.993
the women,

2180
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:53.731
they tend to,

2181
00:58:53.731 --> 00:58:55.110
if they go in Ketosis and stay there,

2182
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.930
they'd start not dreaming and they get more stressed and like their sleep

2183
00:58:57.931 --> 00:59:01.830
quality goes down and I did like three months of like one serving of vegetables

2184
00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:02.011
a day.

2185
00:59:02.011 --> 00:59:05.370
The rest was mostly fat and some meat and eggs and stuff like that.

2186
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.290
It did not end well man.

2187
00:59:07.291 --> 00:59:10.290
After three months of that I was waking up nine times a night and not knowing I

2188
00:59:10.291 --> 00:59:10.741
woke up,

2189
00:59:10.741 --> 00:59:14.940
I was kind of like my sleep was dead and I started getting really dry eyes and

2190
00:59:14.941 --> 00:59:19.941
dry sinuses and I just didn't feel good so I found out what happened is that I

2191
00:59:20.161 --> 00:59:23.330
couldn't even tears because they didn't have enough carbohydrates to me.

2192
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.050
Tears.

2193
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.720
So you have to end my gut lining because you're a man,

2194
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:30.640
you're not out there crying in human fuck and you didn't want to cry.

2195
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.513
You're coming up with it.

2196
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:33.740
That is what I see though with athletes too.

2197
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:34.820
Without you guys suck,

2198
00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.673
man.

2199
00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:36.513
Female,

2200
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.820
they wouldn't,

2201
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.020
they need more carbs.

2202
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:41.000
It's like they can get leaner with more carbs.

2203
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:44.390
I think their cycle gets messed up if they go too low on carbs,

2204
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.340
which is insane.

2205
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:47.090
I can't believe you couldn't produce tears.

2206
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:47.300
Yeah.

2207
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.600
Well my eyes were dry and Mike Sinus is hurt and the lining of my stomach,

2208
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:51.790
like your stomach has mucus.

2209
00:59:51.791 --> 00:59:54.860
Like they protects it from the acid that got dissolved.

2210
00:59:54.861 --> 00:59:58.430
I develop new allergies from three months of like zero carbs essentially.

2211
00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.680
So that a hundred grams a day actually matters.

2212
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.280
And uh,

2213
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.980
occasionally refeeding with like 500 or 800,

2214
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.130
like go crazy and eat a lot of not wheat though.

2215
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.170
We just a terrible way to refit.

2216
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.180
It'll take you like a whole wheat sweet potatoes and squash and why Ryan is

2217
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.340
actually can be good for you as long as you're cheating with foods that aren't

2218
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:19.640
full of toxins like the Tim Ferriss towel cheat day where you just eat like

2219
01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:20.750
snickers bars and whatever.

2220
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:24.290
I tried that for years and what happens is it takes you four or five days to

2221
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.430
recover from the cheat day.

2222
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.740
Cause we're not talking about just like losing a little bit of weight.

2223
01:00:27.741 --> 01:00:30.740
We're talking about like rocking everything and if you want your brain to work,

2224
01:00:30.741 --> 01:00:33.440
you want to not have road ranch and not be a dick when you don't want to be a

2225
01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:34.274
dick,

2226
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.450
then I don't think that she did with cutting all the fun out of fucking cheat

2227
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.730
Shit.

2228
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:40.970
Did you just eliminate right there?

2229
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.400
You know what's cool though is the tighter that my diet gets done,

2230
01:00:43.401 --> 01:00:44.234
the better.

2231
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.450
What I'm willing to do a,

2232
01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.440
it's like before a pizza is to be a cheat day,

2233
01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:50.270
then it's now it's like sweet potato fries are,

2234
01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:50.840
yeah,

2235
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.531
that was a norm.

2236
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:53.240
It's like you get dialed in butter and you're just like,

2237
01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:53.600
I just,

2238
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.550
this is why w how good do I want to feel?

2239
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:55.971
And then you go,

2240
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:56.241
fuck,

2241
01:00:56.241 --> 01:00:56.841
I don't feel good.

2242
01:00:56.841 --> 01:01:00.230
I just had a fight or that it went and he cut a bunch of weight and then he does

2243
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:01.064
cake and all.

2244
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:04.400
It's like I don't ever want to sacrifice how I feel to feel like this.

2245
01:01:04.401 --> 01:01:05.750
It feels so fucking horrible.

2246
01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.710
So what about cholesterol then?

2247
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.930
Till now is 300 plus cluster.

2248
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.300
I'll make sure mustache right now.

2249
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:12.163
That's the first thing.

2250
01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.090
So what?

2251
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.670
What are the things that you can eat if you want to have a cheat day?

2252
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.610
I don't eat bad fats like hydrogenated fat,

2253
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.151
corn oil,

2254
01:01:20.151 --> 01:01:20.984
canola oil,

2255
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.150
and don't eat grain like don't eat wheat.

2256
01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:24.290
If you avoid those things,

2257
01:01:24.291 --> 01:01:25.370
you can have sugar on your cheat day,

2258
01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:26.001
that's fine,

2259
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:27.620
but don't eat sugar and markers are cool.

2260
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.690
It depends if you're sensitive to Casein,

2261
01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:30.620
the milk protein,

2262
01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:33.230
a lot of people should just not have milk and you're going to go right to sleep

2263
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.064
afterwards.

2264
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.030
If you're eating clean.

2265
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:35.840
And I like,

2266
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.280
if I go ahead and I'll go to the movies,

2267
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:38.720
it might be worth it.

2268
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.051
Oh,

2269
01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:39.884
it's great.

2270
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:41.390
Really good ice cream Sundae,

2271
01:01:41.391 --> 01:01:42.224
isn't it?

2272
01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:46.190
You can feel it's very worth it to ice cream.

2273
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:46.971
You can do ice cream.

2274
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:47.661
That's insane.

2275
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:48.980
The get some ice cream.

2276
01:01:48.981 --> 01:01:50.010
Do we talk about that last time?

2277
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.170
Them ice cream.

2278
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.640
It's a recipe for ice cream I made.

2279
01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:54.530
And especially for women when they eat it,

2280
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.660
it's dumb.

2281
01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.690
Horny Guardian made this for me.

2282
01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.190
[inaudible]

2283
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.330
was trying to get you horny dude.

2284
01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:03.530
Him and his Old Lady,

2285
01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.820
nobody asks and it was like purple or taller or rude or something.

2286
01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:09.830
It was the most delicious fucking ice cream.

2287
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:12.170
They're like horn you and you haven't tried bulletproof ice cream yet.

2288
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:13.723
Is that what you call it?

2289
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.410
I called get some ice cream.

2290
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:16.430
That's what Keith was calling it.

2291
01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:18.110
It's a bulletproof recipe,

2292
01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:20.880
but it's in my the upgrade shaft book and be on the menu.

2293
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:21.960
So here's,

2294
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.793
here's how it works.

2295
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.013
You,

2296
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.380
you put like nine egg yolks,

2297
01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:25.981
not the egg whites,

2298
01:02:25.981 --> 01:02:26.611
just the yolks.

2299
01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:28.560
Like you can give the whites to someone who owned it doesn't.

2300
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:33.150
If it does your low fat stuff and then you put like chocolate and butter and

2301
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:36.510
coconut oil and MCT oil and there's as much fat as you can fit in this ice cream

2302
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:37.680
and you put it in the ice cream maker.

2303
01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:40.260
You can put whatever sweetener you want and their sugar salad,

2304
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:40.740
tall,

2305
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.340
whatever.

2306
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.030
Oh honey.

2307
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:42.630
Stevia.

2308
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:43.740
Stevia is is really good.

2309
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:44.700
I don't use sugar.

2310
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:45.421
And when I do it,

2311
01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:49.140
I used out of the tall or cvs and you make the stuff and it sends an

2312
01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:50.670
environmental signal to both of you,

2313
01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:51.690
but especially the woman.

2314
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.010
Her body is primed.

2315
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:55.110
All women have this if there's still fertile,

2316
01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:55.950
and it says,

2317
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.790
if I'm in a world where there's enough raw materials to make a super healthy

2318
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:00.270
baby,

2319
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:01.980
I should go to the bedroom and make one.

2320
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.340
So you basically give this huge dose of amazing fast,

2321
01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:06.300
which the body craves.

2322
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.950
And then what happens?

2323
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.880
You go to the bedroom an hour later.

2324
01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:10.290
It's predictable and repeatable.

2325
01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:10.531
I mean,

2326
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:11.400
Keith was saying it works,

2327
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:12.090
right?

2328
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:12.370
Yeah.

2329
01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:13.860
He'd like hundreds of people who try this.

2330
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.940
It just doesn't mean that you have to come inside them either.

2331
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.590
It doesn't mean like a roofie like effect,

2332
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.970
because it's not fucking,

2333
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:24.751
is that what you're doing?

2334
01:03:24.751 --> 01:03:26.160
Your roofing chicks with your ice cream?

2335
01:03:26.161 --> 01:03:26.341
No.

2336
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:28.770
I'm telling you vodka versus get some ice cream.

2337
01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.540
You're going to score more if you make this ice cream.

2338
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:34.540
Talking about Jack Daniels.

2339
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.430
It depends what kind of growing up my awesome hippie ice cream is better than

2340
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.880
fucking Tequila in terms of certain outcomes.

2341
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.013
It works.

2342
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.350
What about shitty decision making and good times.

2343
01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:54.000
Last [inaudible] got my boner for bad decision makers.

2344
01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:56.011
But you,

2345
01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:56.611
you've had this stuff.

2346
01:03:56.611 --> 01:03:57.444
You know what I'm talking about?

2347
01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:57.800
It's like,

2348
01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.021
okay,

2349
01:03:58.021 --> 01:04:01.340
so the full ingredients to brief people.

2350
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.520
It's a egg yolks.

2351
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.700
Egg yolks nine was a little ice cream maker.

2352
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:07.680
A Cup of Kerry gold.

2353
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:08.580
Unsalted butter.

2354
01:04:08.581 --> 01:04:09.720
Do not put salt in your ice cream.

2355
01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:10.340
It's gross.

2356
01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:10.621
Right?

2357
01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:10.890
Okay.

2358
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.570
And then a cup of coconut oil,

2359
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.200
half a cup of MCQ ice cream.

2360
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:19.210
Those the shit like Carmel salt everywhere isn't so good.

2361
01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:21.060
And I try to add it to add it afterwards.

2362
01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:21.840
Okay,

2363
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.070
so unsalted butter.

2364
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:23.580
Yeah,

2365
01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.990
a cup of coconut oil.

2366
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:25.441
Coconut,

2367
01:04:25.441 --> 01:04:26.940
about a half a cup of MCT oil,

2368
01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:28.950
which gives it like the creamy consistency.

2369
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.390
I had to play around with the ratios there.

2370
01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:31.770
The ratio of butter in it.

2371
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:32.663
Oh totally.

2372
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.110
You melt the cow butter in it.

2373
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.520
It's like eating like a,

2374
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.360
almost like a moose when you put the in there.

2375
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.120
It's,

2376
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.070
it's so good.

2377
01:04:39.071 --> 01:04:39.411
Good.

2378
01:04:39.411 --> 01:04:40.600
So I made this.

2379
01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:40.951
All right,

2380
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:42.690
so I'm going to pitch my book for five seconds.

2381
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.171
Hold on.

2382
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:43.741
Finish the thing.

2383
01:04:43.741 --> 01:04:44.250
So does it work?

2384
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.290
The recipes in here and we're going to use this.

2385
01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:47.340
Leave us a cliffhanger.

2386
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:49.660
We use it works.

2387
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.350
I forgot how to make some healthy when you're like,

2388
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:52.531
look,

2389
01:04:52.531 --> 01:04:53.341
you need to buy my book.

2390
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:54.750
Now it's the recipes in the book.

2391
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:55.261
But here's the thing,

2392
01:04:55.261 --> 01:04:57.150
we use it to turn my west fertility back on.

2393
01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:57.961
It is that powerful.

2394
01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.400
I made it for every night,

2395
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:00.330
not just for fertility,

2396
01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:01.164
because it was fun too.

2397
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:01.890
Um,

2398
01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:06.340
but I met for every night Mr Asprey without pictures listening.

2399
01:05:06.341 --> 01:05:07.174
She's going to kill me.

2400
01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:08.431
And by the way,

2401
01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:08.481
she,

2402
01:05:08.481 --> 01:05:09.314
she's listening.

2403
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:09.960
Sorry.

2404
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.271
Sorry.

2405
01:05:10.271 --> 01:05:11.400
Londa would just choke him around.

2406
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:12.523
Mrs Bulletproof,

2407
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:13.590
is there a rocky road?

2408
01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:14.551
Is,

2409
01:05:14.551 --> 01:05:15.780
do you call her bulletproof wife?

2410
01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:16.960
No,

2411
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.351
but I will.

2412
01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:18.184
Now

2413
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.590
<v 1>that's not a bad idea.</v>

2414
01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:21.610
That's the next book title.

2415
01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:22.130
Great.

2416
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.360
Yeah.

2417
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.040
Bulletproof wife sell that shit.

2418
01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.090
So it was it.

2419
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:25.923
What does it,

2420
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.310
the better baby book.

2421
01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:27.731
Yeah.

2422
01:05:27.731 --> 01:05:29.170
And it's all just about eating,

2423
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.100
eating healthy fats.

2424
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.761
I'm just eating.

2425
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:34.390
Everything you can do to change with the environment tells the baby to do with

2426
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:35.224
his jeans.

2427
01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:36.070
Upgrading your baby.

2428
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:40.930
Fortunate story that was in the news about a Vegan couple that were arrested and

2429
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:46.080
charged with the woman apparently didn't supplement with B 12 and the baby just

2430
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.060
like almond milk and soy milk or something.

2431
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.510
I felt awful when I saw that.

2432
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.280
So fucking terrible lack of understanding of nutrition.

2433
01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.920
They were going out of their way to do vegetarian diets or anything like that

2434
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:01.570
because they think it's a horrible thing to do.

2435
01:06:01.571 --> 01:06:02.140
They they're,

2436
01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.910
they think it's the higher consciousness like to,

2437
01:06:03.911 --> 01:06:04.744
do you know what I mean?

2438
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.140
And that's let's,

2439
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.320
let's talk about that.

2440
01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:07.930
Okay.

2441
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:08.590
All right.

2442
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.510
If you're Vegan and you're doing it for the environment,

2443
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.800
you got to understand that hooved animals like cows and sheep are required for

2444
01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:16.330
soil to not turn into desert.

2445
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:18.970
Cause if they don't break up the top of the soil and poop on it,

2446
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.510
then the soil dies and it forms a crust of algae and water can't go into the

2447
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:23.230
soil.

2448
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.760
So we've had desertification problems,

2449
01:06:24.761 --> 01:06:27.940
like the great dust bowl and all that stuff that happened around the depression

2450
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:29.650
happened because we killed all the buffalo.

2451
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:34.180
So there's a need for us to have grass fed cows roaming ground.

2452
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:37.990
So imagine imagined there's still buffalo that would suck a dick trying to drive

2453
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:38.560
from New York,

2454
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.210
California,

2455
01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:42.700
this fucking million buffalo making the way across the plains.

2456
01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:45.550
I just see big Ole steaks terribly the whole way.

2457
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.413
Buffalo on the call,

2458
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.920
there's so big and they don't even give a fuck if you're there because you're so

2459
01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:51.670
god Damn Ben.

2460
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:52.900
I would have an awesome coat.

2461
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.093
Some got it.

2462
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.100
Some guy got fucked up by a buffalo recently.

2463
01:06:58.030 --> 01:06:58.863
Yellowstone.

2464
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.850
I heard they're wicked smart like dogs too.

2465
01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.080
Like you could train them as a pet.

2466
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:05.280
Ted Nugent had one and he would ride it on stage.

2467
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.173
Ted,

2468
01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.340
he used to ride it onstage.

2469
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.530
How crazy did he go?

2470
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:09.850
I love him.

2471
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:12.820
He's got a place in Michigan and a place in Texas.

2472
01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:16.720
Was that gaps in the high fence operations where just keeps animals in it except

2473
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:17.554
cats.

2474
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:18.610
No cats.

2475
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.450
He does not like cats.

2476
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:20.110
Oh yeah.

2477
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:20.943
Was probably smart.

2478
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:21.551
Right.

2479
01:07:21.551 --> 01:07:23.260
He talks about hunting them all the time.

2480
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:24.740
Oh yeah.

2481
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.561
Feral cats like no,

2482
01:07:25.561 --> 01:07:25.720
he,

2483
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.020
he,

2484
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.070
she was like thousands of him.

2485
01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:27.311
He says,

2486
01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:27.431
look,

2487
01:07:27.431 --> 01:07:30.250
the killed on my birds and he texts him out at 500 yards.

2488
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.120
That dude is,

2489
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:31.540
he's,

2490
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.740
he knows about the environment.

2491
01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:32.980
Yeah.

2492
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.251
Yeah.

2493
01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:34.084
Steve Rinella.

2494
01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.890
The guy from that show meters go hunting and he used to kill feral cats as well.

2495
01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:41.680
We have a different understanding of what a cat is.

2496
01:07:41.681 --> 01:07:44.140
Then it would a feral cat is feral cat as a pet.

2497
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:44.650
Yeah.

2498
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:45.401
They're wild.

2499
01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:46.020
I mean it's not,

2500
01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.040
it's not what you think and they will kill your livestock.

2501
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:51.760
They'll kill all kind of feel whatever they can as a high level predator.

2502
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:51.910
Yeah.

2503
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:52.750
You get chickens,

2504
01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:54.100
they'll kill your chickens for sure.

2505
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.373
There.

2506
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.730
Especially if you have a Tom cat,

2507
01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.600
one of those males,

2508
01:07:58.601 --> 01:08:01.150
the big heads and they come around and piss on everything.

2509
01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.400
When you can't usually get a male that gets out,

2510
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:04.540
that's not fixed.

2511
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:07.060
Those males get really big man.

2512
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:08.261
Yeah.

2513
01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:08.610
Those,

2514
01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:09.080
some of those,

2515
01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.390
I like a goldfish effect.

2516
01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:10.871
Like,

2517
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:12.250
if you can keep the goldfish in the bowl,

2518
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:12.941
it gets so big,

2519
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:14.260
but like you let that cat out,

2520
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:14.621
it gets,

2521
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:15.950
it turns doing huge car

2522
01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:18.220
<v 5>foods that killing machines.</v>

2523
01:08:18.221 --> 01:08:18.480
Yeah,

2524
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.750
they killed like three birds a day.

2525
01:08:19.751 --> 01:08:21.130
Or the amount of feral cat

2526
01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.090
<v 0>there are in the country is gigantic to folks.</v>

2527
01:08:24.091 --> 01:08:24.930
I'll realize it.

2528
01:08:24.931 --> 01:08:27.270
Unless you're driving from New York to California,

2529
01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:27.751
you know,

2530
01:08:27.751 --> 01:08:29.370
you stop and some of these towns along the way,

2531
01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:30.300
but a lot of people just,

2532
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.201
they're irresponsible.

2533
01:08:31.201 --> 01:08:32.060
They're fucking animals.

2534
01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.210
<v 5>The cats get out.</v>

2535
01:08:33.211 --> 01:08:34.290
They form communities,

2536
01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:34.870
they start,

2537
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:35.910
they start organizing,

2538
01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:36.870
they make kittens.

2539
01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.300
The reservations are crazy for that throat.

2540
01:08:39.301 --> 01:08:40.440
Arizona and New Mexico.

2541
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.831
Oh yeah.

2542
01:08:40.831 --> 01:08:43.140
I'm sure the people that live there,

2543
01:08:43.141 --> 01:08:44.430
it's like they don't want to neuter him.

2544
01:08:44.431 --> 01:08:46.200
Like there's drives to neuter and spay.

2545
01:08:46.201 --> 01:08:47.040
They're animals and they're like,

2546
01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:47.540
Hey,

2547
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.420
don't neuter that though.

2548
01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:53.421
Like we were on set there and there's dogs that are dying and eating each other.

2549
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:54.060
It's,

2550
01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:54.893
it's horrific.

2551
01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:57.540
And you're seeing straight rape scenes with dogs like on,

2552
01:08:57.541 --> 01:08:58.770
on if there's a dog in heat,

2553
01:08:58.771 --> 01:08:59.700
if there's a bitch in heat,

2554
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.200
there's like 12 dogs,

2555
01:09:01.201 --> 01:09:01.351
right?

2556
01:09:01.351 --> 01:09:03.230
It's the most horrific thing you've ever,

2557
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:04.463
it's bad.

2558
01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.750
And uh,

2559
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.120
and,

2560
01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.540
and it's right here,

2561
01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:12.660
but we were taking one dog because it was tied up to a post and it was been shot

2562
01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:14.380
with arrows and it's getting like,

2563
01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.253
like just people,

2564
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:16.710
people are kids are fucking with it,

2565
01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:17.161
torturing it,

2566
01:09:17.161 --> 01:09:17.400
right?

2567
01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.211
So we cut it off,

2568
01:09:18.211 --> 01:09:19.350
we asked to take it to the vet,

2569
01:09:19.351 --> 01:09:21.030
we take them to the vet and they're like,

2570
01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:21.261
yeah,

2571
01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:23.250
can you get the shots too and do it,

2572
01:09:23.251 --> 01:09:23.491
you know,

2573
01:09:23.491 --> 01:09:24.330
all this kind of thing.

2574
01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:25.350
And they're like,

2575
01:09:25.351 --> 01:09:26.184
but don't neuter it.

2576
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.480
And we're like,

2577
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.890
we're just taking the dog.

2578
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:30.330
Like this is a dead animal.

2579
01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:32.640
And so one of the crew people ended up,

2580
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.121
they said,

2581
01:09:33.121 --> 01:09:33.391
okay,

2582
01:09:33.391 --> 01:09:33.901
you can have it,

2583
01:09:33.901 --> 01:09:34.081
you know,

2584
01:09:34.081 --> 01:09:35.310
and they took it and they neutered it.

2585
01:09:35.311 --> 01:09:37.020
But there's something against that.

2586
01:09:37.021 --> 01:09:37.950
Like they don't want.

2587
01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:39.160
And I don't know why.

2588
01:09:39.161 --> 01:09:43.140
If they only live eight months probably there and they want a lot more around,

2589
01:09:43.141 --> 01:09:44.040
but it's bad.

2590
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.191
Well,

2591
01:09:44.191 --> 01:09:47.910
there's a big problem with Toxoplasma in third world countries because of the,

2592
01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:48.091
cause.

2593
01:09:48.091 --> 01:09:48.510
There's so many.

2594
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:49.530
It's really,

2595
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.810
are we talking about and cats and pregnancy?

2596
01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.740
Is that what you're talking about?

2597
01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.161
In Brazil?

2598
01:09:53.161 --> 01:09:53.910
A long time ago,

2599
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:57.100
the doctors will tell you never touched cat poop while you're pregnant.

2600
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.990
And I think it's good advice.

2601
01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.000
It's great advice.

2602
01:09:59.020 --> 01:09:59.940
I'm talking about plans,

2603
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.930
even if I'm not pregnant.

2604
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.313
Bulldogs mouth,

2605
01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:05.213
that's the worst.

2606
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:07.200
So I was told one of my gay friends,

2607
01:10:07.201 --> 01:10:08.034
I was like,

2608
01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:08.431
I was like,

2609
01:10:08.431 --> 01:10:09.690
I figure it's just like that.

2610
01:10:09.691 --> 01:10:12.460
Like some guys just like dicks and it said it's like my bulldog.

2611
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.410
He just liked catch it.

2612
01:10:13.411 --> 01:10:14.340
I didn't understand it.

2613
01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:15.420
I thought it was disgusting,

2614
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.430
but I did that.

2615
01:10:17.431 --> 01:10:17.791
I was like,

2616
01:10:17.791 --> 01:10:20.370
I'm just not going to try to pull it out of his mouth though anymore.

2617
01:10:20.371 --> 01:10:21.750
So you just do your thing.

2618
01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:23.010
I don't want to know about that,

2619
01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:24.870
but never want to meet your dog.

2620
01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.910
Why don't you just cover the,

2621
01:10:27.911 --> 01:10:28.501
the like what?

2622
01:10:28.501 --> 01:10:29.880
What I do is I have like my,

2623
01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:30.211
well,

2624
01:10:30.211 --> 01:10:31.320
I had to go back to the wall.

2625
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.380
I turned it to the wall so only the cat could fit in that we got from,

2626
01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:36.600
it was a learning process.

2627
01:10:36.601 --> 01:10:38.610
Brian Katz to cat poop.

2628
01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:43.130
I see the connection to the start with c connection.

2629
01:10:43.131 --> 01:10:45.030
This just shows chaos.

2630
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.140
Going to cock next door.

2631
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.210
<v 0>There was a bunch of people the last time you were here.</v>

2632
01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:49.960
First of all,

2633
01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.300
uh,

2634
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:50.520
I,

2635
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.140
I love the recipe for bulletproof coffee.

2636
01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:55.600
And what I love about it is because of all the fats in it,

2637
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.270
the caffeine is on like sort of a slow drip.

2638
01:10:58.650 --> 01:10:58.901
That's,

2639
01:10:58.901 --> 01:10:59.830
I didn't figure that out.

2640
01:10:59.831 --> 01:11:01.900
I didn't understand that before.

2641
01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.880
I really paid attention after I was like,

2642
01:11:03.881 --> 01:11:05.080
why would it last longer?

2643
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.291
Well,

2644
01:11:05.291 --> 01:11:06.220
that makes sense.

2645
01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:06.341
You're,

2646
01:11:06.341 --> 01:11:09.410
you're blending it up with all this grass fed butter and

2647
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.020
<v 5>he's beans have about half the caffeine of the dark roast you get from like a</v>

2648
01:11:13.021 --> 01:11:13.800
Starbucks or somewhere.

2649
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.160
They're not

2650
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.090
<v 3>high caffeine beans.</v>

2651
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:20.560
The beans that you have a light roast to meet him get yours is,

2652
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.730
and so is that better than a dark road is?

2653
01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.500
Yeah.

2654
01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.280
And it turns out the darker you go,

2655
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:27.750
the less antioxidants you have.

2656
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:28.450
And the more,

2657
01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.210
uh,

2658
01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:30.950
acrylamides that if for acrylamide,

2659
01:11:30.951 --> 01:11:33.630
I'm one of the chemicals PCA that it forms.

2660
01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:39.260
And what about as far as the other neuro enhancers of coffee in the fat working

2661
01:11:39.271 --> 01:11:42.270
synergistically to have that available to our brains.

2662
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:45.810
What you want to do is turn off inflammation in the brain because when your

2663
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:46.411
nerves are inflamed,

2664
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.740
they conduct electricity faster.

2665
01:11:47.741 --> 01:11:48.810
So you want to think faster.

2666
01:11:48.811 --> 01:11:51.420
You want to basically do everything you can to turn down inflammation.

2667
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.010
So what I figured out was if you brew your coffee the way your burn it with a

2668
01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:56.370
French Press,

2669
01:11:56.370 --> 01:12:00.120
that preserves the coffee oils and the coffee oils contain die turpines.

2670
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:01.830
They're called Kaphas strong cow hall.

2671
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:04.980
And what these things do is they go into the brain and they turn off certain

2672
01:12:04.981 --> 01:12:05.910
inflammation pathways.

2673
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:07.800
This is true of any kind of coffee.

2674
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:08.580
How's that?

2675
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.320
So if you take my coffee,

2676
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:13.380
which has no mycotoxins and no histamines in it because of the way it's

2677
01:12:13.381 --> 01:12:13.861
processed,

2678
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:14.700
the bulletproof process,

2679
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:18.720
and then you brew it right the way you just did before the show and the French

2680
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.050
Press,

2681
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:21.990
then what you're getting is these coffee oils that are kind of precious.

2682
01:12:21.991 --> 01:12:24.690
They're one of the things that make coffee and do a legitimate super food.

2683
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:28.970
And then you mix it with these other fats and they get into the body while when

2684
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:32.130
the other fats you're getting from bulletproof coffee is butyric acid in that

2685
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:32.964
butter,

2686
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:34.890
short chain fatty acids there.

2687
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:36.660
Those things actually heal the gut,

2688
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.890
which is kind of cool.

2689
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.350
There's only two ways you can get them if you're lucky and you have the right

2690
01:12:40.351 --> 01:12:41.460
bacteria growing in your gut,

2691
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.780
which a lot of people don't.

2692
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.430
You may make those in your gut,

2693
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.920
but the other place to come from is from dairy,

2694
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.070
so you're getting something that turns off inflammation in the brain,

2695
01:12:50.071 --> 01:12:53.130
which is what short chain fatty acids do and it heals your gut,

2696
01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:54.780
which is kind of cool and that's just water.

2697
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:55.710
That's my butter's a good food.

2698
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.411
<v 0>No.</v>

2699
01:12:56.411 --> 01:13:00.790
People were skeptical about your claims that it's Mycotoxins,

2700
01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:02.140
that it's in coffee,

2701
01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:06.310
that is what's causing discomfort and the crash and all that stuff.

2702
01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:08.320
Has that been proven?

2703
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:13.030
Is there like a test or a study that you can show that shows that mycotoxins are

2704
01:13:13.031 --> 01:13:14.020
at x level?

2705
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:19.520
<v 3>I'm in the very late stages of publishing an IRB approved study of upgraded</v>

2706
01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:22.950
Coffee Institutional Review Board.

2707
01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:25.350
It's like a legitimate medical kind of study.

2708
01:13:25.351 --> 01:13:26.730
I did it go and I start wondering,

2709
01:13:26.731 --> 01:13:27.870
you could just run it through us.

2710
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:29.950
I don't think that you guys are being

2711
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.823
taped,

2712
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:37.230
but so now I'm working with a guy from Stanford University or are there,

2713
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.710
you actually works at Google too and we tested your cognitive function on my

2714
01:13:40.711 --> 01:13:42.270
beans versus major beans,

2715
01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:46.440
like major normal ones and the difference on what was it,

2716
01:13:46.441 --> 01:13:51.390
six of nine measures of cognitive function was very substantially different on

2717
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.900
upgraded coffee is that it's the mycotoxins.

2718
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.200
It's also sometimes the histamine depending on,

2719
01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.070
<v 0>but have you tried,</v>

2720
01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:00.370
have you done tests on various brands?

2721
01:14:00.371 --> 01:14:02.740
You could show the mycotoxin levels of these brands?

2722
01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.640
<v 3>I haven't conducted those tests but I don't need to because it's a known</v>

2723
01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:09.120
industry problem and there's tons of stuff I referenced on this site and most of

2724
01:14:09.121 --> 01:14:10.620
those don't come from coffee roasters.

2725
01:14:10.621 --> 01:14:12.070
Coffee roasters pissed off when I say it,

2726
01:14:12.071 --> 01:14:13.990
it's like if there was mold on my beans,

2727
01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:14.824
I would see it

2728
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.713
<v 1>and my guys,</v>

2729
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:16.720
they have a gay voice.

2730
01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.470
Have you been in one of those coffee places?

2731
01:14:20.471 --> 01:14:21.880
That's just how it intelligentsia.

2732
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.741
But hold on a second.

2733
01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:24.574
I've got it.

2734
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.720
I've got to disagree with you.

2735
01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:29.060
I don't know whether or not your beans have more or less mycotoxins.

2736
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:30.310
I don't have my own lab,

2737
01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:32.130
but yeah,

2738
01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:32.860
I have to.

2739
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:34.210
I do know is if you,

2740
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.140
if you say your stuff contains no mycotoxins are less mycotoxins,

2741
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.410
you should test the other stuff and say what it contains so you can show the

2742
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:42.070
difference.

2743
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:43.190
So that's a,

2744
01:14:43.191 --> 01:14:44.260
that's a fair question.

2745
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:48.310
I don't think you should even try to say that they have it until you do that.

2746
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.300
Okay.

2747
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:49.580
<v 3>If,</v>

2748
01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:53.360
if a university has done the study and they've done a study with like thousands

2749
01:14:53.361 --> 01:14:56.240
of samples all over the place or hundreds of samples depending on which study

2750
01:14:56.241 --> 01:14:57.560
and they've done them for 20 years,

2751
01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.350
I'm just citing those studies because I don't have enough money to conduct all

2752
01:15:00.351 --> 01:15:01.850
those studies has been done.

2753
01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:02.100
Yeah,

2754
01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.860
it's been done for the past 40 years,

2755
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:04.420
40 years.

2756
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.650
<v 1>What has the process of,</v>

2757
01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:06.484
um,

2758
01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:07.323
how they,

2759
01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.790
how they roast coffee changed since then or how they clean it?

2760
01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:10.321
It's actually,

2761
01:15:10.321 --> 01:15:10.390
yeah,

2762
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:13.270
<v 3>actually neither are roasting thing or even really a cleaning thing.</v>

2763
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.690
What happens is a bug comes in,

2764
01:15:15.691 --> 01:15:16.720
it bites the coffee,

2765
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.490
and we've done studies on the bugs.

2766
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:23.491
We know 50% of the bugs that Bite Coffee Cherries have toxic mold spores on

2767
01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:27.430
their feet and that that's how the toxic molds enter this the chain.

2768
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.790
This means if you pick the right coffee and you have someone who's trained at

2769
01:15:30.791 --> 01:15:32.140
picking unblemished coffee,

2770
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.900
that coffee has not been inoculated with the bad stuff,

2771
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:38.440
but then if you're doing like an Indonesian or an African process,

2772
01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:40.180
you literally pick all the coffee,

2773
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:43.420
including the stuff that has bird bites and insect bites and everything else

2774
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:45.520
that are ways for this mold to get in there.

2775
01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.860
You throw it on a tarp and you let it sit there.

2776
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:52.660
It sits there for a while until it basically spoils and the outside dries up and

2777
01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:53.680
then you rinse it off,

2778
01:15:53.681 --> 01:15:55.030
dry it again and ship it off.

2779
01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.300
The other way they do it as they put it in a big bucket or a big barrel.

2780
01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.990
They add water and let it sit for a day or two and it spoils again.

2781
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:06.991
The outside of the coffee chair gets all like slimy work to spoil except with

2782
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:07.660
mine.

2783
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.690
Mine's mechanically processed oil mean.

2784
01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:11.570
When you say spoiled

2785
01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.170
person in the world,

2786
01:16:14.171 --> 01:16:15.004
who does this?

2787
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.060
The whole bulletproof process.

2788
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:17.110
I invented the bulletproof process.

2789
01:16:17.111 --> 01:16:20.770
I'm the only one that that's done every step of the chain and optimize it that

2790
01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:21.220
way.

2791
01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.220
What is getting done to your coffee beans?

2792
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.950
So done.

2793
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:24.671
Anybody else's,

2794
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:25.540
so it,

2795
01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:25.950
well,

2796
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:26.410
some of it,

2797
01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:26.741
I'll tell you,

2798
01:16:26.741 --> 01:16:28.150
there's a couple of steps that are proprietary.

2799
01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:31.810
I'm not going to tell you the rest of the steps are that I allowed zero

2800
01:16:31.811 --> 01:16:34.300
fermentation during the processing of the coffee.

2801
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:35.470
So people,

2802
01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:36.430
folks out of my roast,

2803
01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:37.240
I have a micro roast.

2804
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.260
I love coffee roasters,

2805
01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:42.490
but if you put beans that have problems in the toxins I'm talking about are heat

2806
01:16:42.491 --> 01:16:43.100
stable.

2807
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.420
This is such a problem that in Europe they have a a safe,

2808
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:48.940
acceptable level for Okra toxin in coffee.

2809
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:52.690
It is not set in the u s so if you go to Europe and you drink coffee,

2810
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.980
they have to test their coffee.

2811
01:16:53.981 --> 01:16:55.660
They've changed the whole coffee industry in Europe,

2812
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.660
the level of Okra toxin and is eight parts per million.

2813
01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.940
And if you sell coffee that's above that in Europe,

2814
01:17:00.941 --> 01:17:02.110
you're not even allowed to do that.

2815
01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.610
In the U s there is no limit.

2816
01:17:03.611 --> 01:17:05.500
So where do you think the cheap coffee goes?

2817
01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.100
It has to go to the u s and I love coffee.

2818
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:10.490
I am a coffee person.

2819
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.310
So when coffee people who have the most expensive,

2820
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:13.731
high tech,

2821
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:14.570
amazing roasters,

2822
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:17.510
and they spent their life studying coffee and they're getting beans that came

2823
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:18.620
from this great estate,

2824
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.750
they put them in and well,

2825
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:21.201
I'm sorry,

2826
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:24.830
if those things had histamine or they had mycotoxin or Okra toxin or aflatoxin

2827
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:25.850
in it,

2828
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.110
then what's going to come out of that roaster?

2829
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:28.400
It might taste and smell wonderful,

2830
01:17:28.401 --> 01:17:31.370
but you're not going to be at optimal human performance when it's done.

2831
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.420
So how did you find the right way to do this and how did you go about

2832
01:17:35.421 --> 01:17:39.380
establishing a business and you do you buy your beans roasted from a company

2833
01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:39.801
that you know,

2834
01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:41.400
handles it in a certain way?

2835
01:17:41.401 --> 01:17:44.180
I know of a bug just doesn't land on something though to awesome.

2836
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.030
It's okay if a bug lens on it because I allow no fermentation.

2837
01:17:47.031 --> 01:17:49.130
So the problem is number one inoculation,

2838
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:49.970
which comes from bugs.

2839
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:52.160
Number two is fermentation,

2840
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:54.650
which takes whatever landed on there from the bugs.

2841
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:56.030
So I've got steps like,

2842
01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:00.320
like the guys who pick the coffee have to be able to pick beans that are

2843
01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:01.071
actually ripe.

2844
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:04.520
And the annoying thing about coffee is that on the same branch,

2845
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:06.080
some beans are ripe,

2846
01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:06.621
some are not,

2847
01:18:06.621 --> 01:18:07.490
and they're all clustered together.

2848
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:09.650
So you've got to go through and actually pick out the right ones if you do it

2849
01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:10.250
right.

2850
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:12.140
So typical bulk commodity coffee,

2851
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.990
they pick it with guys who just strip everything off.

2852
01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:16.190
You go to some Starbucks stores,

2853
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.650
they actually have a photo of like this beautiful,

2854
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:18.861
you know,

2855
01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:19.694
bags of beans.

2856
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:20.780
Half the beans aren't right.

2857
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:20.940
Yeah,

2858
01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.180
they're green and black and brown.

2859
01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:23.023
They're all different.

2860
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.141
Those beans,

2861
01:18:24.141 --> 01:18:25.640
not someone who knows how to pick coffee.

2862
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.301
Right?

2863
01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.350
So what's going on there?

2864
01:18:27.351 --> 01:18:27.890
It was cheap.

2865
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:28.880
You're going to ferment them anyway.

2866
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.841
No one's going to notice.

2867
01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:31.850
How did you form this company?

2868
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:35.330
How did you get about changing the way it's processed?

2869
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.343
Well,

2870
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:41.510
I paid for my undergraduate studies by selling caffeine tee shirts over the

2871
01:18:41.511 --> 01:18:41.781
Internet.

2872
01:18:41.781 --> 01:18:42.950
I was the first guy to sell anything.

2873
01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.900
Ever said Caffeine,

2874
01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:48.500
my drug of choice with a picture of the caffeine molecule of those before.

2875
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.681
Yeah.

2876
01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:49.280
I made that up.

2877
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.140
I was like,

2878
01:18:51.141 --> 01:18:52.910
I was a kid and I needed to pay for my school.

2879
01:18:52.911 --> 01:18:54.590
I didn't like working at Baskin Robbins anymore,

2880
01:18:54.591 --> 01:18:57.000
so I started this little tee shirt thing and put it on using it.

2881
01:18:57.010 --> 01:18:59.300
It was amazing what happened and it was,

2882
01:18:59.301 --> 01:18:59.421
you know,

2883
01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:00.470
enough to pay for my school,

2884
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.333
just barely,

2885
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:02.870
so that was good.

2886
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.990
But I had to give up coffee because I started,

2887
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.650
I kept drinking it and I would go up and I'd crash and I go up and I'd crash.

2888
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.630
Then it gets sore joints and it turns out I had Stacie buttress like the really

2889
01:19:11.631 --> 01:19:15.070
bad toxic mold living in my house and it sensitized my immune system to toxic

2890
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.200
molds and I've done all the lab work and I can show you they're really bad toxic

2891
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:21.200
black mold where they have to fumigate your whole house.

2892
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:23.390
That's what the astronauts students come in and that kind of thing.

2893
01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:24.510
As opposed to be a mother,

2894
01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:25.910
fuck it will fuck you up.

2895
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.400
Like if you have water damage in the house and you don't hire guys and

2896
01:19:28.401 --> 01:19:30.950
astronauts whose to come in and test it and clean it like you could,

2897
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:31.740
you could die.

2898
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:35.990
It's like you said that Tom like his head that he was sick for a while and they

2899
01:19:35.991 --> 01:19:38.640
had to go in there and and terrorist whole fucking all support.

2900
01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.380
That happened to me.

2901
01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.290
Like they had guys literally they measured it and they came back and astronauts

2902
01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:44.820
who it's like we're not coming in here without these and saying,

2903
01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:47.390
and I was in there and my immune system got sensitized,

2904
01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:48.140
so I'm like,

2905
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:48.891
I'm like a canary.

2906
01:19:48.891 --> 01:19:49.970
Like you give me moldy coffee.

2907
01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:53.210
I'll tell you within 10 minutes if there was mold in there because it affects my

2908
01:19:53.211 --> 01:19:53.781
forehead swells up,

2909
01:19:53.781 --> 01:19:54.740
you'll see like a ridge,

2910
01:19:54.741 --> 01:19:55.491
like a cling on Ridge,

2911
01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:55.950
right?

2912
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:58.160
That's I'm saying when you have moldy coffee,

2913
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.320
seriously my forehead,

2914
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.270
I have some photos like swells up right here.

2915
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:03.590
Please send those photos to minute.

2916
01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:04.520
I put them on Instagram.

2917
01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:05.563
That's ridiculous.

2918
01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.320
So,

2919
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.630
so I have magic coffee skills there as well as some other foods.

2920
01:20:09.631 --> 01:20:09.811
Right.

2921
01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:10.291
What did you do?

2922
01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:14.130
Did you start a business or did you start buying beans from a business that knew

2923
01:20:14.131 --> 01:20:14.830
what they were doing?

2924
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:17.130
I gave up coffee first and then I just,

2925
01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.420
I finally said I'm going to break down.

2926
01:20:18.421 --> 01:20:21.330
I'm just going to have coffee and I didn't have any symptoms and I was so happy.

2927
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:23.610
And the next day I had coffee and I had symptoms and I'm like,

2928
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.280
so I decided I did all this research,

2929
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:27.210
like tons of research.

2930
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:32.510
Then I spent two years like going around saying how can I like improve the odds?

2931
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.170
And I post on the site,

2932
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:37.530
I tell you how you can find coffee that's kind of clean and that at least makes

2933
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:38.364
a difference.

2934
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:38.911
And then I said,

2935
01:20:38.911 --> 01:20:39.001
well,

2936
01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:40.560
I think I can make coffee this perfectly clean.

2937
01:20:40.561 --> 01:20:44.580
So I talked to some of the top roasters in the country and some of the top being

2938
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:44.881
guys.

2939
01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:49.260
And I went around and I interviewed different people about how their beans were

2940
01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.010
processed.

2941
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:51.690
And I explain the bulletproof process to them.

2942
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.230
And I said,

2943
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:54.510
this is the process I devised based in all my research.

2944
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.330
Can you give me green beans like this?

2945
01:20:57.331 --> 01:20:57.601
Can,

2946
01:20:57.601 --> 01:20:59.970
can you modify your plantation operations to do this?

2947
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:01.170
And they said yes.

2948
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.210
And then I went to the top rank roaster in the u s and I said,

2949
01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:04.044
these are the beans.

2950
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.040
I want you to roast them.

2951
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.990
And then they roast them to my specs,

2952
01:21:06.991 --> 01:21:09.300
which are a medium roast because that's the optimal health thing.

2953
01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:11.130
I may end up doing a,

2954
01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:11.640
uh,

2955
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.473
another roast,

2956
01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:13.650
a dark roast,

2957
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:16.350
but this was like a multiple year thing from the company.

2958
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:17.730
And then you bring them to a roaster.

2959
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.800
I get the beans from the plantation like this.

2960
01:21:19.801 --> 01:21:22.960
These are the guys who grow my beans and they'd pick them my way and they

2961
01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:23.970
process every step.

2962
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:25.171
Right now,

2963
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:25.981
Central America,

2964
01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:26.730
I get them from,

2965
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:30.150
so I have a Guatemalan supply and another couple on the online in other

2966
01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:30.984
countries nearby.

2967
01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.000
I'm concerned about the rust is going on down there right now.

2968
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.071
Coffee,

2969
01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:38.010
fungus called rust is decimating central America right now.

2970
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.780
They could lose 70% of their crop next year.

2971
01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.660
Like you'll probably pay a buck more for a cup of coffee a year and a half from

2972
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:43.494
now because of this.

2973
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:44.161
Okay,

2974
01:21:44.161 --> 01:21:46.290
so these people grow it for you and you,

2975
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:47.191
you're insured,

2976
01:21:47.191 --> 01:21:49.220
they're only picking the right ones and then,

2977
01:21:49.221 --> 01:21:49.891
and I tested,

2978
01:21:49.891 --> 01:21:51.390
they roasted themselves.

2979
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:51.761
No,

2980
01:21:51.761 --> 01:21:51.950
no.

2981
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:52.680
Someone else does.

2982
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:52.861
Right.

2983
01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:56.280
And there's a whole supply chain problem between wind coffees picked and then

2984
01:21:56.281 --> 01:22:01.020
how it's packed and how it's moved into the u s my roasters is in the Pacific

2985
01:22:01.021 --> 01:22:01.854
northwest,

2986
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.030
so they do my roasting for me and then I shipped straight from there.

2987
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:07.650
It's a moldy ass place.

2988
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:10.530
The Pacific northwest seemed like the worst place to get rid of bold.

2989
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.910
It's a fair point actually.

2990
01:22:11.911 --> 01:22:12.810
I should do in Phoenix.

2991
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:14.083
Yeah.

2992
01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:14.671
Yeah.

2993
01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:15.500
There you go.

2994
01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:15.780
Um,

2995
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:16.990
so now you,

2996
01:22:16.991 --> 01:22:17.821
you get it,

2997
01:22:17.821 --> 01:22:18.600
you roasted.

2998
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.020
Do you have like a roasted by date that you put on the baggage?

2999
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:24.120
You know I I that is the end.

3000
01:22:24.121 --> 01:22:25.470
The plans right now,

3001
01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:28.290
the stuff never sits in the warehouse for like more than a week.

3002
01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:33.291
How long can I keep it in my cupboard or freezer or it'll be safe for six plus

3003
01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:34.980
months.

3004
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.030
You're totally fine there,

3005
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:38.970
but it'll be most flavorful if you get it in the first month,

3006
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.833
which is what we'd like.

3007
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:41.190
What if I freeze it?

3008
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:42.630
Is that got any benefit at all?

3009
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:43.860
Freezing has benefits.

3010
01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:45.030
Here's what I would,

3011
01:22:45.031 --> 01:22:49.700
I do if I want to freeze it is I take a little vacuum packer thing and I sucked

3012
01:22:49.701 --> 01:22:50.340
the air out of it.

3013
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.290
If you don't have a vacuum pack or you could just suck the air out,

3014
01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:53.124
there's a little valve,

3015
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:55.010
that little valve we use the expensive valve,

3016
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.540
not the cheap ones that lets the CO2 out.

3017
01:22:57.541 --> 01:22:58.440
Cause when you roast beans,

3018
01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.041
you put them in a bag,

3019
01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:02.190
they produced their own carbon dioxide and that can like puff up the bag.

3020
01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:03.570
So you need to let that pressure out.

3021
01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:04.261
So he just,

3022
01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:04.990
you suck the air out,

3023
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.823
you can just go,

3024
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:08.140
just suck it as far out.

3025
01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:10.330
I have a little machine that does that and put a piece of scotch tape over it

3026
01:23:10.331 --> 01:23:12.490
and toss it in the freezer and that's going to store really,

3027
01:23:12.491 --> 01:23:13.300
really well.

3028
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.490
And here's where people go wrong when they freeze their coffee.

3029
01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:17.170
If you take it out of the freezer,

3030
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.270
you cannot open that bag until it's room temperature.

3031
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:21.010
Cause you know like like a glass,

3032
01:23:21.011 --> 01:23:21.844
we'll get frosty.

3033
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:24.490
Oh the last thing you want is water getting on your roasted coffee cause it'll

3034
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.170
ruin the flavor for sure.

3035
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:29.290
So what you do then is you just take it out,

3036
01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:32.140
you let it sit there and the next morning you cut the bag open and you're going

3037
01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:32.921
to have really fresh,

3038
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:33.760
really good coffee.

3039
01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.860
So a lot of people buy my five pound bags.

3040
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.160
They take those and they like put half of it into a,

3041
01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:38.500
uh,

3042
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.560
one of those like Costco vacuum seal things and they just toss it in the

3043
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:42.394
freezer.

3044
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.350
And that's the most economic way to do it.

3045
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:45.400
And if you put in the freezer,

3046
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:46.930
how long is it good for like the uh,

3047
01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:47.890
it's good.

3048
01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:49.720
I've never measured the total length.

3049
01:23:49.721 --> 01:23:52.210
Probably depends on freezer burn and whatever else is in there.

3050
01:23:52.211 --> 01:23:53.290
But a long time,

3051
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:54.700
like as long as meat would be good,

3052
01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:57.520
the Internet is a ruthlessly critical place.

3053
01:23:57.730 --> 01:24:00.220
So I know you get fucked with a lot.

3054
01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:01.390
A lot of these ideas,

3055
01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:01.691
the,

3056
01:24:01.691 --> 01:24:02.000
you know,

3057
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.630
people claim that they were unsubstantiated and there's no,

3058
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:05.290
yeah,

3059
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:06.100
it's kind of funny.

3060
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:06.540
What does,

3061
01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:09.670
what does the European Union and have an eight parts per million Okra toxin and

3062
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:10.600
the US doesn't?

3063
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.100
Well,

3064
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:12.790
there's other,

3065
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:16.270
there's other things that I've read that show that there's absolutely an issue

3066
01:24:16.271 --> 01:24:21.271
with mycotoxins and all sorts of food and the apples apparently and Hatchell in

3067
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:23.950
is what grows in an apples or the toxin that comes into apples.

3068
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:26.430
And when you hear stories about like Tom Laqueur's,

3069
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:27.460
his house getting,

3070
01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.250
I mean that's a poison fungus.

3071
01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:30.670
That's horrible house.

3072
01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:31.110
Yeah,

3073
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:32.950
this is a real issue and all sorts of different things,

3074
01:24:32.951 --> 01:24:33.370
isn't it?

3075
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:37.120
It's actually really scary because our bodies work pretty well.

3076
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:38.740
If you eat something that's really spoiled,

3077
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.400
like you'll,

3078
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.430
you'll throw up and you'll get sick and then you'll recover.

3079
01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:45.190
And if you were growing your own food or you were a caveman,

3080
01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.330
then okay fine.

3081
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:49.360
The next day you eat meat that wasn't spoiled or whatever it was and you just go

3082
01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:50.194
on with life.

3083
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:51.880
But when we have big food involved,

3084
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.870
they're like,

3085
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.961
oh,

3086
01:24:52.961 --> 01:24:55.000
here's the safe limit of these toxins.

3087
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.610
So let's dump a truck full of tomatoes into the tomato processing plant in.

3088
01:24:58.611 --> 01:25:00.490
Some of them are spoiled and moldy and some aren't,

3089
01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:03.400
but it's okay cause we're at the low acceptable limit.

3090
01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:06.910
But our bodies don't like a low acceptable limit because it's like a chronic

3091
01:25:06.911 --> 01:25:09.850
background noise of inflammation that keeps the body inflamed.

3092
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:12.250
It's not enough to make you sick to make you throw up,

3093
01:25:12.251 --> 01:25:14.770
but it might be enough to make you tired to make you flip the guy off and

3094
01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:17.200
traffic in front of you to feel agitated and aggressive.

3095
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.790
So what I found,

3096
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.391
trust me,

3097
01:25:19.391 --> 01:25:20.224
I don't like this.

3098
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:23.110
I would love to just go to Mcdonald's and get like really healthy food that

3099
01:25:23.111 --> 01:25:24.970
makes me feel good that doesn't do that.

3100
01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:26.320
But I found if I want it to be,

3101
01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.221
you're bulletproof.

3102
01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:30.160
I want to be at that point where my brain worked and I had all the focus and all

3103
01:25:30.161 --> 01:25:33.700
the energy I wanted and I didn't get fat like I used to be when I weighed 300

3104
01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:34.534
pounds.

3105
01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.730
He must have surely changed other things as well though.

3106
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.020
It's not just mycotoxins,

3107
01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:40.390
like it's 70% of my calories from healthy fats.

3108
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.440
Mostly saturated.

3109
01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:41.591
Like,

3110
01:25:41.591 --> 01:25:42.070
I mean I,

3111
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.170
I've optimized every single thing I can,

3112
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:44.970
but like,

3113
01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:46.720
I mean you guys are both in better shape than I am,

3114
01:25:46.721 --> 01:25:48.160
but I work out 45 minutes a month.

3115
01:25:48.161 --> 01:25:50.440
I do my whole body vibration 45 minutes a month.

3116
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:51.251
I'm not kidding.

3117
01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:52.360
I do high end,

3118
01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:52.880
not a minute.

3119
01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.570
Less ridiculous.

3120
01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:55.750
That's five times more than me.

3121
01:25:58.630 --> 01:25:59.860
Really busy.

3122
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.171
I mean,

3123
01:26:00.171 --> 01:26:00.330
I,

3124
01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:00.971
I'll stand on my,

3125
01:26:00.971 --> 01:26:01.300
my,

3126
01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.320
my vibration plate.

3127
01:26:02.321 --> 01:26:04.220
I do that more often than how dare you think?

3128
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.570
<v 1>That's a workout and it's awesome.</v>

3129
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:07.470
I have one.

3130
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.690
I,

3131
01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:08.091
you tend to,

3132
01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:08.924
we,

3133
01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:10.670
it's probably more healthy.

3134
01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:11.811
That's incredible.

3135
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:13.370
You work out 45 minutes a month.

3136
01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:16.280
It's like I lift some heavy things every now and then basically.

3137
01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:18.020
And I do it for very short periods of time.

3138
01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:18.920
Just in your cardio.

3139
01:26:18.921 --> 01:26:19.671
Just turned a dog.

3140
01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:21.470
Shit never tests.

3141
01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.300
It never does.

3142
01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:26.390
I got to walk up to my car.

3143
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:28.000
What do you mean for real?

3144
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.550
I mean,

3145
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:29.390
now what do you know?

3146
01:26:29.391 --> 01:26:30.380
What about nicotine?

3147
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:31.581
But hold on,

3148
01:26:31.581 --> 01:26:32.301
let's talk about this.

3149
01:26:32.301 --> 01:26:35.820
He's still working out 45 fucking minutes a month to can't just gloss over that.

3150
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:37.220
I'm a solid dude,

3151
01:26:37.221 --> 01:26:37.650
right?

3152
01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:38.530
I'm not like assault.

3153
01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.171
As you guys know,

3154
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:43.220
you are given that five minutes a month.

3155
01:26:43.221 --> 01:26:44.720
So do you have a day that you pick?

3156
01:26:44.721 --> 01:26:48.560
Once a month we'd just go fucking crazy and lift a shitload of things for 15

3157
01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:49.040
minutes.

3158
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.660
Maybe 15 minutes,

3159
01:26:50.661 --> 01:26:51.494
three 15

3160
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.240
every day,

3161
01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.290
three times every month.

3162
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:55.110
And so what?

3163
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:56.150
I'm not that religious about it.

3164
01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.600
It's like barely once a week or not really.

3165
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.390
If I'm home and I've got access to my vibration plate,

3166
01:27:02.391 --> 01:27:03.620
which amplifies the effects,

3167
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.210
I'll stand there with the Kettlebell.

3168
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:08.090
Hold the Kettlebell like this for five minutes vibrating 30 times a second,

3169
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:09.320
but that's what you call a workout.

3170
01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:11.620
Amazing.

3171
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:12.650
That's ridiculous.

3172
01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.720
But here's what you need to get.

3173
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.490
You need to get into a Goddamn Jiu Jitsu class.

3174
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:16.400
I really,

3175
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.190
I really want to get into that.

3176
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.120
We'll kick that 45 minutes a month.

3177
01:27:20.121 --> 01:27:20.560
Right?

3178
01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.393
They're everywhere now.

3179
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.371
They used to be,

3180
01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:23.031
they weren't everywhere.

3181
01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:24.770
You had to be to get behind those 45 minutes.

3182
01:27:24.771 --> 01:27:25.521
I'm at Shit.

3183
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:26.280
You know what?

3184
01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.800
I'm actually a yellow belt in judo.

3185
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:28.520
I'll tell you.

3186
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.061
Are you really?

3187
01:27:29.061 --> 01:27:29.540
Yeah.

3188
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.373
When did he do it?

3189
01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:33.230
12 here's the problem.

3190
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:36.020
I live in a small town and I'm on airplanes 150 days a year,

3191
01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:36.990
so I,

3192
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:39.250
I actually miss even go to yoga class.

3193
01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.750
It's like I'm a pretty accomplished yoga.

3194
01:27:40.751 --> 01:27:44.270
I can put my ankles behind my head and all that rocks Twitter page.

3195
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:47.140
We'll go and look at the Twitter page of the rots at drag.

3196
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.710
You want to get driven?

3197
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.981
Yeah.

3198
01:27:48.981 --> 01:27:51.230
This fucking guy is on a plane probably as much as you,

3199
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.860
but he's,

3200
01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:55.610
he posts pictures of himself at the weight room at six 30 in the morning or

3201
01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:58.840
whenever he lands,

3202
01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.330
whatever,

3203
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:00.890
whatever time has gotten to gets it in there.

3204
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:04.520
Does it say in the last three years I started the bulletproof executive.

3205
01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:07.790
I moved countries and I'm a senior executive at this big company.

3206
01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:09.830
Like I'm a vice president in that micro.

3207
01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:14.390
So I'm basically doing two full time jobs and I slept for two years straight,

3208
01:28:14.391 --> 01:28:16.220
less than five hours a night on purpose.

3209
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:18.710
And if I want to work out like the level you guys do,

3210
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:19.730
I got to get my sleep.

3211
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:21.970
I would need three more hours of sleep too.

3212
01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:22.251
I mean,

3213
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:23.084
it's not like,

3214
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.380
it's not like I'm sedentary.

3215
01:28:24.381 --> 01:28:26.990
I'm not some comic that sleeps all fucking day.

3216
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.841
I fucking,

3217
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:30.750
I mean like I,

3218
01:28:30.751 --> 01:28:33.200
I'm one of the busiest people that I know.

3219
01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:34.063
But how much do you sleep?

3220
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:36.600
Probably seven hours in a day to look like you.

3221
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:38.510
So I do four to five hours a night,

3222
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:39.141
right?

3223
01:28:39.141 --> 01:28:40.260
And so I could trade I,

3224
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:41.001
if I work out more,

3225
01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:42.350
I got to get another couple hours sleep.

3226
01:28:42.351 --> 01:28:43.910
And then that's interesting.

3227
01:28:43.911 --> 01:28:46.670
So you feel like there's a less of a demand because you don't work out.

3228
01:28:46.671 --> 01:28:48.440
So you choose to use your resources another way.

3229
01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:49.011
And that's,

3230
01:28:49.011 --> 01:28:49.641
that's what I'm doing.

3231
01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:53.540
And a nice way of rationalizing the fact the only workout 45 minutes a month.

3232
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:54.374
That's what that is.

3233
01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:59.420
I'm a formerly obese guy and one of the things I did is I started this

3234
01:28:59.421 --> 01:28:59.931
experiment,

3235
01:28:59.931 --> 01:29:01.230
4,000 calories a day,

3236
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:02.130
five hours

3237
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.470
<v 3>or less of sleep per night and no exercise.</v>

3238
01:29:04.471 --> 01:29:06.570
And I was going to try and gain like a couple pounds.

3239
01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:07.201
So I could say,

3240
01:29:07.201 --> 01:29:07.381
look,

3241
01:29:07.381 --> 01:29:08.340
I should have gained 20 pounds.

3242
01:29:08.341 --> 01:29:09.150
I gained two pounds.

3243
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:10.200
I did it for two years.

3244
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:12.840
I should have weighed 616 pounds at the end of that experiment.

3245
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:15.540
And I weighed like a pound more than what I weighed before.

3246
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:16.170
Like within,

3247
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:16.501
you know,

3248
01:29:16.501 --> 01:29:17.670
an error margin of poop.

3249
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.370
So I actually got more muscle mass during that time though,

3250
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.750
which was bizarre to me.

3251
01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.300
So that put the,

3252
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.350
what else were you doing though during that time?

3253
01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:29.610
During that time I was reading you submitting your testosterone's?

3254
01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.573
Yeah,

3255
01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.810
surely had some effect.

3256
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.141
Yeah.

3257
01:29:34.141 --> 01:29:39.141
I keep my testosterone it basically the mid range for someone who's 30 and I had

3258
01:29:40.231 --> 01:29:42.510
very low testosterone because I was obese.

3259
01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:44.720
So my testosterone over aromatase.

3260
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:46.110
As it turns to estrogen very quickly,

3261
01:29:46.111 --> 01:29:46.711
at least it used to,

3262
01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:49.830
it doesn't anymore with the way I eat and the other supplements I take.

3263
01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:51.030
So for me,

3264
01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:54.960
since since 30 I've been using small doses of bioidentical testosterone and I

3265
01:29:54.961 --> 01:29:56.130
put them on my armpits.

3266
01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:59.480
I do it once a day and I measured my blood levels.

3267
01:29:59.481 --> 01:30:02.100
So I've never been like above the normal levels.

3268
01:30:02.101 --> 01:30:03.480
I'm not like super.

3269
01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:04.500
Normally I'm juicing.

3270
01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.130
Not ever,

3271
01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:07.810
but the measuring yourself over this time period,

3272
01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.450
you said you gained muscle?

3273
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.000
Yup.

3274
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.370
We doing the testosterone.

3275
01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:13.050
Before you started that measurement,

3276
01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:13.891
I have to do it.

3277
01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:14.790
While you were doing,

3278
01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.250
I've been doing that testosterone every print.

3279
01:30:17.290 --> 01:30:20.310
I want to say every day cause I miss a lot of days cause I forget to smear it

3280
01:30:20.311 --> 01:30:20.760
on.

3281
01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.640
But I've been doing it pretty much since for the last 10 years.

3282
01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:25.681
So no,

3283
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:27.210
then so I didn't change it.

3284
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:28.291
I held a concert.

3285
01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:28.920
You had it?

3286
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.753
Yeah.

3287
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.180
Huh.

3288
01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.013
That's interesting.

3289
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.050
I don't know why you would gain muscle mass from not working out.

3290
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:37.080
That seems like I have some theories about that I was doing,

3291
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:39.450
I invented bulletproof intermittent fasting during that time,

3292
01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:42.120
which is when you do bulletproof coffee during an intermittent fast.

3293
01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:43.381
I'm sorry,

3294
01:30:43.381 --> 01:30:45.470
but you could be a hilarious Saturday night live sketch.

3295
01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:47.610
If you get any more famous,

3296
01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:50.890
you're in trouble because we're going to do a sketch where everybody wanted to

3297
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:51.840
take a bulletproof shit,

3298
01:30:52.650 --> 01:30:54.960
my bullet proof car and go to the bulletproof office.

3299
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.710
You know I,

3300
01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:57.300
this is my bulletproof secretary.

3301
01:30:57.690 --> 01:30:58.600
Let's see if you're in my bubble.

3302
01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:01.020
I'm going to have to check you.

3303
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:02.220
You ran out.

3304
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:02.940
Alright,

3305
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.410
I'll stop bulletproofing stuff Joe,

3306
01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.640
but no more.

3307
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.713
All right,

3308
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:08.063
fair enough.

3309
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:09.240
It's an awesome name.

3310
01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:10.470
It's an awesome name,

3311
01:31:10.471 --> 01:31:12.990
but what do you want to call?

3312
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:15.260
Just totally busting your balls.

3313
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:16.663
You,

3314
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:17.461
what was the word,

3315
01:31:17.461 --> 01:31:18.280
the term you used for?

3316
01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:18.650
Well,

3317
01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:20.460
there's intermittent fasting where you eat nothing crew.

3318
01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:20.930
Fascinating.

3319
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:21.600
Yeah,

3320
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.150
and so there's this new thing and I don't know what to call it.

3321
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:25.950
We'll call it upgraded.

3322
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.823
Anyway,

3323
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:29.723
that's another thing.

3324
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:31.950
That's another Ted Nugent thing.

3325
01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:33.000
Everything's an upgrade.

3326
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:33.211
Oh,

3327
01:31:33.211 --> 01:31:33.820
is it really?

3328
01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.130
He likes to upgrade things.

3329
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.410
I got to talk to great America upgrade this.

3330
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:38.641
That's hilarious.

3331
01:31:38.641 --> 01:31:39.660
I had no idea who was doing that.

3332
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.680
You gotta Watch this show.

3333
01:31:40.681 --> 01:31:41.820
It's a great show on television.

3334
01:31:41.821 --> 01:31:43.470
Let's show spirit of the wild.

3335
01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.690
I had no idea he had a television show.

3336
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.250
Dude.

3337
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.910
You don't even know dude.

3338
01:31:48.010 --> 01:31:48.220
Great.

3339
01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.410
It's fucking show ever.

3340
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:50.610
It's a hunting show.

3341
01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:53.280
This is what Ted Nugent does every week.

3342
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:56.520
He has a giant piece of land with all these animals.

3343
01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:57.331
Okay,

3344
01:31:57.331 --> 01:31:58.590
so he leaves some food out.

3345
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.800
It's got a camera man with him.

3346
01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:00.070
He

3347
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.210
<v 1>leaves some food out of the deer,</v>

3348
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:01.961
goes to the food.

3349
01:32:01.961 --> 01:32:02.910
He shoots it with an Arrow.

3350
01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:10.080
It's the spirit of the why all this wild man and nature and spirit and shooting

3351
01:32:10.751 --> 01:32:11.440
his pets.

3352
01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.190
Just go ahead and look through his album covers and you're looking at a fucking

3353
01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:15.790
wild man.

3354
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.911
Oh,

3355
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:16.810
he's a white dude.

3356
01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.460
Never done any drugs ever.

3357
01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:23.200
Like he looks like a wild eyed acid freak from the 60s and most of the shots.

3358
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:23.560
Yeah,

3359
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.030
he's a wild hunter.

3360
01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:26.283
He loves hunting.

3361
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:26.771
I mean,

3362
01:32:26.771 --> 01:32:26.951
look,

3363
01:32:26.951 --> 01:32:30.970
it's the way to procure food if you want all your animals in the yard and shoot

3364
01:32:30.971 --> 01:32:31.570
him,

3365
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:33.480
it's hard to preserve.

3366
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:33.971
Basically.

3367
01:32:33.971 --> 01:32:34.570
He has,

3368
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:34.840
yeah,

3369
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.980
he's got a game reserve,

3370
01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:36.830
which is I'm,

3371
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:38.620
I have no problem with it at all.

3372
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:38.831
I mean,

3373
01:32:38.831 --> 01:32:39.100
if,

3374
01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.800
if I had a problem with that and I didn't have a problem with farming,

3375
01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.460
I think that'd be incredibly grew up in Michigan and there's,

3376
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:44.840
I dunno,

3377
01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.530
there's like a hundred thousand accidents that happened because of deer in the

3378
01:32:47.531 --> 01:32:48.670
highways every year.

3379
01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:50.830
If you like the DNR,

3380
01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:53.070
they monitored that shit closely that,

3381
01:32:53.071 --> 01:32:53.791
you know what I mean,

3382
01:32:53.791 --> 01:32:55.090
that they're on top of that.

3383
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.880
How many animals we need to call the herd every year.

3384
01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.200
And if they're not like why disease happens to all of these or they came to Lyme

3385
01:33:02.201 --> 01:33:03.034
disease.

3386
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:04.140
Lyme disease is a,

3387
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:09.150
an east coast dude in Michigan disease up there when the deer population started

3388
01:33:10.481 --> 01:33:11.314
on the east coast,

3389
01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.310
when you have mild,

3390
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.740
mild winters and they don't,

3391
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.540
there's nothing else that's negating the herd.

3392
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:17.550
They,

3393
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:18.770
it gets ramp it.

3394
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.790
And there's a bunch of different diseases like that they'll like sweep through.

3395
01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.160
There's not really a time.

3396
01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:24.003
Other ones.

3397
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:24.371
Yeah.

3398
01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:24.971
It's interesting.

3399
01:33:24.971 --> 01:33:25.804
And you know,

3400
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.280
people don't want to accept that.

3401
01:33:27.281 --> 01:33:28.450
You have to call the herd.

3402
01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:31.180
That's a real outfox look at our life.

3403
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:31.631
We will,

3404
01:33:31.631 --> 01:33:31.901
you know,

3405
01:33:31.901 --> 01:33:32.730
live fucking human.

3406
01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:37.240
We've got damage driving yesterday near my house where this beautiful deer just

3407
01:33:37.241 --> 01:33:40.270
walking by the side of the road and I rolled down the windows and my kids are

3408
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:41.800
all looking at it at my wife's looking at it.

3409
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.371
We're like,

3410
01:33:42.371 --> 01:33:43.204
hey,

3411
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:44.890
the deer just standing there looking at us.

3412
01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.330
But you know,

3413
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.480
it's,

3414
01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:47.313
it's beautiful.

3415
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.640
I absolutely agree with you,

3416
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:49.870
with everybody that loves him.

3417
01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:51.880
But I'd shoot that thing and eat it too.

3418
01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.290
And it's nothing wrong with that.

3419
01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:54.400
Eat it.

3420
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.420
And I would revere it.

3421
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.380
And that's the reason why there's not many of them.

3422
01:33:59.410 --> 01:33:59.860
Okay.

3423
01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:02.500
There's a reason why I see one like only once every month or so.

3424
01:34:02.501 --> 01:34:05.200
It's cause there's a lot of fucking coyotes out there that eat their babies.

3425
01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:05.590
Yeah.

3426
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:06.760
That's the number one thing.

3427
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.461
You know,

3428
01:34:07.461 --> 01:34:07.740
when,

3429
01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.520
when people have coyotes near them,

3430
01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:12.610
they don't have any as many deer fauns cause they get those funds,

3431
01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:13.640
they get them when they're really young.

3432
01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:14.620
Coyotes are ruthless,

3433
01:34:14.621 --> 01:34:15.520
they're smart as hell.

3434
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.540
They're smart as hell.

3435
01:34:16.541 --> 01:34:17.470
And they smell it.

3436
01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:18.281
They can smell.

3437
01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:20.560
When a female has given birth,

3438
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:23.500
they can smell blood and they'll come and they'll call each other.

3439
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:25.780
And they're pretty sophisticated about their hunting tactics

3440
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:31.060
on ATVs with dogs running pit bulls.

3441
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:32.223
And uh,

3442
01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:33.191
my friend's dog,

3443
01:34:33.191 --> 01:34:36.940
there's a coyote that's just loping around a curve of this canyon.

3444
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:37.890
And,

3445
01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:38.530
and fucking,

3446
01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:39.191
it's teasing.

3447
01:34:39.191 --> 01:34:40.024
It

3448
01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:44.440
starts running after it and it's just keeping it,

3449
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:45.840
it could totally take it,

3450
01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:47.080
keeps it within distance.

3451
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.150
They round the corner and you hear,

3452
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:50.860
you hear it go crazy.

3453
01:34:50.861 --> 01:34:54.640
We fucking zip over and there's fucking eight coyotes that are surrounding the,

3454
01:34:54.641 --> 01:34:57.560
it's like it lures them in and then they fucking kill it.

3455
01:34:57.561 --> 01:34:58.220
It's crazy.

3456
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.230
<v 5>They bite in the back sides where all the arteries are.</v>

3457
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.490
What happened when you guys showed up?

3458
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.270
They split.

3459
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:03.260
Wow.

3460
01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.150
You're fucking haunters man.

3461
01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:07.670
They'll eat dogs for dinner in the park.

3462
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.980
They're in Griffith everywhere.

3463
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.191
Dude,

3464
01:35:10.191 --> 01:35:13.160
I've seen on Hollywood boulevard just opened down the street.

3465
01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:14.510
The first time I saw one,

3466
01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:15.410
I'll never forget it.

3467
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:16.550
I just started a,

3468
01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:18.160
I had an apartment that the oak woods,

3469
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:20.330
woods or furnished apartments.

3470
01:35:20.331 --> 01:35:21.170
When I first moved here,

3471
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:23.770
I didn't have my own place and I was driving into the,

3472
01:35:23.771 --> 01:35:24.130
uh,

3473
01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:28.670
it was on in Burbank and I'm about to make a turn and I look and I'm like,

3474
01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:30.320
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

3475
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:34.310
There's coyotes like walking down Burbank.

3476
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:35.061
Just tricky tee,

3477
01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:35.211
tee,

3478
01:35:35.211 --> 01:35:35.361
tee,

3479
01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:35.540
tee.

3480
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:38.600
They're creepy little claws could click clacking on the ground.

3481
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:38.901
I was like,

3482
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:40.190
this is fucking nuts.

3483
01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.061
But after a while,

3484
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:41.990
you get totally used to it.

3485
01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:43.400
There's a pack that lives in my neighborhood.

3486
01:35:43.401 --> 01:35:44.720
I see him at least once a week.

3487
01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:45.580
Just make,

3488
01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:46.413
there's like three of them.

3489
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:47.870
What do you think they sleep at night?

3490
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:48.560
I think.

3491
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.970
I think they only day in the day,

3492
01:35:49.971 --> 01:35:50.390
rather.

3493
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.801
The La,

3494
01:35:50.801 --> 01:35:52.490
the La River's right next door.

3495
01:35:52.491 --> 01:35:54.330
I have like a little burrow hang out.

3496
01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:57.320
They dig in a little hole somewhere and they just sleep in there.

3497
01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.753
Wow.

3498
01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.350
Like their dads are always in little like little gullies off this side where

3499
01:36:03.351 --> 01:36:04.040
there's little,

3500
01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.600
a little bit of shade and all that.

3501
01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:06.371
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3502
01:36:06.371 --> 01:36:08.080
They're creepy fucking animals.

3503
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:09.890
A lot of people think them to others.

3504
01:36:09.891 --> 01:36:10.571
So beautiful.

3505
01:36:10.571 --> 01:36:11.800
They will eat your baby.

3506
01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:13.000
No cheap.

3507
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:13.781
They're not nice.

3508
01:36:13.781 --> 01:36:14.221
They're the,

3509
01:36:14.221 --> 01:36:15.910
the cons of the animal kingdom.

3510
01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:17.680
They really creepy animals.

3511
01:36:17.890 --> 01:36:19.360
Coyotes are very creepy.

3512
01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.920
Killed a woman a couple of years ago.

3513
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:21.621
Coyotes.

3514
01:36:21.621 --> 01:36:22.120
Dude.

3515
01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:22.953
Yeah,

3516
01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.570
there's huge 19 year old singer.

3517
01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:26.560
Wow.

3518
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.810
Young girl with like a promising career.

3519
01:36:28.811 --> 01:36:32.680
Apparently she had some record contract and she used to go on these walks in the

3520
01:36:32.681 --> 01:36:33.250
woods,

3521
01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:33.521
you know,

3522
01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:34.470
calm down and his customers,

3523
01:36:34.471 --> 01:36:34.750
customers,

3524
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:35.210
Hungary,

3525
01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:36.610
fucking coyote live.

3526
01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.010
There's some big animals up there.

3527
01:36:39.011 --> 01:36:39.191
Like,

3528
01:36:39.191 --> 01:36:40.810
it's not like down here but you're in.

3529
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:43.750
Why don't want to say where you are but there you have bears where you live,

3530
01:36:43.751 --> 01:36:44.001
right?

3531
01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:44.834
Tory is fine.

3532
01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.360
Basically it's on an island.

3533
01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:47.500
It's mostly wild.

3534
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.940
It's fucking awesome.

3535
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:50.220
It's like a good standard there.

3536
01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:51.970
Once places incredible.

3537
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:56.040
We're about to like buy some acreage and a compound.

3538
01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.051
Absolutely man.

3539
01:36:57.051 --> 01:36:58.420
And we call it 15 pounds.

3540
01:36:58.421 --> 01:36:59.380
Two cows,

3541
01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:00.790
several sheeps and chickens.

3542
01:37:00.791 --> 01:37:01.480
We're going to do it.

3543
01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.141
It's a good idea.

3544
01:37:02.141 --> 01:37:03.700
I've been talking about doing that forever,

3545
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:04.930
about getting together with my friends,

3546
01:37:04.931 --> 01:37:06.970
getting some land and this just scroll around food.

3547
01:37:06.971 --> 01:37:07.900
Let's have some cows,

3548
01:37:07.901 --> 01:37:09.130
let's add some vegetables.

3549
01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.033
But I did the math.

3550
01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:12.300
I can definitely support two cows on them.

3551
01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:15.240
<v 5>We started Craig's just community wise,</v>

3552
01:37:15.241 --> 01:37:16.021
it's so important.

3553
01:37:16.021 --> 01:37:17.210
I think we started going from,

3554
01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:20.940
from this local co-op's and they start bringing vegetables in and yeah,

3555
01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.740
I get people together at the gym and I say,

3556
01:37:22.741 --> 01:37:25.800
how many guys want to go in on a car and we'll buy a local grass fed cow and

3557
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:27.840
that can really supporting that industry.

3558
01:37:28.770 --> 01:37:28.981
Man,

3559
01:37:28.981 --> 01:37:30.750
I've got a hundred pounds of meat in my freezer.

3560
01:37:30.751 --> 01:37:31.650
We just fed off.

3561
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:35.730
It comes like four bucks a pound or something instead of nothing and so much

3562
01:37:35.731 --> 01:37:36.564
better for you.

3563
01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.280
It's so crazy.

3564
01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:38.950
I'm like,

3565
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:39.120
you,

3566
01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.620
you like game.

3567
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:41.611
It's good dude.

3568
01:37:41.611 --> 01:37:43.550
It tastes very different than regular.

3569
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.980
Got To start to vote with your dollars at a certain point when your vote doesn't

3570
01:37:46.981 --> 01:37:47.850
matter anywhere.

3571
01:37:47.851 --> 01:37:50.460
It's like it matters where I fucking spend my money there.

3572
01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.550
This thing by caught that is bringing that up.

3573
01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.000
Yeah,

3574
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:54.641
and and it's,

3575
01:37:54.641 --> 01:37:55.380
it's,

3576
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.011
it's like at you,

3577
01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:58.600
you're impotent almost as it is.

3578
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.440
It's by caught I think B,

3579
01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.090
u y c o t,

3580
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:04.380
t and a.

3581
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:04.861
You can just,

3582
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:05.011
yeah,

3583
01:38:05.011 --> 01:38:07.490
you can get it wherever on your iPhone.

3584
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.630
I'm sure you can get it for androids also would by now,

3585
01:38:09.631 --> 01:38:10.530
but they're just,

3586
01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:11.191
and it,

3587
01:38:11.191 --> 01:38:14.040
you scan whatever it is and it looks up and it goes,

3588
01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:14.191
oh,

3589
01:38:14.191 --> 01:38:15.210
they support Monsanto.

3590
01:38:15.211 --> 01:38:15.721
They support.

3591
01:38:15.721 --> 01:38:16.141
Gmo Is,

3592
01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:17.550
they gave $500 million.

3593
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:20.880
It delineates who's supporting what.

3594
01:38:20.881 --> 01:38:21.330
You know?

3595
01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:22.230
That's a great idea.

3596
01:38:22.231 --> 01:38:23.340
We're going to talk about salmon,

3597
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:24.570
which is part of this bike,

3598
01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.290
and you really going to be able to change the way you can't do shit except with

3599
01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:28.741
your dollars.

3600
01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:30.870
And if you're not supporting local farmers pretty soon,

3601
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:31.770
that's going away,

3602
01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:32.311
right?

3603
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:32.671
They're already,

3604
01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:33.670
they're already suing people.

3605
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.970
Like they're talking about taking over the corn,

3606
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.170
the last May's that's really an in Mexico as if like,

3607
01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:43.050
that'll be hard to buy out a impoverished country.

3608
01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:44.520
Like of course they're going to take that over.

3609
01:38:44.521 --> 01:38:45.354
You know what I mean?

3610
01:38:45.850 --> 01:38:47.220
That's just the next that's happening.

3611
01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:49.560
So the last real corn,

3612
01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:49.830
what?

3613
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:52.890
Was there like wild or is it like there's the farmers that are there.

3614
01:38:52.891 --> 01:38:54.330
All our seeds are in Mexico.

3615
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:55.430
All our seeds everywhere.

3616
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.101
Subjugated.

3617
01:38:56.101 --> 01:38:58.050
So even as local farmers in America,

3618
01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.150
you're going to be at the,

3619
01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:01.290
you're going to be at the mercy,

3620
01:39:01.291 --> 01:39:03.970
you're going to be growing seeds that are genetically modified seeds.

3621
01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:04.160
They're like,

3622
01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:04.470
well,

3623
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:06.570
it's already too far to turn back really,

3624
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:08.450
because they,

3625
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:13.290
they've sued everybody else out of existence and their seeds are so prolific

3626
01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:14.220
that they'll go.

3627
01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:17.700
Then they're engineered to dominate other strains and that that's just what will

3628
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:18.750
happen with all grains,

3629
01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:20.250
with all grown vegetables.

3630
01:39:20.251 --> 01:39:24.000
Eventually with salmon now they made it or not modified salmon that are on

3631
01:39:24.001 --> 01:39:25.950
shelves that you might've eaten unbeknownst to you.

3632
01:39:26.630 --> 01:39:30.540
It's really scary because the deal is if the pollen crosses into your field and

3633
01:39:30.541 --> 01:39:31.230
then,

3634
01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:35.100
exactly and what's happening in the pollen does cross in the field and then they

3635
01:39:35.101 --> 01:39:36.200
proved that with the,

3636
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:40.590
the Supreme Court supports Monsonto in that way is that they go,

3637
01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:41.790
well we found this in your field.

3638
01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:42.061
He's like,

3639
01:39:42.061 --> 01:39:42.361
yeah,

3640
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:43.250
cross pollinated.

3641
01:39:43.251 --> 01:39:44.400
It's my grain or whatever.

3642
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.230
I used it and yeah,

3643
01:39:46.231 --> 01:39:47.310
they polluted my thing.

3644
01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:47.611
No,

3645
01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:47.791
no.

3646
01:39:47.791 --> 01:39:51.810
You're using their seeds and those seeds are trademark and you're sued out of

3647
01:39:51.811 --> 01:39:52.650
existence.

3648
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.770
And then when sample it takes that one over and that's happened all across

3649
01:39:55.771 --> 01:39:56.221
America.

3650
01:39:56.221 --> 01:39:57.260
They're trying to do it in India.

3651
01:39:57.270 --> 01:40:00.600
India is one of the only places that has a class action lawsuit against the

3652
01:40:00.601 --> 01:40:02.310
independent company.

3653
01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.040
A corporation like Monsanto.

3654
01:40:04.041 --> 01:40:04.120
Well,

3655
01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.400
they just lost in Brazil.

3656
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.311
Is that right?

3657
01:40:06.311 --> 01:40:07.800
And lost a huge settlement in Brazil.

3658
01:40:08.730 --> 01:40:11.700
Brazilian farmers were so compromised here,

3659
01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:11.930
but,

3660
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:13.830
but that's the last thing I'm doing is I'm going,

3661
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:13.981
well,

3662
01:40:13.981 --> 01:40:18.600
I just have to go local and in my community with my voice to go here.

3663
01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:19.020
Here's,

3664
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:22.350
here's options that we have and you need to be cognizant of where you're

3665
01:40:22.351 --> 01:40:23.190
spending your dollars.

3666
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:23.611
Interesting.

3667
01:40:23.611 --> 01:40:25.470
Is Cara Santa Maria who was on here?

3668
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:25.710
No,

3669
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:29.820
she's a former science person for the Huffington Post.

3670
01:40:29.821 --> 01:40:30.200
What's the,

3671
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.410
her total title?

3672
01:40:31.411 --> 01:40:32.210
Brian,

3673
01:40:32.210 --> 01:40:32.740
uh,

3674
01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:33.573
visor or whatever.

3675
01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.610
I don't think she had whatever she was,

3676
01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:36.360
whatever the,

3677
01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.200
what was the name of it?

3678
01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:37.921
Whatever she was.

3679
01:40:37.921 --> 01:40:38.754
Yeah,

3680
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.080
whatever scientist.

3681
01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:40.943
She's very smart.

3682
01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:44.550
She thinks that the only way people can survive on this planet with the

3683
01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:47.280
population that we have now is with genetically modified food.

3684
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:51.150
She said she understands that Monsanto may be illegal or rather unethical and

3685
01:40:51.151 --> 01:40:51.870
evil,

3686
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:54.100
but that genetically modified foods

3687
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.260
<v 0>are probably imperative for the survival of the race.</v>

3688
01:40:56.690 --> 01:40:59.820
<v 3>If you believe farming is the core of how to feed people,</v>

3689
01:40:59.821 --> 01:41:02.900
you might make that argument but it doesn't account for topsoil distraction.

3690
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:06.510
If the only way we're going to make people survive is by pushing agriculture out

3691
01:41:06.511 --> 01:41:10.080
from being a centralized activity to being a decentralized activity that has a

3692
01:41:10.081 --> 01:41:10.980
resilience built in.

3693
01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.430
We're doing monoculture everywhere and GMOs make that even worse.

3694
01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:17.450
So you genetically modify something and then a new blight that's,

3695
01:41:17.490 --> 01:41:20.250
that's good for that one strain that's there and you're dead.

3696
01:41:20.251 --> 01:41:21.084
The whole

3697
01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:23.063
<v 0>dies.</v>

3698
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:28.570
The other issue is that we're trying to dominate the actual natural corn and the

3699
01:41:28.831 --> 01:41:33.831
natural non genetically modified plants by allowing their pollen to do to get

3700
01:41:34.951 --> 01:41:38.360
into these farmers and then suing them for it and that just by fact that there

3701
01:41:38.361 --> 01:41:39.570
are suing these guys for it.

3702
01:41:39.571 --> 01:41:42.420
The reason why they're doing that is because they're trying to dominate them and

3703
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:43.303
tick

3704
01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:45.180
them off the market and they,

3705
01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:47.760
they use the reason like gangster tactics.

3706
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:48.630
Beer for sure.

3707
01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:49.571
But the,

3708
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:50.610
the problem with,

3709
01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:51.713
um,

3710
01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:53.760
<v 6>the scientists lady that you just,</v>

3711
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:53.970
it,

3712
01:41:53.970 --> 01:41:54.803
it's,

3713
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.390
it's,

3714
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.870
it's,

3715
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:56.501
it's almost,

3716
01:41:56.501 --> 01:41:57.334
it's like,

3717
01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:00.740
it's like that hippie thing where like in,

3718
01:42:00.741 --> 01:42:01.041
in,

3719
01:42:01.041 --> 01:42:01.841
in public schools,

3720
01:42:01.841 --> 01:42:02.380
they're saying,

3721
01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:02.561
no,

3722
01:42:02.561 --> 01:42:03.430
everybody wins.

3723
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:04.091
You know what I mean?

3724
01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:04.811
If there's a race,

3725
01:42:04.811 --> 01:42:06.160
like everybody wins and,

3726
01:42:06.210 --> 01:42:06.520
right,

3727
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.940
and they're trying to diminish and mitigate anybody from having a bad feeling

3728
01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:10.690
about that.

3729
01:42:10.690 --> 01:42:11.021
And then,

3730
01:42:11.021 --> 01:42:11.411
I'm sorry,

3731
01:42:11.411 --> 01:42:13.090
you turned 17 you get out of school,

3732
01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:13.601
fucking,

3733
01:42:13.601 --> 01:42:16.750
you find out that people lose all over the place and you also,

3734
01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:17.900
if everybody wins in,

3735
01:42:17.901 --> 01:42:18.281
in your,

3736
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:19.180
in your construct,

3737
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:20.350
you never get to learn that,

3738
01:42:20.351 --> 01:42:21.400
well maybe I suck at running,

3739
01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.960
but I'm great at the Tuba or whatever.

3740
01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.670
Nobody finds their own beauty in that.

3741
01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:29.410
And so you're trying to make homogenize fucking people and that's disgusting.

3742
01:42:29.411 --> 01:42:31.270
And loathsome at one regard.

3743
01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:34.120
People need to learn what that hurt and what that sting and what getting punched

3744
01:42:34.121 --> 01:42:34.954
in the mouth is like.

3745
01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:36.010
The other thing is,

3746
01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.510
is that with that,

3747
01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:37.721
oh,

3748
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:38.554
well not every,

3749
01:42:38.710 --> 01:42:39.700
I hear that shit all the time.

3750
01:42:39.701 --> 01:42:41.080
Grass Fed isn't sustainable.

3751
01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:43.240
I heard that shit from a woman that's like,

3752
01:42:43.241 --> 01:42:43.331
well,

3753
01:42:43.331 --> 01:42:45.460
I'm just trying to lessen my,

3754
01:42:45.461 --> 01:42:45.880
uh,

3755
01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.470
my carbon footprint on the earth.

3756
01:42:47.471 --> 01:42:48.304
And she works for,

3757
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.900
uh,

3758
01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.670
like some environmental agency in Maine or something.

3759
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:52.990
In the meantime,

3760
01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:58.020
she's in fertile and gets all kinds of shit to have two kids and spent thousands

3761
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:59.110
or tens of thousands of dollars.

3762
01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:02.410
Having a child is one of the most brutal things that you can impact the

3763
01:43:02.411 --> 01:43:03.244
environmental with.

3764
01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:05.290
I'm not saying it's bad all you mothers or whatever,

3765
01:43:05.291 --> 01:43:08.710
but I'm saying that if nature is not giving you that and for you to force that

3766
01:43:08.711 --> 01:43:10.740
and force fuck your way into the fucking,

3767
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:12.190
into that kind of stream,

3768
01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.550
but be against grass fed fucking cows,

3769
01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.713
fuck yourself.

3770
01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.590
That's the hardest thing to enforce her.

3771
01:43:19.591 --> 01:43:20.680
Her whole thing is,

3772
01:43:20.681 --> 01:43:21.514
is people,

3773
01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:21.910
you,

3774
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:24.370
they have the choice right now to eat grass fed or not.

3775
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:24.790
Right.

3776
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:25.960
And they go to Taco Bell.

3777
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.560
Yeah.

3778
01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:27.850
So that being the case,

3779
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:30.310
not showing the herd,

3780
01:43:30.311 --> 01:43:33.030
it's a time and the money and not like there's a guy who,

3781
01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:33.371
well,

3782
01:43:33.371 --> 01:43:34.210
what's the money issue?

3783
01:43:34.211 --> 01:43:38.800
Because my food costs less than anybody that's eating in any kind of,

3784
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:39.420
um,

3785
01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.253
common way.

3786
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.850
Like I can buy meat at $4 a pound.

3787
01:43:42.851 --> 01:43:43.684
So what do we call?

3788
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.940
<v 0>Right.</v>

3789
01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.080
But you're buying it in bulk,

3790
01:43:45.081 --> 01:43:47.110
a lot of sugar and have the ability to do that yet

3791
01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:49.100
<v 3>250 bucks for a freezer at Costco.</v>

3792
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:49.890
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

3793
01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:50.790
B and when,

3794
01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:54.470
and when titty bars are getting supported all over the place and dudes or drop

3795
01:43:54.471 --> 01:43:57.050
in a couple of hundred dollars in a titty bar to leave with a boner,

3796
01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:58.280
I'm pretty sure they could,

3797
01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:00.140
they could put that into a cow,

3798
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:00.471
man.

3799
01:44:00.471 --> 01:44:01.490
It was kind of get grass fed,

3800
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:04.183
you know what I mean?

3801
01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.110
And so like that whole thing,

3802
01:44:06.111 --> 01:44:06.530
if you're,

3803
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:08.630
if you're talking about people that don't want to achieve,

3804
01:44:08.631 --> 01:44:09.980
it's like a guy came on and he said,

3805
01:44:09.981 --> 01:44:10.430
hey,

3806
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:11.150
ask Dave,

3807
01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:12.590
he hit me up on Twitter and he goes,

3808
01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:14.030
ask about,

3809
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.923
um,

3810
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:17.870
at what cost do you want to optimize yourself?

3811
01:44:17.871 --> 01:44:18.470
And I'm like,

3812
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:19.520
what's the deficits?

3813
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:21.350
Like not everybody wants to get better.

3814
01:44:21.351 --> 01:44:22.790
Not Everybody wants high performance,

3815
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:24.200
but if I'm start,

3816
01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:25.430
decay is real.

3817
01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.050
So the deficit is death.

3818
01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.210
The deficit is,

3819
01:44:28.211 --> 01:44:29.480
is that I get worse off.

3820
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:33.530
And so why wouldn't I want to optimize the years that I have and prolong them if

3821
01:44:33.531 --> 01:44:35.720
I can do it and mitigate any of the,

3822
01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:36.950
the detrimental.

3823
01:44:36.951 --> 01:44:37.200
Yeah.

3824
01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.320
<v 3>So genetically modified foods are bad.</v>

3825
01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:40.483
<v 6>MMM.</v>

3826
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:43.363
<v 3>She was wrong.</v>

3827
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.940
Well,

3828
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:48.920
I think that she is shortsighted and a lot of my career has actually been

3829
01:44:48.921 --> 01:44:50.180
designing green.

3830
01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:51.370
That's what she's advocating.

3831
01:44:51.371 --> 01:44:52.204
There you go.

3832
01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:53.540
That's over nature.

3833
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:54.820
Is that what just seems like about,

3834
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:58.280
it seems like wanting to believe in science over nature when there's all these

3835
01:44:58.281 --> 01:45:02.630
natural foods that are already here that acts like a healthy and sustainable and

3836
01:45:02.631 --> 01:45:03.464
resilient.

3837
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:08.720
And I built resilient systems like cloud computing for living for many years.

3838
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:11.600
And one of the things you do is you make things a little bit different so that

3839
01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:13.340
if a hacker gets these ones,

3840
01:45:13.341 --> 01:45:14.360
they can't get these ones.

3841
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:18.200
So what we're doing with potatoes and corn and soybeans is we're just

3842
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:19.250
monocropping.

3843
01:45:19.251 --> 01:45:22.280
So all it takes is one thing and they're all gone.

3844
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:26.000
We've gotten rid of like three quarters of the domesticated species that we used

3845
01:45:26.001 --> 01:45:27.320
to work with in terms of seats.

3846
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:28.070
They're just gone.

3847
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:29.090
We don't have him anymore.

3848
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.440
And it used to be that,

3849
01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:30.561
you know,

3850
01:45:30.561 --> 01:45:35.450
there's a thousand varieties of potatoes that's insane and it's just

3851
01:45:35.451 --> 01:45:36.290
unconscionable.

3852
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:37.280
It's got to stop

3853
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:40.800
<v 6>you talk about what the unknown things are there in the rain forest that are</v>

3854
01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:41.634
getting cut down.

3855
01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:45.060
Like all the different plants that we have that we haven't even classified yet

3856
01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:47.400
that are being destroyed on a daily basis.

3857
01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:50.100
Like there's so much shit on this earth that we don't even know him.

3858
01:45:50.370 --> 01:45:52.170
And for the arrogance to come in and say,

3859
01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:54.360
we need to homogenize all grains,

3860
01:45:54.361 --> 01:45:54.841
meats,

3861
01:45:54.841 --> 01:45:57.990
and everything so that we can feed a whole population in 20 years from now at

3862
01:45:57.991 --> 01:45:59.790
the rate that we're growing and expanding.

3863
01:45:59.970 --> 01:46:01.170
That's so ridiculous.

3864
01:46:01.171 --> 01:46:02.850
And it's such an arrogant viewpoint.

3865
01:46:03.110 --> 01:46:03.420
It,

3866
01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:05.650
it's coming from such a place of scarcity also.

3867
01:46:05.670 --> 01:46:07.710
It's like even consciously in my own life,

3868
01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:08.940
talking about people,

3869
01:46:08.941 --> 01:46:09.570
uh,

3870
01:46:09.570 --> 01:46:10.110
and,

3871
01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:11.280
and what changes are and,

3872
01:46:11.281 --> 01:46:11.520
and,

3873
01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.900
and as long as I'm going,

3874
01:46:12.901 --> 01:46:13.591
I need more.

3875
01:46:13.591 --> 01:46:14.191
I need this,

3876
01:46:14.191 --> 01:46:14.701
I need that.

3877
01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:15.780
I need more money or whatever.

3878
01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:18.150
When I'm thinking of that way as a kid,

3879
01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:20.100
it's like there's never enough,

3880
01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.240
but when I go,

3881
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:23.280
I need to make my boss some more money.

3882
01:46:23.670 --> 01:46:25.470
Like I need to make this business run better.

3883
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:26.311
When I did that,

3884
01:46:26.311 --> 01:46:29.100
fucking things grew for me crazy exponentially.

3885
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.651
Uh,

3886
01:46:29.651 --> 01:46:32.280
somebody was giving me a ride to the airport from the airport the other day and

3887
01:46:32.281 --> 01:46:32.850
they're like,

3888
01:46:32.850 --> 01:46:33.061
oh,

3889
01:46:33.061 --> 01:46:33.690
well these,

3890
01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:35.190
these podcasts that you do,

3891
01:46:35.191 --> 01:46:36.510
or when you go and speak at schools,

3892
01:46:36.511 --> 01:46:36.810
Tate,

3893
01:46:36.810 --> 01:46:38.550
or when you run this or like,

3894
01:46:38.730 --> 01:46:39.780
does that stuff giving you money?

3895
01:46:39.781 --> 01:46:40.110
And I'm like,

3896
01:46:40.110 --> 01:46:40.800
well,

3897
01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.630
not in a conventional sense,

3898
01:46:42.631 --> 01:46:44.550
but I guess existentially perhaps.

3899
01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:45.441
But the thing is,

3900
01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:46.170
is like,

3901
01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.850
I don't want anybody that's after money.

3902
01:46:47.970 --> 01:46:49.970
I want people that are after a revolution.

3903
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.540
I want people that are after a whole movement that's moving in a positive,

3904
01:46:53.541 --> 01:46:54.440
progressive manner.

3905
01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:54.950
You know what I mean?

3906
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:55.061
And,

3907
01:46:55.061 --> 01:46:55.241
and,

3908
01:46:55.241 --> 01:46:55.430
and,

3909
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.730
and,

3910
01:46:55.730 --> 01:46:56.401
and that stuff would,

3911
01:46:56.401 --> 01:46:59.990
that homogenization of America or of the world is not,

3912
01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:01.600
it's just creating more borders and,

3913
01:47:01.610 --> 01:47:02.450
and like David said,

3914
01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:04.310
if there's a strain that comes up,

3915
01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:05.990
then that is fucking wiped out.

3916
01:47:05.991 --> 01:47:06.651
And now what,

3917
01:47:06.651 --> 01:47:10.160
because I was so arrogant to think that there was scarcity and that I needed to

3918
01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:12.020
control this and get my grips on it.

3919
01:47:12.021 --> 01:47:12.320
It's like,

3920
01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:12.921
it's crazy.

3921
01:47:12.921 --> 01:47:14.840
Go stand by the ocean and you ain't shit.

3922
01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:15.501
You know what I mean?

3923
01:47:15.501 --> 01:47:17.150
We're all moving in a whole different way.

3924
01:47:17.210 --> 01:47:21.560
It's a revolution against being mediocre because here's the thing about this.

3925
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.581
How dare you,

3926
01:47:22.581 --> 01:47:23.780
at what costs optimize.

3927
01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.750
You're going to live your whole life being mediocre when you could have been

3928
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:27.800
awesome and great.

3929
01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.750
Isn't that a much bigger waist than what it's like spitting in the face of God.

3930
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:34.490
Whatever you believe in.

3931
01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:35.420
It's like,

3932
01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:35.961
so you're,

3933
01:47:35.961 --> 01:47:40.190
you've just okay with not not succeeding and with not showing anybody else

3934
01:47:40.191 --> 01:47:41.420
behind you how to get better.

3935
01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:42.280
It's like when you,

3936
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:43.910
when you go on rants and you're talking about,

3937
01:47:43.911 --> 01:47:44.091
you know,

3938
01:47:44.091 --> 01:47:47.310
you've got a bunch of mediocre people that have mediocre kids and everybody's

3939
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:50.450
mimicking that don't have a responsibility,

3940
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.810
not only for like whether it's for my fitness or to protect somebody weaker than

3941
01:47:53.811 --> 01:47:54.770
me or whatever it is,

3942
01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.400
but to be the best that I can be so that you can show the next generation.

3943
01:47:58.401 --> 01:48:01.550
So it's like when Jesse Owens runs and he's the fastest man in the world and

3944
01:48:01.551 --> 01:48:01.971
tell people,

3945
01:48:01.971 --> 01:48:02.691
see that they go,

3946
01:48:02.691 --> 01:48:03.530
that's the fastest Ma.

3947
01:48:03.531 --> 01:48:04.370
And then the next year,

3948
01:48:04.371 --> 01:48:05.630
what somebody is faster.

3949
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:08.090
And now with the Internet and the progressiveness of all of this,

3950
01:48:08.091 --> 01:48:08.960
with these ideas,

3951
01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:14.260
it's crazy to think that I would be anything except optimized like ridiculous.

3952
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:17.630
I have Koi says you owe it to the world to kick ass.

3953
01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:18.620
And if you're not doing that,

3954
01:48:18.621 --> 01:48:20.180
it's not even about doing it for yourself.

3955
01:48:20.210 --> 01:48:21.920
It's you owe that to your community.

3956
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.020
Do a shit for the world.

3957
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:29.050
We show my community [inaudible] call bullshit on that.

3958
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:32.150
I'm getting up and going to the gym for the community.

3959
01:48:33.050 --> 01:48:33.883
I'm not,

3960
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:35.360
I'm a grown ass man.

3961
01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:38.480
Pull Shit Shit for me to sell through and sift for yourself.

3962
01:48:38.481 --> 01:48:39.530
But you owe it to them.

3963
01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:40.580
I don't know.

3964
01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:41.120
Well,

3965
01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:42.020
you know I'm fucking around.

3966
01:48:42.021 --> 01:48:42.410
Yeah,

3967
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:43.243
absolutely.

3968
01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.031
Realistically,

3969
01:48:44.031 --> 01:48:44.341
you know,

3970
01:48:44.341 --> 01:48:45.174
Oh shit.

3971
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:47.630
I said Buck.

3972
01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:53.810
I think that the idea that there's a separation between us and that is that is

3973
01:48:53.811 --> 01:48:55.640
the thing and I know you know it's bullshit too.

3974
01:48:55.641 --> 01:48:59.990
It's like it's like if we're all vibrating at a higher level of consciousness

3975
01:48:59.991 --> 01:49:02.840
that is in sync with whatever the universal vibration is,

3976
01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:05.900
the more pot that there's not hiccups in the gears.

3977
01:49:05.901 --> 01:49:06.734
You know what I mean?

3978
01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.170
And,

3979
01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:08.120
and there's not like,

3980
01:49:08.121 --> 01:49:12.110
it's that illusion of separation that keeps us all in this fucking muted state

3981
01:49:12.111 --> 01:49:15.710
of consciousness that creates road rage that creates like the idea that I need

3982
01:49:15.711 --> 01:49:18.320
to control the ocean or the fucking crops or whatever.

3983
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:20.270
Meditation is so important because when you start,

3984
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:21.440
you start feeling all that stuff,

3985
01:49:21.441 --> 01:49:23.290
you realize that you're not as a separate,

3986
01:49:23.291 --> 01:49:24.124
I'm thinking

3987
01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.450
<v 0>people need to hear from people like yourself or either one of you who have</v>

3988
01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:34.430
experience ups and downs and have some idea of what it's changed in their life

3989
01:49:34.431 --> 01:49:35.510
that's been beneficial.

3990
01:49:35.511 --> 01:49:39.330
And that way a person listening can learn without having to go through and the

3991
01:49:39.331 --> 01:49:41.550
mistakes that I or you might've made.

3992
01:49:41.551 --> 01:49:42.310
So huge.

3993
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:43.490
It's huge.

3994
01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.700
It's very important.

3995
01:49:44.850 --> 01:49:48.040
<v 6>It's unfair that I had to spend $300,000 and then</v>

3996
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.310
<v 3>I could spend $300,000 on all the stuff.</v>

3997
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:52.780
<v 6>So that right now like that it's,</v>

3998
01:49:52.781 --> 01:49:53.080
it's,

3999
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.280
it's incredible.

4000
01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:55.201
I mean the,

4001
01:49:55.201 --> 01:49:55.390
the,

4002
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:57.910
the change that that's made and then that the Internet's made and,

4003
01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:58.661
and Joe,

4004
01:49:58.661 --> 01:49:58.960
like,

4005
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:02.680
like I would have never started a podcast without like you go and dude,

4006
01:50:02.681 --> 01:50:03.160
you've got to,

4007
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:06.400
you've got to make people privy to whatever conversations and madness and

4008
01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:07.563
enlightenment.

4009
01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:08.950
And then I thought too,

4010
01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:09.161
man,

4011
01:50:09.161 --> 01:50:11.540
when I was talking to coach the,

4012
01:50:11.670 --> 01:50:12.401
a couple of weeks ago,

4013
01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:14.350
I did one with Mr Greg Jackson.

4014
01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:15.670
There was fantastic.

4015
01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:16.120
And,

4016
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:18.730
and I would have never maybe seen Greg again or see him in passing,

4017
01:50:18.731 --> 01:50:22.090
but to go and set aside time for conversations with people that you admire and

4018
01:50:22.091 --> 01:50:23.380
that you revere and that you're like,

4019
01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:23.861
oh,

4020
01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:26.200
this is like fuck what a opportunity that is.

4021
01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:28.870
And you get to put it out there so other people can experience it too.

4022
01:50:28.871 --> 01:50:31.330
So these people that had been so formative in your life,

4023
01:50:31.331 --> 01:50:31.640
right?

4024
01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:31.911
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

4025
01:50:31.911 --> 01:50:33.750
We're getting people that you meet and talk to.

4026
01:50:34.850 --> 01:50:35.683
Um,

4027
01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:37.580
I don't know where we were when we went on this,

4028
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:39.080
this little turn until illness,

4029
01:50:39.081 --> 01:50:39.914
but um,

4030
01:50:40.670 --> 01:50:41.503
yeah,

4031
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:46.190
the idea that we could do a better job than nature itself.

4032
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:51.110
The idea that a Monsanto owning life forms is a good idea.

4033
01:50:51.150 --> 01:50:52.610
There's a couple of patent plan.

4034
01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:53.713
It's worse than mine.

4035
01:50:53.770 --> 01:50:55.490
What's the Monsanto cause they own you.

4036
01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.120
Yeah,

4037
01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:56.750
because right,

4038
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:59.420
right now the human genome is essentially all patented,

4039
01:50:59.421 --> 01:50:59.521
right?

4040
01:50:59.521 --> 01:50:59.810
Yeah.

4041
01:50:59.810 --> 01:51:00.780
<v 6>Well remember when they,</v>

4042
01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:01.903
there was a guy,

4043
01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:04.640
there's a guy last year that got charged with,

4044
01:51:04.641 --> 01:51:05.150
uh,

4045
01:51:05.150 --> 01:51:08.450
by the DEA with transporting drugs because he was saying there's,

4046
01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.330
there's a thing in boulder or somewhere like that where you can do stem cell

4047
01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:15.200
shit and they're saying you're taking your own body across state lines.

4048
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:18.710
That's a fucking federal crime because you're going with the intention of taking

4049
01:51:18.711 --> 01:51:19.550
your stem cells out.

4050
01:51:19.670 --> 01:51:20.990
That's a controlled substance,

4051
01:51:20.991 --> 01:51:21.291
right?

4052
01:51:21.291 --> 01:51:22.124
That's a drug.

4053
01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:26.360
And so they fucking charged this poor cock sucker with transporting illegal

4054
01:51:26.361 --> 01:51:29.780
drugs across state lines because they want to stop that fucking yeah.

4055
01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:32.250
<v 3>Progress and get this like Angelina Jolie,</v>

4056
01:51:32.251 --> 01:51:32.580
you know,

4057
01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:32.960
she,

4058
01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:36.330
she had her breasts amputated because she was afraid she might get cancer.

4059
01:51:36.570 --> 01:51:39.120
Now there's a lot about epigenetics,

4060
01:51:39.121 --> 01:51:42.120
a lot of research I've done there about how your environment affects your cancer

4061
01:51:42.121 --> 01:51:42.870
risk.

4062
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:44.940
And I'm sure she'd thought she was doing the right thing.

4063
01:51:44.941 --> 01:51:46.050
But here's the thing.

4064
01:51:46.051 --> 01:51:48.870
The company that does the test for Brc one and two,

4065
01:51:48.871 --> 01:51:51.210
the jeans that she has that put her at high risk,

4066
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:52.950
they own those jeans.

4067
01:51:52.951 --> 01:51:54.090
They patented them.

4068
01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:57.690
They can restrict anyone else from doing research on those genes,

4069
01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.910
even to prove that those genes don't do anything.

4070
01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:01.710
What I'm not joking.

4071
01:52:01.711 --> 01:52:02.371
The company does that.

4072
01:52:02.371 --> 01:52:06.990
They make like $1 billion a year that's off breast cancer genes and no one else

4073
01:52:06.991 --> 01:52:09.630
is allowed there unless they say so because they own the gene.

4074
01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:14.860
They make $1 billion a year off breast cancer genes off the tests for four to

4075
01:52:16.711 --> 01:52:20.720
$5,000 to test you for this BRC hygiene that they've identified.

4076
01:52:20.730 --> 01:52:23.200
They own the testing that they own,

4077
01:52:23.201 --> 01:52:24.330
the use of that gene.

4078
01:52:24.331 --> 01:52:24.930
And here's the thing,

4079
01:52:24.930 --> 01:52:27.600
I sequenced my whole human genome on 23 and me,

4080
01:52:27.601 --> 01:52:28.770
it's 99 bucks,

4081
01:52:29.130 --> 01:52:29.910
right?

4082
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:32.460
So why is it that the machines have gone down in price,

4083
01:52:32.461 --> 01:52:33.300
but it's so expensive?

4084
01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:35.130
It's because they have a monopoly on it.

4085
01:52:35.250 --> 01:52:36.150
It's patented.

4086
01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:40.830
So there's a huge percentage of the human genome is patented and basically owned

4087
01:52:40.831 --> 01:52:43.290
by companies and it's only owned because the supreme court said,

4088
01:52:43.291 --> 01:52:44.170
so are you,

4089
01:52:44.171 --> 01:52:44.890
it's got to stop.

4090
01:52:44.890 --> 01:52:49.460
Are you bullshit on the numbers of people that will get breast cancer because

4091
01:52:49.461 --> 01:52:50.360
they have this gene?

4092
01:52:50.361 --> 01:52:53.300
Do you think that that is something that they have put out there to get people

4093
01:52:53.301 --> 01:52:54.134
to test for it?

4094
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.930
I think that there is a risk associated with the gene,

4095
01:52:56.931 --> 01:52:59.000
but that the environmental risk trumps that.

4096
01:52:59.001 --> 01:53:00.360
If that's the core of epigenetics,

4097
01:53:00.361 --> 01:53:01.460
that's the core of my whole book here.

4098
01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:06.460
It's the environment controls what genes get methylated and methylation is

4099
01:53:06.591 --> 01:53:08.630
basically when RNA comes into copy DNA,

4100
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:11.810
it has to be able to methylate things and the environment controls what the RNA

4101
01:53:11.811 --> 01:53:12.710
can copy.

4102
01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:16.130
Environment meaning specific chemicals in the air or environment,

4103
01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:17.660
meaning chemical weapons,

4104
01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.300
love relationships,

4105
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.991
all of it.

4106
01:53:20.991 --> 01:53:22.220
So how stressed are you filled?

4107
01:53:22.221 --> 01:53:23.054
How stressed are you?

4108
01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.153
So in fact,

4109
01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:28.160
the main pillars in the safety for making like optimize children who like have

4110
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:30.050
every opportunity you can give them,

4111
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:31.970
you need to control your own stress.

4112
01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:34.940
The light you're exposed to is part of your environment.

4113
01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.930
The smog gear exposed to everything goes in and changes your,

4114
01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.570
your genes and it changes the amount of very frequent basis.

4115
01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.810
And how exactly does that work for the lay person who doesn't understand genes?

4116
01:53:44.811 --> 01:53:46.010
How does it change your genes?

4117
01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.491
You Imagine?

4118
01:53:46.491 --> 01:53:50.090
There's like a firewall around your DNA and your DNA stores,

4119
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.340
the set of things,

4120
01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:52.400
your potential.

4121
01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:55.130
So there's a firewall and your RNA comes into copy.

4122
01:53:55.131 --> 01:53:57.920
That DNA when it tries to come in and copy of the DNA,

4123
01:53:57.921 --> 01:54:00.740
it can only copy what it can get past the firewall to see.

4124
01:54:00.741 --> 01:54:02.540
And the firewall is configured by the environment.

4125
01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.380
So it turns out you're exposome the set of everything you're exposed to,

4126
01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.580
your emotions,

4127
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:08.623
your pollution,

4128
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:09.463
your toxins.

4129
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:10.670
When you exercise,

4130
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.570
when you sleep,

4131
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:12.680
the quality of your sleep,

4132
01:54:12.710 --> 01:54:14.780
everything that changes these things.

4133
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:18.410
So you might have a statistically higher chance of getting breast cancer from

4134
01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:20.060
BRC one or BRC too.

4135
01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.680
But can you account for that by going to sleep earlier by eating things that

4136
01:54:24.681 --> 01:54:25.940
don't contribute to cancer?

4137
01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.430
Like what are the environmental things you can do to balance risk?

4138
01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:32.180
So what Angelina Jolie did as she ignored the thing she could do to balance

4139
01:54:32.181 --> 01:54:32.451
risk.

4140
01:54:32.451 --> 01:54:33.350
As far as we can tell,

4141
01:54:33.351 --> 01:54:34.640
I don't know Angelina Jolie,

4142
01:54:34.641 --> 01:54:35.474
I've never met her,

4143
01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:39.800
but she went ahead and made this relatively drastic decision.

4144
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.251
Like,

4145
01:54:40.251 --> 01:54:43.340
I can tell you there's x amount of chance of me getting armed cancer,

4146
01:54:43.341 --> 01:54:44.690
but I'm not cutting off my arms.

4147
01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:45.560
Right.

4148
01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:47.150
And seriously the line of thinking,

4149
01:54:47.151 --> 01:54:50.180
it says you amputate things that might get sick instead of monitoring them and

4150
01:54:50.181 --> 01:54:52.310
doing everything in your power to keep them from getting sick.

4151
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:53.480
That seems broken.

4152
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.890
There's a,

4153
01:54:53.890 --> 01:54:57.680
there's a school of thought on some forms of cancer that were like,

4154
01:54:57.681 --> 01:55:01.250
some families just have some on avoidable form of cancer.

4155
01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:02.323
I mean

4156
01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:06.620
she got breast implants and that was the thing that she put out to the press.

4157
01:55:06.621 --> 01:55:07.454
She says,

4158
01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:11.360
I did this as a precautionary thing because everybody in my family got breast

4159
01:55:11.361 --> 01:55:12.194
cancer and I was like,

4160
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:14.300
whatever reason you did it for awesome.

4161
01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:16.790
Did she really say that that was her?

4162
01:55:16.791 --> 01:55:17.624
That was her press.

4163
01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:21.170
She was probably afraid of judgment of the,

4164
01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:21.581
you know,

4165
01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:24.260
all you're trying to augment yourself in this regard or that regard.

4166
01:55:24.261 --> 01:55:25.094
And so she said you,

4167
01:55:25.630 --> 01:55:26.000
I was like,

4168
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:26.870
that's legit man.

4169
01:55:26.871 --> 01:55:27.704
Whatever the reason.

4170
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:29.310
So there's a whole class of cancers that,

4171
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:31.370
that form after you're injured,

4172
01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.520
so where there's like a scar or an abrasion.

4173
01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:39.640
So even the act of doing a breast removal creates another risk factor for

4174
01:55:40.731 --> 01:55:41.370
cancer.

4175
01:55:41.370 --> 01:55:44.070
And what's the risk of having a micro stroke under surgery?

4176
01:55:44.071 --> 01:55:45.600
It's like between two and 5%.

4177
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:47.010
Like it's not a risk free thing.

4178
01:55:47.011 --> 01:55:49.950
I just feel like there's huge amounts of fear for some things when the rest of

4179
01:55:49.951 --> 01:55:50.784
the body,

4180
01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:50.980
<v 1>yeah,</v>

4181
01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:51.401
you like,

4182
01:55:51.401 --> 01:55:52.630
you altered the body and you know,

4183
01:55:52.690 --> 01:55:55.060
like in a way like all surgeons will say that they're like,

4184
01:55:55.061 --> 01:55:56.640
if you can avoid surgery at any cost,

4185
01:55:56.890 --> 01:55:58.990
please do that because we all through your body,

4186
01:55:59.080 --> 01:55:59.831
all the Fascia,

4187
01:55:59.831 --> 01:56:02.730
that is one piece that covers everything in your graph infection.

4188
01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.220
I was just talking to Bob Cook and he was telling me about a staph infection he

4189
01:56:06.221 --> 01:56:07.240
got from his scratch.

4190
01:56:07.241 --> 01:56:08.074
All of a sudden it's fucking,

4191
01:56:08.130 --> 01:56:12.490
I think it was his elbow blew up like crazy and he took drugs right away.

4192
01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:13.301
Wasn't good enough.

4193
01:56:13.301 --> 01:56:14.230
I've had to go to the hospital.

4194
01:56:14.231 --> 01:56:15.760
Those strains are changing too,

4195
01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:19.930
and they're getting more and more resilient or more resistant to whatever

4196
01:56:19.931 --> 01:56:21.820
antibiotic bacteria as you can get.

4197
01:56:22.090 --> 01:56:25.270
But then also at have you think when you think about like,

4198
01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:25.950
uh,

4199
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:26.220
the,

4200
01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:29.770
the cellular regeneration that happens with cancer and an abnormal form,

4201
01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:34.450
that shit is completely fed by sugars and so like that that having a low fat

4202
01:56:34.451 --> 01:56:37.630
diet is really harmful and a lot of different,

4203
01:56:37.631 --> 01:56:41.350
there's a lot of good evidence to eat and certain ways healthy fats,

4204
01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:43.690
low shot and sugar is bad.

4205
01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:46.090
Sugar actually control your insulin.

4206
01:56:46.210 --> 01:56:47.230
You can control,

4207
01:56:47.231 --> 01:56:48.470
you can mitigate a lot of cancer.

4208
01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.360
Cancer has 28

4209
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:52.570
<v 3>times more insulin receptors on it than a normal cell in the body.</v>

4210
01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:54.340
So that means when you eat sugar,

4211
01:56:54.341 --> 01:56:56.320
you're basically feeding the cancer in your body.

4212
01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:56.921
In fact,

4213
01:56:56.921 --> 01:56:57.754
there's a kind of,

4214
01:56:57.810 --> 01:57:00.640
your cells don't want to proliferate if,

4215
01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.710
if there's not a lot of sugar and excess,

4216
01:57:02.711 --> 01:57:03.491
if there's a lot of sugar,

4217
01:57:03.491 --> 01:57:04.660
they'll go crazy.

4218
01:57:04.690 --> 01:57:05.770
There's not cancer.

4219
01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.370
We had a speaker at a Silicon Valley Health Institute come in and talk about

4220
01:57:09.371 --> 01:57:09.791
insulin.

4221
01:57:09.791 --> 01:57:11.380
Potentiated chemotherapy.

4222
01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:15.010
They take chemo drugs at like 10% of the normal concentration and they inject

4223
01:57:15.011 --> 01:57:16.240
them into you with insulin.

4224
01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:20.260
And the cancer cells love insulin so much that they just soak up the poison and

4225
01:57:20.261 --> 01:57:24.430
the rest of you doesn't crazy that that's how powerful sugar is.

4226
01:57:24.431 --> 01:57:26.230
So if you're at high risk for breast cancer,

4227
01:57:26.650 --> 01:57:30.520
you ought not to eat polyunsaturated oils and you ought not to eat sugar,

4228
01:57:30.521 --> 01:57:31.570
especially fructose.

4229
01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.620
If you do that.

4230
01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:34.810
How do we know what percentage reduction you have?

4231
01:57:34.811 --> 01:57:39.730
So if you have an 87% increased risk or an 87% risk and it tired,

4232
01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.960
no one's tested what that,

4233
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:43.870
what that looks like when you take these other lifestyle things,

4234
01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.190
and if you did that right,

4235
01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:49.120
maybe then you monitor and you decide based on your progress,

4236
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:50.460
whether you're going to have a surgery,

4237
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:51.220
you're not going to have it,

4238
01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:54.970
but to just kind of reactively do it because of the results of one proprietary

4239
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:55.833
gene test.

4240
01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:59.290
To me it seems kind of scary and the fact that this company owns those genes,

4241
01:57:59.291 --> 01:58:00.910
so I'm not allowed to do my own research on them.

4242
01:58:00.911 --> 01:58:02.710
I'm not allowed to have a university research on it.

4243
01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:06.030
<v 1>You're not doing any research.</v>

4244
01:58:06.190 --> 01:58:08.130
So I don't know whether you're telling the truth or not about that,

4245
01:58:08.131 --> 01:58:10.180
but if that is absolutely right and correct,

4246
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.060
it's fucking crazy.

4247
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:11.791
I hope I'm wrong,

4248
01:58:11.791 --> 01:58:13.160
but I'm not a little kid.

4249
01:58:13.810 --> 01:58:18.810
You look at the idea that Monsanto can patent different plants and that they in

4250
01:58:19.321 --> 01:58:21.160
fact tried to patent different parts from it.

4251
01:58:21.250 --> 01:58:23.800
<v 3>It's not meant Santo that owns the human genome.</v>

4252
01:58:23.801 --> 01:58:26.470
I forgot the name of the company or something.

4253
01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:27.363
But anyway,

4254
01:58:27.490 --> 01:58:31.000
<v 1>visa vi the fact that your stem cells are a controlled substance,</v>

4255
01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:35.070
that you can be sued for walking your body around if you have the intention of

4256
01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:36.070
doing that testing.

4257
01:58:36.370 --> 01:58:41.370
That's a non John Ashcroft nonsense that happened about a year ago.

4258
01:58:41.851 --> 01:58:42.240
It happened

4259
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.070
<v 6>a year and a half ago.</v>

4260
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.590
Really?

4261
01:58:43.590 --> 01:58:43.980
But,

4262
01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:45.870
but then the fact that if like this,

4263
01:58:45.930 --> 01:58:48.630
people owning owning genes are all that tea,

4264
01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:53.850
is it outlandish than to think that I wouldn't want to create an illness if I

4265
01:58:53.851 --> 01:58:55.630
had stops say in,

4266
01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:56.370
in this,

4267
01:58:56.370 --> 01:58:57.180
uh,

4268
01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:58.880
big Pharma Company in,

4269
01:58:58.881 --> 01:59:00.570
in this grain manufacturer.

4270
01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.010
I mean,

4271
01:59:02.010 --> 01:59:02.521
fuck man,

4272
01:59:02.521 --> 01:59:03.430
I want to create the PR.

4273
01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:04.560
Like it's like Halliburton.

4274
01:59:04.561 --> 01:59:04.831
It's like,

4275
01:59:04.831 --> 01:59:08.820
of course you want BP to fucking blow itself up in the Gulf because you're the

4276
01:59:08.821 --> 01:59:09.541
only one that's saying,

4277
01:59:09.541 --> 01:59:11.190
I can clean this up even if you can't,

4278
01:59:11.191 --> 01:59:11.611
whatever,

4279
01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:13.020
and I'm going to fleece the taxpayers.

4280
01:59:13.050 --> 01:59:17.490
It's all how can I fucking coopt to make as much money and doubled down on this

4281
01:59:17.491 --> 01:59:21.060
as I can and I'm going to buy tragedies and that's what American corporations

4282
01:59:21.061 --> 01:59:21.894
are doing.

4283
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:22.900
I don't know.

4284
01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.130
<v 1>People are making diseases,</v>

4285
01:59:24.131 --> 01:59:27.310
but I know if he gave some of the opportunity to make a disease that would kill

4286
01:59:27.311 --> 01:59:29.440
a few week people make you $1 billion.

4287
01:59:29.710 --> 01:59:30.580
A lot of companies,

4288
01:59:30.581 --> 01:59:31.420
we'd be down for it.

4289
01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:33.610
They will figure out a way to legally make it happen.

4290
01:59:33.670 --> 01:59:37.660
That's called diabetes type two diabetes onset diabetes.

4291
01:59:37.661 --> 01:59:38.494
How about cigarettes?

4292
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:39.720
I want the exact figure.

4293
01:59:39.730 --> 01:59:40.563
Exactly,

4294
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:41.320
exactly.

4295
01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:41.801
Who knows?

4296
01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:44.440
400,000 plus every year in this country,

4297
01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:46.960
the history of the pharmaceutical and chemical companies,

4298
01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:47.800
you know where they all came from,

4299
01:59:47.801 --> 01:59:48.100
right?

4300
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:48.933
Oil companies,

4301
01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.670
you go back a hundred years to like the Chrysler Chemical Company.

4302
01:59:51.671 --> 01:59:52.870
They came right out of the oil.

4303
01:59:52.930 --> 01:59:53.920
So oil first,

4304
01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:58.240
then oil split into chemicals and pharmaceuticals and these are like the old

4305
01:59:58.241 --> 01:59:59.110
historical roots.

4306
01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:03.700
So companies like Bayer out there that came straight out of oil and chemistry.

4307
02:00:03.701 --> 02:00:05.170
So they split it into making chemicals.

4308
02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:07.420
They split into making a drugs,

4309
02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:08.290
chemicals make us sick,

4310
02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:09.190
drugs make you well,

4311
02:00:09.191 --> 02:00:10.690
and it's kind of a virtuous cycle.

4312
02:00:10.690 --> 02:00:11.410
I'm not saying that these,

4313
02:00:11.410 --> 02:00:13.420
that there's a conspiracy and that you know these,

4314
02:00:13.421 --> 02:00:15.220
these companies are trading stuff back and forth.

4315
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:16.540
It's an emergent behavior.

4316
02:00:16.541 --> 02:00:19.480
Most people actually aren't evil and most people aren't going to kill someone

4317
02:00:19.481 --> 02:00:22.060
sitting across from them or even poison a whole country to make money.

4318
02:00:22.061 --> 02:00:23.200
If you evil people will.

4319
02:00:23.590 --> 02:00:26.260
But the problem is when you make a whole bunch of small decisions to optimize

4320
02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:26.890
profit,

4321
02:00:26.890 --> 02:00:29.020
you end up with like the American healthcare system,

4322
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:33.310
which is more expensive than any other country and produces suboptimal results.

4323
02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:35.980
It's not because there's some evil puppet master,

4324
02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:40.660
it's just cause overtime everyone optimize every micro decision in order to get

4325
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:42.820
the most profit instead of the most human wellness.

4326
02:00:42.821 --> 02:00:43.654
And when you do that,

4327
02:00:43.690 --> 02:00:45.010
you end up with mediocrity.

4328
02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.330
And that's what we're trying to start a revolution against.

4329
02:00:47.410 --> 02:00:52.410
Your needs to be some complete total transparency as far as what people's

4330
02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:58.000
actions in terms of companies and corporations and how that affects human

4331
02:00:58.001 --> 02:00:58.331
beings.

4332
02:00:58.331 --> 02:00:59.440
That should be the bottom line.

4333
02:00:59.441 --> 02:01:00.700
That should be the true bottom line.

4334
02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:03.910
And then we'd look at a profit even they should be like a real honest and

4335
02:01:03.911 --> 02:01:04.744
accurate account.

4336
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:09.250
If your laptop costs you $50 less than it would if people weren't jumping off

4337
02:01:09.251 --> 02:01:10.030
roofs,

4338
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.301
you know,

4339
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:10.840
maybe,

4340
02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:14.000
maybe they should set it up so you've to pay 50 bucks more for your fucking lie

4341
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.870
or they make lip $50 less per lap.

4342
02:01:16.170 --> 02:01:18.390
<v 6>One of the problems I think with the health care industry and,</v>

4343
02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.620
and I don't fucking know shit.

4344
02:01:19.621 --> 02:01:20.111
I mean I,

4345
02:01:20.111 --> 02:01:23.900
I'm this side of not needing velcro shoes to fucking walk around and I got it.

4346
02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:25.090
<v 1>Oh shoes or the shit,</v>

4347
02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:26.860
he really didn't get the respect they deserve,

4348
02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.350
but far better than laces.

4349
02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:30.440
<v 6>The whole,</v>

4350
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:31.790
the whole idea is that,

4351
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.740
that we're basing it on the assumption that you're a broken bean that's coming

4352
02:01:36.741 --> 02:01:39.320
to a doctor and looking for wellness instead of that.

4353
02:01:39.321 --> 02:01:40.280
You come from a perfect

4354
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.530
<v 1>wellness and,</v>

4355
02:01:41.531 --> 02:01:42.291
and your and,

4356
02:01:42.291 --> 02:01:43.760
and how to restore that state.

4357
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.390
We're looking to do,

4358
02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.740
like I've got a friend that's been trying to get off Paxil for three years now

4359
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:52.210
and every time he goes into the darkest fucking holes and he'll,

4360
02:01:52.211 --> 02:01:53.480
he'll forget parts of his days,

4361
02:01:53.481 --> 02:01:54.830
there'll be an a walking blackout.

4362
02:01:54.831 --> 02:01:56.440
Like how do you do that?

4363
02:01:56.450 --> 02:01:57.960
You're gonna have to wean yourself off of that.

4364
02:01:57.961 --> 02:01:58.150
Yeah,

4365
02:01:58.150 --> 02:01:58.331
yeah,

4366
02:01:58.331 --> 02:01:58.550
yeah.

4367
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:59.301
But even then,

4368
02:01:59.301 --> 02:01:59.541
man,

4369
02:01:59.541 --> 02:02:00.120
when he's off,

4370
02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:02.450
it's one of the more serious SSRI is I guess.

4371
02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:03.481
<v 6>And it's like,</v>

4372
02:02:03.481 --> 02:02:04.380
it's coming from,

4373
02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.750
from that kind of thing of you're broken and how to get you well.

4374
02:02:06.751 --> 02:02:07.021
And they're like,

4375
02:02:07.021 --> 02:02:07.111
well,

4376
02:02:07.111 --> 02:02:08.400
maybe you just need to be on it forever.

4377
02:02:08.401 --> 02:02:09.120
And it's like,

4378
02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:09.300
man,

4379
02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:11.370
that's a fucked up proposition when I go.

4380
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.841
So I've just came,

4381
02:02:12.841 --> 02:02:14.430
came into this life broke and her like,

4382
02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:16.500
why is it now that there's 80 inoculations,

4383
02:02:16.501 --> 02:02:16.681
why,

4384
02:02:16.681 --> 02:02:17.011
why,

4385
02:02:17.011 --> 02:02:18.130
why is it such a pronounced [inaudible]

4386
02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:18.851
<v 1>autism?</v>

4387
02:02:18.851 --> 02:02:20.960
Why is that such a pronounced disease right now the town,

4388
02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:22.570
so the autism tends to be,

4389
02:02:22.571 --> 02:02:25.090
males are having babies much later in life.

4390
02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.800
That's what they've directly attributed to it.

4391
02:02:26.890 --> 02:02:30.520
When you guys are in their late forties and they're pumping out kids,

4392
02:02:30.521 --> 02:02:33.160
it's very likely that that kid is going to have some issues.

4393
02:02:33.190 --> 02:02:35.440
We have a whole chapter in here about what's now late forties late.

4394
02:02:35.441 --> 02:02:35.620
It's,

4395
02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:36.011
I think,

4396
02:02:36.011 --> 02:02:36.221
I mean,

4397
02:02:36.221 --> 02:02:37.330
not very likely I should say.

4398
02:02:37.331 --> 02:02:37.720
It's like,

4399
02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:38.200
you know,

4400
02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.400
whatever low percentage,

4401
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:43.960
but it's any much higher than it is when you're 20 or when you third age matters

4402
02:02:43.961 --> 02:02:44.381
a lot.

4403
02:02:44.381 --> 02:02:45.490
And that was how much drinking,

4404
02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:45.761
I mean,

4405
02:02:45.761 --> 02:02:46.011
you,

4406
02:02:46.011 --> 02:02:49.930
you may seem and you mix from like on a regular basis every three or four days.

4407
02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.030
So what,

4408
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.280
you know,

4409
02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:53.260
were you drunk actually matters.

4410
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:54.283
Yeah.

4411
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:55.930
You could fuck up your loads.

4412
02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.813
Yeah.

4413
02:02:57.250 --> 02:02:57.761
Well said,

4414
02:02:57.761 --> 02:02:58.330
man.

4415
02:02:58.330 --> 02:02:59.163
How Sad.

4416
02:02:59.230 --> 02:02:59.591
Brian?

4417
02:02:59.591 --> 02:02:59.780
Yes.

4418
02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:02.590
That healthy load still don't hear nothing.

4419
02:03:02.591 --> 02:03:03.424
You just said that.

4420
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:05.623
Yeah.

4421
02:03:05.770 --> 02:03:06.603
It's um,

4422
02:03:06.850 --> 02:03:07.241
it's,

4423
02:03:07.241 --> 02:03:08.320
it's a fascinating thing.

4424
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.561
You know,

4425
02:03:08.561 --> 02:03:11.170
the development of human beings just not really been,

4426
02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:12.063
um,

4427
02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:16.210
accurately assessed or a really a diagrammed.

4428
02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:21.240
It hasn't been really engineered in a conscientious objective and really

4429
02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:23.470
positive way.

4430
02:03:23.471 --> 02:03:27.160
We've looked at what is the best way to optimize being a human being on this

4431
02:03:27.161 --> 02:03:28.960
planet from the way you think about things,

4432
02:03:28.961 --> 02:03:31.300
to how do you behave and what kind of food you put into your body.

4433
02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:33.460
It's really difficult to acquire this kind of information.

4434
02:03:34.210 --> 02:03:35.043
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

4435
02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:37.640
I remember writing a lot with you and go on,

4436
02:03:37.641 --> 02:03:39.960
Jesus can imagine being on this slave ship everyday,

4437
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:43.740
talking about driving on the four oh five every day at 9:00 AM or whatever it

4438
02:03:43.741 --> 02:03:43.841
was.

4439
02:03:43.841 --> 02:03:47.360
And it's like those kinds of things I was looking at like every,

4440
02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:48.760
every industry that I've been in,

4441
02:03:48.761 --> 02:03:49.670
in my adult life,

4442
02:03:49.671 --> 02:03:52.310
which has been pretty much to try to not have a job.

4443
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:53.680
And uh,

4444
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.920
and I've been pretty good at it,

4445
02:03:55.070 --> 02:04:00.070
but having a job without having one and like I've got like a concrete cowboy is

4446
02:04:00.831 --> 02:04:01.120
a,

4447
02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:01.590
uh,

4448
02:04:01.590 --> 02:04:04.190
a nightclub in Dallas and one of the managers is there.

4449
02:04:04.191 --> 02:04:04.581
He's like,

4450
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:05.414
you know,

4451
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:08.810
all we're doing is the people that are working Monday through Friday,

4452
02:04:09.590 --> 02:04:11.180
this is what it is.

4453
02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:11.481
Like,

4454
02:04:11.481 --> 02:04:12.680
I can't wait to get out into,

4455
02:04:12.681 --> 02:04:13.001
and you're,

4456
02:04:13.001 --> 02:04:14.360
you're causing a distraction.

4457
02:04:14.361 --> 02:04:16.640
You're causing an illusion for them to enjoy their life.

4458
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:18.110
And the next Monday and Tuesday,

4459
02:04:18.111 --> 02:04:20.840
that's what they're talking about is what a great time they had by Wednesday and

4460
02:04:20.841 --> 02:04:21.171
Thursday.

4461
02:04:21.171 --> 02:04:23.240
I can't wait until I do this again and recreate this,

4462
02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:23.751
uh,

4463
02:04:23.751 --> 02:04:23.951
in,

4464
02:04:23.951 --> 02:04:24.381
in my,

4465
02:04:24.381 --> 02:04:25.041
in my gym,

4466
02:04:25.041 --> 02:04:25.611
in Santa Fe.

4467
02:04:25.611 --> 02:04:28.040
It's the same kind of thing in a healthy way of like,

4468
02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:30.860
how can I reduce stress?

4469
02:04:30.861 --> 02:04:32.360
How can I enhance lifts?

4470
02:04:32.361 --> 02:04:34.340
How can I learn how to strangle people better?

4471
02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:36.440
It's like people are getting different skill sets in that,

4472
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:37.303
in that way,

4473
02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:38.170
everything

4474
02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:41.890
<v 5>is like how to avoid the life that I have to have so that I could have another</v>

4475
02:04:41.891 --> 02:04:42.730
life kind of thing.

4476
02:04:42.731 --> 02:04:42.811
Or,

4477
02:04:42.811 --> 02:04:44.350
or making films is the same way.

4478
02:04:44.351 --> 02:04:44.561
I mean,

4479
02:04:44.561 --> 02:04:45.520
that's the only film,

4480
02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:46.211
the film industry,

4481
02:04:46.211 --> 02:04:49.630
I think in the Great Depression was the only thing that remained static or maybe

4482
02:04:49.631 --> 02:04:53.920
went up because people are trying to avoid the horrific fucking existence that

4483
02:04:53.921 --> 02:04:54.551
they're having.

4484
02:04:54.551 --> 02:04:57.970
And so how was it that instead of having a life that I want to escape,

4485
02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:03.160
I can build in a life that is satisfactory and that I can affect your health?

4486
02:05:03.250 --> 02:05:03.760
Yeah,

4487
02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:04.593
for sure.

4488
02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:04.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4489
02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:07.580
You ever meet a guy who just likes to make knives?

4490
02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:08.493
Right?

4491
02:05:09.210 --> 02:05:10.800
<v 5>That guy's a happy mother fucker do it.</v>

4492
02:05:10.801 --> 02:05:11.431
And that's what it is.

4493
02:05:11.431 --> 02:05:12.660
Whatever it is that turns you on,

4494
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.070
fucking do that thing,

4495
02:05:14.071 --> 02:05:14.320
man.

4496
02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:14.730
Yes.

4497
02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:16.110
That's really fucking hard to do though.

4498
02:05:16.530 --> 02:05:17.570
Difficult for [inaudible].

4499
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:18.683
<v 0>Uh,</v>

4500
02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:19.713
to get to that,

4501
02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:20.590
that state.

4502
02:05:20.590 --> 02:05:22.210
So I get some news on the human genome.

4503
02:05:22.630 --> 02:05:25.900
Every part of the human genome sequenced by the human genome project was made

4504
02:05:25.901 --> 02:05:26.950
public immediately.

4505
02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.031
In fact,

4506
02:05:28.031 --> 02:05:31.390
a new date on the human genome was posted every 24 hours.

4507
02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:35.200
And it is true that some private companies that filed thousands of patents on

4508
02:05:35.201 --> 02:05:37.420
Human Julie's over the past several years,

4509
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:38.171
it says,

4510
02:05:38.171 --> 02:05:40.090
we don't know how many such patents have been filed,

4511
02:05:40.091 --> 02:05:43.270
whether the patents will be awarded or if they're enforceable.

4512
02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:45.970
Most of the patent applications have not been acted upon.

4513
02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:47.800
So we really don't know how much,

4514
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:51.700
if any of the genome can be used freely for commercial purposes.

4515
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:52.970
It's a dude named Iste.

4516
02:05:52.971 --> 02:05:55.080
He'd van from the message board posts that.

4517
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:58.540
<v 3>So the company that owns Brc one and two,</v>

4518
02:05:58.570 --> 02:06:00.130
those as far as I understand,

4519
02:06:00.131 --> 02:06:03.460
those patents are legit and that they've been accepted and they also own the

4520
02:06:03.461 --> 02:06:04.570
testing for that.

4521
02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:04.830
Yep.

4522
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:08.260
So no one else can test for it even though it's like of genes there,

4523
02:06:08.261 --> 02:06:11.530
I can't talk about it being there and it's because they own the genes that in

4524
02:06:11.531 --> 02:06:15.160
owning the testing they stopped anybody from competing with them and also

4525
02:06:15.161 --> 02:06:16.390
testing for the jeans.

4526
02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:16.661
Yeah.

4527
02:06:16.661 --> 02:06:19.410
So if anyone else wants to do a report that says you have the BRC when she,

4528
02:06:19.411 --> 02:06:20.230
and they can't say that,

4529
02:06:20.230 --> 02:06:22.810
what about if someone wants to do research on the gene?

4530
02:06:22.811 --> 02:06:23.290
Can't do it.

4531
02:06:23.290 --> 02:06:25.800
You can't do research on the gene of the corner of the stuff I read.

4532
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:27.283
<v 0>Wow.</v>

4533
02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:28.190
If that is true,

4534
02:06:28.191 --> 02:06:29.690
that is pretty fucking bonkers.

4535
02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:33.600
That's nuts that people would let humanity trumped by the bottom.

4536
02:06:33.730 --> 02:06:34.420
<v 3>Bottom line.</v>

4537
02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:37.870
Cause a revolution like you'll be able to sequence your own genes in your own

4538
02:06:37.871 --> 02:06:39.100
house and not that much longer.

4539
02:06:39.101 --> 02:06:40.020
You look at Moore's law,

4540
02:06:40.050 --> 02:06:41.980
how fast the price of this done.

4541
02:06:42.250 --> 02:06:45.190
Early in my career I was with this program called double twist.

4542
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:46.081
There were a customer,

4543
02:06:46.081 --> 02:06:47.230
there's big data's when I worked for,

4544
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:51.640
we had a whole floor of a skyscraper in Oakland and it was just packed with

4545
02:06:51.641 --> 02:06:54.700
these million dollar servers to sequence the human genome and to make it go

4546
02:06:54.701 --> 02:06:59.320
online and now for $99 I can get that same thing done for my DNA and this isn't,

4547
02:06:59.321 --> 02:07:02.920
I'm still alive like this only happened over the last 15 maybe 18 years.

4548
02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.233
That's incredible.

4549
02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:06.220
So you've go forward another 10 or 20 years,

4550
02:07:06.490 --> 02:07:06.881
you know what?

4551
02:07:06.881 --> 02:07:07.571
Screw these companies,

4552
02:07:07.571 --> 02:07:08.770
it's all going to be open source.

4553
02:07:08.771 --> 02:07:09.604
It has to be,

4554
02:07:09.730 --> 02:07:10.960
otherwise they're going to own us

4555
02:07:11.550 --> 02:07:12.001
<v 0>trying.</v>

4556
02:07:12.001 --> 02:07:16.260
Right now it's almost like the last ditch effort at the end of this weird

4557
02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:19.620
digital age w before we progress to the next state,

4558
02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:24.030
people are still trying to click on to really shitty thinking and and

4559
02:07:24.031 --> 02:07:24.864
corruption.

4560
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:26.670
This strikes me as corruption.

4561
02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:27.630
It's all corruption.

4562
02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:28.491
It really is the,

4563
02:07:28.491 --> 02:07:31.470
the fact that then only these laws could have been allowed to take place that

4564
02:07:31.471 --> 02:07:36.471
you could have ever allowed anybody to patent a life form its own a life form

4565
02:07:36.661 --> 02:07:38.940
that's sue people else for also having the seeds,

4566
02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:39.491
that life form.

4567
02:07:39.491 --> 02:07:42.490
When you notice that cross pollination that's just straight evil.

4568
02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:44.200
No sane person would ever do it.

4569
02:07:44.230 --> 02:07:44.950
But companies,

4570
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:45.641
they're insane.

4571
02:07:45.641 --> 02:07:46.480
They're not saying people.

4572
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:47.800
I'm being um,

4573
02:07:47.801 --> 02:07:49.120
on a regular basis,

4574
02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:49.570
uh,

4575
02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:53.410
shocked by how transparent like some of these things are.

4576
02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:57.170
How transparent the connection between Monsanto and,

4577
02:07:57.171 --> 02:08:00.790
and money and influencing politicians and different things that are getting

4578
02:08:00.791 --> 02:08:01.870
snuck through congress.

4579
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:02.681
And then you,

4580
02:08:02.681 --> 02:08:02.960
you,

4581
02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:03.793
you're hearing about these,

4582
02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:07.690
the Monsanto Protection Act or supposedly whatever it's called when people are

4583
02:08:07.691 --> 02:08:09.190
calling the Monsanto Protection Act.

4584
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:10.481
And it just,

4585
02:08:10.481 --> 02:08:10.900
it just,

4586
02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:11.331
it's,

4587
02:08:11.331 --> 02:08:15.250
it's so gross to see like corruption so obvious.

4588
02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:16.173
It's so,

4589
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:21.270
it's so gross to see a group of people that are supposedly are leaders that have

4590
02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:25.330
virtually no inspirational things to say whatsoever.

4591
02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:26.800
There's not a single one.

4592
02:08:26.801 --> 02:08:27.970
Whoever gets up and says,

4593
02:08:27.971 --> 02:08:30.430
what we need to do is eat healthy food,

4594
02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:31.750
drink a lot of water,

4595
02:08:31.930 --> 02:08:35.230
get a lot of exercise and meditate and follow your passion.

4596
02:08:35.410 --> 02:08:37.650
You need to surround yourself with good people and be good to those.

4597
02:08:37.651 --> 02:08:37.860
Yeah.

4598
02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:39.890
<v 6>Or like monitor the news in a different way.</v>

4599
02:08:39.891 --> 02:08:40.400
Like,

4600
02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:40.620
why,

4601
02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:41.690
why isn't that looked at like,

4602
02:08:41.691 --> 02:08:43.640
let's get actual news instead of fear tactics.

4603
02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:44.011
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4604
02:08:44.011 --> 02:08:45.140
I don't watch the news anyway.

4605
02:08:45.570 --> 02:08:47.230
Figure 10 plus years.

4606
02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.400
If someone's going to figure out a way to make money from telling you the truth,

4607
02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:51.140
okay.

4608
02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:52.860
We can make the same kind of money.

4609
02:08:52.861 --> 02:08:55.380
If CNN can make more money by being honest with you,

4610
02:08:55.381 --> 02:08:58.860
than they could about being country and bullshitting and having Anderson Coover

4611
02:08:58.861 --> 02:09:00.000
in front of a green screen.

4612
02:09:00.210 --> 02:09:00.690
You know,

4613
02:09:00.690 --> 02:09:01.021
may,

4614
02:09:01.021 --> 02:09:02.070
maybe we would trust them.

4615
02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:02.761
Maybe.

4616
02:09:02.761 --> 02:09:03.990
Maybe you could actually make money.

4617
02:09:03.991 --> 02:09:04.810
That was,

4618
02:09:04.810 --> 02:09:07.720
<v 6>I was listening to some tapes or Ronald Reagan after the like,</v>

4619
02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.220
uh,

4620
02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:09.053
like he was like,

4621
02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:09.720
well,

4622
02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:10.600
it was the whole thing.

4623
02:09:10.601 --> 02:09:11.290
We don't,

4624
02:09:11.290 --> 02:09:12.070
um,

4625
02:09:12.070 --> 02:09:14.500
we don't negotiate with terrorists talk that he's given.

4626
02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:15.251
And he's saying,

4627
02:09:15.251 --> 02:09:16.510
we totally didn't do that.

4628
02:09:16.511 --> 02:09:17.170
And there's,

4629
02:09:17.170 --> 02:09:18.280
there was no,

4630
02:09:18.281 --> 02:09:18.850
uh,

4631
02:09:18.850 --> 02:09:19.730
there's no lesson,

4632
02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.250
but like we didn't have any kind of,

4633
02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:22.110
uh,

4634
02:09:22.110 --> 02:09:22.300
uh,

4635
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:26.150
interactions with them where there was a arms for hostages type of thing and

4636
02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:30.190
talking about when he took over and it says one month later,

4637
02:09:30.670 --> 02:09:31.870
I know I said that once,

4638
02:09:31.871 --> 02:09:33.880
I believe in my heart that it wasn't true,

4639
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:36.880
but it turns out that the facts are different than what my heart would like to

4640
02:09:36.881 --> 02:09:37.960
believe or some,

4641
02:09:38.230 --> 02:09:39.550
it sounds crazy,

4642
02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:44.730
but you see that happen with Obama's talk about Nda in the same speech.

4643
02:09:45.490 --> 02:09:46.540
There's not a month apart.

4644
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:48.160
It's like in today's Day and age,

4645
02:09:48.161 --> 02:09:49.210
Reagan would have just never,

4646
02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:51.640
he would have never thought about that first speech.

4647
02:09:51.641 --> 02:09:53.470
It would have just maybe not even made,

4648
02:09:53.530 --> 02:09:54.400
made an issue of it.

4649
02:09:54.401 --> 02:09:57.400
But here Obama saying this is totally bad.

4650
02:09:57.401 --> 02:09:58.690
We'll never do any of these things,

4651
02:09:58.691 --> 02:09:59.080
but uh,

4652
02:09:59.080 --> 02:09:59.321
uh,

4653
02:09:59.321 --> 02:10:00.520
I'm going to sign it in any way.

4654
02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:00.951
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

4655
02:10:00.951 --> 02:10:02.070
that was the most ridiculous thing.

4656
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:03.470
Probably never use it,

4657
02:10:03.471 --> 02:10:04.370
but we're going to sign it.

4658
02:10:04.610 --> 02:10:04.851
Well,

4659
02:10:04.851 --> 02:10:07.790
it's pretty obvious at this point that the president doesn't really get the

4660
02:10:07.791 --> 02:10:10.430
chance to say what goes on.

4661
02:10:10.431 --> 02:10:11.211
It's not one person,

4662
02:10:11.211 --> 02:10:11.660
right.

4663
02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:12.650
They're not allowing that.

4664
02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:12.840
It's,

4665
02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:13.970
it's a pretty clear.

4666
02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:15.013
However,

4667
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.360
it's also pretty obvious that whoever gets to be present,

4668
02:10:17.361 --> 02:10:18.560
it's never going to fucking talk about it.

4669
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:20.420
Bill Clinton talks about a whole lot of shit.

4670
02:10:20.421 --> 02:10:21.890
He doesn't talk about the Illuminati.

4671
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:24.260
And so now it's what he is.

4672
02:10:24.261 --> 02:10:25.430
It's what he does and it adds,

4673
02:10:25.431 --> 02:10:29.510
it becomes more and more transparent as it becomes revealed more and more how

4674
02:10:29.511 --> 02:10:30.320
much of a,

4675
02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:32.000
a foothold,

4676
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:33.163
big money,

4677
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:34.560
big corporations have in,

4678
02:10:34.561 --> 02:10:36.080
in governments all over the world.

4679
02:10:36.081 --> 02:10:38.240
The more it becomes ridiculous that they don't talk about it.

4680
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:40.040
So they were never really our president.

4681
02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:40.891
What they were,

4682
02:10:40.891 --> 02:10:44.750
were really good at saying the things that we really like to hear while they

4683
02:10:44.751 --> 02:10:47.930
were being a gangster working for the top dicks in the world.

4684
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:49.400
And that's really what they did.

4685
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:50.263
And that's what the one,

4686
02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:50.520
yeah,

4687
02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:50.901
your dog,

4688
02:10:50.901 --> 02:10:51.531
just shit,

4689
02:10:51.531 --> 02:10:52.010
man.

4690
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.420
Where my smell shit,

4691
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:54.883
I dunno.

4692
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:55.833
I that was taped.

4693
02:10:55.940 --> 02:10:56.421
I wish,

4694
02:10:56.421 --> 02:10:57.100
right?

4695
02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:58.610
I said it smells like dog shit.

4696
02:10:58.640 --> 02:10:59.540
It doesn't sound like,

4697
02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:01.880
be careful what your role,

4698
02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:04.960
maybe she just ripped one.

4699
02:11:05.590 --> 02:11:06.610
She's over there sleeping.

4700
02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:07.060
She's right.

4701
02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:07.893
Oh yeah.

4702
02:11:10.890 --> 02:11:11.760
Geez Louise.

4703
02:11:13.410 --> 02:11:14.460
That's caught one of the phase.

4704
02:11:14.461 --> 02:11:15.750
It was definitely an animal fart.

4705
02:11:16.530 --> 02:11:17.220
That's rude.

4706
02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:18.053
By the way.

4707
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:19.270
Change your dog's food.

4708
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:20.490
Smells like farts.

4709
02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:21.090
Oh,

4710
02:11:21.090 --> 02:11:21.901
Jesus Christ.

4711
02:11:21.901 --> 02:11:23.070
You think it clings to her?

4712
02:11:23.071 --> 02:11:24.000
Look at fog.

4713
02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:25.890
She smells like a beautiful little puppy.

4714
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:27.763
That's right.

4715
02:11:28.090 --> 02:11:28.350
Um,

4716
02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:29.220
what do you think about,

4717
02:11:29.221 --> 02:11:31.800
this is one of the things that really pissed me off when I was,

4718
02:11:31.801 --> 02:11:32.070
uh,

4719
02:11:32.070 --> 02:11:32.970
learning about,

4720
02:11:32.971 --> 02:11:33.270
uh,

4721
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:36.150
various treatments for my bulging disc issue.

4722
02:11:36.690 --> 02:11:37.523
Um,

4723
02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:41.190
there's a lot of people that are going to Europe and they're going to Europe for

4724
02:11:41.191 --> 02:11:44.460
treatments that aren't available in the United States because the United States

4725
02:11:44.461 --> 02:11:48.510
during the Bush administration had a bunch of Wacky fucking restrictions on stem

4726
02:11:48.511 --> 02:11:49.350
cell research.

4727
02:11:49.650 --> 02:11:54.650
So the Europeans got way ahead of what America is doing as far as things with

4728
02:11:55.861 --> 02:11:56.401
stem cells.

4729
02:11:56.401 --> 02:11:59.520
And a lot of professional athletes have been going over there to get these

4730
02:11:59.521 --> 02:12:01.590
really crazy cutting edge treatments.

4731
02:12:01.950 --> 02:12:03.570
I got Dana White went over there,

4732
02:12:03.630 --> 02:12:05.470
they pulled blood from his body,

4733
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:10.290
spun it in something and they the incubates for 10 hours and they pump it back

4734
02:12:10.291 --> 02:12:13.740
into his body and he'd completely cured as Meniere's disease.

4735
02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:14.160
Yeah,

4736
02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.230
he goes back again to do it like in a few months,

4737
02:12:16.231 --> 02:12:16.651
but he's like,

4738
02:12:16.651 --> 02:12:19.860
what they're doing is like fixing people that have injuries that could never fix

4739
02:12:19.861 --> 02:12:20.694
before.

4740
02:12:20.730 --> 02:12:22.450
People with like fucked up backs.

4741
02:12:22.451 --> 02:12:25.350
Like Peyton manning apparently went over there and got his neck fixed.

4742
02:12:25.890 --> 02:12:26.930
What do you know about that shit?

4743
02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.130
<v 3>I haven't done a lot of specific research on stem cells themselves.</v>

4744
02:12:31.730 --> 02:12:36.200
What I do know is that a lot of the things going on with medical interventions

4745
02:12:36.201 --> 02:12:39.050
in the U S it's incredibly slow and hidebound.

4746
02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:42.260
I worked with one of the first companies that had a stick on cardiac monitor.

4747
02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.030
I designed the whole infrastructure.

4748
02:12:44.031 --> 02:12:47.390
Do you like get the signal off the body onto the cloud so we could analyze it

4749
02:12:48.110 --> 02:12:52.460
and the amount of money that that company had to raise just for compliance for

4750
02:12:52.461 --> 02:12:54.530
this sort of thing was incredible.

4751
02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:59.660
So there's all sorts of really brilliant doctors and natural paths and other

4752
02:12:59.661 --> 02:13:01.680
guys who have technologies that,

4753
02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:02.860
some of them are anticancer,

4754
02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:04.940
some of them are are for obesity.

4755
02:13:05.690 --> 02:13:09.620
Some of them are for rapid healing and in order for them to actually do it,

4756
02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:11.510
if they stand up and say I'm doing this,

4757
02:13:11.511 --> 02:13:13.850
they'll lose their license almost immediately because it's an unapproved

4758
02:13:13.851 --> 02:13:14.240
treatment.

4759
02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.620
So that we have this whole bureaucratic institution that forces people who are

4760
02:13:18.621 --> 02:13:23.120
really good healers to at least publicly support things that don't work very

4761
02:13:23.121 --> 02:13:23.780
well.

4762
02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:27.380
And they do this even though maybe at home they're doing something different

4763
02:13:27.381 --> 02:13:29.600
because until you have these double blind studies,

4764
02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:30.381
et Cetera,

4765
02:13:30.381 --> 02:13:31.214
et Cetera,

4766
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:32.220
it's just very slow.

4767
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.680
So what a lot of the new groundbreaking companies,

4768
02:13:34.681 --> 02:13:36.300
including some of the ones that I advise,

4769
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:41.070
what they do is they go overseas because if you go say to Europe or better yet

4770
02:13:41.071 --> 02:13:41.904
to Singapore,

4771
02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:46.190
you can do amazing things to heal people that are not legal to do in the u s and

4772
02:13:46.191 --> 02:13:49.320
might not be legal for 20 years and it will cost you a lot less money.

4773
02:13:49.410 --> 02:13:51.210
Like what things they have available.

4774
02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:54.780
You can go over there and do some of the electrical medicine,

4775
02:13:54.781 --> 02:13:55.501
things like that.

4776
02:13:55.501 --> 02:13:56.460
Electrical medicine.

4777
02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:57.040
Oh yeah.

4778
02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:57.250
Uh,

4779
02:13:57.250 --> 02:14:00.300
I mean my first biohacking conference earlier this year,

4780
02:14:00.301 --> 02:14:01.590
we had guys running,

4781
02:14:01.610 --> 02:14:02.040
um,

4782
02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:05.340
relatively heavy amounts of electrical current over the body in order to

4783
02:14:05.341 --> 02:14:07.260
increase myelination of the nerves.

4784
02:14:07.890 --> 02:14:12.030
And myelinated nerves carry electricity faster and they let you move faster.

4785
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:13.493
There's,

4786
02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.280
Oh wait a minute.

4787
02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:16.440
You can turn people faster by electrical video.

4788
02:14:16.930 --> 02:14:17.281
All right.

4789
02:14:17.281 --> 02:14:19.790
So pretty much it's an incentive.

4790
02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:20.700
We had,

4791
02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:21.270
we had Aubrey,

4792
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:22.900
they're the CEO of on it did,

4793
02:14:22.901 --> 02:14:24.450
he should have seen the change in his punch.

4794
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:25.230
Right?

4795
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:27.030
So w you made him punch harder.

4796
02:14:27.190 --> 02:14:27.450
Uh,

4797
02:14:27.450 --> 02:14:28.350
we're going to punch faster.

4798
02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:29.420
Pump Punch fat.

4799
02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:29.641
Yeah.

4800
02:14:29.641 --> 02:14:30.760
Cause you didn't just warmup,

4801
02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:31.231
no,

4802
02:14:31.231 --> 02:14:32.061
it wasn't that because what,

4803
02:14:32.061 --> 02:14:33.290
what he was doing and,

4804
02:14:33.291 --> 02:14:34.700
and you could see it was really dramatic effect.

4805
02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:35.740
I think that's in the video.

4806
02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:38.100
I almost have the videos done for the conference,

4807
02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:38.970
but um,

4808
02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:39.810
I'll put those online.

4809
02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:40.740
And um,

4810
02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:41.130
what,

4811
02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:41.870
what he was doing,

4812
02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:43.110
he was punching really fast,

4813
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:43.740
but then his,

4814
02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:44.940
he was pulling back slowly.

4815
02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.670
So by running electricity and just coaching is form.

4816
02:14:47.671 --> 02:14:50.820
But when you learn something with the electricity going over your nerves at 500

4817
02:14:50.821 --> 02:14:51.654
times a second,

4818
02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:56.520
your mind thinks you did it 500 times that do something 10,000 times to practice

4819
02:14:56.521 --> 02:14:56.641
it.

4820
02:14:56.641 --> 02:14:57.474
That kind of effect.

4821
02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:00.600
Well if your mind thinks you did it 10,000 times and you only did it for a

4822
02:15:00.601 --> 02:15:01.320
little while,

4823
02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:02.580
you get the practice effect.

4824
02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:04.980
So I watched him before it was like fast,

4825
02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:09.000
slow and when he was done with this stuff after like two days of this,

4826
02:15:09.001 --> 02:15:12.420
he was like equally fast going on the jab and then pulling it back.

4827
02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:13.040
It was,

4828
02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:15.060
it was remarked that quicker.

4829
02:15:15.170 --> 02:15:16.200
He didn't punch quicker.

4830
02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:18.000
I don't know if you punched faster or not.

4831
02:15:18.001 --> 02:15:19.080
I don't think they measured that.

4832
02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:22.680
But you could see that they're measuring the amount of time between throwing the

4833
02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:23.850
punch of pulling the punch back.

4834
02:15:23.850 --> 02:15:26.990
Cause if you can throw three punches because you're pulling back different,

4835
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.200
he punches however many times in 20 seconds under this and then now he's

4836
02:15:31.201 --> 02:15:33.390
punching this many more times than 20 seconds.

4837
02:15:33.710 --> 02:15:36.240
It seems like it would be something that an athlete should do right before they

4838
02:15:36.241 --> 02:15:37.080
did an event.

4839
02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:38.400
How long would it last?

4840
02:15:38.401 --> 02:15:39.230
And is illegal?

4841
02:15:39.230 --> 02:15:40.920
It's legal and the effect,

4842
02:15:40.921 --> 02:15:41.731
it's a nervous system.

4843
02:15:41.731 --> 02:15:42.030
Effects.

4844
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:44.580
It's teaching the nervous system and the nerves in the body.

4845
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:45.451
It's forever.

4846
02:15:45.451 --> 02:15:46.284
Yeah.

4847
02:15:46.570 --> 02:15:51.570
So essentially you could cut your amount of time that it takes to be proficient

4848
02:15:52.021 --> 02:15:55.410
at something by a dramatic throughout the u s military is using this in the

4849
02:15:55.411 --> 02:15:55.890
brain.

4850
02:15:55.890 --> 02:15:56.970
They use this device,

4851
02:15:56.971 --> 02:15:57.511
this little,

4852
02:15:57.511 --> 02:15:58.200
uh,

4853
02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:02.520
transcranial direct current stimulator thing to train drone pilots in six weeks

4854
02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:03.510
instead of three months.

4855
02:16:03.810 --> 02:16:06.000
Drone piloting is the most boring job ever.

4856
02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:08.790
You stare at a screen for 12 hours and if you see something that's a target,

4857
02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:09.990
which happens like once a day,

4858
02:16:09.991 --> 02:16:10.471
if you're lucky,

4859
02:16:10.471 --> 02:16:11.970
you press a button and then someone dies.

4860
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:13.143
You're in a trailer,

4861
02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:15.480
they keep jacking innocent people.

4862
02:16:15.481 --> 02:16:17.360
Is it because they're bored and they just pull the trigger?

4863
02:16:20.490 --> 02:16:21.900
That's gotta be one of the hardest jobs ever.

4864
02:16:21.901 --> 02:16:22.591
You're killing people.

4865
02:16:22.591 --> 02:16:24.780
You're attending to the little video screen from an airplane.

4866
02:16:24.781 --> 02:16:25.000
I,

4867
02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:25.500
I don't,

4868
02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:27.090
I would not want that job to save my life.

4869
02:16:27.091 --> 02:16:27.924
So I got it.

4870
02:16:27.930 --> 02:16:28.591
I got her to stop.

4871
02:16:28.591 --> 02:16:29.470
She doesn't exist.

4872
02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:30.080
I agree.

4873
02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:32.830
<v 2>Should be reserved for like really evil motherfuckers.</v>

4874
02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:33.371
I agree.

4875
02:16:33.371 --> 02:16:36.850
But I gotta respect the guys who are going out and doing that work cause I sure

4876
02:16:36.851 --> 02:16:40.630
as heck wouldn't do it but I have to take that job shouldn't exist.

4877
02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:44.470
It's a crazy business when 80% of the people that you kill you didn't mean to

4878
02:16:44.471 --> 02:16:45.940
kill and eat and you don't even know.

4879
02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.560
You don't even get to see him.

4880
02:16:47.561 --> 02:16:48.990
I mean the mistakes happen and I,

4881
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:50.860
I get 2% of the right people.

4882
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:51.120
Yeah,

4883
02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:51.880
I don't,

4884
02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:55.420
I don't want that on my Karma real in person.

4885
02:16:55.900 --> 02:17:00.100
They say 49 people that happen to be in the cafe or whatever happened die also

4886
02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:04.020
and they and Obama and the military industrial complex calls that Arabian

4887
02:17:04.090 --> 02:17:04.900
success.

4888
02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:05.200
Yeah.

4889
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:06.280
I heard the new update though.

4890
02:17:06.281 --> 02:17:08.950
You'd only kills like 20% of the people though.

4891
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:11.520
That makes me feel better things.

4892
02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:15.520
But it's pretty amazing how we freak out about nine 11.

4893
02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:18.310
Don't think about what we've done so far.

4894
02:17:18.311 --> 02:17:20.660
Is it a drone attacks or,

4895
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:21.310
well,

4896
02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:21.581
I mean,

4897
02:17:21.581 --> 02:17:23.400
you look at Boston and as fucking that's,

4898
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:24.730
and that's awful and horrible,

4899
02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:27.100
but when I heard that it was like three people that died,

4900
02:17:27.101 --> 02:17:28.270
I'm like three fucking people.

4901
02:17:28.271 --> 02:17:29.680
That's a lot of people lost their legs.

4902
02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:32.430
That is the thing scattered out and blew people's legs apart.

4903
02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:33.900
My point being that we,

4904
02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:38.590
we do that in other places with innocent people everyday and we don't,

4905
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:43.270
I wish we had one 10th of the iter that we had when that happened in Boston.

4906
02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:43.841
You know what I mean?

4907
02:17:43.841 --> 02:17:44.630
It's just like,

4908
02:17:44.630 --> 02:17:48.280
it's like just a separation of us as humans that because it happened somewhere

4909
02:17:48.281 --> 02:17:48.850
else,

4910
02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:52.040
that all of a sudden we're not responsible or accountable in some ways really.

4911
02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:54.500
It's also interesting how we choose to like marginalize,

4912
02:17:54.810 --> 02:17:56.110
modularize the numbers.

4913
02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:57.310
You remember when the first,

4914
02:17:57.311 --> 02:17:58.330
the war first started?

4915
02:17:58.510 --> 02:17:59.231
I don't know if you remember,

4916
02:17:59.231 --> 02:18:00.064
but I remember,

4917
02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:00.580
um,

4918
02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:02.470
the first deaths that were coming in,

4919
02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:05.500
they were telling you about the desk and the reason why they were telling you

4920
02:18:05.501 --> 02:18:09.940
about the desk is because our last experience with war was like the craziest

4921
02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:15.090
Mike Tyson first round victory ever thought Iraq is literally like,

4922
02:18:15.401 --> 02:18:17.980
we went over there and fucking Mike Tyson's,

4923
02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.690
you just destroyed them there.

4924
02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:21.520
Their whole army was gone within a couple of weeks.

4925
02:18:21.521 --> 02:18:23.560
And the only people that that died,

4926
02:18:23.890 --> 02:18:26.950
I think there was a couple that had died before,

4927
02:18:26.970 --> 02:18:27.310
uh,

4928
02:18:27.310 --> 02:18:31.360
the big accident where a Scud missile and hit a base and killed a bunch of

4929
02:18:31.361 --> 02:18:33.160
people that were all in one area.

4930
02:18:33.161 --> 02:18:34.240
And that was like the big,

4931
02:18:34.241 --> 02:18:37.180
that was like 79 hit somebody that was a complete accident.

4932
02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.190
Looks random.

4933
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.401
Yeah,

4934
02:18:39.401 --> 02:18:40.420
I think it was,

4935
02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:41.050
you know,

4936
02:18:41.050 --> 02:18:41.391
but,

4937
02:18:41.391 --> 02:18:42.340
but that was,

4938
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:43.540
that was the big loss.

4939
02:18:43.540 --> 02:18:46.810
And so I think people anticipated there was going to be the same sort of thing

4940
02:18:46.811 --> 02:18:47.141
again.

4941
02:18:47.141 --> 02:18:47.951
We'd go in there if you,

4942
02:18:47.951 --> 02:18:48.730
people would die.

4943
02:18:48.730 --> 02:18:49.450
Oh,

4944
02:18:49.450 --> 02:18:50.440
why can't believe they died?

4945
02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:52.720
But everybody was in such a nine 11 fervor.

4946
02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:54.190
You know there was everywhere you go,

4947
02:18:54.191 --> 02:18:56.830
they have American flags are hanging out on people's cars,

4948
02:18:56.980 --> 02:18:59.590
but then after a while they stop telling you about those people.

4949
02:18:59.890 --> 02:19:00.571
They just stopped,

4950
02:19:00.571 --> 02:19:03.580
the numbers kept piling up and they just stopped talking about it.

4951
02:19:03.581 --> 02:19:05.590
It wasn't like a thing where they were going to tell you every day,

4952
02:19:05.591 --> 02:19:06.130
three,

4953
02:19:06.130 --> 02:19:08.260
three marines die in Afghanistan can usually,

4954
02:19:08.261 --> 02:19:09.610
you'll see it a little sidebar,

4955
02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:13.840
but you'll see a big one about some crazy bitches stabbed her boyfriend or I see

4956
02:19:13.841 --> 02:19:16.540
another one about some chicken drowned her kid or you know,

4957
02:19:16.541 --> 02:19:20.800
or did this or left a baby in a car and they'll just dwell and follow that

4958
02:19:20.801 --> 02:19:24.160
person that hounded about this Zimmerman Trayvon Martin thing.

4959
02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:28.070
You know the divisiveness between the two races and how people are so

4960
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:30.260
<v 0>invested in one side or another being correct.</v>

4961
02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:31.640
Fascinating Shit,

4962
02:19:31.641 --> 02:19:35.690
but a massive distraction in terms of the overall population of the human race.

4963
02:19:36.090 --> 02:19:38.750
If you look at what the Fuck Evil Shit is going on right now,

4964
02:19:38.751 --> 02:19:41.420
one questionable death does not merit.

4965
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:42.470
I mean,

4966
02:19:42.470 --> 02:19:45.110
it merits people paying attention to it,

4967
02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:46.430
but it doesn't merit any anymore.

4968
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:50.300
Then some people that die because of a drone attack that we're guilty of

4969
02:19:50.301 --> 02:19:52.880
anything but being poor and living in Pakistan,

4970
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:54.140
those fucking people died.

4971
02:19:54.141 --> 02:19:55.100
Two men and they,

4972
02:19:55.101 --> 02:19:55.790
you know,

4973
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:58.580
families and their lives and they don't even get,

4974
02:19:58.610 --> 02:20:00.170
there's no talk about them at all.

4975
02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:01.340
I mean it occasionally,

4976
02:20:01.341 --> 02:20:03.230
it's a number that someone will bring up,

4977
02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:04.370
but no one's like,

4978
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:05.900
<v 6>and if you do talk about it,</v>

4979
02:20:05.901 --> 02:20:09.470
your label to a conspiracy theorist or a psychopath and it's like,

4980
02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:12.650
how has me caring about human fucking life?

4981
02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:15.080
What are you talking about that,

4982
02:20:15.090 --> 02:20:18.080
that it's like the idea that being a liberal is somehow a bad word.

4983
02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:18.870
It's like that.

4984
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:20.180
It means free thinker.

4985
02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:22.460
If you study etymology of fucking words,

4986
02:20:22.461 --> 02:20:24.670
you dolt we wouldn't walk by,

4987
02:20:24.671 --> 02:20:25.191
I came,

4988
02:20:25.191 --> 02:20:25.551
you know,

4989
02:20:25.551 --> 02:20:28.100
a bad thing and on the tip all that too,

4990
02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:29.600
like I want to give,

4991
02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:30.441
you know,

4992
02:20:30.441 --> 02:20:31.970
Duke credence and respect and,

4993
02:20:31.971 --> 02:20:32.141
and,

4994
02:20:32.141 --> 02:20:33.010
and thanks to,

4995
02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:34.880
to all those people that are there that are,

4996
02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:37.220
that are put in an intolerable situation,

4997
02:20:37.221 --> 02:20:39.500
making a fucking decision.

4998
02:20:39.501 --> 02:20:42.800
I wouldn't want to have to make and whether it's like my friend Brian Stann

4999
02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:43.460
kicker,

5000
02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:44.560
Tommy Truex,

5001
02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:45.381
don Trey home,

5002
02:20:45.381 --> 02:20:45.851
my cousins,

5003
02:20:45.851 --> 02:20:46.700
Spence Fletcher,

5004
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:48.140
all you guys,

5005
02:20:48.141 --> 02:20:49.370
everybody that's gone and served.

5006
02:20:49.371 --> 02:20:50.360
Thank you so much.

5007
02:20:50.390 --> 02:20:51.180
And uh,

5008
02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:52.100
and you know,

5009
02:20:52.101 --> 02:20:52.301
I'm,

5010
02:20:52.301 --> 02:20:52.391
I'm,

5011
02:20:52.391 --> 02:20:54.440
I'm just glad I've never been in that position and,

5012
02:20:54.450 --> 02:20:54.741
and I,

5013
02:20:54.741 --> 02:20:57.980
and I respect your decision to be on the front lines there.

5014
02:20:57.981 --> 02:21:01.730
Cause I know that every guy that I know that ever signed up has done so with

5015
02:21:01.950 --> 02:21:05.530
America and those kinds of ideals of what we've been built on in America in

5016
02:21:05.531 --> 02:21:06.440
their hearts will

5017
02:21:06.970 --> 02:21:11.210
<v 0>the has been propounded Tillman story when Pat Tillman went over there right</v>

5018
02:21:11.211 --> 02:21:12.150
after nine 11 back.

5019
02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:14.880
Pat Tillman was a huge NFL star and some mother fucker.

5020
02:21:14.881 --> 02:21:17.000
It looks like a Barbie doll or Ken Rather.

5021
02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:17.834
Sorry.

5022
02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:19.820
I want to thank brevity Manny,

5023
02:21:19.821 --> 02:21:20.960
the Bradley mandates that are out there.

5024
02:21:20.961 --> 02:21:21.131
Got,

5025
02:21:21.131 --> 02:21:21.381
damn,

5026
02:21:21.381 --> 02:21:22.760
that's a fucking American hero.

5027
02:21:23.210 --> 02:21:24.440
There's a real problem with that,

5028
02:21:24.441 --> 02:21:24.860
huh?

5029
02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:25.970
It was a real problem with that.

5030
02:21:25.971 --> 02:21:28.610
And you take that kid and lock him in solitary confinement,

5031
02:21:28.690 --> 02:21:30.680
cold room with no clothes for three years.

5032
02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:32.150
Don't let him talk to anybody.

5033
02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:32.631
Yeah.

5034
02:21:32.631 --> 02:21:35.240
Anybody that doesn't mention his name as a hero on Memorial Day.

5035
02:21:35.390 --> 02:21:35.990
Well these,

5036
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.651
none of that.

5037
02:21:36.651 --> 02:21:40.010
Like think of the horrible things that people have done in this country.

5038
02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:43.310
The horrible things that Dick Cheney probably did and the fact that

5039
02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:49.370
he put this kid and they locked him in solitary fucking confider for years for

5040
02:21:49.371 --> 02:21:52.610
releasing information about something that was clearly wrong that he felt he

5041
02:21:52.611 --> 02:21:53.444
needed to do.

5042
02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:56.390
And if you look at what actually got exposed,

5043
02:21:56.530 --> 02:21:58.130
well the things that got exposed,

5044
02:21:58.131 --> 02:21:58.551
first of all,

5045
02:21:58.551 --> 02:22:00.710
the names were names that were already released.

5046
02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:02.150
Those are the only names that they released.

5047
02:22:02.390 --> 02:22:04.490
But then the information itself to go exposed,

5048
02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:06.530
it's something that people really needed to deal with.

5049
02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:09.680
The really needed to deal with the attitudes that those helicopter fighter

5050
02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:13.610
pilots had about killing those kids that were like when they found that there

5051
02:22:13.611 --> 02:22:14.361
were kids in the van,

5052
02:22:14.361 --> 02:22:14.541
they're like,

5053
02:22:14.541 --> 02:22:15.630
well I should have brought their kids.

5054
02:22:15.631 --> 02:22:16.280
It's like,

5055
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:17.091
whoa man.

5056
02:22:17.091 --> 02:22:17.570
Like that.

5057
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:19.490
That's not what we think of when we think of America.

5058
02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:19.701
Right.

5059
02:22:19.701 --> 02:22:20.450
You know,

5060
02:22:20.450 --> 02:22:21.890
that shit needs to be exposed.

5061
02:22:21.891 --> 02:22:23.750
And if you are a true patriot,

5062
02:22:23.751 --> 02:22:25.620
you would be happy that that was exposed.

5063
02:22:25.621 --> 02:22:26.010
And if you

5064
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.660
<v 5>felt like that guy committed a crime,</v>

5065
02:22:28.050 --> 02:22:31.000
maybe he needs to be prosecuted for some sort of a crime that,

5066
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:33.000
but it's not what you're doing to them.

5067
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:36.630
It's not locking them naked for three fucking years without getting to talk to

5068
02:22:36.631 --> 02:22:36.781
me.

5069
02:22:36.781 --> 02:22:39.960
But you tell me that it's worth than what Marie worst and what Bernie Madoff

5070
02:22:39.961 --> 02:22:40.794
did.

5071
02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:41.690
They said,

5072
02:22:41.690 --> 02:22:45.620
how come Bernie Madoff gets clothes and food and gets to hang a lawyer?

5073
02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:46.770
A lawyer gets a lawyer.

5074
02:22:47.210 --> 02:22:47.850
How about,

5075
02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:51.450
how about the gift card due to the Patriot Act and diluting the NDA,

5076
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:53.100
they can infinitely detain you.

5077
02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:53.720
They can do,

5078
02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:56.310
they can detain you and definitely they can do whatever they want.

5079
02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:59.040
You don't have to even tell your family you're not the presidential execution

5080
02:22:59.041 --> 02:22:59.311
orders.

5081
02:22:59.311 --> 02:23:00.144
Now,

5082
02:23:00.430 --> 02:23:02.040
that's scary stuff.

5083
02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:02.910
Well,

5084
02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:04.110
that's the other thing with Trump's,

5085
02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:06.120
they've killed four people for Americans.

5086
02:23:06.121 --> 02:23:08.230
It's been greenlit.

5087
02:23:08.310 --> 02:23:10.640
Those guys like Obama's killed.

5088
02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:13.800
This came out through the New York Times and there's all these names on there

5089
02:23:13.801 --> 02:23:14.370
and they're like,

5090
02:23:14.370 --> 02:23:14.671
oh yeah,

5091
02:23:14.671 --> 02:23:15.960
these two guys that happened to die,

5092
02:23:15.961 --> 02:23:16.240
they,

5093
02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:17.890
they're American citizens that are abroad,

5094
02:23:17.891 --> 02:23:19.860
Bill and we murdered them,

5095
02:23:19.861 --> 02:23:21.060
we assassinated them.

5096
02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:22.280
However,

5097
02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:24.570
and we didn't give them due process at all,

5098
02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:26.160
but we didn't need to because they're off the borders.

5099
02:23:26.370 --> 02:23:28.140
Well then they start doing that in the United States.

5100
02:23:28.141 --> 02:23:32.310
You look at that fucking crazy cop that they shot like four other people that

5101
02:23:32.311 --> 02:23:34.630
they didn't mean to before they burned him alive in the cabin.

5102
02:23:34.631 --> 02:23:35.700
And you know what I mean?

5103
02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:40.510
It's like that seems odd that there's obviously a kill order on that guy there

5104
02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:44.140
he shot people that were delivering newspapers crazy that weren't even the right

5105
02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:44.560
color.

5106
02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:46.800
Color looks like ll cool j for fuck sake.

5107
02:23:46.801 --> 02:23:49.320
And they shoot some surfer guy and then adapt and lady,

5108
02:23:49.321 --> 02:23:49.920
it's like,

5109
02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:50.850
that seems odd.

5110
02:23:50.850 --> 02:23:51.211
They're just,

5111
02:23:51.211 --> 02:23:52.920
they're very hot about getting this guy.

5112
02:23:52.921 --> 02:23:53.550
I get,

5113
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:57.240
I have a buddy who has friends in the intelligence business and he's like,

5114
02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:57.661
you know,

5115
02:23:57.661 --> 02:24:00.600
it was really a wake up call for a lot of people cause they're like that's a

5116
02:24:00.601 --> 02:24:03.420
terrible thing that happened because they had those comms shitting themselves

5117
02:24:03.450 --> 02:24:05.670
and it really alerted people to the fact that hey,

5118
02:24:05.930 --> 02:24:09.210
wouldn't be too hard to make a lot of fucking noise if one guy could do

5119
02:24:09.211 --> 02:24:12.420
something like that one crazy Christopher dormer met or you know,

5120
02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:17.310
military trained former police officer who's giant can do something like that.

5121
02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:21.630
What could a team of 10 guys from another country too and that are well trained

5122
02:24:21.631 --> 02:24:22.530
to work in unison?

5123
02:24:22.531 --> 02:24:23.790
It's Goddamn Chuck Norris movies,

5124
02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:24.750
dammit.

5125
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:26.570
You better get those denim stretch jeans on,

5126
02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:27.443
get working.

5127
02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:28.021
But that,

5128
02:24:28.021 --> 02:24:29.750
that's the problem too with Boston is in,

5129
02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:30.541
in that way,

5130
02:24:30.541 --> 02:24:34.180
in the same way that people are like he didn't get in.

5131
02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:37.100
And I don't want to argue about like whether you need your brand or rites

5132
02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:39.300
written and then like a special circumstance,

5133
02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:39.760
whatever,

5134
02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:40.593
go fuck yourself.

5135
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:44.760
But the fucking fact is is that if you're not worried that there's tanks in the

5136
02:24:44.761 --> 02:24:48.060
street and that there's people that are going with m forest door to door with

5137
02:24:48.061 --> 02:24:48.661
flak jackets,

5138
02:24:48.661 --> 02:24:52.230
I'm that could pull you out and need you to comply right now and they could do

5139
02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:56.970
illegal search and seizure and all that happened because this act happened and

5140
02:24:56.971 --> 02:25:00.420
that's not terrifying to you then you're no fucking American doing there again.

5141
02:25:00.750 --> 02:25:03.180
It's so crazy.

5142
02:25:03.570 --> 02:25:05.010
It's all a mistake,

5143
02:25:05.370 --> 02:25:05.790
you know,

5144
02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:06.290
and the,

5145
02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:11.290
the big issue clearly is why are people so angry and broken that they're willing

5146
02:25:11.341 --> 02:25:12.440
to do horrific things?

5147
02:25:12.810 --> 02:25:16.650
Not The big issue is not like give these people that are quote unquote the

5148
02:25:16.651 --> 02:25:19.860
government ultimate control of your life to protect you from things like that

5149
02:25:19.861 --> 02:25:20.580
happening.

5150
02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:21.930
That's not the answer.

5151
02:25:21.931 --> 02:25:24.250
The answer is figuring out what is

5152
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:28.150
<v 1>wrong with the mental health of human beings that allows a certain percentage of</v>

5153
02:25:28.151 --> 02:25:29.020
them to go postal.

5154
02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:29.880
What does it,

5155
02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:31.450
how do you make people more resilient?

5156
02:25:31.530 --> 02:25:35.890
It is the core because you have to make them do you mean by more resilient?

5157
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:37.450
I don't even think it's an accountability thing.

5158
02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:40.750
If your nervous system does stupid shit before he had a chance to notice it

5159
02:25:40.751 --> 02:25:41.261
happening,

5160
02:25:41.261 --> 02:25:43.190
which is the reason a lot of these people do stuff it,

5161
02:25:43.191 --> 02:25:44.870
it's happening on automated pilot.

5162
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:48.460
They develop their whole life doing a bunch of stupid shit and it becomes like

5163
02:25:48.461 --> 02:25:49.770
automated it.

5164
02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:51.610
They'd go to stupid shit first.

5165
02:25:51.611 --> 02:25:55.580
I do self destructive things first because it's programmed in their brain,

5166
02:25:55.581 --> 02:25:57.580
it's programmed in before they can think about it.

5167
02:25:57.581 --> 02:26:00.040
So you can hold someone accountable for what their nervous system did when they

5168
02:26:00.041 --> 02:26:00.641
weren't looking,

5169
02:26:00.641 --> 02:26:01.680
which is what happens for a lot of these.

5170
02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:02.230
So when you,

5171
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:04.390
when you grow up in a shit environment like that,

5172
02:26:04.391 --> 02:26:07.750
by the time you get to a certain age and a lot of respects your program to a

5173
02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:11.110
terrible way and it's an incredibly difficult thing to reprogram,

5174
02:26:11.111 --> 02:26:11.740
how do you,

5175
02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:13.000
and it's actually not that hard.

5176
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:16.330
That's why I'm into these things like neuro feedback and hooking computers up

5177
02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:18.730
your head and showing your brain where it's not behaving well.

5178
02:26:18.731 --> 02:26:21.510
Your brain as an organ self optimizes.

5179
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:22.840
How's that help you?

5180
02:26:22.841 --> 02:26:24.770
If you're a kid and you're living in the hood and your,

5181
02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:25.390
your,

5182
02:26:25.390 --> 02:26:26.980
your mentality is all fucked up.

5183
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:28.860
You grow up in a really violent environment.

5184
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:29.001
<v 3>Well,</v>

5185
02:26:29.001 --> 02:26:31.400
here's how in a study,

5186
02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:34.610
and this was with a group called brain state,

5187
02:26:34.850 --> 02:26:39.850
there's two states in the u s that don't have basically publicly owned or

5188
02:26:40.970 --> 02:26:42.350
privately owned prisons.

5189
02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:44.930
So you have these publicly traded prison companies that run things.

5190
02:26:44.931 --> 02:26:46.730
So the two states where they don't have this,

5191
02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.790
these guys went in and they did a test and they said,

5192
02:26:49.791 --> 02:26:53.420
give us 10 hours of neurofeedback on people and see what happens.

5193
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:55.820
90% reduction in recidivism.

5194
02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:58.250
So they're taking people who are not only in prison,

5195
02:26:58.251 --> 02:26:59.480
but they're trained in prisons,

5196
02:26:59.481 --> 02:27:00.111
be criminals.

5197
02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:01.610
Most criminals go back to prison.

5198
02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:04.400
10 hours of being hooked up to a machine,

5199
02:27:04.401 --> 02:27:08.600
letting their brains fixed themselves without even having to do any real

5200
02:27:08.601 --> 02:27:09.710
conscious effort there.

5201
02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:11.090
Changes everything.

5202
02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:14.420
I met another girl from an incredibly wrecked family,

5203
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:15.770
like her whole,

5204
02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:16.350
she was,

5205
02:27:16.350 --> 02:27:17.183
um,

5206
02:27:17.310 --> 02:27:19.040
a first nations person in Canada.

5207
02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:20.960
This is like the local equivalent of American Indians,

5208
02:27:21.350 --> 02:27:22.790
alcoholics in the family,

5209
02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:23.653
like you know,

5210
02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:26.150
relatives with horrible violent deaths in front of her,

5211
02:27:26.151 --> 02:27:28.040
like all the things that fuck you up,

5212
02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:31.730
one neurofeedback session for seven days.

5213
02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:34.340
She becomes Valedictorian at our school,

5214
02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:39.400
stops drinking and completely cleaned herself up so you can get in at the

5215
02:27:39.471 --> 02:27:43.070
nervous system level underneath the conscious thing and you can undo an enormous

5216
02:27:43.071 --> 02:27:45.410
amount of damage and you can build people that are resilient.

5217
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:46.910
So even when bad stuff happens,

5218
02:27:46.911 --> 02:27:48.410
they don't turn into murdering psychos.

5219
02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:52.010
We've got to start doing this stuff for people because we're putting stresses on

5220
02:27:52.011 --> 02:27:52.760
people that

5221
02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:53.440
<v 1>never,</v>

5222
02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:54.520
ever meant to take.

5223
02:27:54.521 --> 02:27:55.470
My point is though,

5224
02:27:55.471 --> 02:27:56.770
is that sociologically,

5225
02:27:56.771 --> 02:28:01.771
the reason I say accountability is because it's like I want the Tsa to take care

5226
02:28:02.051 --> 02:28:03.160
of me if I'm on a plane,

5227
02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:05.830
therefore I don't have to stand up.

5228
02:28:05.831 --> 02:28:08.080
If somebody is coming with a razor blade down the aisle way,

5229
02:28:08.410 --> 02:28:09.011
you know what I mean?

5230
02:28:09.011 --> 02:28:10.570
All that kind of work that I need.

5231
02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:12.190
I need the police to take care of me.

5232
02:28:12.191 --> 02:28:15.340
And it's like the more government interest has in us in that way.

5233
02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:16.271
The more we're like,

5234
02:28:16.271 --> 02:28:19.750
well that's somebody else's providence so we never dust off and get up and stand

5235
02:28:19.751 --> 02:28:20.650
up for anybody,

5236
02:28:20.651 --> 02:28:22.510
let each other or ourselves,

5237
02:28:22.511 --> 02:28:23.690
what kind of ability has to come from it.

5238
02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:25.460
That's what I mean,

5239
02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:28.450
like having someone else hold you accountable is a worse mood.

5240
02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:28.880
Right,

5241
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:29.060
right,

5242
02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:29.231
right,

5243
02:28:29.231 --> 02:28:29.411
right,

5244
02:28:29.411 --> 02:28:29.631
right,

5245
02:28:29.631 --> 02:28:29.930
right,

5246
02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:30.211
right,

5247
02:28:30.211 --> 02:28:30.670
right.

5248
02:28:30.670 --> 02:28:32.100
But I mean it's like there's,

5249
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:34.010
I've got to take care of me and I've got to take care of it.

5250
02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:34.831
<v 6>It's like my friend,</v>

5251
02:28:34.831 --> 02:28:39.780
a dear friend that I looked up to and he got schizophrenia later in life and his

5252
02:28:39.781 --> 02:28:41.910
mom is a woman that helped raise me and I,

5253
02:28:41.911 --> 02:28:43.030
I've been wanting to go and,

5254
02:28:43.031 --> 02:28:43.740
and uh,

5255
02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:47.070
and just thank her and kind of revere her for me being the man I am and her

5256
02:28:47.071 --> 02:28:48.000
influence in my life.

5257
02:28:48.001 --> 02:28:50.340
And she's dying of cancer and she's in her,

5258
02:28:50.430 --> 02:28:50.790
you know,

5259
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:52.830
she's in like a third stage chemotherapy.

5260
02:28:52.831 --> 02:28:55.260
And then two weeks ago on top of all of that,

5261
02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:55.800
this,

5262
02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.700
this guy that I'd always looked up to and kind of revered who can't,

5263
02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:00.900
who's got mental problems,

5264
02:29:00.901 --> 02:29:01.171
man,

5265
02:29:01.171 --> 02:29:03.550
he lit himself on fire and um,

5266
02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:06.060
and burned off 85% of his skin was,

5267
02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:09.510
stayed alive for three days afterwards before they pulled the plug.

5268
02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:10.501
And,

5269
02:29:10.501 --> 02:29:11.334
uh,

5270
02:29:11.370 --> 02:29:11.650
and,

5271
02:29:11.650 --> 02:29:12.600
and with,

5272
02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:13.860
with all that,

5273
02:29:13.861 --> 02:29:14.221
it's like,

5274
02:29:14.221 --> 02:29:16.190
you look at who,

5275
02:29:16.370 --> 02:29:17.610
who are we taking care of now?

5276
02:29:17.610 --> 02:29:18.570
He's got four kids,

5277
02:29:18.571 --> 02:29:18.751
you know,

5278
02:29:18.751 --> 02:29:19.230
and like,

5279
02:29:19.230 --> 02:29:19.831
I feel,

5280
02:29:19.831 --> 02:29:20.220
I don't,

5281
02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:21.360
I know his oldest boy,

5282
02:29:21.361 --> 02:29:22.141
but like,

5283
02:29:22.141 --> 02:29:26.250
I feel tremendous responsibility to that community as somebody that I've loved

5284
02:29:26.251 --> 02:29:28.200
and grown up with in that like,

5285
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.531
you know,

5286
02:29:28.531 --> 02:29:28.691
and,

5287
02:29:28.691 --> 02:29:30.570
and so giving to a fund for them,

5288
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:31.890
and I'll give every,

5289
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:32.970
every bit I can,

5290
02:29:32.971 --> 02:29:33.691
whenever I can,

5291
02:29:33.691 --> 02:29:34.710
but it's like,

5292
02:29:35.310 --> 02:29:37.710
where do I have responsibility for my community instead of going,

5293
02:29:37.711 --> 02:29:39.150
where's my government to take care of him?

5294
02:29:39.151 --> 02:29:39.691
You know what I mean?

5295
02:29:39.691 --> 02:29:41.040
It's like all those kinds of things.

5296
02:29:41.041 --> 02:29:43.620
It's like we need to take care of each other in that way.

5297
02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:44.640
And that's what I mean.

5298
02:29:44.641 --> 02:29:46.260
I guess when I say a heightened response,

5299
02:29:46.261 --> 02:29:46.530
yeah,

5300
02:29:46.530 --> 02:29:47.460
<v 1>you're my community.</v>

5301
02:29:47.550 --> 02:29:51.270
You're accountable for what happens around you instead of some random entity

5302
02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:53.070
that's going to help you,

5303
02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:54.690
certainly kind of a for yourself.

5304
02:29:54.691 --> 02:29:57.890
The problem is if you grow up in that terrible environment with a Bot once a

5305
02:29:57.891 --> 02:30:01.020
really negative influences and you were programmed in a horrible way,

5306
02:30:01.290 --> 02:30:05.340
it's super hard to fucking snap out of that were hard to get your momentum.

5307
02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.490
It's nearly impossible to do it and see,

5308
02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:08.391
just give up.

5309
02:30:08.391 --> 02:30:08.810
I had my,

5310
02:30:08.810 --> 02:30:09.091
and go,

5311
02:30:09.091 --> 02:30:09.511
whatever,

5312
02:30:09.511 --> 02:30:12.360
fucking let the system take me and surround yourself with a bunch of other

5313
02:30:12.361 --> 02:30:13.194
losers.

5314
02:30:14.170 --> 02:30:15.950
I'll rob this one last bank and we'll see.

5315
02:30:15.970 --> 02:30:17.730
And either they'll get me or I'll be okay and what,

5316
02:30:17.850 --> 02:30:18.900
or whatever the thing is.

5317
02:30:18.901 --> 02:30:19.160
You know,

5318
02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:19.381
I mean,

5319
02:30:19.381 --> 02:30:20.400
you get helpless.

5320
02:30:20.401 --> 02:30:21.660
It's like my mom would always talk about,

5321
02:30:21.930 --> 02:30:22.121
oh,

5322
02:30:22.121 --> 02:30:22.954
the Islamics,

5323
02:30:22.970 --> 02:30:23.430
uh,

5324
02:30:23.430 --> 02:30:26.560
crazy people that are going to fucking run anybody that'll strap a bomb to

5325
02:30:26.561 --> 02:30:26.910
themselves.

5326
02:30:26.910 --> 02:30:27.600
I'm like,

5327
02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:29.430
I just see that as a frustrated dude.

5328
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:29.701
Like,

5329
02:30:29.701 --> 02:30:30.570
that's not insane.

5330
02:30:30.810 --> 02:30:31.291
I mean that's,

5331
02:30:31.291 --> 02:30:33.840
that's a sociologically induced insanity then in that,

5332
02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:36.900
that's somebody that feels so powerless that they'll do that.

5333
02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:40.740
Like most of those guys with bombs also like their wife has a gun to their head.

5334
02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:42.510
It's a bit of a problem there too.

5335
02:30:45.570 --> 02:30:46.800
It's a hard knock life.

5336
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:48.720
I was Mike Tyson,

5337
02:30:48.721 --> 02:30:50.700
you got to hang out with Mike Tyson.

5338
02:30:50.701 --> 02:30:52.290
Did you talk to him for a bit or anything?

5339
02:30:52.770 --> 02:30:52.951
Yeah,

5340
02:30:52.951 --> 02:30:55.080
it was pretty bad ass because he's been doing comedy at the comedy.

5341
02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:56.100
No Way.

5342
02:30:56.170 --> 02:30:57.420
He's amazing when stand up.

5343
02:30:57.480 --> 02:30:58.170
Yeah.

5344
02:30:58.170 --> 02:30:59.940
Like the last two nights or something.

5345
02:30:59.941 --> 02:31:00.571
That's interesting.

5346
02:31:00.571 --> 02:31:01.280
Well,

5347
02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:02.490
we're going tonight bro.

5348
02:31:03.330 --> 02:31:04.470
He does his show.

5349
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:05.160
Um,

5350
02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.990
he's got a show like where he,

5351
02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:09.960
he like does a story and talks about his whole life.

5352
02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:11.210
Damn.

5353
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:12.320
Apparently it's fucking amazing.

5354
02:31:12.330 --> 02:31:15.300
I got to meet sugar ray Leonard and he was amazing to talk to.

5355
02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:16.020
Yeah.

5356
02:31:16.020 --> 02:31:16.500
Yeah.

5357
02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:18.920
Same kind of like that kind of like those,

5358
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:20.070
that kind of fame as

5359
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.700
<v 5>an athlete,</v>

5360
02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:21.780
as a singular athlete.

5361
02:31:21.781 --> 02:31:22.081
Like you're not,

5362
02:31:22.081 --> 02:31:23.340
you're not a ballplayer or something,

5363
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:23.850
but,

5364
02:31:23.850 --> 02:31:24.750
but guys like that,

5365
02:31:24.751 --> 02:31:26.320
those are uncommon dudes.

5366
02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:26.551
Like,

5367
02:31:26.551 --> 02:31:27.450
that's a whole,

5368
02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:28.710
that's the life of a rock star.

5369
02:31:28.711 --> 02:31:32.030
Like I'm buying out the top two floors of the MGM grand and,

5370
02:31:32.031 --> 02:31:33.570
and people that don't even know our stain,

5371
02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:34.460
like that's,

5372
02:31:34.470 --> 02:31:36.510
those are hundred million dollar fights.

5373
02:31:36.511 --> 02:31:37.111
Shit like that.

5374
02:31:37.111 --> 02:31:38.160
That's crazy.

5375
02:31:38.430 --> 02:31:41.370
So let me bring up some coffee stuff because people in my message,

5376
02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:43.650
they want to have this addressed.

5377
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:44.703
Um,

5378
02:31:44.730 --> 02:31:45.690
one of them says both

5379
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:49.790
<v 0>studies found an incidence rate of approximately 50% for the,</v>

5380
02:31:49.791 --> 02:31:49.991
Oh,

5381
02:31:49.991 --> 02:31:54.590
it please stop that for the incident for the approximately 50% for the Oh,

5382
02:31:54.591 --> 02:31:57.980
a producing mold at wildly different concentrations,

5383
02:31:57.981 --> 02:32:02.981
minimum of Otu Ppb in one study and a maximum of 7.8 ppb in another.

5384
02:32:03.650 --> 02:32:04.970
This tells me anything.

5385
02:32:04.971 --> 02:32:06.230
If this tells me anything at all,

5386
02:32:06.231 --> 02:32:09.170
it's that you should probably vary your source if you want to minimize your

5387
02:32:09.171 --> 02:32:09.830
risk.

5388
02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:13.860
And either the FDA or the FSA actually has a legal limit for OAA,

5389
02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:15.410
but the e f s a,

5390
02:32:15.411 --> 02:32:16.730
whenever the fuck these things are,

5391
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:18.950
suggests a limit of eight.

5392
02:32:19.570 --> 02:32:23.300
It looks like a u eight Ugi k g,

5393
02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:28.070
which means that even the worst samples are below the very conservative legal

5394
02:32:28.071 --> 02:32:28.904
limit.

5395
02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:29.950
So you would have to judge,

5396
02:32:29.951 --> 02:32:34.640
study one study actually tested the incidents of Oaa and brewed coffee,

5397
02:32:34.641 --> 02:32:35.630
not just the beans,

5398
02:32:35.631 --> 02:32:39.170
and found a maximum of 7.8 ppb in the brew.

5399
02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:44.000
That seven point a Ugi per one kilogram for ground coffee based on the worst

5400
02:32:44.001 --> 02:32:45.380
contamination of brewed coffee,

5401
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:47.990
7.8 doing the math,

5402
02:32:47.991 --> 02:32:52.970
you'd have to consume the brew from 150 grams of ground coffee per day.

5403
02:32:52.971 --> 02:32:57.971
That's about a half of a standard size 10 of coffee per day if he says if you

5404
02:32:58.041 --> 02:32:58.551
drink that much.

5405
02:32:58.551 --> 02:32:59.091
Same on you.

5406
02:32:59.091 --> 02:33:00.110
And the third study,

5407
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:01.430
uh,

5408
02:33:01.430 --> 02:33:03.260
looked at Alf,

5409
02:33:03.350 --> 02:33:04.010
Alf,

5410
02:33:04.010 --> 02:33:05.010
aflatoxin,

5411
02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:05.250
what?

5412
02:33:05.250 --> 02:33:05.600
Toxic,

5413
02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:07.050
not ORC toxin,

5414
02:33:07.770 --> 02:33:09.020
a toxin [inaudible] toxin,

5415
02:33:09.170 --> 02:33:13.460
which actually is regulated by the FDA and has a maximum of 20 ppb.

5416
02:33:13.461 --> 02:33:17.810
This study also showed that approximately 50% incident rate after roasting with

5417
02:33:17.811 --> 02:33:22.811
the highest concentration of ATP being 16 kg for Decaf less with caffeine.

5418
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:26.930
So that means with any random cup of coffee,

5419
02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:31.340
you have up to a 50% chance of consuming and amount of 80 that's still well

5420
02:33:31.341 --> 02:33:34.580
below the FDA limit and that's nearly zero.

5421
02:33:34.581 --> 02:33:38.480
Risk says none of the studies test the rate of the mold growth on beans while

5422
02:33:38.481 --> 02:33:39.770
storage and the various conditions,

5423
02:33:39.771 --> 02:33:40.131
temperature,

5424
02:33:40.131 --> 02:33:40.491
humidity,

5425
02:33:40.491 --> 02:33:41.240
et cetera.

5426
02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:43.160
So we can't comment on what happens in storage.

5427
02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:45.020
I guess if you really want to be on the safe side,

5428
02:33:45.021 --> 02:33:48.500
only buy as much coffee as you think you can can can use in a week or two.

5429
02:33:48.501 --> 02:33:49.280
Conclusion,

5430
02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:51.110
it says don't believe this is just what it says.

5431
02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:52.820
Don't believe everything that people tell you,

5432
02:33:52.821 --> 02:33:54.620
especially people with something to sell.

5433
02:33:54.621 --> 02:33:56.660
Unless you're drinking gallons of coffee a day,

5434
02:33:56.690 --> 02:33:59.090
gallons of coffee a day brewed coffee is perfectly safe.

5435
02:33:59.860 --> 02:34:00.580
<v 5>No,</v>

5436
02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:01.271
the the,

5437
02:34:01.271 --> 02:34:02.051
do I sell something?

5438
02:34:02.051 --> 02:34:02.291
Yeah,

5439
02:34:02.291 --> 02:34:04.210
I saw something that's not even important.

5440
02:34:04.211 --> 02:34:05.650
I I get tired of people saying that.

5441
02:34:05.651 --> 02:34:05.891
Yeah,

5442
02:34:05.891 --> 02:34:06.521
I saw stuff.

5443
02:34:06.521 --> 02:34:08.010
Can I say something

5444
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:10.660
on the science of it?

5445
02:34:10.661 --> 02:34:12.970
Is that all I know is like from anything,

5446
02:34:12.971 --> 02:34:14.860
whether it's a paleo diet or primal diet,

5447
02:34:14.861 --> 02:34:15.970
the zone diet or whatever.

5448
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:17.760
It's only because I've read that

5449
02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:19.050
<v 6>and if I've only read it,</v>

5450
02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:21.300
I all I have is his talking points,

5451
02:34:21.301 --> 02:34:22.290
but I,

5452
02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:23.310
I've been my own,

5453
02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:25.800
I've been my own experiment with all these things and,

5454
02:34:25.801 --> 02:34:28.950
and what I do notice in one of the most telling things when I got bulletproof

5455
02:34:28.951 --> 02:34:33.951
coffee is that when you asked me do you sometimes feel or you didn't ask,

5456
02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:34.261
<v 3>okay,</v>

5457
02:34:34.261 --> 02:34:34.561
hold on,

5458
02:34:34.561 --> 02:34:34.851
stop,

5459
02:34:34.851 --> 02:34:35.190
stop.

5460
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:36.030
No disrespect bro.

5461
02:34:36.090 --> 02:34:37.800
But I just put out some numbers.

5462
02:34:38.460 --> 02:34:40.110
I want them while they're fresh in his mind,

5463
02:34:40.111 --> 02:34:40.944
you got to respond to,

5464
02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:42.463
it's totally fine.

5465
02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:44.700
I mean you were talking about it from an anecdotal standpoint,

5466
02:34:44.701 --> 02:34:47.910
which is I know that it helped you and until I enjoyed bulletproof coffee,

5467
02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:49.080
but we got to answer this.

5468
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:53.760
So what he's talking about during stored storage of coffee and he was a little

5469
02:34:53.761 --> 02:34:58.140
confused because it's storage of green coffee where problems might happen and

5470
02:34:58.170 --> 02:35:01.080
controlled humidity levels and green coffee matter enormously.

5471
02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:02.041
That's why for instance,

5472
02:35:02.041 --> 02:35:03.060
Indonesian coffee,

5473
02:35:03.061 --> 02:35:04.050
which tastes really good,

5474
02:35:04.170 --> 02:35:06.360
has problems because it's stored with higher humidity.

5475
02:35:06.361 --> 02:35:07.380
They even age it there.

5476
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:09.570
So stuff does happen in green coffee.

5477
02:35:09.690 --> 02:35:13.080
But what's happening is actually happening during the process that turns it into

5478
02:35:13.081 --> 02:35:13.860
green coffee.

5479
02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:16.620
There's another set of toxins that come during the transport of coffee,

5480
02:35:16.621 --> 02:35:19.110
which is why how the coffee is bagged on.

5481
02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:19.891
It's a big container.

5482
02:35:19.891 --> 02:35:23.280
Ships actually affects what comes out of the roaster at the other end.

5483
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.360
Now this guy is relying on the FDA to tell him the safe amount of aflatoxin to

5484
02:35:27.361 --> 02:35:27.900
take.

5485
02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:29.940
Now that's a decision he may choose to make.

5486
02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:30.751
Frankly,

5487
02:35:30.751 --> 02:35:33.300
I don't really trust the FDA to keep my best interests at heart.

5488
02:35:33.690 --> 02:35:37.590
The FDA has also basically judging economics and safety.

5489
02:35:37.591 --> 02:35:41.040
This is the same FDA that tells you that a spartan is perfectly safe and healthy

5490
02:35:41.041 --> 02:35:41.341
for you,

5491
02:35:41.341 --> 02:35:42.660
which is complete bullshit.

5492
02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:44.370
So okay,

5493
02:35:44.371 --> 02:35:45.630
now the point is if it's,

5494
02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:46.770
it's somehow it's binary.

5495
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:48.060
If you have this level,

5496
02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:49.350
it's unsafe.

5497
02:35:49.350 --> 02:35:50.430
If you have this level,

5498
02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:51.750
it's perfectly safe.

5499
02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:53.820
That is not how biology works.

5500
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:57.150
So if your coffee has a level down here versus level down here,

5501
02:35:57.151 --> 02:35:58.080
what's the difference?

5502
02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:01.710
The difference is human performance and how you feel and how do I measure that?

5503
02:36:01.980 --> 02:36:02.311
Well,

5504
02:36:02.311 --> 02:36:07.290
we looked at a computerized cognitive battery and had people do a wash out and

5505
02:36:07.291 --> 02:36:10.680
we had 54 people in this study and they tried my coffee,

5506
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:14.100
which has zero detectable mycotoxins and other coffee,

5507
02:36:14.101 --> 02:36:17.940
which has under the safe limit and okay,

5508
02:36:17.941 --> 02:36:18.480
what happened?

5509
02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:18.661
Well,

5510
02:36:18.661 --> 02:36:22.470
we had better cognitive performance when they had coffee that had fewer toxins

5511
02:36:22.471 --> 02:36:23.190
in it.

5512
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:25.050
The idea that it's somehow safe to have this level,

5513
02:36:25.051 --> 02:36:28.030
but not this level is not correct having a bachelor.

5514
02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:31.560
But this is just stating by your tasks that it's not correct because it is

5515
02:36:31.561 --> 02:36:34.920
correct that some substances you can take a little bit of it and be fine and

5516
02:36:34.921 --> 02:36:36.450
take a large dose of it and be dead.

5517
02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:38.400
That's wandering like salt,

5518
02:36:38.790 --> 02:36:39.151
salt,

5519
02:36:39.151 --> 02:36:40.200
water or salt.

5520
02:36:40.201 --> 02:36:42.600
And you're a dead man and salts.

5521
02:36:42.601 --> 02:36:43.020
Important.

5522
02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:43.380
Right.

5523
02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:47.310
So the question is what's the effect of aflatoxins and Okra toxin on humans?

5524
02:36:47.550 --> 02:36:49.500
And I'm sorry,

5525
02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:51.210
but I just want to be clear.

5526
02:36:51.211 --> 02:36:54.450
So what you're saying is that even a small amount,

5527
02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:56.400
although your body may be able to handle it,

5528
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:57.660
your body's processing it,

5529
02:36:57.661 --> 02:36:59.370
it's still impedes performance.

5530
02:36:59.430 --> 02:37:00.210
Absolutely.

5531
02:37:00.210 --> 02:37:01.590
FDA is not addressing it.

5532
02:37:01.610 --> 02:37:02.910
They don't look at performance at all.

5533
02:37:02.970 --> 02:37:03.360
Like,

5534
02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:06.720
like basically is it going to kill you above a certain risk level that they deem

5535
02:37:06.721 --> 02:37:07.320
tolerable.

5536
02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:08.730
So they get it to a certain point they say,

5537
02:37:08.731 --> 02:37:09.150
okay,

5538
02:37:09.150 --> 02:37:11.160
other than this you might be getting poisoned.

5539
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:15.050
But if you just drank really shitty coffee,

5540
02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:16.010
don't drink

5541
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:18.830
<v 1>a half a tin of it in a day you're going to be okay.</v>

5542
02:37:18.890 --> 02:37:20.030
And you're saying that's not true.

5543
02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:20.631
It's not true.

5544
02:37:20.631 --> 02:37:22.310
What you're going to feel is you're going to feel anxiety.

5545
02:37:22.311 --> 02:37:26.150
And I get lots of people who just gave up coffee like I did because they felt

5546
02:37:26.151 --> 02:37:27.110
crappy when they drink it.

5547
02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:31.160
Who can drink perfectly clean coffee because different people have different

5548
02:37:31.161 --> 02:37:31.761
sensitivities.

5549
02:37:31.761 --> 02:37:34.250
And the other thing that this guy hasn't talked about with this numbers,

5550
02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:36.620
and this is well established and toxicology,

5551
02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:39.080
is that there's a synergism between mycotoxins.

5552
02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:40.920
So if you're getting x amount of aflatoxin,

5553
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:42.290
x amount of Okra toxin,

5554
02:37:42.291 --> 02:37:44.210
x amount of his Uralla known all together,

5555
02:37:44.390 --> 02:37:47.270
that they have a synergistic effect greater than the level of each one of them.

5556
02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:49.010
So I test for all those in my,

5557
02:37:49.011 --> 02:37:52.490
in my beans and there's zero detectable any of them and that's because of the

5558
02:37:52.491 --> 02:37:54.350
process that I engineered to create.

5559
02:37:54.350 --> 02:37:57.410
The beans themselves doesn't allow for their formation.

5560
02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:00.140
So places where they follow these other companies that are selling.

5561
02:38:00.141 --> 02:38:04.160
Michael talks like I saw one website that actually praised your idea for

5562
02:38:04.161 --> 02:38:04.851
bulletproof coffee,

5563
02:38:04.851 --> 02:38:09.530
which is your own invention based on what does it t that you drank with butters,

5564
02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:10.700
Tibetan yak butter tea,

5565
02:38:10.850 --> 02:38:12.470
but adding the upgraded MCT too,

5566
02:38:12.471 --> 02:38:15.950
it makes a huge difference and that's about mitochondrial function.

5567
02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:18.590
There really is a difference in the way it makes you feel.

5568
02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:22.430
And you've even said that there's other single source coffee that you can give

5569
02:38:22.431 --> 02:38:23.530
this micro toxin free,

5570
02:38:23.930 --> 02:38:24.380
clean,

5571
02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:25.213
go get it,

5572
02:38:25.490 --> 02:38:25.911
go get it.

5573
02:38:25.911 --> 02:38:27.920
If you think that bulletproof coffee is expensive,

5574
02:38:27.921 --> 02:38:30.590
so does that explain why bulletproof coffee is expensive?

5575
02:38:30.591 --> 02:38:32.340
It's like it's a difficult process.

5576
02:38:32.341 --> 02:38:33.500
It's your own process.

5577
02:38:33.530 --> 02:38:35.690
It's if you buy the five pound bag,

5578
02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:37.850
it's the same price as Starbucks coffee.

5579
02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:39.230
It's 15 bucks a pound.

5580
02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:41.360
Like it's not more expensive.

5581
02:38:41.450 --> 02:38:42.980
I don't understand where this is coming from.

5582
02:38:42.981 --> 02:38:44.090
If you're buying the small bags,

5583
02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:47.070
there's shipping involved and I don't know what to do to make shipping Laura,

5584
02:38:47.071 --> 02:38:48.620
but I lose money on shipping on that stuff.

5585
02:38:48.621 --> 02:38:50.300
I'm not gouging people on the coffee.

5586
02:38:50.301 --> 02:38:50.631
And in fact,

5587
02:38:50.631 --> 02:38:52.050
it's very fairly priced given to us.

5588
02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:52.821
It doesn't matter.

5589
02:38:52.821 --> 02:38:54.380
This is the Internet no matter what.

5590
02:38:54.470 --> 02:38:55.340
If the Internet,

5591
02:38:55.341 --> 02:38:56.061
if you're making money,

5592
02:38:56.061 --> 02:38:56.880
you're ripping somebody off.

5593
02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:57.110
Yeah,

5594
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:59.060
it has to be that there's no way I have a day job.

5595
02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:03.130
But you've thought about abandoning it and going forward.

5596
02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:04.100
Bulletproof life,

5597
02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:05.780
to be perfectly honest,

5598
02:39:05.781 --> 02:39:07.730
I just switched over to being a contractor in my day job,

5599
02:39:07.731 --> 02:39:08.690
literally like last week.

5600
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:09.051
Oh,

5601
02:39:09.051 --> 02:39:11.300
so you might eventually go 100% I'm sure.

5602
02:39:11.301 --> 02:39:11.751
Hoping to.

5603
02:39:11.751 --> 02:39:15.770
But I mean there's a quarter million words I wrote that are free online.

5604
02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:17.393
That's it.

5605
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:18.630
That's really important.

5606
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:18.891
That's,

5607
02:39:18.891 --> 02:39:20.900
people need to really realize that.

5608
02:39:20.901 --> 02:39:25.901
And also there's a lot of time involved in pursuing this much information and

5609
02:39:26.751 --> 02:39:27.201
people,

5610
02:39:27.201 --> 02:39:28.190
for whatever reason,

5611
02:39:28.310 --> 02:39:29.960
was just going to expert on everything.

5612
02:39:29.961 --> 02:39:31.550
That's like what's been said in my,

5613
02:39:32.100 --> 02:39:32.933
okay,

5614
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:33.270
but,

5615
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:34.220
but it's what it is,

5616
02:39:34.221 --> 02:39:38.150
is you're an expert on all these things that you've spent time researching and

5617
02:39:38.151 --> 02:39:41.450
you've accumulated a bunch of information on and look,

5618
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:42.710
there's,

5619
02:39:42.711 --> 02:39:46.070
there's something important about that and people need to get that in your head.

5620
02:39:46.071 --> 02:39:46.970
You're not going to do that.

5621
02:39:46.971 --> 02:39:47.810
You're not going to do that.

5622
02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:50.690
But he's going to do that and that is important.

5623
02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:53.930
But even if you making a dollar off it,

5624
02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:55.640
people just want to thank that somehow.

5625
02:39:55.650 --> 02:39:56.000
Another,

5626
02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.710
you're a fucking con artist.

5627
02:39:57.950 --> 02:40:02.510
It's really interesting because bottom line is if you want to drink some coffee,

5628
02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:04.490
that idea is the best idea.

5629
02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:09.290
The bulletproof coffee idea is the best idea and it tastes like when,

5630
02:40:09.291 --> 02:40:12.020
when you have the grass fed butter in it and you put a little Stevia take,

5631
02:40:12.021 --> 02:40:12.380
turn me on.

5632
02:40:12.380 --> 02:40:13.200
It's a little Stevia.

5633
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.033
Damn,

5634
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:15.480
it's fucking delicious.

5635
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:18.990
And it will give you a different kind of energy over a long period of title if

5636
02:40:18.991 --> 02:40:20.100
you'd like to have coffee.

5637
02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:22.530
But if you'd like to operate at a higher level,

5638
02:40:22.650 --> 02:40:23.310
it's like,

5639
02:40:23.310 --> 02:40:24.210
it's like even if you don't,

5640
02:40:24.330 --> 02:40:26.730
if vegetarianism made me feel awesome,

5641
02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:27.020
great,

5642
02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:27.853
I'd be a vegetarian,

5643
02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:30.420
I would do whatever I would do whatever it was.

5644
02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:33.180
[inaudible] woman said it's like Adderall.

5645
02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:35.610
Like this shit is like Adderall.

5646
02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:36.340
Yeah.

5647
02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:36.880
Um,

5648
02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:37.330
but,

5649
02:40:37.330 --> 02:40:38.740
but what is the,

5650
02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:40.230
there's what is the downside?

5651
02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:43.170
Is there any downside for drinking this stuff?

5652
02:40:43.171 --> 02:40:43.481
I mean,

5653
02:40:43.481 --> 02:40:44.520
and getting all jacked up.

5654
02:40:44.521 --> 02:40:44.701
I mean,

5655
02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:47.100
it doesn't have play havoc on your adrenals.

5656
02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:47.690
I mean,

5657
02:40:47.690 --> 02:40:48.930
that's a really good question.

5658
02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:50.820
Let's talk about adrenal function and a lot.

5659
02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:51.580
Yeah.

5660
02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:52.413
<v 3>All right.</v>

5661
02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:56.440
Caffeine depletes magnesium to a small degree.

5662
02:40:56.470 --> 02:40:57.400
Not a terrible one,

5663
02:40:57.401 --> 02:40:58.870
but you should be supplementing magnesium.

5664
02:40:58.871 --> 02:40:59.381
Anyway,

5665
02:40:59.381 --> 02:41:02.560
it's my top two supplement recommendations or vitamin D and magnesium.

5666
02:41:02.610 --> 02:41:04.290
<v 1>That's by the way interrupt.</v>

5667
02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:06.180
But that's one of the reasons why she used the tank.

5668
02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:07.560
The isolation tanks.

5669
02:41:07.561 --> 02:41:11.550
One of the best ways that your body gets magnesium and it gets absorbed through

5670
02:41:11.551 --> 02:41:12.420
the dermis.

5671
02:41:12.421 --> 02:41:13.254
Bitch.

5672
02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:13.441
Yeah,

5673
02:41:13.441 --> 02:41:14.700
that's an Epsom salt bath.

5674
02:41:14.730 --> 02:41:14.890
Yeah.

5675
02:41:14.890 --> 02:41:15.301
Taking,

5676
02:41:15.301 --> 02:41:16.170
just not a warm,

5677
02:41:16.830 --> 02:41:18.030
warm salt dehydrates,

5678
02:41:18.031 --> 02:41:18.811
but Luke warm,

5679
02:41:18.811 --> 02:41:19.621
so it's so extended me.

5680
02:41:19.621 --> 02:41:20.311
That's great.

5681
02:41:20.311 --> 02:41:20.940
For the muscle

5682
02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:22.430
<v 3>at some magnesium chloride,</v>

5683
02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:23.820
not just magnesium sulfate to that.

5684
02:41:23.821 --> 02:41:25.020
And you'll get even more benefits.

5685
02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:27.790
What am I getting is in the Zma zinc

5686
02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:31.620
and is that enough?

5687
02:41:32.370 --> 02:41:33.203
Probably not.

5688
02:41:33.230 --> 02:41:34.380
Oral magnesium is,

5689
02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:35.790
it will get you to a certain point,

5690
02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:37.380
but transdermal is amazing.

5691
02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.750
So what should I throw in there which are throwing it right now you have

5692
02:41:39.751 --> 02:41:40.051
sulfate,

5693
02:41:40.051 --> 02:41:40.770
magnesium sulfate,

5694
02:41:40.770 --> 02:41:42.090
you want to put magnesium chloride,

5695
02:41:42.091 --> 02:41:44.730
which is actually like the salt of magnesium because that absorbs through the

5696
02:41:44.731 --> 02:41:45.301
skin differently.

5697
02:41:45.301 --> 02:41:46.290
You see that magnesium oil,

5698
02:41:46.291 --> 02:41:47.550
they mark it like at health food stores.

5699
02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:49.740
That's just super saturated magnesium chloride.

5700
02:41:49.741 --> 02:41:50.550
So adds some of that.

5701
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:51.540
But let's go back to adrenals.

5702
02:41:52.170 --> 02:41:52.460
Um,

5703
02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:52.880
I'll,

5704
02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:53.591
I'll hook you up with him.

5705
02:41:53.591 --> 02:41:54.540
That magnesium chloride,

5706
02:41:54.541 --> 02:41:55.800
just the chemical stuff.

5707
02:41:55.801 --> 02:41:58.590
You can buy pounds of this stuff and just put some of that in there too.

5708
02:41:58.591 --> 02:41:59.670
So when you're getting your magnesium,

5709
02:41:59.671 --> 02:42:01.710
you'll get sulfate and chloride in both channels.

5710
02:42:01.860 --> 02:42:02.693
We'll get in.

5711
02:42:03.270 --> 02:42:04.200
So with adrenals,

5712
02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:08.700
I know that mycotoxins increased cortisol levels,

5713
02:42:08.730 --> 02:42:10.080
they are a poison.

5714
02:42:10.410 --> 02:42:11.400
When you are poisoned,

5715
02:42:11.430 --> 02:42:12.690
your stress levels go up,

5716
02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:14.370
which stresses your adrenal glands.

5717
02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:16.050
This is like pretty basic stuff.

5718
02:42:16.350 --> 02:42:19.710
So maybe higher doses of mycotoxins create more adrenal stress,

5719
02:42:19.711 --> 02:42:20.371
lower doses,

5720
02:42:20.371 --> 02:42:21.204
create less.

5721
02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:23.380
So having coffee without toxins in it.

5722
02:42:23.381 --> 02:42:24.450
If you have adrenal problems,

5723
02:42:24.451 --> 02:42:25.284
it seems to be okay.

5724
02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:29.010
I have lots and lots of people on the forums who are in up to stage three

5725
02:42:29.011 --> 02:42:32.040
adrenal fatigue who have one cup of upgraded beans,

5726
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.411
you know the,

5727
02:42:32.411 --> 02:42:35.880
the micro toxin free coffee and they do very well.

5728
02:42:35.881 --> 02:42:36.690
They recover.

5729
02:42:36.690 --> 02:42:40.380
I've been in Stage three adrenal fatigue multiple times and I still use a cup of

5730
02:42:40.381 --> 02:42:40.770
coffee.

5731
02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:42.060
I've tried going without coffee.

5732
02:42:42.061 --> 02:42:42.960
I've tried going with it.

5733
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:46.200
And the bottom line is if you're doing it responsibly,

5734
02:42:46.290 --> 02:42:47.790
I think doing it with the fat,

5735
02:42:47.850 --> 02:42:51.170
which actually lowers your stress level when your body has adequate food and

5736
02:42:51.171 --> 02:42:54.570
adequate nutrition like that I think is at least a wash and it's probably not

5737
02:42:54.571 --> 02:42:55.320
harmful.

5738
02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:56.520
But if you have adrenal fatigue,

5739
02:42:56.521 --> 02:42:57.121
like real,

5740
02:42:57.121 --> 02:42:59.490
like I'm bedridden sorta stuff you probably,

5741
02:42:59.491 --> 02:43:00.900
I'm not to be using anything with caffeine.

5742
02:43:01.340 --> 02:43:05.740
<v 1>The funny thing you say is like maybe the mycotoxins are causing this adrenal</v>

5743
02:43:05.770 --> 02:43:06.240
response.

5744
02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:08.000
Like that needs to be sort of research,

5745
02:43:08.001 --> 02:43:08.834
right?

5746
02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:09.570
Well,

5747
02:43:09.570 --> 02:43:11.000
I would love more research out there.

5748
02:43:11.190 --> 02:43:15.680
Would we know that like aflatoxin and Okra toxin if they're injected or if you

5749
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:17.430
feed them to an animal that they will raise quarters.

5750
02:43:17.431 --> 02:43:17.830
All that.

5751
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:19.090
That's very well understood.

5752
02:43:19.091 --> 02:43:24.091
Would be a way that you could do a test on coffee and to find out with,

5753
02:43:24.461 --> 02:43:24.730
you know,

5754
02:43:24.730 --> 02:43:25.451
x amount of Pete,

5755
02:43:25.451 --> 02:43:29.830
but what sort of a control would you need to do a test on people and ensure that

5756
02:43:29.831 --> 02:43:33.160
they get a certain amount of mycotoxins in the coffee and then ensure that they

5757
02:43:33.161 --> 02:43:33.730
get none.

5758
02:43:33.730 --> 02:43:35.140
It seems like that to be done,

5759
02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:36.280
you could certainly ensure it.

5760
02:43:36.310 --> 02:43:38.010
I'd be actually really interested in that.

5761
02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:38.200
I,

5762
02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:40.060
I would contribute coffee to a study like that,

5763
02:43:40.090 --> 02:43:43.780
although I don't know where to get aflatoxin guaranteed certified level coffee.

5764
02:43:44.050 --> 02:43:45.580
One of the problems that we have with coffees,

5765
02:43:45.581 --> 02:43:47.320
if you buy a container load of coffee,

5766
02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:48.633
there can be a hotspot.

5767
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:52.000
The back of the container had a leak and so now you get like this,

5768
02:43:52.001 --> 02:43:55.930
much of the container has mycotoxins in it and the rest doesn't.

5769
02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:59.230
And this is one of the reasons that the small style roasting that I'm doing

5770
02:43:59.590 --> 02:44:00.423
works.

5771
02:44:00.490 --> 02:44:04.270
If you go up to like the massive coffee conglomerate level where you're mixing

5772
02:44:04.271 --> 02:44:06.730
like a whole bunch of container lives together and you're homogenizing it,

5773
02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:08.170
you're getting the average level down,

5774
02:44:08.171 --> 02:44:09.880
but you're guaranteeing the presence of toxins.

5775
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:10.960
I want zero toxins,

5776
02:44:10.961 --> 02:44:11.710
not just,

5777
02:44:11.710 --> 02:44:11.831
Oh,

5778
02:44:11.831 --> 02:44:12.550
just a little bit.

5779
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:16.480
Essentially what's going on as these toxins are not really being considered as

5780
02:44:16.481 --> 02:44:20.410
toxins because no one's dying and even though they suck for your health and they

5781
02:44:20.411 --> 02:44:21.910
make you feel like shit,

5782
02:44:21.970 --> 02:44:25.330
no one's paying attention to it and the valley doesn't address it,

5783
02:44:25.930 --> 02:44:30.930
and the way they're looking at as far as regulation is a profit versus negative

5784
02:44:31.811 --> 02:44:33.130
detriment to the human health,

5785
02:44:33.131 --> 02:44:34.630
which is seems to be very low.

5786
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:35.040
[inaudible]

5787
02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:35.390
used to be,

5788
02:44:35.390 --> 02:44:37.210
although it makes you feel kind of cranky,

5789
02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:39.340
it's not really detrimental to your health.

5790
02:44:39.370 --> 02:44:44.370
Is that doing research on mycotoxins and arterial lesions do a search on

5791
02:44:44.771 --> 02:44:46.150
mycotoxins and fertility.

5792
02:44:46.210 --> 02:44:49.390
There's a whole chapter in this book on what Mycotoxins do to animals.

5793
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:52.900
We actually test to animal feed before when animals are pregnant,

5794
02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:57.100
they buy special food without mycotoxins in it because when they feed toxin

5795
02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.430
grain and hay and Alfalfa to animals,

5796
02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.700
they spontaneously lose their pregnancies and they can't get pregnant.

5797
02:45:03.850 --> 02:45:05.530
Like we know what these do to animals.

5798
02:45:05.531 --> 02:45:06.970
But for those same things,

5799
02:45:06.971 --> 02:45:09.430
we don't even have let set for humans.

5800
02:45:09.431 --> 02:45:09.810
For some of you,

5801
02:45:09.810 --> 02:45:13.630
well this is what I think we really need to do to continue this conversation and

5802
02:45:13.631 --> 02:45:14.620
sort of an ethical way.

5803
02:45:14.830 --> 02:45:17.920
Cause I think we're bringing up a lot of things that we can't really completely

5804
02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:19.113
substantiate.

5805
02:45:19.390 --> 02:45:23.950
Like the mycotoxin levels and different coffees like Starbucks and Peet's and

5806
02:45:23.951 --> 02:45:25.990
whatever shit at the mall and the gas station.

5807
02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:30.670
I feel like there needs to be some sort of study done or some tests done on a

5808
02:45:30.671 --> 02:45:32.440
bunch of different different ones.

5809
02:45:32.441 --> 02:45:35.800
Just randomly pull them out of Starbucks and test him.

5810
02:45:35.980 --> 02:45:39.460
How difficult would that be and could you do that and why haven't you done it

5811
02:45:39.461 --> 02:45:39.970
yet?

5812
02:45:39.970 --> 02:45:40.181
Well,

5813
02:45:40.181 --> 02:45:40.540
I mean,

5814
02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:42.430
I would in order to do that,

5815
02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:43.840
I mean just testing is not cheap.

5816
02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:44.670
It's not cheap.

5817
02:45:44.670 --> 02:45:47.530
And why would it cost to do that when you want like a thousand samples?

5818
02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:48.970
How many samples would we need?

5819
02:45:48.971 --> 02:45:49.804
Tape?

5820
02:45:50.210 --> 02:45:50.930
I mean like,

5821
02:45:50.930 --> 02:45:51.190
I know,

5822
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:52.060
but I'll be the Guinea pig.

5823
02:45:52.061 --> 02:45:55.030
I'll do whatever it takes it out.

5824
02:45:55.370 --> 02:45:56.980
We're going to have butter in this coffee or what?

5825
02:45:57.060 --> 02:45:59.020
I would say 50 samples when they need state.

5826
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.490
Yeah,

5827
02:45:59.490 --> 02:46:00.300
that's,

5828
02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.150
that's a good call.

5829
02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:01.900
Yeah,

5830
02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:04.030
but you don't want to go to Hawaii.

5831
02:46:04.031 --> 02:46:08.830
That's a lot of work out minus and lower 48 and here's the question.

5832
02:46:08.831 --> 02:46:09.171
I mean,

5833
02:46:09.171 --> 02:46:09.980
are you going to test like

5834
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:10.730
<v 3>Folgers?</v>

5835
02:46:10.730 --> 02:46:11.291
<v 0>You're going to test it,</v>

5836
02:46:11.291 --> 02:46:11.440
you know,

5837
02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:12.273
just Starbucks.

5838
02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:13.433
Starbucks,

5839
02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:16.420
I think you'd want to test Dunkin donuts.

5840
02:46:16.421 --> 02:46:17.254
You don't want to test.

5841
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:19.600
You should do five,

5842
02:46:19.860 --> 02:46:20.230
right?

5843
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:23.890
I think we'd get a good sample is if you randomly tested,

5844
02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:24.191
you know,

5845
02:46:24.191 --> 02:46:28.240
50 places in this country just went into a place and bought a coffee and then

5846
02:46:28.270 --> 02:46:29.021
wrote the day,

5847
02:46:29.021 --> 02:46:30.430
the time where it came from,

5848
02:46:30.431 --> 02:46:31.630
whether it was coffee bean,

5849
02:46:31.631 --> 02:46:32.470
whether it was Pete's,

5850
02:46:32.490 --> 02:46:33.251
whatever it is,

5851
02:46:33.251 --> 02:46:35.920
whatever mom and pop coffee shop and let's find out.

5852
02:46:35.950 --> 02:46:36.550
Just just,

5853
02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:40.570
I mean that's obviously not good enough scientifically to prove across the

5854
02:46:40.571 --> 02:46:41.404
board,

5855
02:46:42.130 --> 02:46:44.770
but it's a sample enough to give people some information.

5856
02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:45.000
It'll,

5857
02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:46.210
it's a sample enough to,

5858
02:46:46.270 --> 02:46:48.790
we were talking to $100,000 like a hundred grand.

5859
02:46:48.850 --> 02:46:50.630
I'm not feel like we could do a Kickstarter that

5860
02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:54.540
<v 3>I'm not going to put that shit out Starbucks and ask him like,</v>

5861
02:46:54.541 --> 02:46:54.751
Hey,

5862
02:46:54.751 --> 02:46:57.270
do you want to hit this out of the water out of the way?

5863
02:46:57.330 --> 02:46:59.250
I don't think they know their business.

5864
02:46:59.650 --> 02:47:02.100
They know frame that they want to do that.

5865
02:47:03.390 --> 02:47:04.590
Working as managers,

5866
02:47:04.591 --> 02:47:05.424
do you think they know,

5867
02:47:05.790 --> 02:47:10.230
I've talked to like some of the most prestigious coffee scientists in the world

5868
02:47:10.231 --> 02:47:13.560
working for like five plus billion dollar companies about this problem.

5869
02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:15.240
They damn well know about that

5870
02:47:15.250 --> 02:47:17.040
<v 0>as their baristas racist.</v>

5871
02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:17.480
Don't know.

5872
02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:19.090
But let's say working in the store,

5873
02:47:19.091 --> 02:47:20.320
it's about a Barista.

5874
02:47:20.350 --> 02:47:22.000
What about a manager that used to be a Barista?

5875
02:47:22.001 --> 02:47:22.834
They fell a man.

5876
02:47:23.290 --> 02:47:24.123
<v 3>Not at all.</v>

5877
02:47:24.390 --> 02:47:25.860
Like like poison.

5878
02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:27.040
There's a company,

5879
02:47:27.041 --> 02:47:27.970
if you want to look crazy,

5880
02:47:27.971 --> 02:47:28.840
they'll go in there and ask,

5881
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:29.021
Hey,

5882
02:47:29.021 --> 02:47:30.850
do you have single origin coffee at a Starbucks

5883
02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:33.213
or what?

5884
02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:34.471
So what?

5885
02:47:34.471 --> 02:47:35.081
What's going on here?

5886
02:47:35.081 --> 02:47:35.481
This is a,

5887
02:47:35.481 --> 02:47:39.100
a backend industrial supply issue with coffee.

5888
02:47:39.250 --> 02:47:43.360
So there's one of the very large coffee conglomerates has a giant research

5889
02:47:43.361 --> 02:47:44.170
facility with Sephora,

5890
02:47:44.170 --> 02:47:46.390
with 70 scientists working on this now.

5891
02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:50.200
And in Europe they've had to change the way they buy green coffee because now

5892
02:47:50.201 --> 02:47:54.340
they make the people who buy the green coffee from the coffee growers.

5893
02:47:54.730 --> 02:47:56.590
So there's a growing production process.

5894
02:47:56.591 --> 02:47:57.760
There's a coffee,

5895
02:47:57.890 --> 02:48:00.400
a broker and the coffee broker buys it.

5896
02:48:00.401 --> 02:48:03.610
But if they don't arrange for proper transportation in the coffee can actually

5897
02:48:03.820 --> 02:48:06.010
develop mycotoxins in transportation.

5898
02:48:06.430 --> 02:48:10.000
So what's happening now is that the roasters in the supply chain there are

5899
02:48:10.001 --> 02:48:12.490
actually forcing the brokers would,

5900
02:48:12.491 --> 02:48:14.890
who never had to be responsible to this before in Europe.

5901
02:48:14.890 --> 02:48:18.010
They're forcing the brokers to take on that risk and it's changing a lot of the

5902
02:48:18.011 --> 02:48:19.810
whole part of coffee over there.

5903
02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:21.460
But we haven't had that happen here.

5904
02:48:22.210 --> 02:48:23.043
On top of that,

5905
02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:24.580
according to the last research I've seen,

5906
02:48:24.581 --> 02:48:29.581
Starbucks has $816 million worth of coffee in storage that they're working on.

5907
02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.210
So now if we're going to do a sample of $860 million worth of coffee just for

5908
02:48:34.211 --> 02:48:34.691
Starbucks,

5909
02:48:34.691 --> 02:48:35.620
and I'm not picking on Starbucks,

5910
02:48:35.621 --> 02:48:38.500
there's lots of giant coffee companies who buy all kinds of coffees.

5911
02:48:38.501 --> 02:48:39.790
Some is moldy psalms not moldy.

5912
02:48:39.791 --> 02:48:40.660
They mix it all together.

5913
02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:43.810
So like which samples are we going to get?

5914
02:48:43.811 --> 02:48:44.920
And if we ask them for samples,

5915
02:48:44.921 --> 02:48:46.030
I wonder if we'll get the freshest,

5916
02:48:46.031 --> 02:48:47.230
nicest stuff or not.

5917
02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:48.280
Like who knows?

5918
02:48:48.430 --> 02:48:49.600
So if it sits around,

5919
02:48:49.601 --> 02:48:51.460
it's more likely to have mycotoxins.

5920
02:48:51.461 --> 02:48:54.730
It's around as green coffee that is not in a temperature controlled environment.

5921
02:48:54.730 --> 02:48:55.300
Yeah,

5922
02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:57.010
definitely humidity and temperature matter.

5923
02:48:57.070 --> 02:48:58.090
When you're storing coffee.

5924
02:48:58.270 --> 02:48:58.811
So if it's,

5925
02:48:58.811 --> 02:49:01.030
and depending also like if it's African natural coffee,

5926
02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:04.090
that stuff always has mold in it just because of the way it's processed.

5927
02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:05.193
So I mean,

5928
02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:05.921
well,

5929
02:49:05.921 --> 02:49:06.460
okay.

5930
02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:07.050
It's um,

5931
02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:09.750
I don't even want to say it's unlikely or likely that they're going to have

5932
02:49:09.751 --> 02:49:10.860
African coffee.

5933
02:49:10.861 --> 02:49:13.170
I don't know what Starbucks coffee for sure.

5934
02:49:13.171 --> 02:49:13.310
Yeah,

5935
02:49:13.310 --> 02:49:13.610
they do.

5936
02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:14.580
I've seen it a bunch of times,

5937
02:49:14.581 --> 02:49:16.140
but that's like the stuff they're advertising is like,

5938
02:49:16.141 --> 02:49:16.321
you know,

5939
02:49:16.321 --> 02:49:17.490
special Zimbabwe,

5940
02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:18.140
you know,

5941
02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:19.060
summarize that for you.

5942
02:49:19.540 --> 02:49:20.373
You know,

5943
02:49:20.380 --> 02:49:21.810
figure southern Africa is bad for you.

5944
02:49:21.811 --> 02:49:24.690
Some Ethiopian coffee and tell your parents someone super clean.

5945
02:49:26.110 --> 02:49:26.943
Nice.

5946
02:49:27.690 --> 02:49:28.523
So here's,

5947
02:49:28.530 --> 02:49:29.363
here's the deal.

5948
02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:30.463
Um,

5949
02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:31.050
yeah,

5950
02:49:31.050 --> 02:49:34.140
you can get a clean cup of coffee at a high end.

5951
02:49:34.141 --> 02:49:36.690
Coffee House was single origin following the instructions on my website.

5952
02:49:36.691 --> 02:49:37.920
I don't make a nickel from that.

5953
02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:43.340
My dream is to be able to go to any coffee place on the planet,

5954
02:49:43.351 --> 02:49:44.400
walk in the door and say,

5955
02:49:44.401 --> 02:49:45.930
I want a cup of coffee.

5956
02:49:45.931 --> 02:49:46.800
That makes me feel good.

5957
02:49:46.801 --> 02:49:49.030
And it doesn't happen along those lines,

5958
02:49:49.031 --> 02:49:51.390
like I'm working on opening bulletproof coffee shops.

5959
02:49:51.770 --> 02:49:52.430
Like it's,

5960
02:49:52.430 --> 02:49:53.041
it's happening.

5961
02:49:53.041 --> 02:49:53.521
It'll happen.

5962
02:49:53.521 --> 02:49:55.020
Like probably this year.

5963
02:49:55.021 --> 02:49:56.430
I'm bringing the team together.

5964
02:49:56.431 --> 02:49:57.490
We're raising funding for them.

5965
02:49:58.080 --> 02:49:58.310
Yeah,

5966
02:49:58.310 --> 02:50:00.510
like bulletproof team bullet Covo groups.

5967
02:50:00.511 --> 02:50:00.901
You know,

5968
02:50:00.901 --> 02:50:03.010
it's called the mumble through.

5969
02:50:03.011 --> 02:50:04.260
Bobby has bulletproof Ted.

5970
02:50:04.290 --> 02:50:06.090
We're going to call it the Rogan team now.

5971
02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:07.501
Where are you going to start?

5972
02:50:07.501 --> 02:50:08.334
Where's the first place?

5973
02:50:08.370 --> 02:50:09.090
San Francisco.

5974
02:50:09.090 --> 02:50:10.860
We're going to put three coffee shops in San Francisco.

5975
02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:11.670
Wow,

5976
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:12.100
nice.

5977
02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:12.390
And,

5978
02:50:12.390 --> 02:50:15.870
and I'm doing this not to make $1 million cause trust me people,

5979
02:50:15.871 --> 02:50:18.720
if you want to make $1 million opening retail establishments sucks.

5980
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:19.260
It is.

5981
02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:20.340
I don't even know how to do this.

5982
02:50:20.341 --> 02:50:21.150
I had to bring people in.

5983
02:50:21.150 --> 02:50:24.390
You could tell me how to do this stuff and I haven't raised a nickel yet,

5984
02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:26.070
but it will happen and it's,

5985
02:50:26.071 --> 02:50:27.120
it's just hard.

5986
02:50:27.210 --> 02:50:27.630
You know,

5987
02:50:27.630 --> 02:50:30.630
every paper Cup does something to the margins and it's,

5988
02:50:30.631 --> 02:50:32.160
it's actually something I have no experience in,

5989
02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:34.440
but I'm doing it because I think that you should be able to buy a bulletproof

5990
02:50:34.441 --> 02:50:35.370
coffee and feel awesome.

5991
02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:40.030
I want to give you a little bit of vindication because someone else on the board

5992
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:45.070
of dude named Equiv found some studies that found 52% to 91% of green coffee

5993
02:50:46.231 --> 02:50:48.030
beans are contaminated with mycotoxins.

5994
02:50:48.050 --> 02:50:48.390
Yep.

5995
02:50:48.390 --> 02:50:48.680
And,

5996
02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:51.160
and this is from NB and CBI.

5997
02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:52.470
I know that study,

5998
02:50:52.470 --> 02:50:56.040
national coffee brewers board something,

5999
02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:57.960
I forget what it is,

6000
02:50:58.110 --> 02:51:01.330
but there are studies that show 92% government study.

6001
02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:05.010
It's by nih.gov there we go.

6002
02:51:06.050 --> 02:51:06.511
That's not the one,

6003
02:51:06.511 --> 02:51:07.860
I forget what the fuck it is.

6004
02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:11.520
I have like 10 studies like that on the site and depending on where the coffee

6005
02:51:11.521 --> 02:51:11.971
comes from,

6006
02:51:11.971 --> 02:51:12.661
what year it is,

6007
02:51:12.661 --> 02:51:14.670
whether there was a drought and all that,

6008
02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:15.960
it affects it.

6009
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:20.990
Even national center for bio informing bio technology information.

6010
02:51:21.090 --> 02:51:21.570
Okay.

6011
02:51:21.570 --> 02:51:26.570
Advanced Science and help by providing access to biomedical and Doe Genomic

6012
02:51:27.150 --> 02:51:27.230
Information.

6013
02:51:27.230 --> 02:51:27.810
Sorry.

6014
02:51:27.810 --> 02:51:28.643
So here's the thing.

6015
02:51:28.650 --> 02:51:30.360
There are plenty of studies.

6016
02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:32.460
There are lots of studies out there that say there are some,

6017
02:51:32.461 --> 02:51:33.480
there are those things.

6018
02:51:33.481 --> 02:51:33.661
Look,

6019
02:51:33.661 --> 02:51:34.380
like I said,

6020
02:51:34.380 --> 02:51:35.730
that guy cited that say that,

6021
02:51:35.731 --> 02:51:36.030
you know,

6022
02:51:36.030 --> 02:51:36.863
it's all bs,

6023
02:51:37.350 --> 02:51:37.561
you know,

6024
02:51:37.561 --> 02:51:38.520
I wish it was all bs.

6025
02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:39.120
I really do.

6026
02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:40.050
This is the biggest one.

6027
02:51:40.051 --> 02:51:41.850
They found 60 samples in Brazil.

6028
02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:45.840
91% I sat the 1.7 contaminated with molds.

6029
02:51:46.530 --> 02:51:47.363
Wow.

6030
02:51:47.370 --> 02:51:50.970
That's kind of scary because if that coffee is mixed in with your other coffee,

6031
02:51:51.210 --> 02:51:51.931
what are you getting?

6032
02:51:51.931 --> 02:51:54.120
And you could make the argument you're getting a safe level.

6033
02:51:54.180 --> 02:51:54.960
You know what?

6034
02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:55.920
Screw the safe level.

6035
02:51:55.921 --> 02:51:57.120
I'm not interested in the safe level.

6036
02:51:57.121 --> 02:51:58.410
I wanted an optimal level.

6037
02:51:58.530 --> 02:51:59.363
I'm not mediocre.

6038
02:51:59.550 --> 02:52:01.410
Would really like to be able to prove this.

6039
02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:05.010
I would really like if there was a way that we could absolutely prove that these

6040
02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:06.050
have

6041
02:52:06.050 --> 02:52:08.680
<v 1>some sort of a detrimental effect because I,</v>

6042
02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:09.100
there's,

6043
02:52:09.100 --> 02:52:10.160
there's makes sense to me.

6044
02:52:10.161 --> 02:52:11.760
I believe what you're saying in studies,

6045
02:52:11.850 --> 02:52:13.610
I know from trying your coffee,

6046
02:52:13.611 --> 02:52:14.000
your car,

6047
02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.970
I have no adverse effects and I have had headaches from coffee before.

6048
02:52:18.020 --> 02:52:19.220
Weird feelings afterwards.

6049
02:52:19.221 --> 02:52:22.730
I feel like shit and I've always wondered what that was and I think a lot of

6050
02:52:22.731 --> 02:52:26.240
people may have those sort of same shitty feelings after a cup of coffee and

6051
02:52:26.241 --> 02:52:27.050
they just accept it.

6052
02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.520
Yup.

6053
02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:28.353
Right.

6054
02:52:29.630 --> 02:52:30.470
There's so many different things.

6055
02:52:30.471 --> 02:52:33.110
You got to talk to Obama about that president of Starbucks,

6056
02:52:33.330 --> 02:52:36.170
I think he'd be open to having a public conversation about,

6057
02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:37.250
you know,

6058
02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:37.960
that'd be fascinating.

6059
02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:38.990
I think you what?

6060
02:52:38.991 --> 02:52:40.730
Starbucks is a pretty good company,

6061
02:52:40.731 --> 02:52:44.470
like good people company for Howard Schultz and I have huge respect for

6062
02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:45.390
[inaudible].

6063
02:52:45.690 --> 02:52:46.370
He knows name.

6064
02:52:46.370 --> 02:52:49.430
Oh well I know that someone told him about MCT oil last week.

6065
02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:50.870
I told him about it.

6066
02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:51.760
Yeah.

6067
02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:52.240
In what way?

6068
02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:52.520
Well,

6069
02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:55.310
some of the people that I'm working with on my coffee shops are original

6070
02:52:55.311 --> 02:52:55.731
gangsters,

6071
02:52:55.731 --> 02:52:56.564
Starbucks people,

6072
02:52:57.170 --> 02:52:58.220
original gangster.

6073
02:52:58.750 --> 02:53:01.730
They learned how to brew with him and then they're like,

6074
02:53:01.731 --> 02:53:02.031
you know what,

6075
02:53:02.031 --> 02:53:02.864
this is not good enough.

6076
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:06.050
All the Starbucks has been around since like the 80s.

6077
02:53:06.051 --> 02:53:06.261
Right.

6078
02:53:06.261 --> 02:53:06.780
So they just,

6079
02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:08.180
they had their career and they're done,

6080
02:53:08.210 --> 02:53:09.680
but they're looking to do something new and interesting.

6081
02:53:09.681 --> 02:53:10.370
I'll tell you what,

6082
02:53:10.370 --> 02:53:11.420
even if it's bad for you,

6083
02:53:11.421 --> 02:53:12.620
it's fucking delicious.

6084
02:53:13.270 --> 02:53:13.641
I can't,

6085
02:53:13.641 --> 02:53:14.390
and I don't think,

6086
02:53:14.390 --> 02:53:15.590
I don't think it's bad for you.

6087
02:53:15.640 --> 02:53:16.160
Um,

6088
02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:16.450
click,

6089
02:53:16.450 --> 02:53:19.010
Tate had one more question and we should address before we wrap this picture

6090
02:53:19.011 --> 02:53:19.131
off.

6091
02:53:19.131 --> 02:53:19.440
And that was,

6092
02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:22.220
you had a question about cholesterol and I think that's important.

6093
02:53:22.221 --> 02:53:23.930
We never really got to the bottom of that.

6094
02:53:24.250 --> 02:53:24.680
What,

6095
02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:27.200
what's the issue and what should be worried about?

6096
02:53:27.210 --> 02:53:28.580
Like how dare you put that down,

6097
02:53:28.581 --> 02:53:29.000
right?

6098
02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:29.833
It's going to get us in trouble.

6099
02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:31.033
That's gonna get us in trouble.

6100
02:53:31.730 --> 02:53:32.563
<v 3>Um,</v>

6101
02:53:32.580 --> 02:53:33.330
the,

6102
02:53:33.330 --> 02:53:35.070
that would be a way better logo on their

6103
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:37.463
cholesterol.

6104
02:53:37.690 --> 02:53:38.523
Alright.

6105
02:53:38.730 --> 02:53:39.563
Cholesterol.

6106
02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:44.160
If you don't have oxidized cholesterol and you don't have inflammation in your

6107
02:53:44.161 --> 02:53:44.760
body,

6108
02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:46.920
having cholesterol is not a risk factor.

6109
02:53:47.010 --> 02:53:51.030
The way we've been taught it is even having LDL cholesterol isn't higher levels

6110
02:53:51.031 --> 02:53:53.130
of Ldl let you build muscle.

6111
02:53:53.460 --> 02:53:55.370
Like that's just sort of not,

6112
02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:56.730
I haven't worked out in three years.

6113
02:53:57.120 --> 02:53:57.953
Wow.

6114
02:54:00.330 --> 02:54:01.163
<v 1>40 minutes a month.</v>

6115
02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:02.380
<v 3>Here's another thing.</v>

6116
02:54:02.690 --> 02:54:05.410
People who have high levels of unoxidized cholesterol,

6117
02:54:06.130 --> 02:54:07.420
when they're exposed to poisons,

6118
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:11.560
they live a lot longer because your body uses cholesterol to escort toxins out

6119
02:54:11.561 --> 02:54:13.690
of the body through the biliary system in the liver.

6120
02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:15.850
So why have we been told that cholesterol is bad for you?

6121
02:54:15.851 --> 02:54:19.540
Is it cholesterol on a diet with other things?

6122
02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:22.870
Cholesterol was one of the first things we could measure in blood.

6123
02:54:22.871 --> 02:54:27.460
So we've been focusing a lot of research on it since about what the 30s but the

6124
02:54:27.461 --> 02:54:32.461
Gary Tobbs type of people as well as it's a huge body of research in the last

6125
02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:34.570
couple of years have come out really seriously questioning this.

6126
02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:38.170
If you have adequate amounts of high density cholesterol,

6127
02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:39.033
the HDL,

6128
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:41.500
which you do if you eat this kind of old proof diet stuff.

6129
02:54:41.530 --> 02:54:41.861
I'm sorry,

6130
02:54:41.861 --> 02:54:42.680
I don't know what else to call it.

6131
02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:43.360
That's okay.

6132
02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:44.560
I'm just doing your that slide.

6133
02:54:44.980 --> 02:54:48.430
So I caught him and named my book that I have to change it.

6134
02:54:49.930 --> 02:54:50.763
So there's that.

6135
02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:52.630
What you'll end up doing,

6136
02:54:52.631 --> 02:54:52.960
by the way,

6137
02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:54.480
your cholesterol is about 300 on this?

6138
02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:54.980
Yeah,

6139
02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:56.460
mine's about to 47 okay.

6140
02:54:56.770 --> 02:54:58.140
And my LPP,

6141
02:54:58.141 --> 02:54:59.950
La two which is the one I'd worry about the most,

6142
02:54:59.980 --> 02:55:02.380
is very low and I don't have that number memorized.

6143
02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:04.230
Lpp two is a measure

6144
02:55:04.230 --> 02:55:07.910
<v 1>of protein damage inside your arteries if you don't have ILP PLA.</v>

6145
02:55:07.911 --> 02:55:08.270
Two,

6146
02:55:08.270 --> 02:55:09.830
if your homocysteine is low,

6147
02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:11.180
which is a marker of inflammation.

6148
02:55:11.550 --> 02:55:12.470
So of course it is.

6149
02:55:12.471 --> 02:55:15.020
It takes six weeks on the side where people to just crater it out,

6150
02:55:15.290 --> 02:55:15.860
right?

6151
02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:19.340
And then your c reactive protein and homocysteine are the other big markers of

6152
02:55:19.341 --> 02:55:20.174
inflammation.

6153
02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:24.320
So you get those guys where they should be and having cholesterol that isn't

6154
02:55:24.321 --> 02:55:25.880
oxidized is actually good for you.

6155
02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.510
If you're taking your eggs and you're making like well-cooked omelettes out of

6156
02:55:29.511 --> 02:55:30.920
them and you're cooking the yolks to death,

6157
02:55:30.921 --> 02:55:34.430
you're oxidizing that cholesterol and that's inflammatory at the end of the day.

6158
02:55:34.580 --> 02:55:35.900
Or you should be eating raw eggs,

6159
02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:37.011
egg yolks,

6160
02:55:37.011 --> 02:55:38.350
absolutely toss them in your smoothie.

6161
02:55:38.450 --> 02:55:39.170
There are amazing.

6162
02:55:39.170 --> 02:55:40.100
It makes it taste like ice cream.

6163
02:55:40.101 --> 02:55:42.560
Don't have to worry about Salmonella wash the outside of the egg.

6164
02:55:42.561 --> 02:55:44.690
One in 45,000 eggs have salmonella on.

6165
02:55:44.730 --> 02:55:45.890
It's on the outside of the egg,

6166
02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:46.820
so any outside of the egg.

6167
02:55:46.821 --> 02:55:47.810
So when you crack it open,

6168
02:55:47.811 --> 02:55:49.340
that's when you get it in the actual egg itself.

6169
02:55:49.570 --> 02:55:52.670
So it's a dirty egg and that's something that people don't ever do that never

6170
02:55:52.671 --> 02:55:53.440
wash the outside of it.

6171
02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:53.910
Right?

6172
02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:54.500
They come,

6173
02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:55.333
Washington,

6174
02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:55.821
Washington,

6175
02:55:55.821 --> 02:55:56.654
the u s anyway,

6176
02:55:57.620 --> 02:56:02.360
some under motivated fuck the Illuminati hose and the Illuminati working

6177
02:56:02.361 --> 02:56:02.960
together.

6178
02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:04.130
This is the guy that could eat me.

6179
02:56:04.131 --> 02:56:06.040
Me Out credit GSA.

6180
02:56:06.410 --> 02:56:06.980
Listen man,

6181
02:56:06.980 --> 02:56:11.000
I need to do a podcast with both you motherfuckers individually again cause I'm

6182
02:56:11.001 --> 02:56:12.680
already even scratched the surface.

6183
02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:14.210
Let's do it individually and together,

6184
02:56:14.270 --> 02:56:15.103
which is so nice.

6185
02:56:15.340 --> 02:56:16.310
We're going to do one together.

6186
02:56:16.311 --> 02:56:18.380
I think tomorrow take you got your own podcast.

6187
02:56:18.381 --> 02:56:22.610
Now how do people get that state bulletproof.com or not of a bit on,

6188
02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:23.693
uh,

6189
02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:26.173
for the,

6190
02:56:26.390 --> 02:56:27.440
for my attorney,

6191
02:56:27.441 --> 02:56:29.600
you guys working together or not yet?

6192
02:56:29.630 --> 02:56:34.630
Maybe tomorrow we'll find on it and in bulletproof is a common mark so nobody

6193
02:56:34.731 --> 02:56:34.940
can,

6194
02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:35.660
it's yours.

6195
02:56:35.660 --> 02:56:36.500
Nobody can steal it.

6196
02:56:36.890 --> 02:56:39.440
That's still around for a long ass time for you to come along and jacket.

6197
02:56:39.441 --> 02:56:40.251
That doesn't even make sense.

6198
02:56:40.251 --> 02:56:40.640
You know,

6199
02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:42.950
bulletproof ideas had been around since the beginning of time,

6200
02:56:44.220 --> 02:56:45.800
but if you're going to do bulletproof coffee,

6201
02:56:45.810 --> 02:56:47.620
are you going to do it around food products?

6202
02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:48.770
You're going to do it around me.

6203
02:56:48.771 --> 02:56:49.790
I'm going to ask some questions.

6204
02:56:49.791 --> 02:56:50.624
That's all I'm going to say.

6205
02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:52.970
You shouldn't be able to own the term bulletproof.

6206
02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:54.410
They can own your genes.

6207
02:56:54.411 --> 02:56:57.080
Joe Tate Fletcher,

6208
02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:57.950
I'm generous.

6209
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:58.940
Talk to me if you want to use it,

6210
02:56:58.941 --> 02:56:59.571
but you can't just say,

6211
02:56:59.571 --> 02:57:00.310
I'm going to make,

6212
02:57:00.310 --> 02:57:00.681
we can do,

6213
02:57:00.681 --> 02:57:02.070
let's get it on proof potato.

6214
02:57:02.230 --> 02:57:03.300
Suppose not exist.

6215
02:57:03.650 --> 02:57:04.483
It's too late.

6216
02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:05.360
Yeah,

6217
02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:06.193
it's over.

6218
02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:07.131
One more time.

6219
02:57:07.131 --> 02:57:07.880
How do people get it?
