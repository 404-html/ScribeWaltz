35
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.103
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dream was to sync for the pope and </v>

36
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>then he became like a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in Montreal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he got a record deal and then he sang </v>

39
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>for the Canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he came out with a book and then at</v>

40
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the end I was like,</v>

41
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he supposed to die?</v>

42
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>That's just the basic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a little dark joke.</v>

43
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's what I do is dark humor.</v>

45
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Ray Romano.</v>

46
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did that joke and uh,</v>

47
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>in never did that joke on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that joke in a special.</v>

48
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 1>The Dea didn't air on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cut a couple of things out for TV.</v>

49
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I get a letter from the human rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>people saying you owe 80.</v>

51
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 1>First it was they wanted 82,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the joke.</v>

52
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we listened to the joke.</v>

53
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 1>We think that this boy's family deserves</v>
<v Speaker 1>82,000</v>

54
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] of this joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird number.</v>

55
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I thought they were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this how fucking stupid I am.</v>

56
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>When I got the letter and I saw human </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights commission,</v>

57
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was getting an award or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prize or something because I,</v>

58
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of benefits and stuff.</v>

59
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>But for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I raised money for disabled people.</v>

60
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:29.241
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

61
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They recognize me as a good dude.</v>

62
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 1>So I read this and then I called my </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager and I'm like,</v>

63
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want 80,000.</v>

64
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

65
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>let's just get the best lawyer we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found the best lawyer in Canada,</v>

66
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does a free speech stuff.</v>

67
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Met Him and he told me the reason why it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was $80,000,</v>

68
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>$80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a weird number.</v>

69
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Like if they ask a 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fight it,</v>

70
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.120
<v Speaker 1>but 80,000</v>

71
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 2>is big enough to kind of scare you but </v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough to really scare you.</v>

72
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 2>You'll go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

73
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I give you a 40 and then they'll go,</v>

74
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a few questions.</v>

75
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>So this bit you said you cut it from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

76
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do they know about it?</v>

77
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.301
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

78
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:17.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this interview on TV and the um,</v>

79
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>the reporter talked about the bit he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>never seen the bit.</v>

80
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.043
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how did he know about someone told </v>

81
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.790
<v Speaker 2>them about the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bed was in the special,</v>

82
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 2>the specialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was on the Internet.</v>

83
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>So you could watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

84
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.274
<v Speaker 2>you could watch it on the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this special had been in movie theaters </v>

85
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 2>in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just when we sold it on TV,</v>

86
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 2>this in French was in French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was weird.</v>

87
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Whenever people were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit they were like,</v>

88
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:43.744
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in Canada and in England </v>

89
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.073
<v Speaker 2>where it's very left leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were talking shit about the bit </v>

90
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:51.320
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

91
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you can't even understand that joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in a language.</v>

92
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>You don't speak about a person you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

93
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:02.281
<v Speaker 2>So the people almost made it look like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just picked this random disabled boy and</v>

94
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I was making fun of his disability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was making fun of the fact that he</v>

95
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:08.764
<v Speaker 2>had become famous because everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought he was dying and then he didn't </v>

96
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

97
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him it's a dark joke.</v>

98
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.563
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

99
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Not even that particularly mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

100
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a question really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying,</v>

101
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you die?</v>

102
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I spent money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You little fuck yeah.</v>

103
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.060
<v Speaker 2>And say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

104
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 2>You said how come he's alive?</v>

105
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

106
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And when I did the thing for TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cut a couple things out that I thought</v>

107
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 2>could get me in trouble because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured,</v>

108
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you put out a special and people </v>

109
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 2>pay for the special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be allowed.</v>

110
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:39.574
<v Speaker 2>And I still think this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone should think this way </v>

111
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.263
<v Speaker 2>if it like if you put out a special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be allowed to say whatever </v>

112
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you sell your special to like CBS</v>

113
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>or ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then of course they're going to cut shit</v>

114
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 2>out of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like your,</v>

115
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 2>your last special on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be crazy if netflix had looked joe,</v>

116
00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.630
<v Speaker 2>we fucking loved your special but this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to cut this out.</v>

117
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>You've got to cut this into netflix </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

118
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why they're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

119
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.123
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't give you hardly any input at </v>

120
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

121
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.051
<v Speaker 2>Those there go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

122
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 2>we really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they don't do anything.</v>

123
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they uh,</v>

124
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some controversial shit and this </v>

125
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 2>one in my last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just let it go.</v>

126
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>That's much appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I was really happy when I saw your last </v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

128
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was the perfect thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come back from a Nanette,</v>

129
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gatsby special.</v>

130
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 2>It's an important special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not funny and it's like,</v>

131
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 2>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is,</v>

132
00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:34.560
<v Speaker 2>it's her art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

133
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we're putting it in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>box,</v>

134
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that standup comedy.</v>

135
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 2>But if you do something and it has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughs in it and then it goes on this,</v>

136
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.833
<v Speaker 2>this by this journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biographical journey of your life and </v>

137
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:48.814
<v Speaker 2>your ubs observations and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say it in a way that's meaningful </v>

138
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>and people still enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not funny anymore.</v>

139
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It's still I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot</v>

140
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 3>of comics didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of columns got upset and I was </v>

141
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.904
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

142
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get why you would say it's not comedy,</v>

143
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 3>but I don't get why you would get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously people like it.</v>

144
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't get upset if people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain books or certain songs that like</v>

145
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a good friend who likes fish,</v>

146
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't hate fish,</v>

147
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's not my cup of tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

148
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes me upset that your friend,</v>

149
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 3>your friend likes fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said Jamie,</v>

150
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

151
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Jamie and I have nothing against fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

152
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.190
<v Speaker 3>maybe I need to listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

153
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie says no js.</v>

154
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not jamie like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That Hannah gatsby special.</v>

155
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.413
<v Speaker 3>Like I really wanted to watch it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to be some guy that </v>

156
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 3>listened to three minutes said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

157
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 3>So I did listen to it and I do get why </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

158
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.413
<v Speaker 3>It's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an important special and I think </v>

159
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 3>it's good for what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

160
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the fact that people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying this is comedy in time.</v>

161
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Came out with the list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most hilarious specials and that was</v>

162
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.114
<v Speaker 3>number one at a time when it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity Olympia toward told thing is </v>

163
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 3>it's all very diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some funny people on it,</v>

164
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 3>no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can still like these lists.</v>

165
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.314
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these lists are always weird because </v>

166
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.983
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's someone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjective opinion and there's nothing </v>

167
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 3>wrong with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it like,</v>

168
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

169
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 3>who's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's this person?</v>

170
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.023
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see Chris Rock's list of</v>
<v Speaker 3>top 10 comedians or top 10 comedy </v>

171
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 3>specials or someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's who I know who they are.</v>

172
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 3>I understand their thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this person is a famous writer.</v>

173
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:35.444
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're famous </v>

174
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:38.710
<v Speaker 3>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to see like Matt Tie ebs,</v>

175
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.853
<v Speaker 3>like top 10 movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a certain tea gets to </v>

176
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.250
<v Speaker 3>these top 10 things and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who sits here?</v>

177
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 3>This is all so subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

178
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 3>And the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nanette thing is,</v>

179
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to watch it.</v>

180
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I've only watched parts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

181
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.050
<v Speaker 3>but that my reaction to it was my </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to everybody else's reaction.</v>

182
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is going on here?</v>

183
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Either it's the most amazing thing ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>or some sort of an affront to comedy,</v>

184
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And either it gets a bit of both because</v>

185
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

186
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 3>it's like a lot of people were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a Ted talk and I think it kind</v>

187
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 3>of is.</v>

188
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 3>It's a funny Ted talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong with that,</v>

189
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.713
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>

190
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.603
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is my point on all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like why do we need these sort of </v>

191
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.083
<v Speaker 3>parameters that comedy has to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 3>before we accept it because it doesn't </v>

192
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 3>have to be your kind of shit for it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be something that people enjoy.</v>

193
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.623
<v Speaker 3>Obviously someone enjoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people enjoying it </v>

194
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 3>because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some of those.</v>

195
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 3>When they make those lists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you like,</v>

196
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 3>let's include this person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's include that.</v>

197
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.550
<v Speaker 3>We've got to make sure we have x amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of women and x amount.</v>

198
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.573
<v Speaker 3>You could see there's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thought process behind </v>

199
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:49.634
<v Speaker 3>creating these lists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of those people will appear on </v>

200
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 3>those lists over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

201
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 3>So that means to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

202
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.143
<v Speaker 3>Somebody loves that special that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>special is like number one on so many </v>

203
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 3>people's lists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just number two or number three.</v>

204
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 3>It's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people's lists,</v>

205
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 3>so someone's enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

206
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:09.460
<v Speaker 3>what do I give a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does anybody give a shit?</v>

207
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Was my reaction is my reaction to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics that are like upset?</v>

208
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

209
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.670
<v Speaker 3>But why are I remember why I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they got mad.</v>

210
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.523
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't because they were saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one special is because she </v>

211
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 3>went on an interview I think in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia and said,</v>

212
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're a comedian who only cares </v>
<v Speaker 3>about making people laugh,</v>

213
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 3>then you should stop doing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be in show business,</v>

214
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't see you publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should give a message.</v>

215
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I disagree with that strongly,</v>

216
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 3>but from her perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she's trying to do,</v>

217
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 3>it's like someone who's really into rock</v>
<v Speaker 3>and roll that like,</v>

218
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 3>fuck rap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

219
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.440
<v Speaker 3>rock and roll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're saying.</v>

221
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what she's saying.</v>

222
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 3>She's doing it in like a comedic form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

223
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 3>if you're only in a comedy that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>people laugh,</v>

224
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda.</v>

225
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

226
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the deep comedy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

227
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.063
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite all time standards for sure is </v>

228
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Mitch Hedberg and Mitch Hedberg had all </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsequitors.</v>

229
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.503
<v Speaker 3>Nothing was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no deep meaning to any of it </v>

230
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:07.494
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like super silly and still to </v>

231
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.160
<v Speaker 3>this day like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if I'm in traffic,</v>

232
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll listen to that shit because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so silly,</v>

233
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking.</v>

234
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just that his,</v>

235
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.774
<v Speaker 3>his expression and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression is going to be different and </v>

236
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Speaker 3>this is something I've figured out over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the course of my.</v>

237
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.253
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get it right all the time when </v>

238
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

239
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:28.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

240
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I hated people that didn't swear and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

241
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 3>there's no way you talk like that for </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

242
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you talk like that for </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

243
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 3>But then after awhile I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do I care?</v>

244
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Do some of the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't swear like Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

245
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't swear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the best comedians of all time</v>

246
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.154
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even a subjective question or </v>

247
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 3>an opinion like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

248
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows he's one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

249
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 3>if you have 100 comedians that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the best ever,</v>

250
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Seinfeld's none the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your that lists bullshit.</v>

251
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Brian Regan hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't swear it off.</v>

252
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.203
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of great comics who </v>

253
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 3>just have their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

254
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 3>there's comics that have puppets that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are really funny.</v>

255
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Like you just because you have a puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean you're not really funny.</v>

256
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 3>But for a lot of comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Qms,</v>

257
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:13.854
<v Speaker 3>go to papa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

258
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not there yet.</v>

259
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like everything else I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>on Bart.</v>

260
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you ever say auto and George?</v>

261
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George.</v>

262
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.583
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was almost making fun of the </v>

263
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.193
<v Speaker 3>whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the end that I fucking love that </v>

264
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 3>people would get mad at him because his </v>
<v Speaker 3>lips moved to fucking move bro.</v>

265
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't even trying to hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just funny.</v>

266
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

267
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 3>there's been a few really fun a puppet </v>
<v Speaker 3>acts,</v>

268
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.900
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

269

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who gives a shit?</v>

270
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.240

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

271
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.163
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a thing though when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in your twenties that anything </v>

272
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 3>that isn't what you do are you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is garbage,</v>

273
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

274
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 3>Because I remember I was like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a plus.</v>

275
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Like that was I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

276
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 3>thing about being in your twenties in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nineties because we had just had,</v>

277
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennison and,</v>

278
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.990
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

279
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 3>like Bill Hicks and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if,</v>

280
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.360
<v Speaker 3>if you were doing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

281
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.773
<v Speaker 3>like Jeff Foxworthy were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were judging you but we shouldn't </v>

282
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

283
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 3>who gives a shit?</v>

284
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff foxworthy parameters.</v>

285
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Like the nicest guy in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

286
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks nice.</v>

287
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I'd never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry the cable guy's nice as fuck.</v>

288
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 3>He's super sweet and he got super judged</v>
<v Speaker 3>too hard.</v>

289
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 3>People went hard on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave crossroad a crazy letter to him.</v>

290
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Like a letter from Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desk of days cross.</v>

291
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 3>It was free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like tongue in cheek,</v>

292
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:37.743
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that he was somehow or </v>

293
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 3>another promoting racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was what people said.</v>

294
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.730
<v Speaker 3>He's doing a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His real name's Dan Whitney.</v>

295
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 3>His character is really dumb guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have sleeves,</v>

296
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 3>who's fucking hilarious and it's good </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

297
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 3>His character isn't racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the racist,</v>

298
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like these lands I looked,</v>

299
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.023
<v Speaker 3>there's once you run out of like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>high profile targets that are actually </v>

300
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:02.014
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to like find things are </v>

301
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 3>close to that.</v>

302
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like what you're saying there.</v>

303
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 3>What are you saying about Asian people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't do it,</v>

304
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 3>don't you fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some,</v>

305
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.403
<v Speaker 3>there's some things you could still get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's some like absolute </v>

306
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:20.500
<v Speaker 3>realities that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>

307
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could say,</v>

308
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.623
<v Speaker 3>Asian people in generally have higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>iqs and they're better at math as a </v>

309
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:26.224
<v Speaker 3>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

310
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.690
<v Speaker 3>That's a solid fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

311
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 3>but if it goes the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's positive,</v>

312
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can always do it.</v>

313
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 3>The thing about white people is we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not as smart as Asians.</v>

314
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say that because I'm white,</v>

315
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 3>but if I was Asian and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people are just not as smart.</v>

316
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Even though it's true like terms of Iq </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests and mathematics in particular,</v>

317
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 3>they're just fucking smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so,</v>

318
00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 3>so much smarter.</v>

319
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.350
<v Speaker 3>You know what they're doing in Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

320
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 3>See this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're.</v>

321
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 3>They're making it more difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Asian students to get into Harvard.</v>

322
00:13:54.761 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a class action lawsuit because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've actually raised the score levels</v>

323
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.600
<v Speaker 3>that Asians have to achieve because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many of them.</v>

324
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

325
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and that's actual racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phrase this super racist,</v>

326
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't hear leftwing people,</v>

327
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.114
<v Speaker 3>progressive people calling out that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of racism because because of the way </v>

328
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 3>many Asian cultures have sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>structured their society,</v>

329
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.743
<v Speaker 3>people don't complain as much and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>work hard and they like fucking put </v>

330
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:23.884
<v Speaker 3>their nose to the grindstone and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>get going and this is part of their </v>

331
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:30.850
<v Speaker 3>culture and so when something like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens there,</v>

332
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.983
<v Speaker 3>they have to break out of those norms in</v>
<v Speaker 3>order to protest is really obvious </v>

333
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 3>racism and because they really haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>done that before,</v>

334
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 3>they just sort of silently working hard.</v>

335
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Harvard just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

336
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 3>it's too many of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking smarty pants,</v>

337
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.950
<v Speaker 3>Asian folk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

338
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Well a few people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson has.</v>

339
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

340
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:59.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a few recognized public minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

341
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 3>you know the word intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a weird word,</v>

342
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Public intellectuals,</v>

343
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 3>but those guys are definitely public </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals where they have these long</v>

344
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:06.584
<v Speaker 3>form discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember watching on the </v>

345
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing these debates together.</v>

346
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fascinating.</v>

347
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.853
<v Speaker 3>Especially they're just there </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions about religion because </v>

348
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Jordan is fairly religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

349
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 3>He's got a really interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it.</v>

350
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 3>He says he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he acts as if God is real,</v>

351
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.323
<v Speaker 3>not that he believes in God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that he acts as if God is real and </v>

352
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 3>he finds great benefit to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very arguable.</v>

353
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that Harris is like not buying it at</v>

354
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 3>all and he's brilliant too.</v>

355
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 3>So the two of them together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

356
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:34.310
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

357
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.833
<v Speaker 3>this is a fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like really cool high level </v>

358
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 3>conversation and you get to sit in on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing I like about Darren Peterson,</v>

359
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I've noticed whenever I watch his </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews,</v>

360
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.270
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks like sometimes like if someone</v>

361
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 3>asks them a question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see them stop and think to really</v>

362
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 3>see where he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like a dumb guy like me,</v>

363
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.740
<v Speaker 3>I just started talking and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

364
00:15:56.741 --> 00:16:01.741
<v Speaker 3>I'll eventually out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows exactly what he's saying,</v>

365
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in regards to like Marxist </v>

366
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:07.460
<v Speaker 3>history and things that he gets very </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about.</v>

367
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.443
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets,</v>

368
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.403
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

369
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.320
<v Speaker 3>he's having these conversations like </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally on a daily basis.</v>

370
00:16:13.321 --> 00:16:14.154
<v Speaker 3>So was going over a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>grievances and a lot of the material he </v>

371
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:18.410
<v Speaker 3>talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going over to a lot.</v>

372
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 3>So he's got that shit bolted down and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>got in trouble too with the human rights</v>

373
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 3>commission in Ontario.</v>

374
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got in trouble because they were </v>

375
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:26.444
<v Speaker 3>going to force people to use compelled </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns and there were some weird </v>

376
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:30.914
<v Speaker 3>language that he didn't like about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way they could enforce it or what they </v>

377
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 3>were asking people to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it got to the point where we're</v>

378
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:37.650
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

379
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.483
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about made up words now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it gets to a certain point where </v>

380
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 3>people get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

381
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 3>people are fucking self-indulgent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know it.</v>

382
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.480
<v Speaker 3>We all know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

383
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.353
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also the other side of it </v>

384
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.431
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

385
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:50.264
<v Speaker 3>people also should be able to express </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves as freely as you guys get to </v>

386
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:53.894
<v Speaker 3>do on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they do that with their name </v>

387
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Speaker 3>or their gender or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck they want.</v>

388
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 3>And why do you care if it's so simple to</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say whatever the fuck they want you</v>

389
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 3>it's just a name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

391
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:05.563
<v Speaker 3>Xer or all those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Jordan was like there 78 different </v>

392
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can't do this like this is,</v>

393
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.530
<v Speaker 3>this is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like,</v>

394
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.503
<v Speaker 3>I'm very pro trans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can do whatever the fuck you </v>

395
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:21.360
<v Speaker 3>want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same as like onstage,</v>

396
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.570
<v Speaker 3>I can do whatever the fuck I want to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>on state,</v>

397
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.910
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean you have to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>see me.</v>

398
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same thing if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be called Zur,</v>

399
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.893
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what the fuck that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm accidentally going to call you </v>

400
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.740
<v Speaker 3>her or him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

401
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 3>that can definitely happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't get upset at that.</v>

402
00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what the fuck is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And plus like if you get it wrong,</v>

403
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 3>it's an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

404
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.893
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between you being </v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage because it was like a choice </v>

405
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:48.231
<v Speaker 3>with your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

406
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 3>You decided to be a comedian</v>

407
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 4>is an argument there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

408
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 4>And then the other side is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they didn't have a choice.</v>

409
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.060
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

410
00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:55.893
<v Speaker 4>they feel compelled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they actually are of the other </v>

411
00:17:58.141 --> 00:17:59.680
<v Speaker 4>gender and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

412
00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.613
<v Speaker 4>their brain is wired like the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender and their body just isn't what </v>

413
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.910
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to have and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking with their head.</v>

414
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

415
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm cool with that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

416
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 4>like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fine.</v>

417
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.773
<v Speaker 4>As long as you're not interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people's lives because of your </v>

418
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:17.030
<v Speaker 4>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're not,</v>

419
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 4>you're not fucking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to do anything.</v>

420
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 4>I just have to call you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She now okay.</v>

421
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as I know.</v>

422
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.161
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm uncomfortable.</v>

423
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you bully someone on purpose?</v>

424
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:26.394
<v Speaker 4>You know it's going to fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His problem was that he didn't want it </v>

425
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 4>to be compelled because they need to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>in trouble if you fuck up.</v>

426
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

427
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what he's talking about.</v>

428
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.123
<v Speaker 4>He has no problem calling a male who </v>
<v Speaker 4>transitioned to female girl or she or </v>

429
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's like,</v>

430
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.620
<v Speaker 4>you can't use these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't compel me to use these made up</v>

431
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.463
<v Speaker 4>words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because at a certain point when these </v>

432
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:46.644
<v Speaker 4>things get rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they become contests and they become </v>

433
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:53.480
<v Speaker 4>this battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an idea battle.</v>

434
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Which side are you on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they try to win.</v>

435
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.143
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the problems that I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>with police officers and even the court </v>

436
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.684
<v Speaker 4>system that what happens when you get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecutor and a defense attorney is </v>

437
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 4>there's a contest going on and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

438
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:08.874
<v Speaker 4>they are involved in this contest </v>
<v Speaker 4>multiple times a week with a bunch of </v>

439
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:15.240
<v Speaker 4>different cases and they're moving </v>
<v Speaker 4>things around all the time,</v>

440
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:18.270
<v Speaker 4>but they're constantly trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what they're trying to do.</v>

441
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 4>When a cop pulls you over and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets you for something,</v>

442
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to arrest you.</v>

443
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we were playing a game.</v>

444
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:25.704
<v Speaker 4>Now you know this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's allowed to play this game and this </v>

445
00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 4>is what he's supposed to do and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

446
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:30.954
<v Speaker 4>he's got every right to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's going to search your home and </v>

447
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:33.960
<v Speaker 4>it'll shoot your dog because you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>weed.</v>

448
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.430
<v Speaker 4>And this is where all this stuff comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

449
00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:36.264
<v Speaker 4>It comes to these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this insane justification for these </v>

450
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:38.994
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous axe comes from the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been given a set of rules in </v>

451
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:42.864
<v Speaker 4>order to participate in this game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the game when it comes to like </v>

452
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 4>things like compelled pronouns and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes too like pushing the envelope</v>

453
00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 4>further and further and further at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain point in time,</v>

454
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:55.800
<v Speaker 4>you can't say no you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't make up a new language.</v>

455
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agreed.</v>

456
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't make a new bill lang.</v>

457
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

458
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

459
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 4>fucking Mikey language and PD language </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Tommy Lee.</v>

460
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:04.314
<v Speaker 4>So let's just agree on the words we use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many different new words do you </v>

461
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:10.530
<v Speaker 4>have?</v>

<v Speaker 4>he was judging that he was too shitty to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a kid.</v>

476
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 4>There were two people at the Human </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rights Commission</v>

477
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to resign,</v>

479
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.643
<v Speaker 1>that he had paid off a 13 year old girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 15 years ago to not tell anyone </v>

480
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 1>that he had had sex with her and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what people forget.</v>

487
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes in my intent wasn't to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>this little kid.</v>

488
00:21:21.421 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>My intent was to make people laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these guys,</v>

489
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.790
<v Speaker 1>their intent was to put their dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of a child that's fucking.</v>

490
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>And they judged him and they judged me </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>

491
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 1>While hypocrisy knows no bounds and I </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody that's doing anything like that,</v>

493
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just a sickness that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible these fucking guys,</v>

494
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:43.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.733
<v Speaker 1>So they put you through some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you went through this for a long </v>

496
00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:49.070
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>

497
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.150
<v Speaker 1>my lawyer when I first met my lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>

498
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.811
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

499
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.910
<v Speaker 1>they want you to settle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

500
00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

501
00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:57.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it reduced,</v>

502
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 1>get it reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like 20 grand.</v>

503
00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told them,</v>

504
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do that,</v>

505
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:01.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any comic in Canada is going to be </v>

506
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 1>fucked because I'm going to set this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird precedent.</v>

507
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>So I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

508
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather give you 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>then give them five.</v>

509
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.170
<v Speaker 1>So then he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he told me,</v>

510
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:15.004
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't win the cause I didn't go to </v>

511
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:20.800
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the human rights tribunal.</v>

512
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I was judged by the human rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribunal and the Human Rights Commission</v>

513
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:28.660
<v Speaker 1>was bringing me there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's me versus them judged by them.</v>

514
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.750
<v Speaker 1>So he told me you're definitely going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose to kangaroo court,</v>

515
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

516
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then will appeal and the government will</v>

517
00:22:36.651 --> 00:22:38.270
<v Speaker 1>probably accept the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

518
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 1>to listen to the case again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>

519
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 1>then you'll win that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

520
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 1>but so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

521
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:44.621
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

522
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm out.</v>

523
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

524
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I loved rocky and there was something </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird about.</v>

525
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking rocky.</v>

526
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lose the champ.</v>

527
00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then like I was,</v>

528
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>something really weird happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>though is I didn't,</v>

529
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.293
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it did affect me this </v>
<v Speaker 1>much because when I was in court and I </v>

530
00:23:06.881 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 1>saw this kid's family fucking crying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

531
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

532
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 1>These people really took this shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

533
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And I felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird because my,</v>

534
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.030
<v Speaker 1>my joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my intent was to make people laugh.</v>

535
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've fucking nothing against this kid.</v>

536
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

537
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't not like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

538
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.860
<v Speaker 1>But then to see that they took this </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously and then the,</v>

539
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.900
<v Speaker 1>how the media was portraying me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

540
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 1>the in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a series of shows in Edinburgh and</v>

541
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:38.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal,</v>

542
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.453
<v Speaker 1>the wrote a Mike Ward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Ward is getting rich off of this </v>

543
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 1>little boy and I was doing shows in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edinburgh that no one makes money.</v>

544
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing like a 200 seat theater.</v>

545
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.011
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

546
00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 1>these fuckers are making me look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm becoming rich because of this little</v>

547
00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You became a target.</v>

548
00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.753
<v Speaker 1>And then quick bait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they get people to pay </v>

549
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't think it did affect me.</v>

550
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that I think the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>why it did affect,</v>

551
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 1>affect me is if all you get is hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can block hate out.</v>

552
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:12.150
<v Speaker 1>It's super easy to block Keto and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if all you get is love,</v>

553
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.890
<v Speaker 1>that's easy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was getting hate and love so,</v>

554
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.480
<v Speaker 1>so I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.323
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't let the Hayden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then someone had shown me love so </v>

556
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:19.964
<v Speaker 1>I'd open up and then the hated come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just so fucking weird and I </v>

557
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 1>was like googling myself too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

558
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

559
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:31.420
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an article about me in,</v>

560
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.323
<v Speaker 1>in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I google translate to see that </v>

561
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a piece of garbage.</v>

562
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 1>It was weird and then I just saw I shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't fun anymore.</v>

563
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 1>So I was doing shows and it people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

564
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd get these weird hecklers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

565
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

566
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:49.953
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like comedy anymore and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I've ever done my whole </v>

567
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the only thing I've ever loved.</v>

568
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't have kids because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

569
00:24:56.421 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 1>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not the type of person.</v>

570
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:00.614
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're good at organizing your </v>

571
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had kids,</v>

572
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I like the way I live my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a horrible father.</v>

573
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 1>So I never had kids because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

574
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.293
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I liked I don't like </v>

575
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I don't have kids,</v>

576

<v Speaker 1>much got rid of all my savings.</v>

596
00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So I told my manager I didn't like doing</v>

<v Speaker 1>of the month I was doing shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending like everything was okay.</v>

604
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.303
<v Speaker 1>And that took like maybe a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and a half of me going through </v>

605
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:36.290

<v Speaker 1>like I just be like lying down in the </v>

609

610
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:48.714
<v Speaker 1>drinking wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was drinking wine in my bathtub </v>

611
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least four hours a day.</v>

612
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

613
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:56.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could feel like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>was still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

640
00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd kill herself.</v>

641
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Seeing what her son has become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

642
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck a bitch?</v>

643
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:05.170
<v Speaker 1>But I started like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

644
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

645
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept on going or a page now and uh,</v>

646
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.513
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a better month ago I did an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview and she shared it and she was </v>

647
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:14.430
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

651
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:20.394
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember saying that to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's even crazier is I keep going </v>

652
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:25.580
<v Speaker 1>back to her page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

653
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

655
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:30.084
<v Speaker 1>Adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's probably whacked out of her hand </v>

656
00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:33.510
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.090
<v Speaker 1>who knows what she's on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And alcohol really helped.</v>

658
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not good,</v>

659
00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:40.130
<v Speaker 1>but alcohol really helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

660
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.620
<v Speaker 1>so you recommend it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend it if you're.</v>

661
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a depressant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

662
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.453
<v Speaker 1>it's a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be sad and drunk than </v>

663
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:51.540
<v Speaker 1>just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

665
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:54.840
<v Speaker 1>but I knew like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I still drank,</v>

666
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 1>but I drank my way less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way less.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was drinking maybe like four,</v>

668
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.000
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe six,</v>

669
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 1>26 ounces a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was drinking almost a full bottle</v>

670
00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 1>of vodka every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be impressive.</v>

671
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.193
<v Speaker 1>But yesterday jake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake was on 80 mile drive with </v>

681
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:34.130

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

682
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.990

<v Speaker 1>like not that much sugar.</v>

683
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're drinking it all day.</v>

684
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>She'll catch up now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I switched to vodka.</v>

685
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't stop thinking about my health.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote in 2009 and I did in a special.</v>

694
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 1>That was from 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a tour 2000,</v>

695
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:09.004
<v Speaker 1>10 to 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a super old joke and what's </v>

696
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.390
<v Speaker 1>fucked up defending something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote 10 years ago,</v>

697
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.453
<v Speaker 1>like people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were you thinking when you wrote </v>

698
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 1>that joke?</v>

699
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck.</v>

700
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking not even year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some one guy told me,</v>

701
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

702

<v Speaker 1>nowadays.</v>

703
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote that joke 10 years ago.</v>

705
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Ten years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to do say shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that he did right after.</v>

709
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I remember that Susan Smith Lady that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drowned her kids.</v>

710
00:30:44.321 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

711
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.373
<v Speaker 1>Crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found this lady drove her car into </v>

712
00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:49.924
<v Speaker 1>the river and just drowned her kids did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on purpose and a right after it </v>

713
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:56.090
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian holds,</v>

714
00:30:56.091 --> 00:30:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but it goes onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comedy story goes.</v>

715
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard those are bad kids.</v>

716
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 4>They sat that close to the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They never put away their blocks,</v>

717
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.493
<v Speaker 4>the constantly spilling the milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those kids will not be missed and </v>

718
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:10.930
<v Speaker 4>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

719
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 4>It was so ridiculously mean and funny at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same time,</v>

720
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.280
<v Speaker 4>and people have to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's you're in a nightclub.</v>

721
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 4>People are drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are allowed freedom of expression.</v>

722
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 4>It is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These aren't bad people.</v>

723
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.860
<v Speaker 4>Holtz was not a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not a bad person,</v>

724
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.823
<v Speaker 4>bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are people that are doing a </v>

725
00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 4>certain type of art form and here's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's weird,</v>

726
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.473
<v Speaker 4>this type of art form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do you say mean shit that you </v>

727
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:34.504
<v Speaker 4>don't really mean for whatever reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that because you're a guy </v>

728
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:39.820
<v Speaker 4>on stage and it's too much like you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually saying it,</v>

729
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 4>but if you were saying it in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're planning a fine,</v>

730
00:31:43.181 --> 00:31:44.014
<v Speaker 4>be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're playing a mean fucking villain </v>

731
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:49.090
<v Speaker 4>characters saying awful shit in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would be like,</v>

732
00:31:49.091 --> 00:31:50.770
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam Jackson is a great guy.</v>

733
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.880
<v Speaker 4>He didn't really kill that guy over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheeseburger like that.</v>

734
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 4>That was just a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>his character did that.</v>

735
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 4>He's a murderous monster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

736
00:31:57.461 --> 00:31:58.294
<v Speaker 4>He's screaming Bible Vengeance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bible verses and then fucking shooting </v>

737
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:02.764
<v Speaker 4>this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody has a problem with that </v>

738
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 4>because it's Samuel Jackson's obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>an actor in pulp fiction was a movie.</v>

739
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.160
<v Speaker 4>We don't have any confusion.</v>

740
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Santa file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then movie.</v>

742
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

743
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that's fucked up about</v>

744
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Canada though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a makeup artist named him.</v>

745
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 1>He quits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Sudep five times.</v>

746
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.270
<v Speaker 1>That's like the GSP of makeup artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

747
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.273
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's special effects makeup and he did </v>

748
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:29.340
<v Speaker 1>this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a,</v>

749
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.590
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a demo of what he can do.</v>

750
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a short film where he had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid and he murdered the kid.</v>

751
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:39.230
<v Speaker 1>He didn't actually murder the kid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

752
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 1>and then he put that out on the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

753
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:43.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name at the end and the whole who </v>

754
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:50.441
<v Speaker 1>played who and some fucking Weirdo in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany saw this and thought it was real</v>

755
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interpol,</v>

756
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:52.993
<v Speaker 1>Interpol called the Montreal cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal police went to remain </v>

757
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.670
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] house to arrest him for </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

758
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And then he said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kid,</v>

759
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw the video.</v>

760
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.661
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

761
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 1>but the kid see the kid in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's my neighbor.</v>

762
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 1>So they went to meet the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the murder victim,</v>

763
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 1>which was a little kid neighbor and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw he was alive and they still,</v>

764
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.383
<v Speaker 1>they took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took them to court because they </v>

765
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:16.844
<v Speaker 1>said what he did incited violence and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he and everyone told them they were </v>

766
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:22.994
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna win for sure because this </v>

767
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:24.824
<v Speaker 1>is just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is he had to defend </v>

768
00:33:26.661 --> 00:33:29.260
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to go to court and he had to.</v>

769
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 1>And when you win a court case like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it costs you 30,</v>

770
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80,000</v>

771
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.673
<v Speaker 1>to defend yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government doesn't give you your </v>

772
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 1>money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a stupid like my case,</v>

773
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda stupid.</v>

774
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:45.860
<v Speaker 1>But his case is fucking retarded because</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one ever kills someone.</v>

775
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Films it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then has the end credits.</v>

776
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

777
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they did,</v>

778
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.250
<v Speaker 3>now they'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you said no one ever does that.</v>

779
00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I would like to point you to a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Mike Ward.</v>

780
00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.780
<v Speaker 3>We clearly showed some fucking psycho </v>
<v Speaker 3>set established.</v>

781
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.250
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge accepted.</v>

782
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:07.140
<v Speaker 3>This is why Jordan Peterson was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>adamant that that bill was dangerous and</v>

783
00:34:07.141 --> 00:34:09.750
<v Speaker 3>that it would be bad for everybody in </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad for free speech.</v>

784
00:34:09.751 --> 00:34:10.584
<v Speaker 3>When we look at it in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have a distorted perception </v>

785
00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:13.584
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think we totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand your system of government </v>

786
00:34:15.931 --> 00:34:16.764
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to censorship because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys don't have freedom of expression </v>

787
00:34:19.801 --> 00:34:20.670
<v Speaker 3>the way we do in America.</v>

788
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.533
<v Speaker 1>What's fucked up too about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian is since all of our TV and all </v>

789
00:34:24.451 --> 00:34:27.780
<v Speaker 1>of our movies are American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the first thing I asked my lawyer,</v>

790
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about?</v>

791
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.420
<v Speaker 1>What about the First Amendment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

792
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

793
00:34:31.141 --> 00:34:32.940
<v Speaker 1>We don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

794
00:34:32.941 --> 00:34:33.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we don't.</v>

795
00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I know we're not America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we must have the Canadian version of</v>

796
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.730
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

797
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:39.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no like,</v>

798
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.410
<v Speaker 1>like people all over the world that talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit about the states.</v>

799
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:48.240
<v Speaker 1>The states is the only place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that speech is protected by law.</v>

800
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.360
<v Speaker 1>You can still get in trouble by saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

801
00:34:51.361 --> 00:34:52.020
<v Speaker 1>You can still get it.</v>

802
00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.853
<v Speaker 3>Protests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see Michelle Wolf Donk on the </v>

803
00:34:54.211 --> 00:34:55.890

<v Speaker 3>White House press correspondents' </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner,</v>

807
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:06.743

<v Speaker 3>seen the video and she didn't bother at </v>

808
00:35:11.161 --> 00:35:13.020
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact she killed.</v>

809
00:35:13.021 --> 00:35:16.950
<v Speaker 3>She had some funny shit and so he wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>today that she bumped so hard.</v>

810
00:35:16.951 --> 00:35:19.560
<v Speaker 3>They're now going to bring someone like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to do comedy anymore.</v>

811
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.060
<v Speaker 3>They're going to bring in an author.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

812
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.283
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So called comedian Michelle was bombed </v>

813
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.130
<v Speaker 3>so badly as you're in the White House </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondence dinner that this year for</v>

814
00:35:29.131 --> 00:35:31.650
<v Speaker 3>the first time in decades they will have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an author instead of a comedian.</v>

815
00:35:31.651 --> 00:35:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Good first step to come back with dying </v>
<v Speaker 3>evening and tradition.</v>

816
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Exclamation point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

817
00:35:36.091 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 3>I will go question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She writes.</v>

818
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I bet you'd be on my side if I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed a journalist.</v>

819
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

820
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.880
<v Speaker 3>We'll get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got 297,769</v>

821
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:52.380
<v Speaker 3>likes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty 4,000.</v>

822
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:54.810
<v Speaker 3>One hundred 69 retweets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of which is mine.</v>

823
00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.200
<v Speaker 3>That was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit is hilarious.</v>

824
00:35:58.201 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a savage and he's.</v>

825
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did was silly.</v>

826
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:04.210
<v Speaker 3>You can't say someone bought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he does.</v>

827
00:36:04.211 --> 00:36:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's his move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

828
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.413
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't say someone bombed </v>

829
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 3>when we can watch the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't bomb.</v>

830
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 3>You pull it up at anytime you want and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could watch that video.</v>

831
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 3>She killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that though,</v>

832
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:18.180
<v Speaker 3>because since the people that have seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

833
00:36:18.181 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't bump,</v>

834
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.500
<v Speaker 3>but the people that didn't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they think,</v>

835
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the mag a mindset.</v>

836
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had a mag,</v>

837
00:36:25.361 --> 00:36:26.194
<v Speaker 3>a mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be you don't need any reality </v>

838
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:29.904
<v Speaker 3>other than the reality that you all </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided upon and you press forward with </v>

839
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:33.774
<v Speaker 3>fucking hashtags and American flags and </v>
<v Speaker 3>red and white hats and you just keep </v>

840
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:38.040
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>

841
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.873
<v Speaker 3>You just keep moving and eventually what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing is you're like hacking the </v>

842
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:46.050
<v Speaker 3>news cycle because the news cycle is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so everything lasts a day.</v>

843
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe two days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four days sick.</v>

844
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fuck about stormy daniels.</v>

845
00:36:49.821 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Stop talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over,</v>

846
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.330
<v Speaker 3>like that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's.</v>

847
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.393
<v Speaker 3>And they've kind of figured that out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of an odd way like even him with </v>

848
00:36:58.031 --> 00:36:58.900
<v Speaker 3>the stormy Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

849
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Still talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll go away.</v>

850
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.640
<v Speaker 3>It's going away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

851
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:06.900
<v Speaker 3>like the fucking lawyer now he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>charged with domestic violence.</v>

852
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:07.883
<v Speaker 3>The lawyer for stone stormy day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who was going to run for </v>

853
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:11.154
<v Speaker 3>president now he got charged with </v>
<v Speaker 3>domestic violence and check out a </v>

854
00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>restraining order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over baby.</v>

855
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.960
<v Speaker 3>So like you just keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they do is just keep moving,</v>

856
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 3>just keep moving and eventually go like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

857
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously she didn't bomb.</v>

858
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.000
<v Speaker 3>He can say she did and even she'd done </v>
<v Speaker 3>because them keep moving,</v>

859
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.103
<v Speaker 3>just keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do nothing ever sticks </v>

860
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.440
<v Speaker 3>because he's caught a wave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's the new cycles.</v>

861
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's so crazy.</v>

862
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing stationary that we call </v>
<v Speaker 3>can examine for long periods of time.</v>

863
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Everything's just moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's just constantly moving.</v>

864
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 3>There's no stability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's k with him in the White House.</v>

865
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.760
<v Speaker 3>He knows there's no stability because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually got to be the president.</v>

866
00:37:49.761 --> 00:37:50.594
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he figured like he treats everyone like </v>

867
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 3>a comic treats hecklers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

868
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 3>And he's said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people that say that he still,</v>

869
00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so smart,</v>

870
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.353
<v Speaker 3>like he figured he figured all this shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out that all the protocol that </v>

871
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 3>was established in the fucking 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds,</v>

872
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 3>early $19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

873
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not Harry Truman.</v>

874
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.330
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not George Washington.</v>

875
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.340
<v Speaker 3>This is 2018.</v>

876
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.680
<v Speaker 3>There's porn everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

877
00:38:16.681 --> 00:38:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Oxycontin's are killing people and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one's talking about it.</v>

878
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.393
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes are killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No politician ever brings up the fact </v>

879
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 3>half a million people die every year in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>

880
00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Just from cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up,</v>

881
00:38:26.371 --> 00:38:27.840
<v Speaker 3>keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

882
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he had that little jeff </v>

883
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:30.294
<v Speaker 3>sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little munchkin working for him forever </v>

884
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.970
<v Speaker 3>with saying that good people don't smoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana like the whole thing.</v>

885
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.973
<v Speaker 3>Chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's knows it's chaos because he's the </v>

886
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:38.344
<v Speaker 3>top guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You imagine being the top guy in </v>

887
00:38:41.031 --> 00:38:41.864
<v Speaker 3>something as insane as like the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States governmental system and seeing </v>

888
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.953
<v Speaker 3>the lobbyists and special interest </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups and all the money and all the </v>

889
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:49.324
<v Speaker 3>fucking cast and Saudi Arabia's cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>up journalists and you gotta keep your </v>

890
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 3>mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking madness.</v>

891
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 3>And he's the top madman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wonder why he tweets shit like this.</v>

892
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 3>He knows there's no rules so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could all fall apart at any minute.</v>

893
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching today.</v>

894
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:04.684
<v Speaker 3>Him pardoning a Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why you guys still do this </v>

895
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:06.934
<v Speaker 3>kind of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was probably tweeting about Jim </v>

896
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Acosta being a fag and then turns around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and goes,</v>

897
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 3>this Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good Turkey.</v>

898
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 3>He came here illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them.</v>

899
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he do with that Turkey?</v>

900
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:17.884
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

901
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.360
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just decided to.</v>

902
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Turkey gets to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

903
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 3>What happens to those immediately when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they shut the cameras off for sure.</v>

904
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:30.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling you you're going to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>you for Christmas.</v>

905
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 3>So the whole idea that that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

906
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:35.110
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to decide one Turkey,</v>

907
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.090
<v Speaker 3>one turkeys are good Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

908
00:39:37.091 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 3>and everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>save it.</v>

909
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.123
<v Speaker 3>Save it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

910
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Out with the ax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psych.</v>

911
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I was just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put his head on a log chunk.</v>

912
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.140
<v Speaker 3>People would freak out.</v>

913
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.060
<v Speaker 3>But you knew I was going to kill a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey.</v>

914
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Why were you upset that I'm killing this</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey?</v>

915
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all in St Louis.</v>

916
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday he tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said some,</v>

917
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.433
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe Saudi Arabia may have been </v>

918
00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:54.990
<v Speaker 3>behind that Kosha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shaggy.</v>

919
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

920
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 3>did you just figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is he a detective?</v>

921
00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.040
<v Speaker 3>It took this long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew.</v>

922
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

923
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.610
<v Speaker 3>let's examine that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stay.</v>

924
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

925
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you really know?</v>

926
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Only what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey to told us.</v>

927
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Only what the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody tells you.</v>

928
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.953
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I'm not advocating </v>

929
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:14.314
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyone who says they know what </v>

930
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:17.350
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Jesus,</v>

931
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.500
<v Speaker 3>the only people that know what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the people that did it,</v>

932
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:21.663
<v Speaker 3>and then the people who think they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to the people that are </v>

933
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:26.230
<v Speaker 3>examining it and then the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are reading third,</v>

934
00:40:26.231 --> 00:40:26.891
<v Speaker 3>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fifth,</v>

935
00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:29.350
<v Speaker 3>sixth hand about what happened.</v>

936
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.900
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

937
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:32.763
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they killed him.</v>

938
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

939
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:37.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure this is what I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that if you stare at the sun,</v>

940
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:38.930
<v Speaker 3>it burns your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

941
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

942
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know.</v>

943
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that if you a light dead trees </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on fire,</v>

944
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.160
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a wildfire.</v>

945
00:40:48.161 --> 00:40:49.750
<v Speaker 3>It's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure of that.</v>

946
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who killed that guy?</v>

947
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure someone killed them.</v>

948
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.450
<v Speaker 3>They're all admitting they killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure that pretty sure.</v>

949
00:40:58.810 --> 00:40:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know.</v>

950
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one day saying that they had,</v>

951
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.503
<v Speaker 3>the Turkish government had recordings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't want to share them </v>

952
00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:08.194
<v Speaker 3>publicly because they didn't want the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other embassies knowing how they record </v>

953
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 3>embassies because you're not supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

954
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what they said.</v>

955
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.030
<v Speaker 3>If you're not supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they probably all do it.</v>

956
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

957
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:17.471
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

958
00:41:17.471 --> 00:41:20.320
<v Speaker 3>apparently there's video and audio is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I read,</v>

959
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.120
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

960
00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Do I know when you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

961
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:25.450
<v Speaker 3>they killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking killed him.</v>

962
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Said that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is an audio tape,</v>

963
00:41:27.581 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't going to hear it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to hear it.</v>

964
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.180
<v Speaker 3>It was totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't need to.</v>

965
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

966
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:33.950
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

967
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly</v>

968
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.290
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

970
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.513
<v Speaker 4>lived with Chrissy bills forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's like is going to get eaten </v>

971
00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:45.190
<v Speaker 4>and then one day gets heat and along the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

972
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen the documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a Warner Herzog movie.</v>

973
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the greatest unintentional </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy of all time.</v>

974
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.870
<v Speaker 4>It's really good what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get Lit and watch it.</v>

975
00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 4>You're going to fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a guy who is.</v>

976
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.430
<v Speaker 4>There's something wrong with him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>right away like you,</v>

977
00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 4>you start making judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

978
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 4>is he gang?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's gay.</v>

979
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.700
<v Speaker 4>I think he's gay and he fighting it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the ways he fights it,</v>

980
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:10.010
<v Speaker 4>he goes and lives in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not bullshitting.</v>

981
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 4>He didn't get the term bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

982
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.013
<v Speaker 4>he's saving bears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's like so feminine and he brings </v>

983
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:19.670
<v Speaker 4>his fucking camera and he's walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the forest.</v>

984
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I was just gay,</v>

985
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I was gay then I would just go meet a</v>

986
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 4>guy at a truck stop or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not gay.</v>

987
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.753
<v Speaker 4>So it's like who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who are walking around by themselves in </v>

988
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:37.770
<v Speaker 4>the woods surrounded by bears going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

989
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 4>files just gay or be so easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

990
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 4>do you hear how you're saying it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the stereotypical gay voices.</v>

991
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:44.594
<v Speaker 4>One of the weirdest things because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like not a single masculine </v>

992
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:51.680
<v Speaker 4>heterosexual male who uses that speech </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern.</v>

993
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Like that speech pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exclusive to gay men.</v>

994
00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.640
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

995
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

996
00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 4>this is a speech pattern that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>associate with homosexuals and you know,</v>

997
00:43:03.771 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 4>you could say someone's prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you look,</v>

998
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 4>you know it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

999
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:08.443
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear someone talking and saying </v>

1000
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:12.890
<v Speaker 4>homosexual type things in that voice you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

1001
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.753
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a gay guy.</v>

1002
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend come out of the closet to</v>

1003
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 1>me and the whole time he was coming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1004
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.473
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to pretend like I'm </v>

1005
00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 1>surprised because he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1006
00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I got a Ta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1007
00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:26.613
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

1008
00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.330
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is weird.</v>

1009
00:43:31.331 --> 00:43:31.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1010
00:43:31.991 --> 00:43:35.650
<v Speaker 4>you know what it's weird is any </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion of it is deemed homophobic.</v>

1011
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.650
<v Speaker 4>It's not homophobic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No problem with me being gay,</v>

1012
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.480
<v Speaker 4>but it is weird that some percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 10 percent,</v>

1013
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:44.343
<v Speaker 4>20 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the number is of gay guys talk </v>

1014
00:43:46.871 --> 00:43:48.790
<v Speaker 4>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're adorable.</v>

1015
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say gay things.</v>

1016
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.270
<v Speaker 4>They have their fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Justin Martin deals.</v>

1017
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Good friend of mine.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Swings.</v>

1019
00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.460
<v Speaker 4>He swings when he walks he sachets as he</v>
<v Speaker 4>walks into a room.</v>

1020
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:02.620
<v Speaker 4>He's hilarious too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking funny.</v>

1021
00:44:02.621 --> 00:44:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Standup comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's,</v>

1022
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.343
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1023
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:10.330
<v Speaker 4>he will take on those kind of vocal </v>
<v Speaker 4>affectations,</v>

1024
00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:11.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not negative.</v>

1025
00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.653
<v Speaker 1>There's a comic of Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good friend named John Sanka </v>

1026
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Dart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a gay guy,</v>

1027
00:44:16.171 --> 00:44:19.890
<v Speaker 1>but a gay audiences don't like him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a guy guy.</v>

1028
00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Like he's from a small town in Manitoba </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1029
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.180
<v Speaker 1>So gay people don't like him cause he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's,</v>

1030
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.930
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy guy and then we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>last summer and I was like,</v>

1031
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you should do a show and</v>

1032
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.873
<v Speaker 2>call it no gays allowed because whenever</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has gay people it always goes wrong </v>

1033
00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 2>because they get angry and that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1034
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.950
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy guy but he's gay and they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>

1035
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 2>But here's what's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was a guy guy but he was straight,</v>

1036
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 2>they'd probably want to turn him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1037
00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.830
<v Speaker 2>he should pretend to be a straight guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like really easy to turn.</v>

1038
00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 2>A buddy of mine who was a makeup artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super good dude who's gay as fuck.</v>

1039
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 2>And he was always telling me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>

1040
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.073
<v Speaker 2>He would do airtech street guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would suck his dick straight of him </v>

1041
00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.460
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're laughing.</v>

1042
00:45:05.461 --> 00:45:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

1043
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:07.643
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would give me details like what is </v>

1044
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:11.400
<v Speaker 2>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

1045
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.100
<v Speaker 2>They like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get a thrill out of turning guys,</v>

1046
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they're turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

1047
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend that used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first moved to Montreal,</v>

1048
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.513
<v Speaker 2>we he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to a gay bar because a lot of </v>

1049
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 2>women go there because they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get hit on,</v>

1050
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.493
<v Speaker 2>and then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just pretend like we're gay and </v>

1051
00:45:27.511 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 2>we'll try to have sex with the lady for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time.</v>

1052
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Speaker 2>He was really good at it because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like super thin,</v>

1053
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 2>so he did look like a gay guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just looked like a fucking weird,</v>

1054
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.660
<v Speaker 2>weird fucking Chubby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight guy going into a gay bar.</v>

1055
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.733
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck gay guys built like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm always surprised whenever I see </v>

1056
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:49.850
<v Speaker 2>chubby gay guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe.</v>

1057
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe they're really gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1062
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.900

<v Speaker 2>I see it differently.</v>

1063
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.793
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about them as attracted to </v>

<v Speaker 2>someone who has got a lot of natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources stored in the skin.</v>

1099
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting too,</v>

1100
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 3>in England they call uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people from India,</v>

1101
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:43.263
<v Speaker 3>Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think of that as Asia because it </v>

1102
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:46.414
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we got weird with oriental at some </v>

1103
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 3>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oriental became derogatory,</v>

1104
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.853
<v Speaker 3>some weird way.</v>

1105
00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:54.973
<v Speaker 3>Oriana was normal like oriental rugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like a thing you'd go to </v>

1106
00:47:57.701 --> 00:47:58.850
<v Speaker 3>oriental rugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 3>That's like if someone was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1108
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.840
<v Speaker 3>toothpaste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1109
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.670
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey motherfucker,</v>

1110
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.593
<v Speaker 3>you can't say that shit anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at one point in time oriental was </v>

1111
00:48:07.061 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 3>like a total.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real thing.</v>

1112
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was part of the language.</v>

1113
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.633
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so now we say Asian because we try </v>

1114
00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:17.770
<v Speaker 3>to be politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Asia is fucking giant.</v>

1115
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks in Asia.</v>

1116
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:21.663
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1117
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what those,</v>

1118
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 3>like the people that ended up on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>island one dude,</v>

1119
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck do you,</v>

1120
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.720
<v Speaker 3>you're running away from something to </v>
<v Speaker 3>end up.</v>

1121
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Well everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1122
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read about the migration of </v>

1123
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:37.534
<v Speaker 3>people from Africa spreading out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big part of what they're doing </v>

1124
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.520
<v Speaker 3>is trying to get away from people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are trying to tell them,</v>

1125
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.533
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all either they run out of </v>

1126
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're run a food or they're being,</v>

1127
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.430
<v Speaker 3>they're being forced out of areas like </v>
<v Speaker 3>new people come in,</v>

1128
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.660
<v Speaker 3>people escape and survive and did our </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire history as human beings.</v>

1129
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.493
<v Speaker 3>It's like bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more powerful human beings move into an </v>

1130
00:48:58.331 --> 00:48:59.164
<v Speaker 3>area and kill and rape and then spread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spread out and then keep going and </v>

1131
00:49:02.531 --> 00:49:05.650
<v Speaker 3>everybody else just keeps going and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually fortify in the distance.</v>

1132
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:06.484
<v Speaker 3>You get a new city and they try to hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>them off and then new people coming </v>

1133
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:09.364
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so many instances from </v>

1134
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:12.574
<v Speaker 3>the mon goals to the Romans being go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and back and matt all through </v>

1135
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:16.510
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you broke it down,</v>

1136
00:49:16.511 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at it like a math problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's happening here,</v>

1137
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.193
<v Speaker 3>here's this happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These groups of people get together and </v>

1138
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:22.384
<v Speaker 3>then they develop some shit there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills other groups of people and they </v>

1139
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:26.160
<v Speaker 3>push into those groups of people and try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fuck their chicks,</v>

1140
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.140
<v Speaker 3>steal money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck the chicks,</v>

1141
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.460
<v Speaker 3>eat their food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they do the same thing and then</v>

1142
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.600
<v Speaker 3>and then people go back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all people have done.</v>

1143
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Like there's never been a time where no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one was at war.</v>

1144
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Like if you've ever gone through human </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1145
00:49:40.691 --> 00:49:41.524
<v Speaker 3>there's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there was a period of a hundred </v>

1146
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 3>years where there was no warrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never happened.</v>

1147
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Never ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the best guy to ask about.</v>

1148
00:49:47.111 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 3>This isn't impressive how they built </v>
<v Speaker 3>those arrows,</v>

1149
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.093
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The craftsmanship because their proper </v>

1150
00:49:51.821 --> 00:49:52.720
<v Speaker 3>error,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they look like.</v>

1151
00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:55.390
<v Speaker 3>They have pictures of the arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently he died.</v>

1152
00:49:55.391 --> 00:49:56.224
<v Speaker 3>Just have the arrows hitting them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way I was thinking it was in </v>

1153
00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 3>order for an Arrow to be done properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1154
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.130
<v Speaker 3>and you could aim and then hit someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and killed them.</v>

1155
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:05.740
<v Speaker 3>It has to go through the whole structure</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the pelvis.</v>

1156
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to.</v>

1157
00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:07.684
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with the kid hit a bunch of </v>

1158
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:09.750
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1159
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.860
<v Speaker 3>if they hit him a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get a shot him in the gut.</v>

1160
00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:12.973
<v Speaker 3>Shitty arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't think they have shitty </v>

1161
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:16.090
<v Speaker 3>hours because they need them to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1162
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:19.870
<v Speaker 3>So there has got to be island animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're hunting these animals.</v>

1163
00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:24.560
<v Speaker 3>But it's not that hard for these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these kinds of tribes to,</v>

1164
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 3>if they have the proper would on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>island,</v>

1165
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they um,</v>

1166
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:29.503
<v Speaker 4>they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have been making bows and arrows </v>

1167
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.694
<v Speaker 4>for a long time and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll use certain fibers from certain </v>

1168
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:38.580
<v Speaker 4>trees and they weave them together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a bowstring and you know,</v>

1169
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.433
<v Speaker 4>if they have enough goodwood and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have good fiber and they have the </v>

1170
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:45.920
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1171
00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:46.754
<v Speaker 4>even if they don't have metal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could still to this day I found one </v>

1172
00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 4>in Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found an old,</v>

1173
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what era it's from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I found a an arrowhead,</v>

1174
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.963
<v Speaker 4>but while I was actually bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found an actual arrowhead from some </v>

1175
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:00.344
<v Speaker 4>native American tribe that they left by </v>
<v Speaker 4>and apparently they were like really </v>

1176
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:03.434
<v Speaker 4>common,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people find them all the time </v>

1177
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:05.833
<v Speaker 4>because you think of the thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years that the indigenous people were </v>

1178
00:51:07.971 --> 00:51:10.970
<v Speaker 4>here and all the different animals they </v>
<v Speaker 4>shot with bows and arrows.</v>

1179
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 4>They figured out how to do it so these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people must know how to do it too and if</v>

1180
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:15.314
<v Speaker 4>they have enough good stone to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>something flint or something similar to </v>

1181
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 4>make the arrowheads or maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>using something toxic,</v>

1182
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:23.563
<v Speaker 4>maybe they have some sort of toxic plant</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just dipping the tip of a </v>

1183
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 4>sharpened tip into it.</v>

1184
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.850
<v Speaker 2>If if you dip the tip and something </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxic,</v>

1185
00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.910
<v Speaker 2>don't can you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you can apparently,</v>

1186
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:39.420
<v Speaker 2>but not the area near the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

1187
00:51:39.421 --> 00:51:40.254
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of these tribes that shoot </v>

1188
00:51:42.241 --> 00:51:45.900
<v Speaker 2>things that shoot things with poison on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of their arrows.</v>

1189
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1190
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.010
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that they just didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat it,</v>

1191
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.873
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

1192
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.073
<v Speaker 2>if they don't hit it perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to wait for the </v>

1193
00:51:53.401 --> 00:51:54.234
<v Speaker 2>perfect shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to hit it so they </v>

1194
00:51:55.471 --> 00:51:58.140
<v Speaker 2>can hit it in the ass or in the neck or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck they hid it.</v>

1195
00:51:58.141 --> 00:52:00.870
<v Speaker 2>If they have poison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing's going to die.</v>

1196
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used poison for a lot of weird shit</v>

1197
00:52:03.421 --> 00:52:04.330
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1198
00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:06.600
<v Speaker 2>use poison to fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really strange.</v>

1199
00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:08.340
<v Speaker 2>They tape this season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fish.</v>

1200
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:52:09.811 --> 00:52:10.644
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take this plant and they smash it </v>

1202
00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:12.970
<v Speaker 2>up</v>

1203
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.550
<v Speaker 4>and they make this green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

1204
00:52:15.551 --> 00:52:18.330
<v Speaker 4>that the Yanomami may have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1205
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.950
<v Speaker 4>some more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe Bolivia or something like that.</v>

1206
00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.800
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those tribal peoples that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives almost,</v>

1207
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:24.723
<v Speaker 4>almost uncontacted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still some like w they'll have like </v>

1208
00:52:27.851 --> 00:52:30.010
<v Speaker 4>under armour tee shirts on and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

1209
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.520
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1210
00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:35.980
<v Speaker 4>the barefoot and they take these plants </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I forget what the planet is,</v>

1211
00:52:35.981 --> 00:52:39.040
<v Speaker 4>but they smash this plant up and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this green pulp.</v>

1212
00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:43.780
<v Speaker 4>And then they put this pulp in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>ponds and these fish just float.</v>

1213
00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:44.943
<v Speaker 4>It's some sort of toxin and it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucks these fish up and they just float </v>

1214
00:52:48.101 --> 00:52:48.934
<v Speaker 4>up to the top and then they'd go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>scoop the fish and take them out of </v>

1215
00:52:51.221 --> 00:52:52.960
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it like paralyzes them.</v>

1216
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:54.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not toxic to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1217
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe they lit up,</v>

1218
00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 2>but I guess you have to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hungry to think,</v>

1219
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:03.710
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not killing enough or getting enough</v>

1220
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 2>fruits or vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to poison these things and I'd</v>

1221
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:10.490
<v Speaker 2>rather die being poisoned than starving </v>
<v Speaker 2>to death.</v>

1222
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:11.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1223
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.523
<v Speaker 4>full have been on the edge of survival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they've figured out survival down </v>

1224
00:53:16.131 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 4>to like everything in their area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know what's edible.</v>

1225
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.600
<v Speaker 4>They know what's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what to avoid,</v>

1226
00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 4>what to cultivate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what to seek</v>

1227
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1228
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know how to do it,</v>

1229
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:30.234
<v Speaker 3>so if these people are on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's a resource rich island and it </v>

1230
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 3>seems to be like an island in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ocean,</v>

1231
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.113
<v Speaker 3>as long as they don't kill too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as they keep a certain healthy </v>

1232
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 3>population of animals around are </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognizant of that as this.</v>

1233
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:42.930
<v Speaker 3>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1234
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:47.840
<v Speaker 3>the video I found in 2008 where some </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishermen or someone found them and them</v>

1235
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 3>coconuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1236
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 3>So these people apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1237
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you follow the story,</v>

1238
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.113
<v Speaker 3>they came from Africa 60 something </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years ago and I guess probably </v>

1239
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.030
<v Speaker 3>during the ice age the coastline was </v>
<v Speaker 3>very different,</v>

1240
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:09.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water levels were way lower and then</v>

1241
00:54:09.061 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 3>when the ice melted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oceans rose and then we get,</v>

1242
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:13.523
<v Speaker 3>we got now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe it was a much larger island or </v>

1243
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was like the bearing landmass </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could get across it.</v>

1244
00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.293
<v Speaker 3>Fuck your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speak a language that no one else not </v>

1245
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 3>even close to anything else since it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been so long.</v>

1246
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:28.523
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's combined with Lang throw it here </v>

1247
00:54:30.961 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 3>is combined with body language who </v>
<v Speaker 3>seemed to have a link.</v>

1248
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 3>So they were like telling him to throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and they'd given him coconuts.</v>

1249
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.460
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy how friendly they are without</v>

1250
00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 3>knowing who the person is and where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're from.</v>

1251
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the dude's giving them free food,</v>

1252
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 3>so I think they're pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a bunch of free.</v>

1253
00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Coconut is definitely a way to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with people,</v>

1254
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.253
<v Speaker 3>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that guy had coconuts instead of a </v>

1255
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably through bibles,</v>

1256
00:54:57.361 --> 00:54:59.790
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

1257
00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Tried to eat the Bible up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1258
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.240
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

1259
00:55:03.241 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Imagine some guy just showing up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving you free food.</v>

1260
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Can you see my Dick?</v>

1261
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Is that what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this video?</v>

1262
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Some videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outrageous.</v>

1263
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a real translation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1264
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1265
00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.360
<v Speaker 3>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1266
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:18.360
<v Speaker 3>so it says a wooden act similar to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain acts.</v>

1267
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking crazy looking carried </v>

1268
00:55:20.611 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 3>by all men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they.</v>

1269
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they might not even have like metal.</v>

1270
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:31.490
<v Speaker 3>It seems like if he's got a wooden acts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they have what they're using</v>

1271
00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:35.750
<v Speaker 3>for arrowheads and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kind of fucking interests.</v>

1272
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude is fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>

1273
00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:42.981
<v Speaker 3>it's really what's weird about it is you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't really go there like Jay,</v>

1274
00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:48.110
<v Speaker 3>you guys ever read or watched that movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the city ofZ ,</v>

1275
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 3>the lost city of z?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was called?</v>

1276
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.913
<v Speaker 3>It was about an explorer from England </v>
<v Speaker 3>who made his way to South America and </v>

1277
00:55:56.641 --> 00:55:58.890
<v Speaker 3>eventually got eaten by cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly,</v>

1278
00:55:58.891 --> 00:55:59.724
<v Speaker 3>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1279
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:03.390
<v Speaker 3>but he was looking for this last Mayan </v>
<v Speaker 3>or Aztec city.</v>

1280
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Was it a Mayan city?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lost City of Z.</v>

1281
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1282
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:09.300
<v Speaker 3>so he was looking for some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1283
00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:10.530
<v Speaker 3>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've.</v>

1284
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.050
<v Speaker 3>They know this for sure now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some really,</v>

1285
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:13.884
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really ancient cities in the Amazon and </v>

1286
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:18.930
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know from when.</v>

1287
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:19.853
<v Speaker 3>They don't know who built them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't even know who it's </v>

1288
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.310
<v Speaker 3>different culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1289
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.183
<v Speaker 3>it's a culture that's long gone and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the area where they had the city has </v>

1290
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 3>been absorbed by the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>

1291
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.513
<v Speaker 3>they find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think either from satellites or from </v>

1292
00:56:32.321 --> 00:56:33.154
<v Speaker 3>some kind of imagery where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticing these really obvious grid </v>

1293
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:37.594
<v Speaker 3>patterns that indicate irrigation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they had fields and they had </v>

1294
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 3>streets and so this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this English explorer.</v>

1295
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.740
<v Speaker 3>What was the gentleman's name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry Faucet.</v>

1296
00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Here's the book's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Percy Percy Fawcett and so this,</v>

1297
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.983
<v Speaker 3>this dude went to the jungles of Brazil </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple times looking for this lost </v>

1298
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:58.660
<v Speaker 3>city of gold to 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60.</v>

1299
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was really,</v>

1300
00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a cool movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not,</v>

1301
00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:04.043
<v Speaker 3>it's not the best movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's cool because it's like you get </v>

1302
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 3>to see the lost city of z.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He found it before he was killed.</v>

1303
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.351
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1304
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:13.570
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he found something.</v>

1305
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.270
<v Speaker 3>He found that I don't want to spoil the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

1306
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a bad movie.</v>

1307
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.620
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting to me is that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1308
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:21.663
<v Speaker 3>you just got to put yourself in the mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that lived in 1860 and they </v>

1309
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 3>literally had no idea what the fuck was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in South America.</v>

1310
00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 3>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But someone would come back and say,</v>

1311
00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:36.170
<v Speaker 3>author has a story of his jetties down </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jungle river and the guy would stand</v>

1312
00:57:36.971 --> 00:57:37.804
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We met the uncontacted tribe and they </v>

1313
00:57:39.611 --> 00:57:42.190
<v Speaker 3>would talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have brought back pod pottery and this</v>

1314
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:43.024
<v Speaker 3>is a spearhead and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's drawings of the animals that </v>

1315
00:57:46.211 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I saw as get drawings of crocodiles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking giant Paranas and shit.</v>

1316
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.430
<v Speaker 2>It must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>must've been guys that made that shit up</v>

1317
00:57:52.431 --> 00:57:53.264
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the difference between a guy that </v>

1318
00:57:54.981 --> 00:57:58.400
<v Speaker 2>actually had real pottery and just me </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting my wife,</v>

1319
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a full will.</v>

1320
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened with the dinosaurs,</v>

1321
00:58:01.521 --> 00:58:02.354
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That people would pretend to say I have </v>

1322
00:58:03.741 --> 00:58:05.870
<v Speaker 2>seen dinosaurs like in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1323
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:06.411
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1324
00:58:06.411 --> 00:58:07.244
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they first discovered that a </v>

1325
00:58:08.241 --> 00:58:09.074
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur was a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people started faking it and they </v>

1326
00:58:12.771 --> 00:58:15.950
<v Speaker 2>would come up with fake dinosaurs to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

1327
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:16.784
<v Speaker 2>like boost their science credit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are like legitimate people or </v>

1328
00:58:19.791 --> 00:58:21.290
<v Speaker 2>thought to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1329
00:58:21.291 --> 00:58:25.100
<v Speaker 2>the credibility accountability rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then was not what it is today.</v>

1330
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:25.953
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the peer review process </v>

1331
00:58:27.891 --> 00:58:28.724
<v Speaker 2>was the sound of these fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were maniacs out there just trying to </v>

1332
00:58:31.131 --> 00:58:31.964
<v Speaker 2>pretend that they found dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they use like go fuck a buffalo park </v>

1333
00:58:36.211 --> 00:58:37.044
<v Speaker 2>or some shit.</v>

1334
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what I found.</v>

1335
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was just digging randomly.</v>

1336
00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Even now though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you found bones from an elephant</v>

1337
00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.450
<v Speaker 2>and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1338
00:58:47.451 --> 00:58:48.284
<v Speaker 2>I dug this out in Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like people would be like that </v>

1339
00:58:51.231 --> 00:58:52.140
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1340
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:53.063
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing that's like nine feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>long for a little while and then you </v>

1341
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.190
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual scientists will get ahold of it.</v>

1342
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.671
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1343
00:58:58.671 --> 00:59:00.650
<v Speaker 2>this is an elephant bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking idiot.</v>

1344
00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.350
<v Speaker 2>This is a dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we were in 17,</v>

1345
00:59:03.351 --> 00:59:04.410
<v Speaker 2>46.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:07.730
<v Speaker 2>What year was it when they did that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dinosaur thing?</v>

1347
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some sort of like a battle,</v>

1348
00:59:11.211 --> 00:59:13.580
<v Speaker 2>like everybody's trying to discover the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latest and the greatest.</v>

1349
00:59:13.581 --> 00:59:15.440
<v Speaker 2>They'd pee shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't belong.</v>

1350
00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some weird wackiness.</v>

1351
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 2>But you know what's fascinating to me is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that something has to</v>

1352
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.173
<v Speaker 3>die in like mud or it has to die and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be at the bottom of the ocean or </v>

1353
00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:28.964
<v Speaker 3>a lake in silk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something has to happen to preserve </v>

1354
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:34.130
<v Speaker 3>those bones because if it doesn't then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get nothing.</v>

1355
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:36.043
<v Speaker 3>That's why we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know Jack Shit about what like </v>

1356
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 3>octopus look like with Octopi looked </v>
<v Speaker 3>like $5 million years ago,</v>

1357
00:59:44.061 --> 00:59:45.580
<v Speaker 3>60 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1358
00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.493
<v Speaker 3>like the cracking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that could have easily been a real </v>

1359
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1360
00:59:49.401 --> 00:59:50.234
<v Speaker 3>A fucking super enormous octopus that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could eat whales because there are some </v>

1361
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:55.100
<v Speaker 3>big fucking words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some videos.</v>

1362
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have.</v>

1363
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.710
<v Speaker 3>There's no bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1364
00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 3>They just die in mud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 3>It has to tie in something to become </v>
<v Speaker 3>fossilized now.</v>

1366
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:05.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

1367
01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:07.580
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're seeing that fossil,</v>

1368
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:08.443
<v Speaker 3>do you know that that's not really the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bone that has all the mineral that has </v>

1369
01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:12.584
<v Speaker 3>replaced the bone over like thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>and millions of years or whatever it </v>

1370
01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 3>takes?</v>

1371
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When something's fossilized,</v>

1372
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 3>like if you see like a fossilized shark </v>
<v Speaker 3>tooth and it's black,</v>

1373
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.093
<v Speaker 3>that's not the real color of the teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the color of all the minerals that </v>

1374
01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:26.324
<v Speaker 3>have replaced what the tooth used to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>as it remains compressed and all this </v>

1375
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.810
<v Speaker 3>sludge and mud and shit over millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1376
01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:33.644
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty freaky shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like when you see these dinosaur </v>

1377
01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:36.614
<v Speaker 3>bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1378
01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.390
<v Speaker 3>they're fossilized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them,</v>

1379
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.343
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of the bones that we find a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead things they've become like a piece </v>

1380
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:43.214
<v Speaker 3>of rock to could look completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different because I've heard people say </v>

1381
01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:50.180
<v Speaker 3>that most dinosaurs that we look at now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we think about how they look,</v>

1382
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:51.043
<v Speaker 3>they really had feathers now thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just assumed that the sound of </v>

1383
01:00:54.231 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Jurassic Park is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably isn't.</v>

1384
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck they sounded like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might not have made any noise here.</v>

1385
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.410
<v Speaker 3>The great dinosaur fossil hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1386
01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:02.403
<v Speaker 3>the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>China has enjoyed unprecedented gold </v>

1387
01:01:04.101 --> 01:01:08.330
<v Speaker 3>rush of feather dinosaur fossils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many are real?</v>

1388
01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there have been some feathered fossils.</v>

1389
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:12.463
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a museum in Montana and Bozeman </v>

1390
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.920
<v Speaker 3>in the museum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of science museum,</v>

1391
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:23.870
<v Speaker 3>and they have a one of those rappers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a velociraptor with feathers,</v>

1392
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.350
<v Speaker 3>like a model of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a life size Velossa,</v>

1393
01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:31.460
<v Speaker 3>like like a freaky demon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That my first thing you ever want to see</v>

1394
01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 3>before you die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid of birds,</v>

1395
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.100
<v Speaker 3>so imagine how fucking big bird like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1396
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I lose my fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

1397
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Here's the bone wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The great dinosaur rush.</v>

1398
01:01:42.051 --> 01:01:47.051
<v Speaker 3>A period of intense and ruthlessly </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive fossil hunting and discovery</v>

1399
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:49.700
<v Speaker 3>during the gilded age of American </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1400
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:55.060
<v Speaker 3>marked by the heated rivalry between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Edwin drinker cope drinker.</v>

1401
01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.433
<v Speaker 3>That's what Middle Lane Bro of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Academy of Natural Sciences of </v>

1402
01:01:58.761 --> 01:01:59.594
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whilst this guy's name authentic </v>

1403
01:02:01.931 --> 01:02:06.931
<v Speaker 3>real othniel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you say that is off Neil Othniel</v>

1404
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Charles Marsh of the peabody museum of </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural history of the year.</v>

1405
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.133
<v Speaker 3>Each of the two paleontologists use </v>
<v Speaker 3>underhanded methods to outdo each other </v>

1406
01:02:15.261 --> 01:02:17.690
<v Speaker 3>in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resulting resorted to bribery,</v>

1407
01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 3>theft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the destruction of bones.</v>

1408
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.843
<v Speaker 1>East scientist also sought to ruin his </v>
<v Speaker 1>rivals reputation and cut off its </v>

1409
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:25.584
<v Speaker 1>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use the attacks in scientific </v>

1410
01:02:27.271 --> 01:02:28.104
<v Speaker 1>publications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this doesn't seem like these are the </v>

1411
01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>people that were using fake stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like a fake shit.</v>

1412
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1413
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>If this was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably fake shit.</v>

1414
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>People are all crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys like doing that.</v>

1415
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.793
<v Speaker 1>You can tell like at first that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>real scientists and then they became </v>

1416
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>famous and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

1417
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.324
<v Speaker 1>I like being famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if I enjoy being a famous </v>

1418
01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>scientist in scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both the Chinese one.</v>

1419
01:02:51.841 --> 01:02:52.674
<v Speaker 1>What are you getting now from and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese is not known for making </v>

1420
01:02:54.931 --> 01:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>counterfeit stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't believe that article.</v>

1421
01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

1422
01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>They make whole cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made Paris.</v>

1423
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 1>If you go to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a Paris.</v>

1424
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I was in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a tour of China like two years ago</v>

1425
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 1>and there's one of the guys bugging me.</v>

1426
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.293
<v Speaker 1>He told me his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend loved France and there's </v>

1427
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:18.090
<v Speaker 1>a neighborhood in Shanghai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly like France.</v>

1428
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So he brought her to France and then she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1429
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:22.913
<v Speaker 1>not the Chinese ones better because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact replica and they do that now </v>

1430
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:29.370
<v Speaker 1>in the Arab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My knees one is better.</v>

1431
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:34.040
<v Speaker 1>She says Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they redid the.</v>

1432
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they redid a,</v>

1433
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sorbonne and the like.</v>

1434
01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:43.941
<v Speaker 1>They redid buildings from France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in the Arab Emirates and your.</v>

1435
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.773
<v Speaker 1>Everything is exactly the same as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in France except it's all like Saudis </v>

1436
01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:55.230
<v Speaker 1>and people from Kuwait was a weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1437
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Try to recreate a historical building </v>
<v Speaker 1>that still exists.</v>

1438
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Put that effort into creating something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no white people copy.</v>

1440
01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:04.944
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because they like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably complicated to to cause </v>

1441
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

1442
01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna go to go to whatever country</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be food.</v>

1443
01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to be Halau.</v>

1444
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be complicated to go the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mosque?</v>

1445
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:19.583
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just next to the mosque and we'll </v>

1446
01:04:23.161 --> 01:04:23.994
<v Speaker 1>be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is enough oil money floating </v>

1447
01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:25.614
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could probably build a whole world </v>

1448
01:04:26.491 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 1>out in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could visit New York City.</v>

1449
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York to fake Manhattan,</v>

1450
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn Bridge cab drivers or river </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking makeover.</v>

1451
01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:37.763
<v Speaker 1>They're such dicks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Building the biggest building in the </v>

1452
01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:41.880
<v Speaker 1>world in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go in,</v>

1453
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:42.743
<v Speaker 1>in the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turned the lights off and it </v>

1454
01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>becomes kind of like a ride and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts going up and then it shows,</v>

1455
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:49.554
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at the level that the biggest </v>

1456
01:04:51.031 --> 01:04:51.864
<v Speaker 1>building in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the empire state building is here </v>

1457
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.223
<v Speaker 1>at like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 meters and then this is the biggest </v>

1458
01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>building in Shanghai and then they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they want to just show,</v>

1459
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got in the elevator,</v>

1460
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're like,</v>

1461
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:07.640
<v Speaker 1>no bitch.</v>

1462
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1463
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:09.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money since they did,</v>

1464
01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>like the first time I was in Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest building was a,</v>

1465
01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they built one in Dubai and then the</v>

1466
01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>year after Shanghai beat it by like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three meters.</v>

1467
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>And then Dubai was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

1468
01:05:21.731 --> 01:05:24.750
<v Speaker 1>we're going to beat you by 500 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a,</v>

1469
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a kilometer or almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like more than half a mile high.</v>

1470
01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than half a mile high.</v>

1471
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's St and the city,</v>

1472
01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:37.663
<v Speaker 1>would you say it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look and the city in the 19 </v>

1473
01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>seventies didn't really exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

1474
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:45.274
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the national anthem could be the </v>

1475
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:49.054
<v Speaker 1>eye of the tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking insane how big it got so </v>

1476
01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:56.820
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're all so fucking wretched.</v>

1477
01:05:56.821 --> 01:05:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1478
01:05:57.941 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>what were you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1479
01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:00.660
<v Speaker 1>as you were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1480
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I'd definitely be </v>
<v Speaker 1>registered before,</v>

1481
01:06:02.801 --> 01:06:03.634
<v Speaker 1>but king's island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a theme park in Ohio and </v>

1482
01:06:05.231 --> 01:06:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Cincinnati area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the Eiffel Tower there.</v>

1483
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:10.450
<v Speaker 1>There's also one somewhere else at </v>
<v Speaker 1>another park.</v>

1484
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say exact replica.</v>

1485
01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:13.324
<v Speaker 1>One third replica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eiffel Tower that's been there since </v>

1486
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:17.284
<v Speaker 1>like the seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all those rich Arab countries will </v>

1487
01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:19.754
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of one third seven times vague </v>

1488
01:06:22.651 --> 01:06:24.460
<v Speaker 1>made of diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see,</v>

1489
01:06:24.461 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 1>you can see this Eiffel Tower from the </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1506
01:07:11.231 --> 01:07:12.064
<v Speaker 1>we got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got lucky that someone said Google </v>

1507
01:07:15.551 --> 01:07:17.300
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Malibu last six,</v>

1508
01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:19.070
<v Speaker 3>600 houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1509
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone said that the other day,</v>

1510
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.653
<v Speaker 3>but everyone's hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to know if they're right or </v>

1511
01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many houses got lost at Malibu?</v>

1512
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Because I know a lot of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost houses.</v>

1513
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:37.920
<v Speaker 3>I know at least eight people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost houses.</v>

1514
01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And how was the evacuation [inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it like area like you,</v>

1515
01:07:42.471 --> 01:07:45.660
<v Speaker 1>you can just grab like one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One or two things.</v>

1516
01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Grab</v>

1517
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.230
<v Speaker 3>my laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>1,500</v>

1518
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:50.150
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>1,500</v>

1519
01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:56.260
<v Speaker 3>totally destroyed Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the number probably keeps going up,</v>

1520
01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:59.570
<v Speaker 3>but those are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are homes,</v>

1521
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:01.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of those 1500,</v>

1522
01:08:01.851 --> 01:08:04.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many of them are homes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them are.</v>

1523
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people lost their homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1524
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:07.833
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy thing that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wind gets behind that fire and </v>

1525
01:08:10.611 --> 01:08:14.270
<v Speaker 3>everything's dry and it just goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight to the water and there's almost</v>

1526
01:08:14.271 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>nothing they could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lost so</v>

1527
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 4>many houses on point dume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you would think,</v>

1528
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:20.420
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck is a fire going to get to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1529
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.553
<v Speaker 4>Like if you ever see what point dume is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like this beautiful area of very </v>

1530
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:28.940
<v Speaker 4>wealthy people live in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this cliff overlooking the ocean.</v>

1531
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:29.774
<v Speaker 4>I mean spectacular and like you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>never think that a wildfire we get </v>

1532
01:08:33.771 --> 01:08:36.180
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was raining fire man.</v>

1533
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.220
<v Speaker 4>That's point dume out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1534
01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.213
<v Speaker 4>so many of those houses got cooked man </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's videos that people made of </v>

1535
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.233
<v Speaker 4>them leaving their horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like fire raining from the sky </v>

1536
01:08:48.021 --> 01:08:52.490
<v Speaker 4>everywhere you look houses on fire and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a super exclusive,</v>

1537
01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 4>really rich area and no one could </v>
<v Speaker 4>protect it.</v>

1538
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.220
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing they could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The firefighters did their best.</v>

1539
01:08:58.221 --> 01:08:59.720
<v Speaker 4>They saved as many structures as they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

1540
01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:00.554
<v Speaker 4>but it was fucking raging man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a rocks throw from my house when </v>

1541
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:04.820
<v Speaker 4>we left.</v>

1542
01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.070
<v Speaker 4>We left at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning,</v>

1543
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Thursday night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The traffic,</v>

1544
01:09:07.491 --> 01:09:08.324
<v Speaker 4>because the traffic is always crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you evacuate and the traffic's </v>

1545
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.760
<v Speaker 4>like that must,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must freak out.</v>

1546
01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Scary is what happened to the people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise,</v>

1547
01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:17.684
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were evacuating and something like </v>

1548
01:09:19.611 --> 01:09:20.444
<v Speaker 4>60 plus people died in their cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fire just overcame cars and there's </v>

1549
01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:25.933
<v Speaker 4>nowhere to go and they're stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 4>gridlock and the fires literally coming </v>

1550
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 4>at them ready for this 80 football </v>
<v Speaker 4>fields a minute.</v>

1551
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.970
<v Speaker 4>That's how fast it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Traveling at some.</v>

1552
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:37.940
<v Speaker 4>At one point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what happens over the summer.</v>

1553
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:41.060
<v Speaker 4>There's a town right outside of Athens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greece.</v>

1554
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:41.953
<v Speaker 4>Yet wildfires took over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The town was wiped off in a couple of </v>

1555
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:46.160
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People died in their cars and homes.</v>

1556
01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just traveling.</v>

1557
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.433
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens in paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot more than a thousand </v>

1558
01:09:52.101 --> 01:09:54.250
<v Speaker 4>people are missing paradise.</v>

1559
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.513
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know and the problem is </v>

1560
01:09:56.781 --> 01:10:00.530
<v Speaker 4>they'll never know like whatever was </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is incinerated.</v>

1561
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:01.483
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they won't be able to get DNA that </v>

1562
01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.033
<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's the craziest fire they've </v>

1563
01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 4>ever experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the scariest,</v>

1564
01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 4>most destructive California wildfire </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>

1565
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.143
<v Speaker 4>and that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one down here was nothing compared </v>

1566
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:19.550
<v Speaker 4>to that one in northern California and </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison to the size and scope.</v>

1567
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean that thing is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's fire,</v>

1568
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 4>there's a photo of this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Firefighter has sort of iconic photo.</v>

1569
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.043
<v Speaker 4>He standing on a rock and behind him the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole mountain is on fire and it's just </v>

1570
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:33.284
<v Speaker 4>like holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people in my friend Brendan Child </v>

1571
01:10:37.671 --> 01:10:41.090
<v Speaker 4>was doing a show in Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Sacramento,</v>

1572
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:45.260
<v Speaker 4>out his hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole street was filled with smoke.</v>

1573
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't see shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1574
01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke is everywhere.</v>

1575
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.513
<v Speaker 4>And he sent me a photo of the television</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was showing the air quality was </v>

1576
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:55.280
<v Speaker 4>very poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Air Quality everywhere,</v>

1577
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.860
<v Speaker 4>all through that area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just all in red.</v>

1578
01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:58.933
<v Speaker 4>So it was all like people were walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>around with masks on and it would </v>

1579
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 4>literally be like you're walking through</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fire.</v>

1580
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.290
<v Speaker 4>There's smoke everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nuts,</v>

1581
01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is in Sacramento?</v>

1582
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

1583
01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 4>Is it contained now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of contained?</v>

1584
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:14.603
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

1585
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.030
<v Speaker 3>the one here is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know about the one that's up</v>

1586
01:11:18.031 --> 01:11:18.864
<v Speaker 3>north,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real issue is that could happen </v>

1587
01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:22.350
<v Speaker 3>again like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they all,</v>

1588
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.440
<v Speaker 3>they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sparked up so quick and more hit.</v>

1589
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.513
<v Speaker 3>What's the plan that they could do to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure this doesn't happen or is </v>

1590
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:31.670
<v Speaker 3>there something they can do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1591
01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that Jamie.</v>

1592
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 3>The air quality in San Francisco is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

1593
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Being there for a day is like slow </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking.</v>

1594
01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:39.920
<v Speaker 3>10 cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1595
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

1596
01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Fire smoke where people like Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>mass,</v>

1597
01:11:44.911 --> 01:11:46.950
<v Speaker 3>I guess people are wearing masks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1598
01:11:46.951 --> 01:11:47.784
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1599
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:48.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bert Kreischer was walking down the </v>

1600
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:52.030
<v Speaker 3>street with a mask on and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I texted him,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

1604
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:58.183
<v Speaker 3>You can't believe how smokey the era's </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's just all through San </v>

1605
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.273
<v Speaker 3>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's coughing and wearing masks </v>

1606
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 3>in Sacramento looked even worse than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1607
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:08.520
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of shit you never think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing.</v>

1609
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.033
<v Speaker 3>It could just hit you look at that data </v>
<v Speaker 3>at San Francisco right now and if you </v>

1610
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 3>don't know San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't know how shocking this is.</v>

1611
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't see the hills.</v>

1612
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.633
<v Speaker 3>Can't see all those houses in the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all just smoke from the fire for </v>

1613
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:24.833
<v Speaker 3>that shit to blow out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like San Francisco super like </v>

1614
01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:29.450
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1615
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that fire contained?</v>

1616
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.653
<v Speaker 3>A article with a couple of couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>days ago said it was at 57 percent </v>

1617
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:39.870
<v Speaker 3>contained and I was just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>google more.</v>

1618
01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.590
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only 57 percent contained at the air's a</v>

1619
01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:46.650
<v Speaker 3>little clear today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're at moderate to severe whatever.</v>

1620
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is man,</v>

1621
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:51.900
<v Speaker 3>but these fires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all it needs is one gust of wind,</v>

1622
01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:52.734
<v Speaker 3>one new storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one new Santa Ana winds pick up some </v>

1623
01:12:56.641 --> 01:13:00.830
<v Speaker 3>embers and then whoosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole state is just dries.</v>

1624
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:01.703
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man to 80 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 80 percent contained going gonna </v>

1625
01:13:04.401 --> 01:13:08.580
<v Speaker 3>rain tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully that does.</v>

1626
01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:09.870
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to rain tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1627
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:14.470
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking like everyone who moved out</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1628
01:13:14.471 --> 01:13:16.770
<v Speaker 3>like from out East Lake when you moved </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1629
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.050
<v Speaker 3>you've been here for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years.</v>

1630
01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 3>You must have been scared the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years of earthquakes,</v>

1631
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:24.450
<v Speaker 3>but you never thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1632
01:13:24.451 --> 01:13:26.580
<v Speaker 3>I might have to leave my house because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fire.</v>

1633
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:27.563
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been evacuated three times because </v>

1634
01:13:28.631 --> 01:13:29.220
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the fire.</v>

1635
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

1636
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>

1637
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 3>how many major earthquakes since you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been here?</v>

1638
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:36.000
<v Speaker 3>None.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One minor one.</v>

1639
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.480
<v Speaker 3>It was enough to let you know like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when it happens and the,</v>

1640
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:43.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house seemed like a,</v>

1641
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.023
<v Speaker 3>you ever get a refrigerator and you take</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that cardboard box and you stand </v>

1642
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:52.350
<v Speaker 3>inside of it as a kid and you'd push it </v>
<v Speaker 3>around back and forth.</v>

1643
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:55.110
<v Speaker 3>That's literally what the walls of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment looked like.</v>

1644
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just started moving like this.</v>

1645
01:13:56.911 --> 01:13:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Like it was very different than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

1646
01:13:58.111 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I thought it would be like shake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rumble.</v>

1647
01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Everything would shake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1648
01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:03.480
<v Speaker 3>it was just like this dome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dome,</v>

1649
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.621
<v Speaker 3>doom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doom,</v>

1650
01:14:04.621 --> 01:14:05.454
<v Speaker 3>doom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doom.</v>

1651
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:09.870
<v Speaker 3>But it was so nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a nothing earthquake.</v>

1652
01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.610
<v Speaker 3>It was like a five point or some shit or</v>
<v Speaker 3>five point seven,</v>

1653
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 3>but it was enough to where when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>walls moved you realize like,</v>

1654
01:14:16.391 --> 01:14:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a big one happens,</v>

1655
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 3>this shit just falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is not this thing.</v>

1656
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Ain't gonna make it houses just fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart.</v>

1657
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:27.190
<v Speaker 3>The walls would just break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will floor.</v>

1658
01:14:27.191 --> 01:14:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Were you on a second floor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That must.</v>

1659
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:33.070
<v Speaker 3>That must like if you're on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>floor,</v>

1660
01:14:33.071 --> 01:14:33.731
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1661
01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:34.564
<v Speaker 3>I can run out the shit we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she lands in your head as you're </v>

1662
01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:38.974
<v Speaker 3>trying to get at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know how fucking stupid humans </v>

1663
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:41.050
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1664
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:41.883
<v Speaker 3>We go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1665
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

1666
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I can run out the second floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the opposite.</v>

1667
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking if I'm going to top </v>
<v Speaker 3>floor,</v>

1668
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:48.214
<v Speaker 3>I'll serve my way to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll land on all these fuckers below me </v>

1669
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:53.650
<v Speaker 3>a dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to make it.</v>

1670
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was enough to just let me just </v>

1671
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 3>realize like you don't even know what an</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake is.</v>

1672
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:01.790
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my idea of an earthquake was like a</v>

1673
01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:02.830
<v Speaker 3>cartoon movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1674
01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.150
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in an earthquake,</v>

1675
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 3>but a real earthquake is just the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting.</v>

1676
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:11.620
<v Speaker 3>It actually moves and apparently the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were here during the big one</v>

1677
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:13.330
<v Speaker 3>of 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at 93,</v>

1678
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.650
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The earth moved almost like water,</v>

1679
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:21.850
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see the earth just bucking and</v>

1680
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.684
<v Speaker 3>moving and you could see like chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it like lifting up and then settling </v>

1681
01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.130
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1682
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:29.020
<v Speaker 3>The people that were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to them,</v>

1683
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:29.913
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not ptsd like soldiers ptsd </v>

1684
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:37.510
<v Speaker 3>or like rape survivors or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

1685
01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:41.320
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely some ptsd to comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from natural disasters.</v>

1686
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:42.623
<v Speaker 3>Is this trauma to seeing how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>meager you are in comparison to the </v>

1687
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 3>earth itself as the earth is moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fuck,</v>

1688
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I got to get out of here and then a mass</v>
<v Speaker 3>exodus,</v>

1689
01:15:53.441 --> 01:15:54.274
<v Speaker 3>like bunch of people move to Colorado </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people moved all over the fucking </v>

1690
01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.480
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carla was nice though.</v>

1691
01:15:58.481 --> 01:15:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado.</v>

1692
01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:00.420
<v Speaker 3>It's gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1693
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised at the now with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildfires,</v>

1694
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:07.110
<v Speaker 3>are people leaving California or no?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1695

<v Speaker 3>I'm sure some are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1696
01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:13.720
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the weather's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so nice because it never rains.</v>

1697
01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.990
<v Speaker 3>It never does anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>mother nature.</v>

01:17:11.991 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 3>they've been convinced this whole time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the government is trying to make it</v>

1719
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 3>rain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if ever there was a time to utilize</v>

1720
01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:19.550
<v Speaker 3>chem trails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would it be now,</v>

1721

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>

1722
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.633
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very disconcerting because you </v>

1723
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 3>realize how fragile the whole system is </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these,</v>

1724
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that worked so hard to save</v>

1725

<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can only save so much,</v>

1726
01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:33.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can only save so many </v>

1727
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:35.300
<v Speaker 3>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only save so many people.</v>

1728
01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:37.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a real wake up call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1729
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Shit could get ugly and this off topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but off topic of the fires,</v>

1730
01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 3>but because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1731
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:49.520
<v Speaker 3>yesterday we're talking about red band </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the store and I didn't know that when</v>

1732
01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.473
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were banned the whole crew for like </v>

1733

<v Speaker 3>seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a long time.</v>

1734
01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.073
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I will tell you is </v>

1735
01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:01.003
<v Speaker 3>because you took a bullet for the seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>years is kind of like you took a bullet </v>

1736
01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:04.940
<v Speaker 3>for everyone else was going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with that shit,</v>

1737
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:08.090
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't know at the time the ads </v>
<v Speaker 3>or to looking back.</v>

1738
01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck them.</v>

1739
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say I was taking a bullet,</v>

1740
01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:14.720
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1741
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The subjects beaten down too much,</v>

1742
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going through it now.</v>

1743
01:18:18.471 --> 01:18:19.304
<v Speaker 3>That's why on our end now we have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are making money by stealing </v>

1744
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>

01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:25.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1746
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:29.060
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a French guy was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not with a French comedy.</v>

1747
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:29.751
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:31.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>

1749
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:32.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>

1750
01:18:32.891 --> 01:18:33.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1751
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I own a club in Montreal and I banded </v>

1752
01:18:36.691 --> 01:18:38.060
<v Speaker 1>guide this summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1753
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:41.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had stolen a bunch of material.</v>

1754
01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.133
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing called the GML comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>club that it's basically like how even </v>

1755
01:18:46.611 --> 01:18:49.220
<v Speaker 1>when you say comedy club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were saying something in French</v>

1756
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.970
<v Speaker 1>first you have to see comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:18:51.971 --> 01:18:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1758
01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1759
01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:57.380
<v Speaker 1>because that's the way you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

1760
01:18:57.381 --> 01:18:58.214
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1761
01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.153
<v Speaker 1>he had stolen a pretty much everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>from def comedy jam and they did it </v>

1762
01:19:03.621 --> 01:19:06.440
<v Speaker 1>there in France and just didn't with </v>
<v Speaker 1>French language.</v>

1763
01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Even with black dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to steal def comedy</v>

1764
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:11.600
<v Speaker 1>jam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to French black dudes.</v>

1765
01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Like there are black dudes in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was all these Arab guys.</v>

1766
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:19.010
<v Speaker 1>So whenever you see like for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years in France,</v>

1767
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever you sign an Arab comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all like,</v>

1768
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.710
<v Speaker 1>like Dave Chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was,</v>

1769
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something very fucked up.</v>

1770
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.593
<v Speaker 1>And this summer there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was in my club and then I found </v>

1771
01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:32.300
<v Speaker 1>out and I fucking lost my mind and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1772
01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted a,</v>

1773
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:35.210
<v Speaker 1>my door guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1774
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.480
<v Speaker 1>get him the fuck out everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's with you throw them out.</v>

1775
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them in the club strangers </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1776
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:42.893
<v Speaker 3>With comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to create things and some </v>

1778
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.113
<v Speaker 3>basically a criminal can sneak in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of an artist's colony and just </v>

1779
01:19:50.731 --> 01:19:55.230
<v Speaker 3>start profiting off of your work and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimidating you and making you work for</v>

1780
01:19:55.231 --> 01:19:56.070
<v Speaker 3>them essentially.</v>

1781
01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:57.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that sucks and people </v>

1782
01:19:58.131 --> 01:19:58.964
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you went through with </v>

1783
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.720
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you called out Carlos,</v>

1784
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>no one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one cares like they do now.</v>

1785
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>They do see the</v>

1786
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.800
<v Speaker 2>thing is they don't know your situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>up there is different,</v>

1787
01:20:10.801 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 2>but the only reason they do now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks good.</v>

1788
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.840
<v Speaker 2>But if didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1789
01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:22.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like banning Carlos now.</v>

1790
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:23.094
<v Speaker 2>Like Carlos Mencia can't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it makes them look like we respect </v>

1791
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 2>comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't really respect Comedians,</v>

1792
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1793
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:32.004
<v Speaker 2>who's they in this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sound like you're a conspiracy </v>

1794
01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:35.610
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't respect us,</v>

1795
01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:36.500
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1796
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:37.343
<v Speaker 2>but like whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I've called out a joke thieves </v>

1797
01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to festivals or networks,</v>

1798
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.821
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1799
01:20:44.821 --> 01:20:45.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1800
01:20:45.361 --> 01:20:46.260
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>

1801
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Do something about this and then as soon</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it blows over,</v>

1802
01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:50.970
<v Speaker 2>they don't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1803
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about festivals,</v>

1804
01:20:52.261 --> 01:20:52.981
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1805
01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:53.814
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1806
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 2>clubs would be much more likely to band </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1807
01:20:56.521 --> 01:21:00.450
<v Speaker 2>especially if someone who they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>stealing from also works there.</v>

1808
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.070
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more likely to happen.</v>

1809
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Especially if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1810
01:21:04.251 --> 01:21:05.084
<v Speaker 2>when in best case scenario the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's getting stolen from is already </v>

1811
01:21:08.401 --> 01:21:10.710
<v Speaker 2>established and successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they could say something about it.</v>

1812
01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:11.753
<v Speaker 2>The worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's established steals from </v>

1813
01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:16.320
<v Speaker 2>open microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which fucking does happen.</v>

1814
01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:18.420
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1815
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:21.660
<v Speaker 2>if there's anything that you'd get </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to quit comedy,</v>

1816
01:21:21.661 --> 01:21:22.950
<v Speaker 2>that might be one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1817
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be one that might be,</v>

1818
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:25.703
<v Speaker 2>especially in the beginning having only </v>
<v Speaker 2>good jokes stolen by a person who does </v>

1819
01:21:29.911 --> 01:21:30.744
<v Speaker 2>it on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to watch it on comedy </v>

1820
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:34.170
<v Speaker 2>central a couple days later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1821
01:21:34.171 --> 01:21:35.004
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you remember that that guy had been </v>

1822
01:21:36.931 --> 01:21:41.540
<v Speaker 2>in the back of the room a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago and watched your act and yet.</v>

1823
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1824
01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even believe it.</v>

1825
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a comic and France named a Gad </v>
<v Speaker 2>Elma lay.</v>

1826
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Who is he?</v>

1827
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Speaker 2>He's in New York now and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1828
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.070
<v Speaker 2>he works a lot in English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a,</v>

1829
01:21:52.071 --> 01:21:52.904
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1830
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.053
<v Speaker 2>he has these rumors and I'm going to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly because I don't want to get </v>

1831
01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:58.160
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get sued.</v>

1832
01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.480
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1833
01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:00.170
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1834
01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I know that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's taken a couple.</v>

1835
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.880
<v Speaker 2>At first he took a couple bits from </v>
<v Speaker 2>American comics,</v>

1836
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:06.893
<v Speaker 2>then he got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he started stealing from a French </v>

1837
01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Canadian comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the last thing I heard he did was he</v>

1838
01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:16.450
<v Speaker 2>had this contest for open Mike </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and he was like,</v>

1839
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 2>my next comedy tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1840
01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:22.050
<v Speaker 2>send me your three best minutes on tape </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the best comic.</v>

1841
01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:22.933
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to book a top and for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he started stealing from those </v>

1842
01:22:26.701 --> 01:22:28.820
<v Speaker 2>open micros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

1843
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.590
<v Speaker 2>that's such a garbage move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wacky.</v>

1844
01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1845
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't tell them you're a good person.</v>

1846
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

1847
01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:38.400
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure it's true,</v>

1848
01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:43.020
<v Speaker 2>but I saw him do a show once in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in France and he was a like,</v>

1849
01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:44.310
<v Speaker 2>he's a rich dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1850
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:48.090
<v Speaker 2>he's got his own private plane and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1851
01:22:48.091 --> 01:22:49.980
<v Speaker 2>he's got his own private plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1852
01:22:49.981 --> 01:22:50.814
<v Speaker 2>he was married to the Princess of Monaco</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's got a lot of money and he was </v>

1853
01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:56.630
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing a bit,</v>

1854
01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:57.483
<v Speaker 2>a bit like he's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing a bit about how he can't </v>

1855
01:23:00.781 --> 01:23:04.740
<v Speaker 2>afford an air conditioner in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment and I was like,</v>

1856
01:23:04.741 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have</v>

1857
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.903
<v Speaker 1>a kid with the princess of Monaco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can afford like multiple air </v>

1858
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 1>conditioners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1859
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good though.</v>

1860
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.620
<v Speaker 1>The people care like there are people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

1861
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Some people care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

1862
01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:22.564
<v Speaker 1>The problem is saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get sounds like paper like </v>

1863
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.080
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All white people are racist.</v>

1864
01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1865
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I know the whole thing in France a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

1866
01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:35.043
<v Speaker 1>The new generation of French French </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics are really angry about this and </v>

1867
01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:39.214
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this youtube as a channel that </v>

1868
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:46.561
<v Speaker 1>you talked about here when you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Tom Papa though is on a,</v>

1869
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:51.930
<v Speaker 1>it's called copy comic and they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>like bits that they'll take a bit from a</v>

1870
01:23:52.271 --> 01:23:57.271
<v Speaker 1>comic from here and then they just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that what's going on.</v>

1871
01:23:57.701 --> 01:23:58.990
<v Speaker 1>But someone friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1872
01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Just to educate them.</v>

1873
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1874
01:24:02.551 --> 01:24:03.384
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to quite a few comics from </v>

1875
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.960
<v Speaker 3>countries that are bilingual that say </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a.</v>

1876
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Montreal was very bilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1877
01:24:12.271 --> 01:24:14.250
<v Speaker 3>almost everybody speaks French,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1878
01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1879
01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost everybody speaks English.</v>

1880
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:18.763
<v Speaker 3>It's like probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>bilingual places and bought definitely </v>

1881
01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:21.714
<v Speaker 3>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not a place like that in </v>

1882
01:24:22.591 --> 01:24:23.424
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no place like that in North </v>

1883
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:25.583
<v Speaker 3>America now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even thinking North American terms of </v>

1884
01:24:27.361 --> 01:24:28.194
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's no place that's kind of </v>

1885
01:24:29.281 --> 01:24:32.680
<v Speaker 3>universally speaks Spanish and English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1886
01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:35.130
<v Speaker 3>it's like some people speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people speak Spanish,</v>

1887
01:24:35.131 --> 01:24:36.390
<v Speaker 3>but very few people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1888
01:24:36.391 --> 01:24:37.224
<v Speaker 3>you can't this the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never like Montreal is like </v>

1889
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.560
<v Speaker 3>probably probably 80 percent speak both </v>
<v Speaker 3>languages,</v>

1890
01:24:43.561 --> 01:24:44.394
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:46.950
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful city,</v>

1892
01:24:46.951 --> 01:24:47.820
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing,</v>

1893
01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:50.240
<v Speaker 3>but you're fucking freedom of speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>laws,</v>

1894
01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:51.660
<v Speaker 3>dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1895
01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Fucking didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1896
01:24:53.011 --> 01:24:53.844
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to create shitty art when </v>

1897
01:24:55.021 --> 01:24:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you have that.</v>

1898
01:24:55.770 --> 01:24:56.603
<v Speaker 3>You know the way that you punish someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you think is doing something awful </v>

1899
01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:03.264
<v Speaker 3>with their speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as they're not calling for </v>

1900
01:25:04.201 --> 01:25:05.730
<v Speaker 3>someone to be murdered or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1901
01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:08.220
<v Speaker 3>The way you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you don't go to their show,</v>

1902
01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.470
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to support you,</v>

1903
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.770
<v Speaker 3>and then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't find them.</v>

1904
01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:14.873
<v Speaker 3>If enough people don't like you and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a message of hate and won't </v>

1905
01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:17.850
<v Speaker 3>come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will make money.</v>

1906
01:25:17.851 --> 01:25:18.361
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>

1907
01:25:18.361 --> 01:25:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Stop doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you kill that.</v>

1908
01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't think you should have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a message of hate,</v>

1909
01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.413
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that certain people </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be able to side what's hateful </v>

1910
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.880
<v Speaker 3>because they keep pushing that boundary </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way.</v>

1911
01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:33.390
<v Speaker 3>They push all the other boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll push the boundaries of what,</v>

1912
01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:36.270
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is?</v>

1913
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:41.300
<v Speaker 3>What's the definition of prejudice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the definition of entitlement?</v>

1914
01:25:42.481 --> 01:25:43.314
<v Speaker 3>What's the definition?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are you always coming from a place </v>

1915
01:25:45.211 --> 01:25:47.220
<v Speaker 3>of privilege?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are you always entitled?</v>

1916
01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Are you always racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you.</v>

1917
01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.273
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1918
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.113
<v Speaker 3>they have those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to do this with corporations </v>

1919
01:25:53.250 --> 01:25:55.200
<v Speaker 3>and there's no evidence that it works at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1920
01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.333
<v Speaker 3>They do unconscious bias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like counseling or they sit down with </v>

1921
01:26:00.841 --> 01:26:03.560
<v Speaker 3>their employees and they talked to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>about perhaps</v>

1922
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.520
<v Speaker 4>this unconscious racism they might have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so everybody's like,</v>

1923
01:26:07.521 --> 01:26:08.450
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I racist?</v>

1924
01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.420
<v Speaker 4>And they'd go next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So shitty.</v>

1925
01:26:10.421 --> 01:26:13.850
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's crazy about it is that all it</v>

1926
01:26:13.851 --> 01:26:18.230
<v Speaker 4>is is like they needed a response to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceived situation,</v>

1927
01:26:18.231 --> 01:26:20.690
<v Speaker 4>which I'm sure is the situation in many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many places don't.</v>

1928
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to minimalize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they needed a response.</v>

1929
01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:25.880
<v Speaker 4>So the response to something totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>unscientific,</v>

1930
01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.893
<v Speaker 4>not support,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least they can say they're doing </v>

1931
01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:29.610
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a,</v>

1932
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism bias training and they have these</v>

1933
01:26:32.571 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 4>people sit down and they talked to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>about like,</v>

1934
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:37.520
<v Speaker 4>this is what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1935
01:26:37.521 --> 01:26:40.990
<v Speaker 4>if a person of color walks in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>

1936
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Chad and I want to be racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

1937
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it works man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think it's,</v>

1938
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.233
<v Speaker 4>it's not the way that racism sucks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way to stop racism is be a good </v>

1939
01:26:52.011 --> 01:26:52.550
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1940
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:55.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the more good people we have,</v>

1941
01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:56.093
<v Speaker 4>they will inspire more good people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will all realize that racism is </v>

1942
01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:03.050
<v Speaker 4>fucking stupid and we should treat </v>
<v Speaker 4>people as individuals always.</v>

1943
01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's by gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my sexual preferences,</v>

1944
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:09.560
<v Speaker 4>origin of your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ancestors.</v>

1945
01:27:09.561 --> 01:27:10.394
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I care in terms of like sexual </v>

1946
01:27:13.581 --> 01:27:14.640
<v Speaker 4>preference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1947
01:27:14.641 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Karen terms of whether I think you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive or not.</v>

1948
01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.160
<v Speaker 4>I care in terms of like whether I </v>
<v Speaker 4>decide,</v>

1949
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:20.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the to,</v>

1950
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.943
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's some people that want to </v>

1951
01:27:24.171 --> 01:27:25.004
<v Speaker 4>hang out with really loud people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some people that want to hang </v>

1952
01:27:27.681 --> 01:27:28.514
<v Speaker 4>out with people that are like more </v>
<v Speaker 4>demure or some people that are more </v>

1953
01:27:30.351 --> 01:27:32.330
<v Speaker 4>introspect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody likes different Shit.</v>

1954
01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.253
<v Speaker 4>You're allowed to like different shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not allowed to discriminate </v>

1955
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:37.664
<v Speaker 4>against someone and keep them from </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupation or keep them from place to </v>

1956
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:41.384
<v Speaker 4>live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if we all thought that way and just </v>

1957
01:27:43.011 --> 01:27:43.844
<v Speaker 4>treated people on the merits of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>own individual personality and </v>

1958
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:48.170
<v Speaker 4>character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd have a way better world.</v>

1959
01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:49.003
<v Speaker 4>I think we could all agree to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you get into these groups of </v>

1960
01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:53.420
<v Speaker 4>all white people or all Asians are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1961
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:56.150
<v Speaker 4>fucking come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's too small.</v>

1962
01:27:56.210 --> 01:27:57.043
<v Speaker 4>That's such a gross generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too small of a common denominators </v>

1963
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:02.630
<v Speaker 4>to weird the what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you are like,</v>

1964
01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:05.570
<v Speaker 4>how much of what you are is where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you're from and shit,</v>

1965
01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:07.850
<v Speaker 4>you can't control how much melanin you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have in your skin.</v>

1966
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:08.953
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you are is all the things you've </v>

1967
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.980
<v Speaker 4>experienced and all the life you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived and all the lessons you've learned</v>

1968
01:28:15.981 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 4>where you are at this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

1969
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:18.794
<v Speaker 4>And if I like you at 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might not apply to you when you were </v>

1970
01:28:20.481 --> 01:28:22.130
<v Speaker 4>18.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might've been fucking annoying.</v>

1971
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.050
<v Speaker 4>But I meet you when you're 30.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like hey,</v>

1972
01:28:24.051 --> 01:28:25.100
<v Speaker 4>you're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1973
01:28:25.101 --> 01:28:27.770
<v Speaker 4>and everything's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that should be okay too.</v>

1974
01:28:27.810 --> 01:28:32.810
<v Speaker 4>It's not like we have to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 4>between people just being not interested</v>

1975
01:28:33.771 --> 01:28:34.604
<v Speaker 4>in talking to any one individual and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what is wrong with with gross </v>

1976
01:28:40.461 --> 01:28:45.461
<v Speaker 4>generalizations and then tribal ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sticking to only people of European</v>

1977
01:28:45.771 --> 01:28:49.160
<v Speaker 4>ethnicity and these are the good folks </v>
<v Speaker 4>of European descent,</v>

1978
01:28:49.161 --> 01:28:49.994
<v Speaker 4>like you're fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Civilization's been down that road </v>

1979
01:28:53.421 --> 01:28:54.254
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that shit again and you </v>

1980
01:28:55.731 --> 01:28:59.600
<v Speaker 4>can't do it for Asians either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it for black people.</v>

1981
01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:00.523
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say everybody's great in this </v>

1982
01:29:02.761 --> 01:29:05.460
<v Speaker 4>group because it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so simplistic.</v>

1983
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:07.170
<v Speaker 4>It's not just simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's dangerous,</v>

1984
01:29:07.171 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 4>and it also makes people scared to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything about like,</v>

1985
01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate the thing.</v>

1986
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:12.024
<v Speaker 4>I left blank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing I like about not censoring </v>

1987
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:18.900
<v Speaker 4>hate speech is if you let hateful people</v>
<v Speaker 4>say hateful things,</v>

1988
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.090
<v Speaker 4>you know where the dangerous people are.</v>

1989
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:24.840
<v Speaker 4>So if you're censoring like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>use this where you can't say this.</v>

1990
01:29:24.841 --> 01:29:25.674
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know who the fucking Weirdos </v>

1991
01:29:27.631 --> 01:29:28.464
<v Speaker 4>are at that hate black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hate gay people that hate the </v>

1992
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.900
<v Speaker 4>translator because everyone's acting </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same.</v>

1993
01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:37.560
<v Speaker 4>Like everything's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when they're with their friends</v>

1994
01:29:37.570 --> 01:29:40.140
<v Speaker 4>or whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that that think like them,</v>

1995
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.190
<v Speaker 4>then they're buting all their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hate and shit and garbage.</v>

1996
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:45.263
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever people can express themselves </v>

1997
01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:47.124
<v Speaker 4>freely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be some sort of </v>

1998
01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 4>suppression and if there's some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppression,</v>

1999
01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:53.400
<v Speaker 4>there is a resentment of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppression.</v>

2000
01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:56.330
<v Speaker 4>And then there's just like this anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this tension.</v>

2001
01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:59.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when he would.</v>

2002
01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:00.263
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially what we're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about people in business </v>

2003
01:30:03.691 --> 01:30:05.730
<v Speaker 4>meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they're forced to communicate,</v>

2004
01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:06.983
<v Speaker 4>how this forced to address how they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>forced to communicate that go into this </v>

2005
01:30:09.451 --> 01:30:11.010
<v Speaker 4>very professional building.</v>

2006
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:14.310
<v Speaker 4>All the women are dressed professional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the men to dress professional.</v>

2007
01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.293
<v Speaker 4>They all get together in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>conference tables and everyone is </v>

2008
01:30:17.281 --> 01:30:18.170
<v Speaker 4>agreeing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even those,</v>

2009
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:22.530
<v Speaker 4>these are sexual beings who may be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine,</v>

2010
01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:23.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

2011
01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.920
<v Speaker 4>they've been fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2012
01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:28.690
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>

2013
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:33.170
<v Speaker 4>they've been to music festivals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've maybe been to burning man and,</v>

2014
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:34.223
<v Speaker 4>but they're contained that contained in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this room and they're talking about </v>

2015
01:30:37.621 --> 01:30:41.550
<v Speaker 4>statistics and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>probabilities and then someone brings up</v>

2016
01:30:41.551 --> 01:30:42.301
<v Speaker 4>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2017
01:30:42.301 --> 01:30:43.134
<v Speaker 4>Diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all very important and everyone is </v>

2018
01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:49.470
<v Speaker 4>behaving and this super weird world </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can't,</v>

2019
01:30:49.471 --> 01:30:52.410
<v Speaker 4>you can't move outside the box even </v>
<v Speaker 4>remotely if you,</v>

2020
01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:54.180
<v Speaker 4>if you move outside the box even a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little,</v>

2021
01:30:54.181 --> 01:30:55.014
<v Speaker 4>if you say you know about the guy from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Netflix that got fired because he used </v>

2022
01:30:57.661 --> 01:31:00.270
<v Speaker 4>the n word in a descriptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

2023
01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.220
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about Tom Segura special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're Thompson was talking about changes</v>

2024
01:31:05.221 --> 01:31:06.054
<v Speaker 4>in language and just talked about some </v>
<v Speaker 4>words can't say anymore and he says </v>

2025
01:31:08.761 --> 01:31:10.290
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't say retarded.</v>

2026
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:11.183
<v Speaker 4>He says this just because he said that </v>
<v Speaker 4>just because he said that people were </v>

2027
01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:18.480
<v Speaker 4>getting angry at him and protesting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>groups.</v>

2028
01:31:18.481 --> 01:31:21.120
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to boycott Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember?</v>

2029
01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this guy,</v>

2030
01:31:23.551 --> 01:31:24.384
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was one of the big wigs at </v>

2031
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:28.703
<v Speaker 4>Netflix and he said he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like saying the word nigger to an </v>

2032
01:31:33.151 --> 01:31:37.290
<v Speaker 4>African American person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's like to say retarded to</v>

2033
01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.540
<v Speaker 4>a family where someone has someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>downstairs.</v>

2034
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:40.374
<v Speaker 4>So he was defending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about how offensive that </v>

2035
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.910
<v Speaker 4>word is to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

2036
01:31:44.911 --> 01:31:46.200
<v Speaker 4>this is the issue that we're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

2037
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.600
<v Speaker 4>So you just talked about it at a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter of fact way.</v>

2038
01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:54.980
<v Speaker 4>They report him for saying the word and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets fired and apparently he did this</v>

2039
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.533
<v Speaker 4>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I've read in the same </v>

2040
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 4>context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2041
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 4>The same</v>

2042
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.440
<v Speaker 3>exact context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's repeating this thought.</v>

2043
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.333
<v Speaker 3>It's basically having a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing an intellectual exercise </v>

2044
01:32:06.491 --> 01:32:08.260
<v Speaker 3>like is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it the same to you?</v>

2045
01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.450
<v Speaker 3>And he's saying it around African </v>
<v Speaker 3>American people,</v>

2046
01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 3>but in saying it around African American</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2047
01:32:13.301 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 3>just the fact that he said the word </v>
<v Speaker 3>uttered it like Abracadabra.</v>

2048
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.293
<v Speaker 3>Just saying it was enough for him to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose his very high profile job at </v>

2049
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Netflix was apparently well liked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it really.</v>

2050
01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you think we're becoming like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because our lives are too easy?</v>

2051
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:34.950
<v Speaker 3>That like if we had to struggle to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>food and and protect our families,</v>

2052
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:39.520
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't be worried about this word </v>
<v Speaker 3>or that word or my feelings.</v>

2053
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.780
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:32:40.781 --> 01:32:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I think we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

2055
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:42.743
<v Speaker 3>we're seeking out altercations when we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think we're programmed for a </v>

2056
01:32:46.931 --> 01:32:49.690
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of interaction with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that's unpleasant.</v>

2057
01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.500
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2058
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.050
<v Speaker 3>we're a program for a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>

2059
01:32:53.051 --> 01:32:54.640
<v Speaker 3>whether it's verbal or physical.</v>

2060
01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.513
<v Speaker 3>We're programmed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's what got us to 2018 in </v>

2061
01:32:59.471 --> 01:33:03.610
<v Speaker 3>terms of the crazy history of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>species is it marched across the world.</v>

2062
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:08.910
<v Speaker 3>So imagine leaving Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What woody got animal skins on your feet</v>

2063
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 3>and you're walking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck were those people and what</v>

2064
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 3>kind of people they encounter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's our ancestors.</v>

2065
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.113
<v Speaker 3>Our ancestors had just been dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit forever and when there's no </v>

2066
01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:20.680
<v Speaker 3>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some bullshit over there.</v>

2067
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:23.290
<v Speaker 3>There's 78 different gender pronouns </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

2068
01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:24.213
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why you don't think so </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're a cis gendered white </v>

2069
01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:28.930
<v Speaker 3>privilege piece of Shit and all white </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are racist.</v>

2070
01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 3>And then you start tweeting up a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those if you go to those people's pages,</v>

2071
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:33.900
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

2072
01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:37.210
<v Speaker 3>I'll find a person who says like </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous shit and if I'm not blocked</v>

2073
01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:38.044
<v Speaker 3>by them from some gigantic autoblocker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sometimes they do these block </v>

2074
01:33:41.291 --> 01:33:42.124
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

2075
01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:45.910
<v Speaker 3>But if someone I'm not blocked by them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will bookmark them.</v>

2076
01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:48.560
<v Speaker 3>So instead of like following them so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know I'm from,</v>

2077
01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.920
<v Speaker 3>I would just bookmark them so I'll just </v>
<v Speaker 3>go back.</v>

2078
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:51.783
<v Speaker 3>So I have a file on my computer called </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy motherfuckers and I will go the </v>

2079
01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:55.653
<v Speaker 3>crazy motherfuckers page and I'll see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them go through these manic depressive </v>

2080
01:33:59.321 --> 01:34:00.154
<v Speaker 3>states and freak out about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then every now and then something </v>

2081
01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:04.630
<v Speaker 3>will get tossed in there about </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships.</v>

2082
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.170
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean yeah,</v>

2083
01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.560
<v Speaker 3>because I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it is,</v>

2084
01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:13.740
<v Speaker 3>it is harder for someone of color like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>black or Arab or you know,</v>

2085
01:34:14.231 --> 01:34:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Asian around some people around some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2086
01:34:16.781 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But saying white privilege,</v>

2087
01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.330
<v Speaker 3>like there are a lot of white homeless </v>
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

2088
01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:24.640
<v Speaker 3>And whenever I say a white homeless </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2089
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I always want to give them money and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

2090
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:27.940
<v Speaker 3>white privilege do.</v>

2091
01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:28.773
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt there's an advantage in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this current climate and world to being </v>

2092
01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:32.254
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the white people are not </v>

2093
01:34:33.371 --> 01:34:35.620
<v Speaker 3>guilty of doing anything just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're privileged,</v>

2094
01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:36.553
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of calling it white </v>

2095
01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:38.554
<v Speaker 3>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we need to concentrate on is the </v>

2096
01:34:40.121 --> 01:34:42.700
<v Speaker 3>people that are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only real problem.</v>

2097
01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:43.743
<v Speaker 3>The only problem is racist people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even though white people get </v>

2098
01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:50.440
<v Speaker 3>discriminated against less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem was saying things like black</v>

2099
01:34:50.441 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 3>people can't be racist because racism is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a power thing and bite people have power</v>

2100
01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.560
<v Speaker 3>over black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it's.</v>

2101
01:34:57.610 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a</v>

2102
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.843
<v Speaker 4>fucking intellectual forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know it is when they're saying it </v>

2103
01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:05.960
<v Speaker 4>and it's just one thing that they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>repeat and you're supposed to accept it.</v>

2104
01:35:05.961 --> 01:35:06.794
<v Speaker 4>And it's a part of what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about earlier where there's a game </v>

2105
01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:09.494
<v Speaker 4>that's going on and the game is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to say the 78 different </v>

2106
01:35:12.651 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 4>gender pronouns I want you to say that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>want you to do that.</v>

2107
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.540
<v Speaker 4>I want you to refer to me is that I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to for to me is this.</v>

2108
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.040
<v Speaker 4>I want you to do what I want you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you stop using certain language,</v>

2109
01:35:22.041 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 4>I want you to start saying certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>things because that means I win.</v>

2110
01:35:25.290 --> 01:35:26.123
<v Speaker 4>It's counterproductive because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not teaching anyone how stupid it is to </v>

2111
01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:32.600
<v Speaker 4>just discriminate based on race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you're doing is blocking out that.</v>

2112
01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:33.434
<v Speaker 4>Being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that doesn't even work </v>

2113
01:35:34.761 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

2114
01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:37.310
<v Speaker 4>I think what really works is leading by </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

2115
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>

2116
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 4>What I think we learned from what we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned from people better than us.</v>

2117
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:42.403
<v Speaker 4>You see someone who is amazing and she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>super smart and she's really kind to </v>

2118
01:35:45.021 --> 01:35:46.140
<v Speaker 4>people who got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn it.</v>

2119
01:35:46.141 --> 01:35:46.974
<v Speaker 4>I got to be more like her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's where we're missing that </v>

2120
01:35:49.971 --> 01:35:52.280
<v Speaker 4>aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chastising.</v>

2121
01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 4>See this is the problem with what goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>on with the left in particular,</v>

2122
01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:01.300
<v Speaker 4>the brutal mean assaults on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These twitter gangs and facebook gangs,</v>

2123
01:36:04.011 --> 01:36:04.844
<v Speaker 4>they target someone and attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are not changing anything and in </v>

2124
01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:09.494
<v Speaker 4>fact you are going to get people who see</v>
<v Speaker 4>this horrible shit and they're going to </v>

2125
01:36:12.891 --> 01:36:14.090
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck those people.</v>

2126
01:36:14.091 --> 01:36:14.924
<v Speaker 4>I'm going that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they go the other way and you </v>

2127
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.233
<v Speaker 4>recruit people to be on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is literally how Donald Trump </v>

2128
01:36:20.061 --> 01:36:20.894
<v Speaker 4>became president.</v>

2129
01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.810
<v Speaker 4>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the major factors was people were</v>

2130
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:28.520
<v Speaker 4>noticing a trend and the trend was </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards these crybaby,</v>

2131
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:32.300
<v Speaker 4>preposterous liberals that call it </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything is racist.</v>

2132
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Everything is sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is homophobic.</v>

2133
01:36:34.341 --> 01:36:35.174
<v Speaker 4>Everything and everything falls into </v>
<v Speaker 4>this blanket of transgression where </v>

2134
01:36:38.601 --> 01:36:39.434
<v Speaker 4>there's no innocent and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>guilty and then when they find they run </v>

2135
01:36:42.351 --> 01:36:43.184
<v Speaker 4>out of targets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go after each other for not being </v>

2136
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:45.344
<v Speaker 4>progressive enough to start calling each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other out to find jealousy in the </v>

2137
01:36:47.901 --> 01:36:48.734
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something that really makes me </v>

2138
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:51.044
<v Speaker 4>happy when I see people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>calling people out for years and then </v>

2139
01:36:54.681 --> 01:36:56.190
<v Speaker 4>they get caught out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

2140
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 4>finally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2141
01:36:57.370 --> 01:37:00.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it happen.</v>

2142
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:01.663
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it happen with people I've </v>

2143
01:37:03.441 --> 01:37:05.540
<v Speaker 4>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen them become.</v>

2144
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:07.783
<v Speaker 4>Jamie Kilstein is a friend of mine and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie Kilstein was at one point in his </v>

2145
01:37:11.301 --> 01:37:16.240
<v Speaker 4>life this really progressive activist </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who was like,</v>

2146
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:17.083
<v Speaker 4>everything he said had to be like super </v>
<v Speaker 4>male feminists and super trans positive </v>

2147
01:37:20.931 --> 01:37:24.080
<v Speaker 4>and I mean he was trying so hard to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted but,</v>

2148
01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:25.700
<v Speaker 4>but he's super honest about it too.</v>

2149
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.410
<v Speaker 4>He's done a podcast about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2150
01:37:27.411 --> 01:37:30.920
<v Speaker 4>he'd call people out and be really mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>and really vicious.</v>

2151
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:32.930
<v Speaker 4>And then he realized he was getting all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this anxiety from it.</v>

2152
01:37:32.931 --> 01:37:35.820
<v Speaker 4>He had to check his twitter all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd be walking the street,</v>

2153
01:37:35.821 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 4>just couldn't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like checking his twitter,</v>

2154
01:37:38.031 --> 01:37:39.560
<v Speaker 4>see what their replies were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was released.</v>

2155
01:37:39.710 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 4>He was caught in this weird fucking hate</v>
<v Speaker 4>spiral,</v>

2156
01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:44.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though he was proporting,</v>

2157
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:46.183
<v Speaker 4>he was acting on the premise that he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good person and he was going to call </v>

2158
01:37:48.861 --> 01:37:49.694
<v Speaker 4>out all these bad people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was like addicted to this </v>

2159
01:37:51.321 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 4>weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it turned on him.</v>

2160
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.173
<v Speaker 4>It turned on him like some girls accused</v>
<v Speaker 4>him of being creepy and it was like </v>

2161
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:58.783
<v Speaker 4>super minor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like trying to go on dates with people </v>

2162
01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:03.570
<v Speaker 4>like just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was enough that it all you need</v>

2163
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 4>is like one in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every in that world,</v>

2164
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:07.343
<v Speaker 4>everyone is so hyper progressive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for any sort of deviation from </v>

2165
01:38:12.091 --> 01:38:15.540
<v Speaker 4>the pattern they can attack and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just decided that this guy,</v>

2166
01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:18.940
<v Speaker 4>even though he had been like this model </v>
<v Speaker 4>ally for,</v>

2167
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:19.853
<v Speaker 4>for a male as a male feminist and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people of color and gay stood for </v>

2168
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:25.880
<v Speaker 4>everything that they wanted to.</v>

2169
01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:29.270
<v Speaker 4>He's a piece of garbage because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>heterosexual,</v>

2170
01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2171
01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.730
<v Speaker 4>apparently he worked with this girl or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

2172
01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:33.564
<v Speaker 4>but whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was the most minor of </v>

2173
01:38:35.821 --> 01:38:37.010
<v Speaker 4>transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no rape,</v>

2174
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:37.853
<v Speaker 4>no touching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2175
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:39.900
<v Speaker 4>no meanness know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

2176
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:44.770
<v Speaker 4>And so after all this was done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came out on the other end and that it</v>

2177
01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:48.690
<v Speaker 4>needed just came clean about like how he</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt while he was doing it.</v>

2178
01:38:48.691 --> 01:38:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Why did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very brave that he did that.</v>

2179
01:38:51.211 --> 01:38:55.230
<v Speaker 4>But it gives you insight to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is one of the problems of this</v>

2180
01:38:55.231 --> 01:38:56.064
<v Speaker 4>unnavigable territory of social media is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's very compelling to engage </v>

2181
01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:03.170
<v Speaker 4>constantly and consistently with people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>

2182
01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:04.733
<v Speaker 4>this really anxiety ridden wave of </v>
<v Speaker 4>animosity that's going to run back and </v>

2183
01:39:09.601 --> 01:39:11.430
<v Speaker 4>forth between the two of you for no </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

2184
01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:13.080
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time for no reason</v>

2185
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:14.710
<v Speaker 2>was free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Nipple,</v>

2186
01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:15.910
<v Speaker 2>a big thing here.</v>

2187
01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.610
<v Speaker 4>There was more New York like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>gals were.</v>

2188
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:20.543
<v Speaker 4>They decided they were going to protest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that men can be topless but they can be </v>

2189
01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:25.200
<v Speaker 4>topless and they passed that right?</v>

2190
01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.053
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend that she was telling me </v>

2191
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:29.700
<v Speaker 2>and we had this conversation and she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2192
01:39:29.850 --> 01:39:32.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a female female,</v>

2193
01:39:32.461 --> 01:39:35.220
<v Speaker 2>breasts aren't sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I should be allowed to shop.</v>

2194
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:36.203
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2195
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:38.850
<v Speaker 2>you know that I know that my penis </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know.</v>

2196
01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if I see tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dick is going to get hard.</v>

2197
01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I respect you,</v>

2198
01:39:46.711 --> 01:39:48.840
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fucking pull your tits out,</v>

2199
01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:52.010
<v Speaker 2>my Dick is going to get hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get,</v>

2200
01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:54.890
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do for you,</v>

2201
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:55.910
<v Speaker 2>we were animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2202
01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:58.050
<v Speaker 2>it's also that we're just not used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing tits.</v>

2203
01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If tits were out all the time,</v>

2204
01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.990
<v Speaker 2>they were actually get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is changing gears.</v>

2205
01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Look at those people in that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead island.</v>

2206
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:08.990
<v Speaker 2>They have weird tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tits.</v>

2207
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Someone needs to tell them they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice west coast to the west coast.</v>

2208
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

2209
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I think they should be able to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2210
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:19.103
<v Speaker 2>They want to walk around topless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is there's too many </v>

2211
01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.610
<v Speaker 2>dickheads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

2212
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:25.500
<v Speaker 2>You're running into a river of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dickheads.</v>

2213
01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:28.200
<v Speaker 2>You're going to try to go upstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that with her tits hanging out.</v>

2214
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.510
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to a bar,</v>

2215
01:40:30.630 --> 01:40:32.420
<v Speaker 2>if you want to go to a bar top lists </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2216
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:33.323
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is chaos that's going off the </v>

2217
01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:36.031
<v Speaker 2>rails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2218
01:40:36.031 --> 01:40:39.810
<v Speaker 2>you definitely should be able to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you should.</v>

2219
01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:41.580
<v Speaker 2>If you were my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2220
01:40:41.581 --> 01:40:43.830
<v Speaker 2>if in an ideal world should be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2221
01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:46.540
<v Speaker 2>you should definitely be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do I think you should do it?</v>

2222
01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:47.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2223
01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:49.740
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to try to suck them.</v>

2224
01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:53.400
<v Speaker 2>They're going to try to grab them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

2225
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>If someone's going</v>

2226
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.370
<v Speaker 3>to touch your tits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

2227
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:56.223
<v Speaker 3>It's so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be in the perfect bar in </v>

2228
01:40:58.901 --> 01:41:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Asheville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina,</v>

2229
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:01.243
<v Speaker 3>and you can be there from 10 to two and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody will touch your tits like one </v>

2230
01:41:03.071 --> 01:41:05.320
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's gonna touch your tits.</v>

2231
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:06.183
<v Speaker 3>People are gross.</v>

2232
01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.113
<v Speaker 2>Like even even when girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ariana Grande Grande's sang at aretha </v>

2233
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.903
<v Speaker 2>Franklin's funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even that preacher tried to touch her </v>

2234
01:41:13.170 --> 01:41:15.700
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to grip.</v>

2235
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:16.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine if she had freed the nipple </v>

2236
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have gotten who'd got pregnant.</v>

2237
01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.553
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no argument in saying that they </v>

2238
01:41:26.691 --> 01:41:27.950
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2239
01:41:27.951 --> 01:41:28.784
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be a law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is almost like mean you can make </v>

2240
01:41:31.491 --> 01:41:36.491
<v Speaker 3>parallels to compelled speech because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think that you should be naked and</v>

2241
01:41:37.971 --> 01:41:39.620
<v Speaker 3>just walk down the street if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>

2242
01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.513
<v Speaker 3>but you should be allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should if you're my </v>

2243
01:41:42.681 --> 01:41:44.600
<v Speaker 3>friend because I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2244
01:41:44.601 --> 01:41:45.434
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's is way more likely that you'll get </v>

2245
01:41:49.041 --> 01:41:50.870
<v Speaker 3>raped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think.</v>

2246
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to know what the,</v>

2247
01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:53.413
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do a study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would like to know what the </v>

2248
01:41:55.590 --> 01:42:00.050
<v Speaker 3>statistics look just make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make these people get raped,</v>

2249
01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.880
<v Speaker 3>like just walk around for four of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects,</v>

2250
01:42:04.881 --> 01:42:06.650
<v Speaker 3>got raped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want,</v>

2251
01:42:06.651 --> 01:42:09.020
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do that study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2252
01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:10.933
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live in a tribe like that </v>

2253
01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:13.933
<v Speaker 3>uncontacted tribe outside of India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably super accustomed to </v>

2254
01:42:16.851 --> 01:42:19.400
<v Speaker 3>seeing people naked and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably act normal.</v>

2255
01:42:19.670 --> 01:42:22.370
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not that big a deal where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2256
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:23.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2257
01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:26.420
<v Speaker 3>what's in the box man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's in the box?</v>

2258
01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.553
<v Speaker 3>And we will cover everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the buys are all covered up or feed </v>

2259
01:42:29.661 --> 01:42:30.130
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

2260
01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when we were young,</v>

2261
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:33.583
<v Speaker 2>like I'd see just a sears catalog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman in a bra and I jerk off and now </v>

2262
01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:41.753
<v Speaker 2>like it desensitized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start watching porn and then you're </v>

2263
01:42:45.421 --> 01:42:46.171
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

2264
01:42:46.171 --> 01:42:49.980
<v Speaker 2>If someone had Mascara running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not gagging.</v>

2265
01:42:50.010 --> 01:42:53.780
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't at least one murder in this.</v>

2266
01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.640
<v Speaker 2>How can I get hard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch an action movie and nobody dies in</v>

2267
01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:00.900
<v Speaker 2>a bitch ass movies this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're Weirdos.</v>

2268
01:43:00.901 --> 01:43:01.734
<v Speaker 2>And everybody has their own weird quirk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's I think a lot of times we don't </v>

2269
01:43:06.181 --> 01:43:09.900
<v Speaker 2>admit it or we then you see someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>an extreme and you're like,</v>

2270

<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least I'm out that like we have an </v>

<v Speaker 2>to gold.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But he has a crippling addiction of </v>

2273
01:43:17.541 --> 01:43:20.340
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes and just a weird guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you meet him,</v>

01:43:20.341 --> 01:43:22.160
<v Speaker 2>he's just a fucking over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

2275
01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Is it crippling because you can't afford</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2276
01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:26.490
<v Speaker 2>He's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he just said bad judge of character.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about it for awhile.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Pro on this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get that party role and that's </v>

2282
01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.820
<v Speaker 2>what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You blur out faces and watch.</v>

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Poseidon gets his ass kicked by the name</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2290
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:06.320
<v Speaker 1>that's not a real picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the shit you're going to get.</v>

2291

<v Speaker 1>She's going to steal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to steal all your shit.</v>

2292
01:44:09.321 --> 01:44:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2293
01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:10.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's real.</v>

2294
01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I think she's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like,</v>

2295
01:44:12.210 --> 01:44:13.220
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not real.</v>

2296
01:44:13.221 --> 01:44:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And then she came over to the house when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were doing a spot at the,</v>

2297
01:44:16.851 --> 01:44:18.250

2299
01:44:20.751 --> 01:44:21.584
<v Speaker 1>he gave her $300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he tried to touch her and she was </v>

2302
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:28.540
<v Speaker 1>we need more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they went out to a,</v>

2303
01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:30.760
<v Speaker 1>like an ATM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got more money,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she brought it.</v>

2305
01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.860
<v Speaker 1>She went back to the apartment and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he pulled the Dick and she was like,</v>

2306
01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:38.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not having sex.</v>

2307
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:40.250
<v Speaker 1>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2308
01:44:40.251 --> 01:44:41.084
<v Speaker 1>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she ran away and pepper sprayed or like </v>

2309
01:44:42.441 --> 01:44:43.850
<v Speaker 1>she ran it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was still making it.</v>

2310
01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.713
<v Speaker 1>So he said I tried to chase her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was fast in the hills and </v>

2311
01:44:47.290 --> 01:44:48.123
<v Speaker 1>there's two flights of stairs and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>slipped on the last ones because he has </v>

2312
01:44:50.391 --> 01:44:53.240
<v Speaker 1>his boxer shorts and as soon as he stood</v>
<v Speaker 1>up from the slip,</v>

2313
01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 1>she sprayed him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ran out,</v>

2314
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:59.690
<v Speaker 1>he ran three floors up to get dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you went out looking for her.</v>

2315
01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:02.450
<v Speaker 1>But he's not gonna find finer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he shows up at the store.</v>

2316
01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Belligerent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And was he naked when she pepper sprayed</v>

01:45:05.421 --> 01:45:05.960
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>dudes renting the apartment.</v>

2346
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Why would we bring glitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe this is la.</v>

2347
01:46:15.291 --> 01:46:16.124
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man.</v>

2348
01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 1>You were gone on before about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

2349
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:21.110
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible for you to be a gay guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely could have been gay guy,</v>

2350
01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.190
<v Speaker 1>a gay burlesque.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if I was a gay guy,</v>

2351
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:31.160
<v Speaker 1>like I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be a gay guy,</v>

2352
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think would bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2353
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:34.710
<v Speaker 1>high heels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing nets,</v>

2354
01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:36.430
<v Speaker 1>glitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd go hard.</v>

2355
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:37.783
<v Speaker 1>Hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd have like some old timey </v>

2356
01:46:41.271 --> 01:46:45.950
<v Speaker 1>clothes onto like a Charlie Chaplin Gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like Sherlock Holmes.</v>

2357
01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:47.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2358
01:46:47.721 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Old Timey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie,</v>

2359
01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Chaplin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay stuff.</v>

2360
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.710
<v Speaker 2>You know how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how hard it must have been in those days</v>

2361
01:46:52.711 --> 01:46:55.770
<v Speaker 2>to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like coming out of the closet now.</v>

2362
01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.270
<v Speaker 2>It's still hard in small towns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But imagine already even in big cities,</v>

2363
01:47:00.271 --> 01:47:02.250
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on your friend's parents.</v>

2364
01:47:02.410 --> 01:47:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

2365
01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Chaplin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Days Imagine.</v>

2366
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 2>But there's probably a lot of gang shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2367
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think there's any </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference in the number.</v>

2368
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I bet the numbers probably sound like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2369
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:17.040
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2370
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:18.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause even now people are saying now </v>

2371
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:22.000
<v Speaker 2>there are more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more transit in the weather,</v>

2372
01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.020
<v Speaker 2>but there are more that are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>operations.</v>

2373
01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:27.480
<v Speaker 2>But in the old days it was the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2374
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I bet the numbers consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the percentage.</v>

2376
01:47:32.411 --> 01:47:35.070
<v Speaker 2>It's probably more numbers now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more people.</v>

2377
01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.533
<v Speaker 2>There were probably a bunch of gay dudes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the fifties that were actually </v>

2378
01:47:40.111 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 2>trans women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just because you couldn't get,</v>

2379
01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:47.280
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't change anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you just suck Dick,</v>

2380
01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:49.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in private or whatever.</v>

01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Like the format podcasting.</v>

2399
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Every and now they're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Podcast,</v>

2400
01:48:47.391 --> 01:48:49.350
<v Speaker 2>but the first couple of years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

2401
01:48:49.351 --> 01:48:51.300
<v Speaker 2>like 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2402
01:48:51.301 --> 01:48:52.134
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most podcasts sounded like shitty </v>

2403
01:48:54.061 --> 01:48:57.270
<v Speaker 2>versions of Opie and Anthony and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2404
01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.153
<v Speaker 2>like was ones that we're trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an hour long interview style </v>

2405
01:49:02.431 --> 01:49:04.400
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more like a,</v>

2406
01:49:04.401 --> 01:49:05.234
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some npr type deal or something like </v>

2407
01:49:06.511 --> 01:49:08.190
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then um,</v>

2408
01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.440
<v Speaker 2>we started doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2409
01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:13.290
<v Speaker 2>where there would be like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics just hanging around,</v>

2410
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.860
<v Speaker 2>hanging out and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we started doing those,</v>

2411
01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:17.873
<v Speaker 2>which was like 2009 ish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was clearly influenced by opie and </v>

2412
01:49:22.921 --> 01:49:27.921
<v Speaker 2>anthony and also influenced even more so</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Anthony Kumi is Internet show that he</v>

2413
01:49:28.081 --> 01:49:29.800
<v Speaker 2>was doing last compound show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:30.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I watched that and this is one </v>

2415
01:49:32.551 --> 01:49:36.150
<v Speaker 2>of the big things that hit me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized I could do it because um,</v>

2416
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.860
<v Speaker 2>he just set it up in his basement.</v>

2417
01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2418
01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:39.453
<v Speaker 2>he had some money and he decided to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a green screen and you've got these </v>

2419
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:43.103
<v Speaker 2>professional cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought about it while I was </v>

2420
01:49:44.851 --> 01:49:45.601
<v Speaker 2>watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2421
01:49:45.601 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 2>why don't I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2422
01:49:46.711 --> 01:49:47.544
<v Speaker 2>why am not doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got this whole setup in his </v>

2423
01:49:49.211 --> 01:49:50.044
<v Speaker 2>basement and then there was this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>time where he was drunk doing karaoke </v>

2424
01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.770
<v Speaker 2>with a machine gun as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you get a machine gun,</v>

2425
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:57.633
<v Speaker 2>any sig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's doing karaoke and I remember </v>

2426
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:02.710
<v Speaker 2>thinking like this crazy motherfucker I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to,</v>

2427
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:03.903
<v Speaker 2>I need to do a show now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to because now I'm saying this </v>

2428
01:50:07.061 --> 01:50:07.894
<v Speaker 2>would be a lot of fun and I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed doing radio shows when I did </v>

2429
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.830
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do.</v>

2430
01:50:11.831 --> 01:50:12.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do opie and anthony even if I </v>

2431
01:50:13.871 --> 01:50:18.871
<v Speaker 2>didn't have like tickets to sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it was all sold out,</v>

2432
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I would still show up and go hang out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with those guys because it was just fun.</v>

2433
01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Like a comic's table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just hanging out.</v>

2434
01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Just break them both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>

2435
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean like we're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it happened.</v>

2436
01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:31.913
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it with those guys and </v>

2437
01:50:32.741 --> 01:50:36.130
<v Speaker 2>watching anthony do it on his own and </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming friends with Jimmy,</v>

2438
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:37.403
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then seeing how it's fun to just </v>

2439
01:50:40.361 --> 01:50:41.194
<v Speaker 2>hang out with comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did Anthony show a couple of weeks </v>

01:50:44.591 --> 01:50:45.424

01:50:46.931 --> 01:50:48.100
<v Speaker 2>next week when he's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>their setup is great.</v>

2460
01:51:27.401 --> 01:51:28.234
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the green screen behind them just turns </v>

2461
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:31.180
<v Speaker 2>it into whatever the fuck he wants it to</v>

<v Speaker 2>shell,</v>

2464
01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:40.523
<v Speaker 2>like the first couple of times I did his</v>
<v Speaker 2>show when it was in the basement of his </v>

2465
01:51:43.061 --> 01:51:43.894
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something I like about doing </v>

2466
01:51:45.341 --> 01:51:46.630
<v Speaker 2>those shows when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2467
01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:50.530
<v Speaker 2>you go into someone's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did Steven crowder show,</v>

2468
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:53.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a month ago and there was something</v>

2469
01:51:53.051 --> 01:51:57.930
<v Speaker 2>cool about going in the suburbs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dallas in his garage to do his show.</v>

2470
01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Supposed to say where he lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2471
01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Guys hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2472
01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:01.800
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But tell us.</v>

2473
01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:06.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even crowder dies my fault.</v>

2474
01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I was getting blamed tooth moved around </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

2475
01:52:09.581 --> 01:52:10.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2476
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:11.081
<v Speaker 2>I know y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2477
01:52:11.081 --> 01:52:11.914
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But remember he did that a thing that </v>

2478
01:52:13.271 --> 01:52:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Bob Ross Paints Muhammad to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took ball.</v>

2479
01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:18.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's literally something that </v>

2480
01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:23.770
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to kill you if you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did that allowed.</v>

2481
01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's strange time.</v>

2482
01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also a time where that,</v>

2483
01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:31.413
<v Speaker 2>criticizing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing anything that's Islamic is </v>

2484
01:52:33.881 --> 01:52:34.714
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous because people call you </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobic and because people want to </v>

2485
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:38.674
<v Speaker 2>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got two different things going </v>

2486
01:52:39.611 --> 01:52:40.444
<v Speaker 2>on at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those same people will have no </v>

2487
01:52:42.611 --> 01:52:44.390
<v Speaker 2>problem mocking Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

2488
01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2489
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

2490
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.140
<v Speaker 1>not even like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a right wing guy.</v>

2491
01:52:48.141 --> 01:52:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself a little more to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

2492
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:54.170
<v Speaker 1>but there's something I like about right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing media,</v>

2493
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:55.663
<v Speaker 1>especially like the funny type of right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing media that they take fucking crazy </v>

2494
01:52:59.991 --> 01:53:01.410
<v Speaker 1>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean like Kumina,</v>

2495
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:02.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kumina,</v>

2496
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:04.400
<v Speaker 1>like crowder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like A.</v>

2497
01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:05.233
<v Speaker 1>Steven crowder is really funny to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin McInnes I think is fucking </v>

2498
01:53:08.031 --> 01:53:08.830
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

2499
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:12.610
<v Speaker 4>Gavin's in the crossfire and right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the eye of Sauron is upon him.</v>

2500
01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:16.810
<v Speaker 4>He's too much stupid shit about inciting</v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

2501
01:53:16.811 --> 01:53:21.270
<v Speaker 4>And now that there's some articles </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that the FBI considers him a,</v>

2502
01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.113
<v Speaker 4>that the proud boys are hate group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then Kumina sent me something that </v>

2503
01:53:26.050 --> 01:53:29.050
<v Speaker 4>he sent him and I'll send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's saying it's</v>

2504
01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:29.973
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I heard about the proud </v>

2505
01:53:31.891 --> 01:53:35.810
<v Speaker 1>boys I was doing Gavin shown New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2506
01:53:35.850 --> 01:53:37.920
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was with a Dante narrow,</v>

2507
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:40.800
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a black comic in New York.</v>

2508
01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2509
01:53:42.121 --> 01:53:42.954
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2510
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:44.760

<v Speaker 1>me and him are in the proud boys.</v>

2511
01:53:44.761 --> 01:53:46.950
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's the proud boys holding?</v>

2512
01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's explain what it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because a joke,</v>

2513
01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.740
<v Speaker 1>at first it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't jerk off,</v>

2514
01:53:52.890 --> 01:53:53.723
<v Speaker 1>so the will want to fuck our wives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like four months later I was </v>

2515
01:53:57.211 --> 01:53:57.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh</v>

2516
01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Gavin McInnes quit the proud boys today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2517
01:54:01.090 --> 01:54:01.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2518
01:54:01.650 --> 01:54:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it today?</v>

2519
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I thought he had quit that years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2520
01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.460
<v Speaker 1>This just got posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2521
01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.380
<v Speaker 4>Think maybe Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sending you an article to where he's</v>

2522
01:54:08.381 --> 01:54:12.790
<v Speaker 4>realizing how problematic it is to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected with these people.</v>

2523
01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:14.230
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2524
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:16.870
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to have a group,</v>

2525
01:54:17.170 --> 01:54:18.003
<v Speaker 4>you can't control everyone in the group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anybody in the group that does </v>

2526
01:54:20.591 --> 01:54:22.290
<v Speaker 4>something horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just sent you something.</v>

2527
01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:23.733
<v Speaker 4>Pull this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is Gavin's response to all this </v>

2528
01:54:24.761 --> 01:54:27.430
<v Speaker 4>because so many people got mad at me </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I had Gavin on the first place.</v>

2529
01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:28.593
<v Speaker 4>First of all I had Gavin on because used</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be one of the founders of vice also </v>

2530
01:54:31.691 --> 01:54:34.900
<v Speaker 4>because I had Gavin on before that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was fun to hang out with.</v>

2531
01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Then when I had them on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had them on the last time.</v>

2532
01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:42.190
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about was the proud boys.</v>

2533
01:54:42.191 --> 01:54:43.660
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know what the fuck that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

2534
01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.210
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe I'd heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I thought it was a joke.</v>

2535
01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:47.653
<v Speaker 4>Turned out he used to be a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It started off as a joke on compound </v>

2536
01:54:50.771 --> 01:54:53.230
<v Speaker 4>media and Anthony will get into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

2537
01:54:53.231 --> 01:54:54.064
<v Speaker 4>He knows the history of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were making fun of something </v>

2538
01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.740
<v Speaker 4>and they decided to make a fake mock </v>
<v Speaker 4>group called the proud boys.</v>

2539
01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:00.693
<v Speaker 4>Now the problem with this is when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a group that's supposed to be </v>

2540
01:55:03.281 --> 01:55:04.114
<v Speaker 4>fighting and the va and I actually tried</v>
<v Speaker 4>to express this to him when he was on </v>

2541
01:55:06.491 --> 01:55:08.800
<v Speaker 4>the show because he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking people's ass.</v>

2542
01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:09.634
<v Speaker 4>We're going to punch him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling them to punch people in the </v>

2543
01:55:10.691 --> 01:55:11.141
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2544
01:55:11.141 --> 01:55:13.840
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not how reality works.</v>

2545
01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:15.100
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've ever been punched</v>

2546
01:55:15.101 --> 01:55:15.934
<v Speaker 4>in the face or if you've been around </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that like to punch people in the </v>

2547
01:55:17.981 --> 01:55:18.814
<v Speaker 4>face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't just punch someone in the </v>

2548
01:55:19.481 --> 01:55:20.050
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

2549
01:55:20.050 --> 01:55:21.970
<v Speaker 4>What happens is you punched him in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>face,</v>

2550
01:55:21.971 --> 01:55:23.920
<v Speaker 4>they come back with a bat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody gets a knife,</v>

2551
01:55:23.921 --> 01:55:26.110
<v Speaker 4>people get guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It always escalates.</v>

2552
01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:27.033
<v Speaker 4>It's going to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't just get away with punching </v>

2553
01:55:28.481 --> 01:55:30.040
<v Speaker 4>people in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2554
01:55:30.041 --> 01:55:30.874
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not good that these antifa people </v>

2555
01:55:32.261 --> 01:55:33.094
<v Speaker 4>bring bike locks and smack people in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>heads with them and that's kind of the </v>

2556
01:55:34.931 --> 01:55:35.764
<v Speaker 4>point in that in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those people don't understand what </v>

2557
01:55:38.591 --> 01:55:41.500
<v Speaker 4>happens when you start the chain of </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

2558
01:55:41.710 --> 01:55:44.400
<v Speaker 4>When you started that domino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand what happens.</v>

2559
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:45.263
<v Speaker 4>They think that they're living in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking book that they love about some </v>

2560
01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:48.893
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary liberal character that </v>
<v Speaker 4>reaches out and and smashes all these </v>

2561
01:55:54.271 --> 01:55:58.200
<v Speaker 4>oppressors of social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not reality and reality.</v>

2562
01:55:58.201 --> 01:56:00.270
<v Speaker 4>You just hit a guy with a lock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was talking to you,</v>

2563
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:01.223
<v Speaker 4>you assaulted him with a deadly weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the next thing you know they're </v>

2564
01:56:02.761 --> 01:56:04.300
<v Speaker 4>going to kill you or they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>beat you.</v>

2565
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:05.143
<v Speaker 4>They're going to punch you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when a guy like Gavin says something </v>

2566
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should punch them in the face.</v>

2567
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:14.490
<v Speaker 4>I understand why he said that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were inciting violence.</v>

2568
01:56:14.491 --> 01:56:15.324
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these antifa people would hit people </v>

2569
01:56:16.471 --> 01:56:18.300
<v Speaker 4>with things that were in masks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2570
01:56:18.301 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 4>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them were doing it nonviolently.</v>

2571
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Some of them just wanted what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought was the right things to happen.</v>

2572
01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.750
<v Speaker 4>But like all groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a fucking big group.</v>

2573
01:56:27.751 --> 01:56:29.340
<v Speaker 4>You can't control everybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

2574
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:30.990
<v Speaker 4>And that happened with the proud boys </v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

2575
01:56:30.991 --> 01:56:31.824
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he decided to have this thing </v>

2576
01:56:33.751 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 4>that was going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2577
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:35.753
<v Speaker 4>mockingly oppose Antifa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it became real and then it became </v>

2578
01:56:40.141 --> 01:56:41.740
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just this is.</v>

2579
01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.990
<v Speaker 4>This is just one of the problems that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have when there's a fucking group</v>

2580
01:56:45.991 --> 01:56:49.920
<v Speaker 4>of people have post to another group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and you know,</v>

2581
01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:52.380
<v Speaker 4>him quitting the proud boys is </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely smart.</v>

2582
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:53.363
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think it's going to help </v>
<v Speaker 4>because now people are saying he's a </v>

2583
01:56:55.681 --> 01:56:56.514
<v Speaker 4>white supremacist and what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception that people have of you is </v>

2584
01:56:59.671 --> 01:57:03.030
<v Speaker 4>almost important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost as important as what you actually</v>

2585
01:57:03.031 --> 01:57:06.150
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably even more important almost</v>

2586
01:57:06.450 --> 01:57:07.283
<v Speaker 4>because not for you and not for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not for people that are gonna actually </v>

2587
01:57:09.421 --> 01:57:11.940
<v Speaker 4>read into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for people in the outside,</v>

2588
01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:16.440
<v Speaker 4>the perception of who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it just too many things to learn?</v>

2589
01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:17.910
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a racist.</v>

2590
01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:20.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck that racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all people here.</v>

2591
01:57:20.130 --> 01:57:22.050
<v Speaker 4>That's all they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they keep moving.</v>

2592
01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:24.210
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile you've got a guy who's Gavin </v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2593
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not even American.</v>

2594
01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:27.120
<v Speaker 4>He's Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second of all,</v>

2595
01:57:27.121 --> 01:57:30.180
<v Speaker 4>he's married to a native American woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is not a racist.</v>

2596
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:32.700
<v Speaker 4>He said he's a provocateur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

2597
01:57:32.701 --> 01:57:33.534
<v Speaker 4>Unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says ridiculous shit because he </v>

2598
01:57:34.891 --> 01:57:38.020
<v Speaker 4>thinks it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a very bad situation.</v>

2599
01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:42.010
<v Speaker 4>Is almost a troll or like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even think like I've,</v>

2600
01:57:42.110 --> 01:57:44.190
<v Speaker 4>I know him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're not good,</v>

2601
01:57:44.191 --> 01:57:45.024
<v Speaker 4>good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

2602
01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:45.913
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked them a lot and I'm pretty sure </v>

2603
01:57:47.851 --> 01:57:50.580
<v Speaker 4>he's not even right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's just fucking,</v>

2604
01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:54.960
<v Speaker 4>he's definitely fucking with people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he definitely has some right wing ideas,</v>

2605
01:57:54.961 --> 01:57:55.794
<v Speaker 4>but more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't like some of the ridiculous </v>

2606
01:57:58.951 --> 01:58:01.400
<v Speaker 4>aspects of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's more in.</v>

2607
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:02.343
<v Speaker 4>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's a more opposed some of the </v>

2608
01:58:04.861 --> 01:58:07.800
<v Speaker 4>more preposterous notions of relapsed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he is really right.</v>

2609
01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's right on some things to a right</v>

2610
01:58:09.901 --> 01:58:10.734
<v Speaker 4>wing on some things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he came onto the show dressed like </v>

2611
01:58:14.101 --> 01:58:17.760
<v Speaker 4>fucking Michael Douglas from falling </v>
<v Speaker 4>down as a goof.</v>

2612
01:58:17.761 --> 01:58:22.230
<v Speaker 4>He brought a freezer case and everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a tie and a white short sleeve button</v>

2613
01:58:22.231 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 4>up shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did it as a goof.</v>

2614
01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:25.050
<v Speaker 4>Like that's him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a.</v>

2615
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:27.210
<v Speaker 4>he's a weird guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Funny.</v>

2616
01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:28.800
<v Speaker 4>He says funny shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he.</v>

2617
01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.080
<v Speaker 4>But in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you.</v>

2618
01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:34.380
<v Speaker 4>There's two different ways you can go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through life,</v>

2619
01:58:34.381 --> 01:58:36.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could pretend,</v>

2620
01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:37.163
<v Speaker 4>put on an act or you can be yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he's chosen to do is a little bit </v>

2621
01:58:40.591 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 4>of both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's chosen</v>

2622
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.770
<v Speaker 3>to pretend a little bit but also be </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself,</v>

2623
01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard for people to know where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the line is.</v>

2624
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.080
<v Speaker 3>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fun.</v>

2625
01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:50.914
<v Speaker 3>If you're getting away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun when it turns on you and </v>

2626
01:58:54.281 --> 01:58:54.760
<v Speaker 3>then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2627
01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:55.593
<v Speaker 3>that part I was joking around about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like says who like who's who's </v>

2628
01:58:59.591 --> 01:59:01.990
<v Speaker 3>right and who's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it gets.</v>

2629
01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:05.260
<v Speaker 3>It gets real slippery when people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually know who you are,</v>

2630
01:59:05.261 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 3>where you stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think he was,</v>

2631
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:08.583
<v Speaker 3>he thought it was fun to fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people a little bit on with certain </v>

2632
01:59:10.811 --> 01:59:15.250
<v Speaker 3>things and in this climate man that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be fucking dangerous.</v>

2633
01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:16.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

2634
01:59:16.231 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 3>And Kaufman of 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No he's not.</v>

2635
01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:20.260
<v Speaker 3>He's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2636
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:21.730
<v Speaker 3>he's Gavin McInnes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2637
01:59:21.731 --> 01:59:24.220
<v Speaker 3>and I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sad that all this shit is going down</v>

2638
01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:28.210
<v Speaker 3>and I hope it passes over and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people get to understand me.</v>

2639
01:59:28.210 --> 01:59:30.430
<v Speaker 3>It's not a perfect person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one is.</v>

2640
01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:33.000
<v Speaker 3>But what he has is an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was weird.</v>

2641
01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:34.083
<v Speaker 3>Says Funny Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he take a shit on the air once on a </v>

2642
01:59:36.581 --> 01:59:37.414
<v Speaker 3>show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stuck his finger up his ass and shit </v>

2643
01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a bad guy.</v>

2644
01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.310
<v Speaker 3>He's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2645
01:59:42.850 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 3>If there's something we're right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

2646
01:59:45.431 --> 01:59:50.431
<v Speaker 3>like in 2018 that the left hates or </v>
<v Speaker 3>right the right hates the left and we're</v>

2647
01:59:51.371 --> 01:59:53.830
<v Speaker 3>all exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>

2648
01:59:54.010 --> 01:59:57.810
<v Speaker 3>a difference between what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2649
01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:00.130
<v Speaker 3>The stupidity in the group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the whole group.</v>

2650
02:00:00.131 --> 02:00:00.964
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly like the worst common </v>

2651
02:00:02.321 --> 02:00:04.320
<v Speaker 3>denominator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst common denominator.</v>

2652
02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:07.090
<v Speaker 3>The worst actors in any group define </v>
<v Speaker 3>that group.</v>

2653
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:09.310
<v Speaker 3>So whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2654
02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:10.840
<v Speaker 3>people that are on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2655
02:00:10.841 --> 02:00:12.310
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right whore,</v>

2656
02:00:12.311 --> 02:00:16.090
<v Speaker 3>fiscally conservative but socially </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal and they just,</v>

2657
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:17.223
<v Speaker 3>they just don't think that you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend money like crazy and they believe </v>

2658
02:00:19.391 --> 02:00:21.760
<v Speaker 3>in discipline and they believe and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2659
02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:25.030
<v Speaker 3>having an intelligent financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning,</v>

2660
02:00:25.090 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

2661
02:00:26.050 --> 02:00:31.050
<v Speaker 3>there's that as well as people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>socially democratic socialist.</v>

2662
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:33.143
<v Speaker 3>I think you could spend all the rich </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's money on all these other </v>

2663
02:00:34.871 --> 02:00:35.704
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just as many people because </v>

2664
02:00:36.761 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a way broader spectrum,</v>

2665
02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:39.423
<v Speaker 3>but you have to pick a side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most of us are like 90 percent </v>

2666
02:00:42.251 --> 02:00:46.870
<v Speaker 3>in the metal and then there's the five </v>
<v Speaker 3>five on each side that like,</v>

2667
02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:47.951
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2668
02:00:47.951 --> 02:00:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm more left leaning and then you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>like extreme left and you're like,</v>

2669
02:00:51.371 --> 02:00:52.750
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

2670
02:00:52.751 --> 02:00:53.561
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more right.</v>

2671
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:55.420
<v Speaker 3>And then you see the fucking Weirdos on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right.</v>

2672
02:00:55.630 --> 02:00:56.830
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2673
02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something very scary on </v>
<v Speaker 3>both sides.</v>

2674
02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you see that scary thing,</v>

2675
02:01:02.891 --> 02:01:04.680
<v Speaker 3>you want to pose that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you become what?</v>

2676
02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:05.530
<v Speaker 3>It's the op,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2677
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you become a left wing person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you decided,</v>

2678
02:01:07.781 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 3>well we've got to stop trump no matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>

2679
02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Whatever is never trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a lot of that going on.</v>

2680
02:01:13.330 --> 02:01:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I think the only reason why I went more </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the right side is because of the free</v>

2681
02:01:17.921 --> 02:01:20.560
<v Speaker 3>speech thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think pretty much everything.</v>

2682
02:01:20.561 --> 02:01:21.394
<v Speaker 3>I'm more left leaning except the free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech thing that I'm more right </v>

2683
02:01:24.401 --> 02:01:25.540
<v Speaker 3>leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

2684
02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:28.090
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be a writer left thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2685
02:01:28.091 --> 02:01:28.924
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that's the left that's having a </v>

2686
02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:31.834
<v Speaker 3>problem with free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's insane to me because I </v>

2687
02:01:33.941 --> 02:01:34.774
<v Speaker 3>always thought the left was all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>free expression and intelligence and </v>

2688
02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>education and it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also used</v>

2689
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:45.070
<v Speaker 4>to be more about peaceful behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the hippies in the,</v>

2690
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:46.393
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the seventies where everything really </v>

2691
02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:50.450
<v Speaker 4>changed in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which really did launch a revolution and</v>

2692
02:01:50.451 --> 02:01:52.940
<v Speaker 4>changed a lot of America during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties,</v>

2693
02:01:52.941 --> 02:01:53.774
<v Speaker 4>in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of it is inspired by </v>

2694
02:01:54.591 --> 02:01:55.760
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2695
02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 4>All those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2696
02:01:57.831 --> 02:01:58.664
<v Speaker 4>but nonviolent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big part of that whole </v>

2697
02:02:00.051 --> 02:02:01.730
<v Speaker 4>movement was all love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2698
02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.320
<v Speaker 4>and the hippies movement of today is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same.</v>

2699
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:07.183
<v Speaker 4>It's like a feeble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>small subset of the overall aggressive </v>

2700
02:02:12.471 --> 02:02:14.530
<v Speaker 4>liberal group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2701
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.350
<v Speaker 4>that thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2702
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.233
<v Speaker 4>they've got to stomp out sexism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>racism and transphobia and all these </v>

2703
02:02:19.821 --> 02:02:23.360
<v Speaker 4>things and like really aggressive front </v>
<v Speaker 4>running,</v>

2704
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:24.403
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones who want to change policy and </v>

2705
02:02:26.241 --> 02:02:27.074
<v Speaker 4>change culture and change society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you get and teeth involved and </v>

2706
02:02:31.041 --> 02:02:31.874
<v Speaker 4>you get people screaming in people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>faces and people going to lectures and </v>

2707
02:02:35.001 --> 02:02:38.510
<v Speaker 4>blocking lectures and threatening </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence and like,</v>

2708
02:02:38.511 --> 02:02:41.660
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a very different kind of vibe.</v>

2709
02:02:42.110 --> 02:02:44.660
<v Speaker 4>Then what changed the world in 67?</v>

2710
02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:45.933
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a bit about how the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to deal with hate is with love and </v>

2711
02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>that I truly believed that if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like w and I try to do that.</v>

2712
02:02:56.081 --> 02:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it was weird when I was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through my weird face,</v>

2713
02:02:58.331 --> 02:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>but now whenever people say I fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate you because you did this,</v>

2714
02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:02.974
<v Speaker 1>you did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to understand why they hate me </v>

2715
02:03:05.170 --> 02:03:06.003
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I generally do understand like I'm </v>

2716
02:03:07.931 --> 02:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>not a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know,</v>

2717
02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:10.361
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2718
02:03:10.361 --> 02:03:10.831
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2719
02:03:10.831 --> 02:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm a guy that made fun of a disabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

2720
02:03:12.941 --> 02:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get how you can hate that.</v>

2721
02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>But then I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to,</v>

2722
02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of going,</v>

2723
02:03:19.331 --> 02:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm allowed doing this.</v>

2724
02:03:20.831 --> 02:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I show them respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I show them love.</v>

2725
02:03:22.601 --> 02:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And then after like three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always like,</v>

2726
02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2727
02:03:26.170 --> 02:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry if I told you you shouldn't do</v>

2728
02:03:28.361 --> 02:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2729
02:03:28.570 --> 02:03:29.403
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't.</v>

2730
02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:30.363
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to change people's minds </v>

2731
02:03:32.591 --> 02:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>just by listening to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some.</v>

2732
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:36.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2733
02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>it's also probably as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people don't know you.</v>

2734
02:03:39.370 --> 02:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>They're just engaging with you to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction out of people.</v>

2735
02:03:42.191 --> 02:03:43.024
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just some people are what is </v>

2736
02:03:44.770 --> 02:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people,</v>

2737
02:03:46.271 --> 02:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're one on one in real life on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet,</v>

2738
02:03:50.111 --> 02:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter,</v>

2739
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to change how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

2740
02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>But if you've talked to people and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

2741
02:03:56.681 --> 02:03:57.514
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's not a month and this guy is </v>

2742
02:03:58.991 --> 02:04:02.120
<v Speaker 1>not an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because whenever people want to like,</v>

2743
02:04:02.230 --> 02:04:03.030
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2744
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.863
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy that doesn't like you on the </v>

2745
02:04:05.201 --> 02:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Internet that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2746
02:04:06.610 --> 02:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan's a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

2747
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>if you met him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't say that.</v>

2748
02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if he did think you were an asshole,</v>

2749
02:04:13.991 --> 02:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>he'd explained this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd talked to him and he'd be</v>

2750
02:04:17.501 --> 02:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

2751
02:04:18.190 --> 02:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan's a good guy.</v>

2752
02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2753
02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:20.893
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely a limited amount that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could get through when you're </v>

2754
02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:25.113
<v Speaker 4>expressing yourself on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on instagram or something like that and </v>

2755
02:04:27.610 --> 02:04:28.443
<v Speaker 4>people like to get reactions out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people so they want to get Mike Ward's </v>

2756
02:04:30.551 --> 02:04:31.384
<v Speaker 4>goat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to fuck with you and say </v>

2757
02:04:32.471 --> 02:04:33.304
<v Speaker 4>mean shit to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're doing it because they want </v>

2758
02:04:34.511 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 4>to get a reaction and some of them don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>even think of you as a and they also</v>

2759
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.903
<v Speaker 2>think of you as an easy target because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did something mean and because </v>

2760
02:04:42.271 --> 02:04:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you're a guy in the public eye and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a professional comedian and maybe</v>

2761
02:04:45.241 --> 02:04:47.420
<v Speaker 2>they hate their job and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this guy.</v>

2762
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Is he living his dream when I have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shitty job?</v>

2763
02:04:51.690 --> 02:04:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2764
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:53.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of it.</v>

2765
02:04:53.761 --> 02:04:56.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's a Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a Shitty,</v>

2766
02:04:56.161 --> 02:04:58.920
<v Speaker 2>but b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know because the whole,</v>

2767
02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:03.270
<v Speaker 2>the whole interaction sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's wrong,</v>

2768
02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:04.500
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's wrong.</v>

2769
02:05:04.590 --> 02:05:05.423
<v Speaker 2>Though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is stupid and </v>

2770
02:05:07.591 --> 02:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>interacting with people like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth with them.</v>

2771
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I've done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid to do,</v>

2772
02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:15.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a complete waste of </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

2773
02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Did you get along shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your last special?</v>

2774
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:19.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shit,</v>

2775
02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:20.333
<v Speaker 2>no fucking article from vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then ms dot quoted because they </v>

2776
02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:31.580
<v Speaker 2>totally took me out of context because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said he calls vegans dip shits.</v>

2777
02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.113
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I said was that the majority of </v>

2778
02:05:35.371 --> 02:05:36.204
<v Speaker 2>Vegans I think are good people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to live their lives without </v>

2779
02:05:41.050 --> 02:05:41.883
<v Speaker 2>something dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just made this moral choice and </v>

2780
02:05:44.431 --> 02:05:45.264
<v Speaker 2>then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those people pay for it with their </v>

2781
02:05:46.861 --> 02:05:48.290
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always sick.</v>

2782
02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked like what the other job,</v>

2783
02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:54.533
<v Speaker 2>the other part of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other part of the joke was he used </v>

2784
02:05:58.171 --> 02:05:59.004
<v Speaker 2>to like the other part of the joke was </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the rest of the people that are </v>

2785
02:06:03.301 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Vegan there really only vegan because </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology didn't find them first.</v>

2786
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dip shits.</v>

2787
02:06:08.490 --> 02:06:11.460
<v Speaker 2>They coulda woulda joined the Taliban if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took the wrong exit.</v>

2788
02:06:11.630 --> 02:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>It's just so the took out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He calls vegans dip shits.</v>

2789
02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:16.173
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2790
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:21.120
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the title of the article.</v>

2791
02:06:21.210 --> 02:06:23.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're special.</v>

2792
02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's other things to thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about vegans.</v>

2793
02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:27.203
<v Speaker 2>I spent like four hours looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of people that have vacant </v>

2794
02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:34.590
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like when when like I don't eat</v>

2795
02:06:34.591 --> 02:06:37.400
<v Speaker 2>meat or I don't eat meat product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my dogs I'm like,</v>

2796
02:06:37.401 --> 02:06:40.230
<v Speaker 2>cats do because like why am I going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide?</v>

2797
02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel guilty if I eat steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my fucking dog doesn't care my dog.</v>

2798
02:06:45.811 --> 02:06:48.570
<v Speaker 2>If I left my dog out of the house </v>
<v Speaker 2>without me,</v>

2799
02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 2>he'd fucking kill everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why am I going to be like,</v>

2800
02:06:51.841 --> 02:06:53.040
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no young man.</v>

2801
02:06:53.041 --> 02:06:53.874
<v Speaker 2>You're going to eat carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know dogs can be vegan without </v>

2802
02:06:56.761 --> 02:07:01.761
<v Speaker 2>swallowing hina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but cats can't die like in a month and a</v>

2803
02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:02.551
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2804
02:07:02.551 --> 02:07:03.384
<v Speaker 2>That's why I wrote that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't even know that people were </v>

2805
02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:07.890
<v Speaker 2>that stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they.</v>

2806
02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:11.400
<v Speaker 2>They made their cats Vegan and then just</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the pictures,</v>

2807
02:07:12.210 --> 02:07:15.720
<v Speaker 2>there's something weird that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all vegetarian and Vegans,</v>

2808
02:07:15.721 --> 02:07:18.450
<v Speaker 2>if you look at animal cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always sad.</v>

2809
02:07:18.690 --> 02:07:21.870
<v Speaker 2>But when I was looking at Vegan cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made me laugh.</v>

2810
02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2811
02:07:23.251 --> 02:07:24.084
<v Speaker 2>It's so ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so stupid because it's such a fucking </v>

2812
02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:28.313
<v Speaker 2>glaringly ridiculous proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decide that a cat is no longer a </v>

2813
02:07:33.301 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 2>carnivore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all looked freddy mercury</v>

2814
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:37.533
<v Speaker 1>the last month of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Freddy Mercury was the </v>

2815
02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:42.660
<v Speaker 1>last one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Google a Vegan.</v>

2816
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Cats need to see that</v>

2817
02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:47.030
<v Speaker 4>on his deathbed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to see it.</v>

2818
02:07:47.090 --> 02:07:48.020
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2819
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>God Damn you made me feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a good joke.</v>

2820
02:07:52.251 --> 02:07:53.270
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2821
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:54.223
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe there was a real photo </v>

2822
02:07:55.941 --> 02:07:56.774
<v Speaker 1>going around.</v>

2823
02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:57.853
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probably is that I've been through </v>

2824
02:07:59.010 --> 02:08:00.740
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2825
02:08:00.770 --> 02:08:02.060
<v Speaker 4>it's um.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2826
02:08:02.061 --> 02:08:04.040
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

2827
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:08.000
<v Speaker 4>if you can explain your comedy well </v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

2828
02:08:08.001 --> 02:08:10.970
<v Speaker 4>you can still get away with a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just have to,</v>

2829
02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:15.530
<v Speaker 4>you have to take a lot of time to craft </v>
<v Speaker 4>your bits and you gotta think about what</v>

2830
02:08:15.531 --> 02:08:19.490
<v Speaker 4>you're saying and how other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just whether or not it works because</v>

2831
02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:21.950
<v Speaker 4>sometimes things work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're saying things like,</v>

2832
02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:22.813
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could have got away with the same </v>

2833
02:08:23.901 --> 02:08:28.550
<v Speaker 4>exact thought and I would've been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've been in more people's brains.</v>

2834
02:08:28.551 --> 02:08:29.540
<v Speaker 4>It would have gotten in smoother.</v>

2835
02:08:29.970 --> 02:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2836
02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:31.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard a thing,</v>

2837
02:08:32.010 --> 02:08:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I love Norm Mcdonald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2838
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Norm Macdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite comic of all time.</v>

2839
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was going through my thing,</v>

2840
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I saw a thing about him that he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when he was doing weekend update,</v>

2841
02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:44.453
<v Speaker 1>he'd done a joke about someone that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>just died and then he got an email from </v>

2842
02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:48.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2843
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:51.710
<v Speaker 1>the people's family about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was before email.</v>

2844
02:08:51.711 --> 02:08:55.700
<v Speaker 1>So I guess he got a letter of facts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever about the,</v>

2845
02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:57.870
<v Speaker 1>how they felt about that joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

2846
02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>that made me realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

2847
02:08:59.581 --> 02:09:00.414
<v Speaker 1>when I make fun of someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an actual person behind that </v>

2848
02:09:03.661 --> 02:09:04.410
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

2849
02:09:04.410 --> 02:09:05.660
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it,</v>

2850
02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:08.070
<v Speaker 1>it's weird that my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole court thing,</v>

2851
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2852
02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:12.780
<v Speaker 1>like when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was before I went to court,</v>

2853
02:09:12.810 --> 02:09:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I read norms thing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

2854
02:09:15.511 --> 02:09:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I never got that because I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes about this.</v>

2855
02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:19.803
<v Speaker 1>This kid was famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in my mind it was like making fun of </v>

2856
02:09:22.621 --> 02:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Justin Bieber was like making fun of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever,</v>

2857
02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I realized,</v>

2858
02:09:28.230 --> 02:09:29.063
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2859
02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:30.710
<v Speaker 1>there's someone behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2860
02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>someone that feels</v>

2861
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:34.103
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying is exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 4>people experience when they hate on you </v>

2862
02:09:37.051 --> 02:09:37.950
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2863
02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly the same thing.</v>

2864
02:09:41.670 --> 02:09:43.590
<v Speaker 4>They don't think of you as being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person just the same way.</v>

2865
02:09:43.591 --> 02:09:45.330
<v Speaker 4>You don't think of Justin Bieber as </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a person.</v>

2866
02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

2867
02:09:46.650 --> 02:09:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2868
02:09:47.701 --> 02:09:49.350
<v Speaker 4>We're all guilty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2869
02:09:50.250 --> 02:09:51.083
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope ultimately we were going to get </v>

2870
02:09:53.071 --> 02:09:53.904
<v Speaker 4>past this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of what's happening with </v>

2871
02:09:55.591 --> 02:10:00.591
<v Speaker 4>this is that this has only been around </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like 20 years,</v>

2872
02:10:01.530 --> 02:10:05.040
<v Speaker 4>this internet way of communicating with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with each other and only been around the</v>

2873
02:10:05.041 --> 02:10:08.040
<v Speaker 4>way it is really the way it is now for </v>
<v Speaker 4>like less than 10.</v>

2874
02:10:08.070 --> 02:10:09.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2875
02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:12.300
<v Speaker 4>and I think that we don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing with it yet.</v>

2876
02:10:12.330 --> 02:10:14.550
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how to do it yet and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it up.</v>

2877
02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:15.993
<v Speaker 1>And I think too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for comedy for a while when I was </v>

2878
02:10:17.921 --> 02:10:20.520
<v Speaker 1>going through my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is telling me they're like,</v>

2879
02:10:20.530 --> 02:10:23.350
<v Speaker 1>do you think this is the death of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark humor?</v>

2880
02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it is,</v>

2881
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're gonna just be smarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2882
02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:28.660
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get the fuck out of Canada.</v>

2883
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:33.080
<v Speaker 4>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is what everybody always.</v>

2884
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 4>This is the end.</v>

2885
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.330
<v Speaker 2>This is the end of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was one of the things that I</v>

2886
02:10:36.331 --> 02:10:38.990
<v Speaker 2>read about the Nanette special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the end of comedy.</v>

2887
02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:40.133
<v Speaker 2>Like she was gonna kill comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you never going to be at the end </v>

2888
02:10:41.901 --> 02:10:42.830
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so silly.</v>

2889
02:10:42.831 --> 02:10:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Like why would someone not want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh?</v>

2890
02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:47.630
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that it's not a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of art,</v>

2891
02:10:47.850 --> 02:10:48.683
<v Speaker 2>but why would someone not want to laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I then there was another weird thing </v>

2892
02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:52.244
<v Speaker 2>that she got interviewed and she said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she was going to retire unless </v>

2893
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Louis ck comes back and he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes back,</v>

2894
02:10:58.461 --> 02:11:00.230
<v Speaker 2>he comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she realized,</v>

2895
02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:03.600
<v Speaker 2>she said work is not done yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2896
02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's a real quote </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2897
02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:14.450
<v Speaker 2>But she might've been tongue and cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

2898
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:15.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

2899
02:11:15.321 --> 02:11:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say things to.</v>

2900
02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:19.860
<v Speaker 2>And I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might've very well just kidding.</v>

2901
02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:23.240
<v Speaker 2>She might've been joking around like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they might've been laughing,</v>

2902
02:11:23.241 --> 02:11:24.950
<v Speaker 2>she might've been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess my work is not done,</v>

2903
02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:25.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you see it flash in two </v>

2904
02:11:27.141 --> 02:11:27.974
<v Speaker 2>dimensions and who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was angry at her because she </v>

2905
02:11:31.911 --> 02:11:32.744
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said she didn't know who norm </v>

2906
02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2907
02:11:37.130 --> 02:11:39.680
<v Speaker 2>You know who norm Macdonald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she doesn't.</v>

2908
02:11:39.681 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she really isn't in the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's not from around here.</v>

2909
02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:43.533
<v Speaker 2>Even those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people in that country that left </v>

2910
02:11:45.741 --> 02:11:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know who norm McDonald's.</v>

2911
02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's is a fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was on that boat growing coconuts.</v>

2912
02:11:56.570 --> 02:11:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't norms.</v>

2913
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Definitely a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed the.</v>

2914
02:12:00.650 --> 02:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't get a human.</v>

2915
02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:02.313
<v Speaker 4>Must be on the podcast and someone could</v>
<v Speaker 4>put the Kibosh on him talking to people </v>

2916
02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:06.584
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She mentioned Louis C k again and </v>

2917
02:12:08.031 --> 02:12:10.850
<v Speaker 4>possibly that he might mount a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to stop him.</v>

2918
02:12:10.851 --> 02:12:15.390
<v Speaker 4>She said it's worth just to see if he </v>
<v Speaker 4>does have an audience.</v>

2919
02:12:15.391 --> 02:12:17.600
<v Speaker 4>Of course you will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was 18 seconds left.</v>

2920
02:12:17.601 --> 02:12:19.850
<v Speaker 4>The interview tape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't expect to take a turn.</v>

2921
02:12:19.851 --> 02:12:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot Gatsby of course had other ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he does have an audience,</v>

2922
02:12:23.690 --> 02:12:26.390
<v Speaker 4>then I won't be quoting standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot Gatsby said,</v>

2923
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:29.510
<v Speaker 4>quote me on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If Louis ck finds his audience,</v>

2924
02:12:29.511 --> 02:12:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I will definitely not quit standup </v>
<v Speaker 4>because my work here is not done.</v>

2925
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:35.083
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then also,</v>

2926
02:12:35.090 --> 02:12:38.810
<v Speaker 4>could you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say I said that with a cheeky smile.</v>

2927
02:12:38.811 --> 02:12:39.770
<v Speaker 4>She added and left them.</v>

2928
02:12:40.410 --> 02:12:41.243
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she was.</v>

2929
02:12:41.530 --> 02:12:42.363
<v Speaker 2>She was fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does the New York Times still use </v>

2930
02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.770
<v Speaker 2>tape to record?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2931
02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:49.750
<v Speaker 2>but I liked that she said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that I said it with a cheeky smile.</v>

2932
02:12:49.751 --> 02:12:50.584
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a little joke as we suspected she </v>

2933
02:12:53.261 --> 02:12:56.380
<v Speaker 2>was tongue in cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally she sang cheeky smile.</v>

2934
02:12:56.530 --> 02:12:58.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's exactly what tongue and cheek </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

2935
02:12:58.271 --> 02:12:59.530
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2936
02:12:59.650 --> 02:13:00.730
<v Speaker 2>So good for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2937
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:03.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shade do anything wrong.</v>

2938
02:13:03.821 --> 02:13:05.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

2939
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Anything transcribed can look fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her Act,</v>

2940
02:13:08.321 --> 02:13:10.300
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the animosity,</v>

2941
02:13:10.301 --> 02:13:13.750
<v Speaker 2>the fucking tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who cares so unnecessary.</v>

2942
02:13:13.810 --> 02:13:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of friends because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

2943
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:18.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Canadian comics by say by </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that,</v>

2944
02:13:18.461 --> 02:13:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean against her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

2945
02:13:20.291 --> 02:13:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like her animosity towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else,</v>

2946
02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:26.710
<v Speaker 2>a Canadian comics generally they used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come here to the states,</v>

2947
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:31.060
<v Speaker 2>but like 10 years ago they start going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to England or Australia and I,</v>

2948
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:34.200
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Canadian comics that knew her </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

2949
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:37.890
<v Speaker 2>she used to be really funny and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just this show.</v>

2950
02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:38.873
<v Speaker 2>There was like a more serious show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe in the interviews she just </v>

2951
02:13:41.761 --> 02:13:44.310
<v Speaker 2>fucking around pretending like she </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know,</v>

2952
02:13:44.311 --> 02:13:46.360
<v Speaker 2>nor could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what she wants to do now to,</v>

2953
02:13:46.361 --> 02:13:47.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you're really funny for a </v>

2954
02:13:47.941 --> 02:13:48.810
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2955
02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that is something that I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck is her name.</v>

2956
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Someone is doing that now too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just did something where she,</v>

2957
02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:00.360
<v Speaker 2>she did an interview about it</v>

2958
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:03.020
<v Speaker 5>that God dammit fuck is her name.</v>

2959
02:14:06.490 --> 02:14:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I got woken up real early this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm super foggy.</v>

2960
02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:11.460
<v Speaker 2>My kid climbed into bed this morning at </v>
<v Speaker 2>5:00</v>

2961
02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>AM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go back to sleep.</v>

2962
02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:13.930
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2963
02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:14.853
<v Speaker 2>she's a constant.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just have some fun.</v>

3099
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:06.470
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just always loved being.</v>

3100
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:08.660
<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was such a great guy.</v>

3101
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:09.643
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure he's alive if he hears this still </v>

3102
02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.093
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's a great guy and I just enjoyed </v>

3103
02:20:13.941 --> 02:20:16.020
<v Speaker 4>being around him and I was a struggle.</v>

3104
02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:16.893
<v Speaker 4>There was a small room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't have that many seats and he </v>

3105
02:20:19.050 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 4>had two floors in a nice little bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>downstairs and a pool table.</v>

3106
02:20:21.921 --> 02:20:25.130
<v Speaker 4>Then upstairs real intimate room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just a great place.</v>

3107
02:20:25.131 --> 02:20:27.580
<v Speaker 4>And to me it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3108
02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:30.440
<v Speaker 4>that place helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was um,</v>

3109
02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:31.513
<v Speaker 4>in the time when I started doing it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>right when my career went from being </v>

3110
02:20:34.791 --> 02:20:39.791
<v Speaker 4>like a middle act who was kind of going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the road and doing these weird little</v>

3111
02:20:39.981 --> 02:20:42.980
<v Speaker 4>gigs to becoming a headlight or getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>on television.</v>

3112
02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:44.233
<v Speaker 4>All that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it happened while I knew him </v>

3113
02:20:46.791 --> 02:20:47.624
<v Speaker 4>and during that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I've taken quite a few trips up </v>

3114
02:20:50.751 --> 02:20:51.584
<v Speaker 4>to montreal for the comedy festival to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work at jimbos place and she'd go back </v>

3115
02:20:55.311 --> 02:20:56.900
<v Speaker 4>and forth and do a bunch of gigs up </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3116
02:20:57.430 --> 02:21:00.530
<v Speaker 4>It just was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was an important spot for me,</v>

3117
02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:03.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like jimbo was one of those guys that he</v>

3118
02:21:03.051 --> 02:21:04.220
<v Speaker 4>had a real eye for.</v>

3119
02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:05.053
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he booked everyone before they were </v>

3120
02:21:07.971 --> 02:21:10.160
<v Speaker 4>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is for people listening.</v>

3121
02:21:10.310 --> 02:21:13.940
<v Speaker 4>This is like a 85,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 90 seat room,</v>

3122
02:21:13.941 --> 02:21:15.440
<v Speaker 4>like it's super small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3123
02:21:15.441 --> 02:21:16.400
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

3124
02:21:16.401 --> 02:21:20.390
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it stopped 100 maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he could have dumped him in there,</v>

3125
02:21:20.690 --> 02:21:21.830
<v Speaker 4>but he never asked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saw richard?</v>

3126
02:21:21.831 --> 02:21:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Jenny there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3127
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:24.320

<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see jenny there?</v>

3128
02:21:24.490 --> 02:21:28.420
<v Speaker 4>I saw chris rock there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw ray romano there guys.</v>

3129
02:21:28.850 --> 02:21:30.990
<v Speaker 4>I saw chris rock there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3130
02:21:31.430 --> 02:21:35.210
<v Speaker 4>I saw richard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jenny wants just level that place.</v>

3131
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:36.283
<v Speaker 4>It was during a time where I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might've been like four years into </v>

3132
02:21:41.090 --> 02:21:41.970
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

3133
02:21:42.010 --> 02:21:47.000
<v Speaker 4>I was pretty new in the comedy and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>up there with you during the festival.</v>

3134
02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:48.620
<v Speaker 4>You were just there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing the festival.</v>

3135
02:21:48.621 --> 02:21:49.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3136
02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'll add maybe five years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe was five years into comedy and uh,</v>

3137
02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:57.260
<v Speaker 4>richard jenny was a monster man.</v>

3138
02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:58.273
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is the one guy that I just repeat </v>

3139
02:22:00.381 --> 02:22:01.214
<v Speaker 4>this over and over again because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>think people appreciate how fucking </v>

3140
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:07.250
<v Speaker 4>funny he was because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was kind of an odd guy who was just,</v>

3141
02:22:07.350 --> 02:22:10.340
<v Speaker 4>it was hard to find like a category </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you fit it in.</v>

3142
02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:11.593
<v Speaker 4>But he was so fucking funny and he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>lit that place on fire and I remember </v>

3143
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:17.940
<v Speaker 4>leaving his set going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god damn,</v>

3144
02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:22.280
<v Speaker 4>it was terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>

3145
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:23.383
<v Speaker 4>But I absorbed something from it and one</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing was that that guy exhausted </v>

3146
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:28.703
<v Speaker 4>subjects like he would take a premise </v>
<v Speaker 4>and exhausts that premise and smash it </v>

3147
02:22:33.091 --> 02:22:33.924
<v Speaker 4>to the point where when he was on like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this third wave of observation and </v>

3148
02:22:37.381 --> 02:22:38.730
<v Speaker 4>punchlines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would just like,</v>

3149
02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:40.493
<v Speaker 4>you were in awe of the fact that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuing to beat down the subject as </v>

3150
02:22:44.851 --> 02:22:48.810
<v Speaker 4>you were the writing and the punchlines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was also like the mastery,</v>

3151
02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:53.110
<v Speaker 4>his ability just master a premise and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just just,</v>

3152
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:56.580
<v Speaker 4>just dominate all the and take you off </v>
<v Speaker 4>guard,</v>

3153
02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:57.593
<v Speaker 4>catch you off guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you also agreed while he was saying </v>

3154
02:22:59.761 --> 02:23:01.290
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a wizard man.</v>

3155
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:04.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just sweet tight jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3156
02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:06.540
<v Speaker 4>He was so god damn good.</v>

3157
02:23:07.430 --> 02:23:12.230
<v Speaker 1>That's how I am with ralphie may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I remember ralphie up,</v>

3158
02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anyone get laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ralph,</v>

3159
02:23:16.791 --> 02:23:18.330
<v Speaker 1>he got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3160
02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I get a series of shows with them like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year or two before he died.</v>

3161
02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:23.923
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the walls felt like they were fucking </v>

3162
02:23:25.641 --> 02:23:30.290
<v Speaker 1>shaking like I could I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was hosting the show and he was,</v>

3163
02:23:30.291 --> 02:23:33.560
<v Speaker 1>he was closing it and he wasn't supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to close at first.</v>

3164
02:23:33.561 --> 02:23:34.880
<v Speaker 1>But then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

3165
02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:36.820
<v Speaker 1>it was gone too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3166
02:23:36.821 --> 02:23:39.050
<v Speaker 1>they had to make them close closing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

3167
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:40.880
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3257
02:27:15.701 --> 02:27:17.890

3259
02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:22.563
<v Speaker 2>and he's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's kind of what he's </v>

3260
02:27:25.691 --> 02:27:29.260
<v Speaker 2>doing with compound media and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling myself a young comic even though</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a young 45 and I'm going to die in </v>
<v Speaker 2>four months.</v>

3262
02:27:32.141 --> 02:27:32.974

<v Speaker 2>It takes people that are established but</v>

3265
02:27:38.981 --> 02:27:39.814
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said he started doing things </v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>

3269
02:27:49.881 --> 02:27:50.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked me,</v>

3270
02:27:50.681 --> 02:27:51.520
<v Speaker 2>do you want to do this?</v>

3271
02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:54.640
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't want to move to like go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my wife,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like montreal.</v>

3273
02:27:57.330 --> 02:27:58.450

3274
02:27:58.451 --> 02:28:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he was like,</v>

3275
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:02.440
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do the show,</v>

3276
02:28:02.441 --> 02:28:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you can do it from montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus I,</v>

3277
02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you do it?</v>

3278
02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:08.890
<v Speaker 2>How do you have it set up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a studio in a,</v>

3279
02:28:08.891 --> 02:28:09.990
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

3280
02:28:10.390 --> 02:28:13.990
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a park acts which is a neighborhood with</v>

3281
02:28:13.991 --> 02:28:15.970
<v Speaker 2>where he's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell people where you are,</v>

3282
02:28:15.980 --> 02:28:18.740
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to attack us.</v>

3283
02:28:19.330 --> 02:28:23.280
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has a studio and it,</v>

3284
02:28:23.330 --> 02:28:26.120
<v Speaker 2>we do this show every week and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of fun.</v>

3285
02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just do,</v>

3286
02:28:28.970 --> 02:28:30.500
<v Speaker 2>they downloaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you send it,</v>

3287
02:28:30.510 --> 02:28:33.980
<v Speaker 2>upload it to send it to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't stream,</v>

3288
02:28:33.981 --> 02:28:34.950
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

3289
02:28:34.970 --> 02:28:39.970
<v Speaker 2>We were the only show that isn't live </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we never pretended like advantage of</v>

3290
02:28:40.461 --> 02:28:40.880
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3291
02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:45.050
<v Speaker 2>And do like weird splices where you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in time and change clothes.</v>

3292
02:28:45.051 --> 02:28:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Don't say a word about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well fuck is happening here.</v>

3293
02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:48.993
<v Speaker 2>Just change your tee shirt because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just saw this gentlemen just shows 100 </v>

3294
02:28:52.701 --> 02:28:54.710
<v Speaker 2>percent law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be your joke call.</v>

3295
02:28:54.711 --> 02:28:56.360
<v Speaker 2>You should call your show 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

3296
02:28:56.390 --> 02:29:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing that people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>because all of our fans are like old,</v>

3297
02:29:02.061 --> 02:29:03.200
<v Speaker 2>uh oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a fence.</v>

3298
02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:08.150
<v Speaker 2>And I think what people like is our show</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not political at all.</v>

3299
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:09.163
<v Speaker 2>And the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the stuff on competent media </v>

3300
02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:15.300
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is political and like people that,</v>

3301
02:29:15.301 --> 02:29:16.134
<v Speaker 2>like politico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even people that like political stuff </v>

3302
02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:19.850
<v Speaker 2>after awhile they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3303
02:29:19.851 --> 02:29:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

3304
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Hillary's a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we laugh?</v>

3305
02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:25.933
<v Speaker 2>And that is both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The compound media is like very right </v>

3306
02:29:26.961 --> 02:29:27.770
<v Speaker 2>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3307
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:28.603
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any left wing like reno in the </v>

3308
02:29:31.131 --> 02:29:31.964
<v Speaker 2>background?</v>

3309
02:29:32.060 --> 02:29:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should get,</v>

3310
02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:38.980
<v Speaker 2>we should get it like a trends third mic</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold trans show.</v>

3311
02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3312
02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:43.053
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as right wing as people </v>

3313
02:29:44.931 --> 02:29:46.070
<v Speaker 2>think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3314
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you know anthony's right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's intelligent.</v>

3315
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:49.903
<v Speaker 2>He's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensible arguments whether you agree </v>

3316
02:29:51.411 --> 02:29:52.670
<v Speaker 2>with them or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3317
02:29:52.671 --> 02:29:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily right wing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3318
02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.740
<v Speaker 2>I liked talking to him and he's super </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

3319
02:29:57.800 --> 02:29:58.633
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like in 2018 people have </v>

3320
02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:04.880
<v Speaker 2>forgotten like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see this on the right.</v>

3321
02:30:05.050 --> 02:30:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Two people on the left field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit on anthony or people on the right.</v>

3322
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On like a.</v>

3323
02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I like comics and I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>

3324
02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:16.520
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even if that's not how you think.</v>

3325
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:17.470
<v Speaker 2>That's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3326
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Like sarah silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people on the right.</v>

3327
02:30:20.601 --> 02:30:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Shit on sarah silverman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah silverman is fucking funny.</v>

3328
02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:24.590
<v Speaker 2>She's hilarious.</v>

3329
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Common.</v>

3330
02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:29.120
<v Speaker 2>But you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only with their shitting on.</v>

3331
02:30:29.121 --> 02:30:32.120
<v Speaker 2>There's only her political opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3332
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:34.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a nonsense war to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3333
02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:36.920
<v Speaker 2>do you do what do you want everybody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think to what you think,</v>

3334
02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:38.750
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3335
02:30:38.751 --> 02:30:40.160
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to what we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

3336
02:30:40.161 --> 02:30:43.400
<v Speaker 2>people just get on these teams and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to hate everybody's on the team and</v>

3337
02:30:43.430 --> 02:30:45.410
<v Speaker 2>she's on team left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fuck that bitch.</v>

3338
02:30:45.730 --> 02:30:46.563
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the why we got to the </v>

3339
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:49.363
<v Speaker 2>top of the food chain that we grew up </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and a operation and then we </v>

3340
02:30:54.231 --> 02:30:54.891
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3341
02:30:54.891 --> 02:30:57.380
<v Speaker 2>well it's us versus them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to win.</v>

3342
02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

3343
02:30:59.120 --> 02:30:59.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm william von hippel guy was on my </v>

3344
02:31:01.311 --> 02:31:03.920
<v Speaker 2>show last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book called the social leap.</v>

3345
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to that episode,</v>

3346
02:31:05.581 --> 02:31:06.414
<v Speaker 2>but the book is essentially all about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how human beings really succeeded by </v>

3347
02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:14.630
<v Speaker 2>figuring out once we were some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird primate thing that was close to us</v>

3348
02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:18.550
<v Speaker 2>by banding together and working in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperation and that,</v>

3349
02:31:18.551 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forming teams and</v>

3350
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:22.710
<v Speaker 4>loyalty to the teams always rewarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3351
02:31:22.711 --> 02:31:26.310
<v Speaker 4>this is what you're seeing in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should see in social circles.</v>

3352
02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Even when you know with these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>auntie for people and,</v>

3353
02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:32.790
<v Speaker 4>and proud boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all the same thing.</v>

3354
02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:33.653
<v Speaker 4>It's just tribal behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're seeing tribal behavior on the </v>

3355
02:31:35.941 --> 02:31:36.774
<v Speaker 4>right from the proud boys tribal </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior on the left from antifa and </v>

3356
02:31:39.781 --> 02:31:42.580
<v Speaker 4>everybody else is the enemy and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>lash out and you know,</v>

3357
02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:43.433
<v Speaker 4>most of it is just completely misguided.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of all the aggression and the </v>

3358
02:31:47.041 --> 02:31:47.874
<v Speaker 4>violence and the hate is so stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so misguided and counterproductive and </v>

3359
02:31:51.871 --> 02:31:52.704
<v Speaker 4>even though they think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because in the moment it's such an </v>

3360
02:31:53.881 --> 02:31:56.370
<v Speaker 4>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>childish thing to do with a lash out and</v>

3361
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:59.370
<v Speaker 4>hit someone with a bike lock or punch </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone sucker punch them,</v>

3362
02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:03.780
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you're doing is feeding this fucking</v>

3363
02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:06.000
<v Speaker 4>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never going to run out of fuel.</v>

3364
02:32:06.001 --> 02:32:08.970
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to keep chewing up our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our culture.</v>

3365
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:11.140
<v Speaker 4>It's going to just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your,</v>

3366
02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:13.330
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to end it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to.</v>

3367
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:16.350
<v Speaker 4>If you start punching people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it keeps it.</v>

3368
02:32:16.351 --> 02:32:18.350
<v Speaker 4>You're feeding the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3369
02:32:18.510 --> 02:32:19.343
<v Speaker 4>they're going to punch back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going just going to punch </v>

3370
02:32:20.701 --> 02:32:21.750
<v Speaker 4>back when they're going to kill you.</v>

3371
02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:24.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a lot of shows for,</v>

3372
02:32:25.010 --> 02:32:25.671
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>

3373
02:32:25.671 --> 02:32:26.504
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3374
02:32:26.690 --> 02:32:29.450
<v Speaker 1>the people that liked me are generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

3375
02:32:29.690 --> 02:32:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Like most of my fans are more men than </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

3376
02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I do corporate gigs,</v>

3377
02:32:35.271 --> 02:32:40.271
<v Speaker 1>the only corporate gigs I'd ever do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're shows for military police officers</v>

3378
02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>or the hell's angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now every time.</v>

3379
02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:44.293
<v Speaker 1>And the thing I realize is when you talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a group of cops or you talk to a </v>

3380
02:32:48.951 --> 02:32:52.070
<v Speaker 1>group of hell's angels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same fucking guys,</v>

3381
02:32:52.330 --> 02:32:53.163
<v Speaker 1>the same guys because they got the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact fucking mentality through their </v>

3382
02:32:56.390 --> 02:32:58.310
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys that are like,</v>

3383
02:32:58.430 --> 02:33:00.020
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's us versus them.</v>

3384

<v Speaker 1>We do this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're going in there and only difference</v>

02:33:20.721 --> 02:33:25.721
<v Speaker 1>about 15 years ago back home I did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke about it.</v>

3395
02:33:25.890 --> 02:33:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I did a joke on one of the galleries </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3396
02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:32.660
<v Speaker 1>for the festival and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reporter talk shit about me.</v>

3397
02:33:32.770 --> 02:33:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a joke.</v>

3398
02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:37.180
<v Speaker 1>All my jokes are about little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was.</v>

3399
02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:39.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a joke.</v>

3400
02:33:39.081 --> 02:33:44.081
<v Speaker 1>I done a joke that I mentioned a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl that got kidnapped in my joke.</v>

3401
02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:49.130
<v Speaker 1>And the joke is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3402
02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you always make me feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give up comedy.</v>

3403
02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I fucking went out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe rogan to give up comedy.</v>

3404
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:58.790
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should commit suicide.</v>

3405
02:33:58.870 --> 02:34:01.340

<v Speaker 1>girl victim.</v>

3406
02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead a jump because it'd be a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vet the little girl,</v>

3407
02:34:05.930 --> 02:34:06.763
<v Speaker 1>but it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the joke is going to suck now </v>

3408
02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:10.590
<v Speaker 1>because it wouldn't have to explain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

3409
02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:13.880
<v Speaker 1>but it was a because I owed money to the</v>

<v Speaker 1>the irs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you owed them $8,</v>

3414
02:34:25.421 --> 02:34:27.550
<v Speaker 1>they're going to kidnap your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the one that,</v>

3415
02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:29.500
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that have blah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>got good reviews.</v>

3420
02:34:40.061 --> 02:34:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Everything was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like three weeks later,</v>

3421
02:34:43.091 --> 02:34:45.430
<v Speaker 1>this reporter guy writes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3422
02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:49.300
<v Speaker 1>an article about how the audience was </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked and offended.</v>

3423
02:34:49.330 --> 02:34:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were shocked and offended.</v>

3424
02:34:51.431 --> 02:34:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I got a standing ovation and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked and offended.</v>

3425
02:34:54.820 --> 02:34:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And then there was this a french </v>
<v Speaker 1>canadian guy that's like a,</v>

3426
02:34:58.510 --> 02:35:02.110
<v Speaker 1>like a Larry King type guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started his show.</v>

3427
02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:04.990
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Ward made fun of this little girl,</v>

3428
02:35:05.170 --> 02:35:08.950
<v Speaker 1>let's call her grandfather to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks about that joke.</v>

3429
02:35:08.951 --> 02:35:11.080
<v Speaker 1>So he called the grandfather during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

3430
02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:14.410
<v Speaker 1>during the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't tell the guy who's so.</v>

3431
02:35:14.411 --> 02:35:15.071
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3432
02:35:15.071 --> 02:35:16.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know Mike Ward?</v>

3433
02:35:16.261 --> 02:35:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what do you think about that?</v>

3437
02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:25.691
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then people lost and then people </v>

3440
02:35:32.051 --> 02:35:34.060
<v Speaker 1>were calling in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go like a fucking asshole.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What a piece of garbage and then people.</v>

3442
02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>So you've got an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People lost that.</v>

3443
02:35:38.011 --> 02:35:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I like make them fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little kids,</v>

3444
02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:41.163
<v Speaker 1>people lost their fucking minds and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were sending messages to my </v>

3445
02:35:45.071 --> 02:35:47.980
<v Speaker 1>manager that they knew where I lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to murder me.</v>

3446
02:35:48.310 --> 02:35:51.160
<v Speaker 1>And then I look outside the house and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager calls me.</v>

3447
02:35:51.161 --> 02:35:51.994
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people that are going to kill </v>

3448
02:35:52.991 --> 02:35:53.471
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3449
02:35:53.471 --> 02:35:55.270
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at my house.</v>

3450
02:35:55.450 --> 02:35:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I see fucking people lined up outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my house.</v>

3451
02:35:58.001 --> 02:35:58.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

3452
02:35:58.691 --> 02:35:59.524
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But lIke I was looking at them and they </v>

3453
02:36:02.111 --> 02:36:05.320
<v Speaker 1>weren't attacking the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just like in front of my house</v>

3454
02:36:05.321 --> 02:36:08.740
<v Speaker 1>looking at my house and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a brave dude.</v>

3455
02:36:08.741 --> 02:36:09.574
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3456
02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:12.040
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not fucking you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know how to fight.</v>

3457
02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:13.053
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

3458
02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to go talk to them to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

3459
02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:15.993
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's up.</v>

3460
02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:20.740
<v Speaker 1>So I went out and then they acted like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just regular guys just hanging</v>

3461
02:36:20.741 --> 02:36:22.270
<v Speaker 1>out outside my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3462
02:36:22.330 --> 02:36:23.163
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found out like two or three </v>

3463
02:36:25.031 --> 02:36:25.864
<v Speaker 1>years ago that I had done a couple shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>for hell's angels and the hell's angels </v>

3464
02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:34.440
<v Speaker 1>had parked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told their dudes like Mike Ward,</v>

3465
02:36:34.691 --> 02:36:36.370
<v Speaker 1>there are people that want to kill Mike </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ward.</v>

3466
02:36:36.371 --> 02:36:37.204
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so watch the people that want to kill </v>

3467
02:36:38.861 --> 02:36:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Mike Ward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the with the hell's angels,</v>

3468
02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:46.090
<v Speaker 1>like on my house is in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street people,</v>

3469
02:36:46.091 --> 02:36:46.924
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the street and on each</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner that were hell's angels watching </v>

3470
02:36:49.811 --> 02:36:51.550
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3471
02:36:51.551 --> 02:36:56.020
<v Speaker 1>fuck the hell's angels protected me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wacky.</v>

3472
02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of hell's angels are probably good</v>

3473
02:36:58.601 --> 02:36:59.960
<v Speaker 1>guys there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3474
02:36:59.970 --> 02:37:00.803
<v Speaker 1>you're saying they're probably the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the guys with the crops gang if you </v>

3475
02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:06.310
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the same with mafia guys.</v>

3476
02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:10.150
<v Speaker 1>If you don't owe them money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good guys.</v>

3477
02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:15.240
<v Speaker 1>They're good guys here with a message </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your business that's like,</v>

3478
02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:18.470
<v Speaker 2>they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whenever,</v>

3479
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:22.670
<v Speaker 2>whenever I meet anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the mafia or whatever,</v>

3480
02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't seem like he's in the mafia</v>

3481
02:37:24.941 --> 02:37:27.710
<v Speaker 2>is a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't own like $19,000.</v>

3482
02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3483
02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:29.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well i'M sure a lot of organized crime </v>

3484
02:37:31.311 --> 02:37:34.430
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of organized business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably behave pretty similar.</v>

3485
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a business.</v>

3486
02:37:35.930 --> 02:37:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Things they can get away with and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can't.</v>

3487
02:37:37.671 --> 02:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

3488
02:37:38.310 --> 02:37:41.390
<v Speaker 2>If you just go around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go around breaking legs and killing pill</v>

3489
02:37:41.391 --> 02:37:44.730
<v Speaker 2>you then they'll kill your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn business.</v>

3490
02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn goddamn goddamn business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright gents.</v>

3491
02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Let's wrap this pitch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing this forever.</v>

3492
02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3493
02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:54.283
<v Speaker 2>when do you think this thing's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get resolved with the thing that's </v>

3494
02:37:56.841 --> 02:37:58.550
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I went to court,</v>

3495
02:37:58.551 --> 02:37:59.384
<v Speaker 2>this have fucking stupid I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it'd be like oj that at the </v>

3496
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:03.783
<v Speaker 2>end of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my trial they'd be like case stand up </v>

3497
02:38:05.541 --> 02:38:07.250
<v Speaker 2>and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we vote for you.</v>

3498
02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:12.050
<v Speaker 2>But in Canada they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get the verdict like for six or eight</v>

3499
02:38:12.051 --> 02:38:15.560
<v Speaker 2>months later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going back to court early january</v>

3500
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:18.890
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll probably get the verdict </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a year or two.</v>

3501
02:38:19.660 --> 02:38:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really like I'm going to be 97</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the timE I get the money is just cost</v>

3502
02:38:26.181 --> 02:38:28.310
<v Speaker 2>costing you so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to cost me like,</v>

3503
02:38:28.390 --> 02:38:29.223
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bruce from the like it's going to cost </v>

3504
02:38:32.481 --> 02:38:33.314
<v Speaker 2>probably 200,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>210 and this is the thing I want to </v>

3505
02:38:36.411 --> 02:38:39.140
<v Speaker 2>start a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just paid off 20.</v>

3506
02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:40.243
<v Speaker 2>I could have paid off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have paid off 10 times if I </v>

3507
02:38:42.351 --> 02:38:44.090
<v Speaker 2>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>

3508
02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:47.360
<v Speaker 2>what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really lucky that a,</v>

3509
02:38:47.361 --> 02:38:49.910
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a guy that always sees the glass</v>
<v Speaker 2>half full,</v>

3510
02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:51.590
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3511
02:38:51.730 --> 02:38:55.550
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky that I had the money to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because if I was a guy,</v>

3512
02:38:55.551 --> 02:38:56.384
<v Speaker 2>like there was three or four years into </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy and someone sent me a letter to </v>

3513
02:39:00.111 --> 02:39:00.591
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3514
02:39:00.591 --> 02:39:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you owe 80.</v>

3515
02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I would have fucking either committed </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide,</v>

3516
02:39:03.801 --> 02:39:07.100
<v Speaker 2>quit comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or four years into comedy you'd probably</v>

3517
02:39:07.101 --> 02:39:10.250
<v Speaker 2>be more inclined to say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate because you thought it was</v>

3518
02:39:10.251 --> 02:39:11.001
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3519
02:39:11.001 --> 02:39:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it'd be shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3520
02:39:12.290 --> 02:39:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you get rewarded what,</v>

3521
02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:18.140
<v Speaker 2>especially when you do open mic nights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're just starting out,</v>

3522
02:39:18.170 --> 02:39:22.130
<v Speaker 2>you get rewarded in taking chances that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't necessarily Funny,</v>

3523
02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:23.450
<v Speaker 2>but there are shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3524
02:39:23.451 --> 02:39:27.280
<v Speaker 2>You're risky because it might be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best reaction of your set.</v>

3525
02:39:27.281 --> 02:39:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might not even be necessarily good,</v>

3526
02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:30.973
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best reaction of your set </v>
<v Speaker 2>because frankly your set is mostly dog </v>

3527
02:39:34.461 --> 02:39:36.920
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when you're two or three years in.</v>

3528
02:39:36.980 --> 02:39:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3529
02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:38.953
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that gets on the internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>some three year old comic is barely </v>

3530
02:39:43.730 --> 02:39:44.563
<v Speaker 2>stage legs under him dropping bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just saying something stupid that you </v>

3531
02:39:48.021 --> 02:39:49.760
<v Speaker 2>think you're going to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3532
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to start a thing though.</v>

3533
02:39:51.741 --> 02:39:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I haven't started yet because I was gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the depression.</v>

3534
02:39:54.441 --> 02:39:55.274
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about this for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now since I'm not in my depression </v>

3535
02:39:57.770 --> 02:40:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start a fund for whoever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next guy or next girl,</v>

3536
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:06.080
<v Speaker 2>next woman is going to go broke so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be a storm of them.</v>

3537
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:08.480
<v Speaker 2>But I think because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because uh,</v>

3538
02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:09.373
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was lucky I think of myself as </v>

3539
02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:14.220
<v Speaker 2>lucky for real cause like I don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot</v>

3540
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:15.053
<v Speaker 1>of money but I had enough money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend myself and I didn't even have to </v>

3541
02:40:18.841 --> 02:40:19.910
<v Speaker 1>go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3542
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:23.070
<v Speaker 1>fuck it in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your profile to help you.</v>

3543
02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It would have helped me if I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend all my days in the bathtub crying,</v>

3544
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:29.520
<v Speaker 1>drinking wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3545
02:40:29.550 --> 02:40:31.680
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had used this,</v>

3546
02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I could've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could've.</v>

3547
02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would have become like</v>
<v Speaker 1>super famous,</v>

3548
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:37.410
<v Speaker 1>but I could have used this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

3549
02:40:37.470 --> 02:40:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to use this.</v>

3550
02:40:38.761 --> 02:40:39.594
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be the guy that made </v>

3551
02:40:42.151 --> 02:40:43.650
<v Speaker 1>fun of disabled children</v>

3552
02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:45.450
<v Speaker 4>too late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3553
02:40:47.530 --> 02:40:48.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>

3554
02:40:48.461 --> 02:40:49.294
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3555
02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a real noble idea to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3556
02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:52.273
<v Speaker 4>to start a fund for the next guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially because Canada has such a </v>

3557
02:40:55.601 --> 02:40:57.710
<v Speaker 4>wonky system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada,</v>

3558
02:40:57.711 --> 02:40:59.260
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're basically conneCted.</v>

3559
02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:01.420
<v Speaker 4>We're all together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were.</v>

3560
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:04.300
<v Speaker 4>You guys were right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3561
02:41:05.610 --> 02:41:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Basically Vermont with crazy last 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights commissions because there's</v>

3562
02:41:11.701 --> 02:41:12.534
<v Speaker 1>the canadian human rights commission and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every canadian province has their human </v>

3563
02:41:16.201 --> 02:41:20.340
<v Speaker 1>rights commission and there in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 12 human rights commission,</v>

3564
02:41:20.341 --> 02:41:21.174
<v Speaker 1>so there's the one at the hague that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they go after evil war criminals and </v>

3565
02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:25.794
<v Speaker 1>shit and then they're a leaven in Canada</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go after open milkers and Jordan </v>

3566
02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Peterson and they go after me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3567
02:41:32.220 --> 02:41:33.053
<v Speaker 4>thiS is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can make comparisons to what they're </v>

3568
02:41:35.521 --> 02:41:36.354
<v Speaker 4>doing with free speech to what we deem </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be the real issues with controlling </v>

3569
02:41:40.501 --> 02:41:43.230
<v Speaker 4>free speech on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's real similarities.</v>

3570
02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:46.260
<v Speaker 4>I think having these human rights </v>
<v Speaker 4>councils,</v>

3571
02:41:46.470 --> 02:41:47.303
<v Speaker 4>committees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people getting together and decide and </v>

3572
02:41:48.631 --> 02:41:51.900
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to come off callous or </v>
<v Speaker 4>ruthless or you know,</v>

3573
02:41:51.901 --> 02:41:54.750
<v Speaker 4>and so they can decide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's gone too far.</v>

3574
02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:57.360
<v Speaker 4>This is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be able to say that.</v>

3575
02:41:57.750 --> 02:42:00.780
<v Speaker 4>That is the number one problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlling free speech.</v>

3576
02:42:00.890 --> 02:42:01.723
<v Speaker 4>Like you should be able to say whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want and then if people don't like </v>

3577
02:42:04.021 --> 02:42:04.854
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they'll watch you or they don't go </v>

3578
02:42:06.361 --> 02:42:09.510
<v Speaker 4>see you and you let the free market </v>
<v Speaker 4>decide.</v>

3579
02:42:09.790 --> 02:42:13.170
<v Speaker 4>It's not about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about inciting,</v>

3580
02:42:13.171 --> 02:42:15.330
<v Speaker 4>hey are saying you should go kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3581
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:16.343
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a problem with with gavin was gavin </v>

3582
02:42:18.781 --> 02:42:20.400
<v Speaker 4>was actually saying punch them.</v>

3583
02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:21.713
<v Speaker 4>Hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking crazy because he's not </v>

3584
02:42:23.401 --> 02:42:25.680
<v Speaker 4>used to being punched and hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

3585
02:42:25.890 --> 02:42:26.723
<v Speaker 4>People that are around violence a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't just willy nilly advocate </v>

3586
02:42:30.901 --> 02:42:32.310
<v Speaker 4>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3587
02:42:32.311 --> 02:42:33.144
<v Speaker 4>and I think he realizes that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>why he stepped down from this whole </v>

3588
02:42:35.731 --> 02:42:37.580
<v Speaker 4>thing now because he realizes like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3589
02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:38.773
<v Speaker 4>it's probably hard to see how you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceived when you're in that fucking </v>

3590
02:42:42.391 --> 02:42:46.710
<v Speaker 4>polarizing a position as he is that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just was at one point in time.</v>

3591
02:42:46.711 --> 02:42:48.240
<v Speaker 4>The guy who was one of the cofounders </v>
<v Speaker 4>advice.</v>

3592
02:42:48.450 --> 02:42:51.380
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting provocate tour guys.</v>

3593
02:42:51.390 --> 02:42:53.610
<v Speaker 4>Very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy talking to him,</v>

3594
02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:56.340
<v Speaker 4>to this guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3595
02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:58.440
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the leader of a hate group.</v>

3596
02:42:58.441 --> 02:43:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit sticks to you man.</v>

3597
02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's.</v>

3598
02:43:01.850 --> 02:43:04.290
<v Speaker 4>It sticks to you like crazy glue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3599
02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:08.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't always going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think what we were saying earlier,</v>

3600
02:43:08.871 --> 02:43:11.950
<v Speaker 4>it's like that perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sometimes</v>

3601
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:12.843
<v Speaker 1>almost as important as reality and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your case may prove to be until wore </v>

3602
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:17.583
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3603
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:18.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now I'm it people forgotten and </v>

3604
02:43:22.061 --> 02:43:23.980
<v Speaker 1>people see the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3605
02:43:24.130 --> 02:43:26.740
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were starting out the podcast,</v>

3606
02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:30.940
<v Speaker 1>the thing that kind of pissed me off is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in America,</v>

3607
02:43:30.941 --> 02:43:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in quebec,</v>

3608
02:43:32.621 --> 02:43:36.600
<v Speaker 1>which is french Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they saw me as a guy that that would.</v>

3609
02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I do jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

3610
02:43:38.411 --> 02:43:39.244
<v Speaker 1>I'm offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking dirty comic and I do what </v>

3611
02:43:41.741 --> 02:43:42.574
<v Speaker 1>I do and I think I do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People enjoy that kind of comedy and </v>

3612
02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:47.220
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They enjoyed gangster rap the same way.</v>

3613
02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:48.063
<v Speaker 1>They enjoy violent movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like some shitty like fucking </v>

3614
02:43:52.091 --> 02:43:55.390
<v Speaker 1>open mike are doing rape jokes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work.</v>

3615
02:43:55.540 --> 02:43:57.520
<v Speaker 1>If I do rape jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my rape jokes,</v>

3616
02:43:57.550 --> 02:43:59.710
<v Speaker 1>fucking murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape jokes,</v>

3617
02:43:59.711 --> 02:44:03.940
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've won like fucking 15 awards.</v>

3618
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Every rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape joke of the year award,</v>

3619
02:44:09.570 --> 02:44:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>

3620
02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:14.980
<v Speaker 1>people like a lot of the media instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of going,</v>

3621
02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:15.993
<v Speaker 1>there's something weird about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government because the government </v>

3622
02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:22.630
<v Speaker 1>judging my case is exactly like judging </v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie.</v>

3623
02:44:22.690 --> 02:44:23.523
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying fucking why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they driving so fast and fast </v>

3624
02:44:27.221 --> 02:44:32.140
<v Speaker 1>and the furious why they forgot that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do,</v>

3625
02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:35.140
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't like what I do is art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3626
02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:38.140
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not think standup is art,</v>

3627
02:44:38.141 --> 02:44:40.060
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking expression.</v>

3628
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.983
<v Speaker 1>And I were talking about this earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it just seems too much like you're </v>

3629
02:44:43.001 --> 02:44:45.640
<v Speaker 1>just talking cause cause here's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3630
02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you see a comic that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

3631
02:44:48.790 --> 02:44:51.760
<v Speaker 1>it looks easy and when it looks easy it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like they just,</v>

3632
02:44:51.761 --> 02:44:53.920
<v Speaker 1>it's off the top of their head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they think.</v>

3633
02:44:54.130 --> 02:44:54.963
<v Speaker 1>And that's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was jim jefferies that said </v>

3634
02:44:56.711 --> 02:44:57.544
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he said there are things that I </v>

3635
02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:05.590
<v Speaker 1>think and there what I sound stage or </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I think are funny and that's</v>

3636
02:45:05.591 --> 02:45:07.460
<v Speaker 1>what we do on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it.</v>

3637
02:45:07.470 --> 02:45:09.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not a check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was me too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
