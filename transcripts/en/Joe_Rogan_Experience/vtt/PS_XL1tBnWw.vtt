<v Speaker 1>Mr Rogers.</v>

11
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bob Ross Estate.</v>

12
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Over the age of 19 dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what's confusing what most</v>

13
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.890
<v Speaker 1>of what you guys do in terms of like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Ross thing in particular.</v>

14
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>First of all that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took a lot of balls because this is</v>

15
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had Bob Ross Painting Muhammad,</v>

16
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>which is a period blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second one because they,</v>

17
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>the buzzfeed women were doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting.</v>

18
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 1>It was youtube actually after meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Youtube.</v>

19
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Remember how you can top something</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we'll,</v>

20
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll pull this sucker right up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

21
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like an additional seven and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our student,</v>

22
00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were Bob Ross estate got after you.</v>

24
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.150
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's parody.</v>

25
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>How can they mock you or how can they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get you in trouble for mocking something</v>

26
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>or doing parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>

27
00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>You have a system with youtube right</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they just strike,</v>

28
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>they strike you and you lose your</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileges whether you win or not.</v>

29
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>We've never lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Bob Ross,</v>

30
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>the state sent us a message right into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like first off,</v>

31
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>have you no decency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>this isn't in accordance with Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Laughing our asses off onto this lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're supposed to be in accordance</v>

34
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>with Islamic law when I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they thought that we didn't know</v>

35
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:20.411
<v Speaker 1>that it was a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:25.411
<v Speaker 1>they thought we didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We stumbled across this and so then we</v>

37
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>bonded to the lawyers as Bob Ross would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have on let's say,</v>

38
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>welcome back to the joy of painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to draw her lawyer friends</v>

39
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>eating from a nice big pile of shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we painted them eating from a pile of</v>

40
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 1>corn infested shit and then at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the video and it looks like they need</v>

41
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>a friend and put Muhammad right next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in the pile and it hangs above our</v>

42
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>bathroom and we never heard from them</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

43
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>They sent a cease and desist and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ran it past her lawyer.</v>

44
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Shocking me have killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we have Mr Rogers now.</v>

46
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>What is Mr Rogers mad about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a parody.</v>

47
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>We did a few parodies of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>won't you be my neighbor intros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it like a year ago.</v>

49
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

50
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.790
<v Speaker 1>how could someone put a strike on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a parody?</v>

51
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that is protected.</v>

52
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you get to the realm of parody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>satire and it's.</v>

54
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.450
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even then it depends on who looks at</v>

55
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with Youtube,</v>

56
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just someone.</v>

57
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Last time we got her privileges back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time we didn't like.</v>

58
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.121
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

59
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 1>we've never lost a case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've countered filed.</v>

60
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.320
<v Speaker 1>We've always won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is clearly parody.</v>

61
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>The Mr Rogers was actually your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to track each like their,</v>

62
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their logos there.</v>

63
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.760

<v Speaker 1>Nothing humps aboriginal.</v>

64
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

65
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is demonetized and what's not</v>

68
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>demonetized and they had something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They favor the whole thing but you up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Was it summer</v>

84
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>six monitor half Asian lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill came with us and they didn't know.</v>

85
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>We just were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

86
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.210
<v Speaker 1>he's a producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came out and read the sitting there</v>

87
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>right next to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing voted number one lawyer</v>

88
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>in the state and a hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny guy.</v>

89
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>So we go out there and we're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there kind of listening and</v>

90
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>they're just saying nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally I said,</v>

91
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's happening with</v>

92
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>demonetization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening with.</v>

93
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we're all conservatives here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

94
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>We've had our videos put in restricted</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode.</v>

95
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>What are the guidelines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know and they wouldn't.</v>

96
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question.</v>

97
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at the back because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was later in the day elephant in the</v>

98
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 1>room as if it wasn't obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

99
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why everyone's there and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>

100
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.560
<v Speaker 1>That's was the period blood spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

101
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>things that are hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that could be offensive,</v>

103
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.160
<v Speaker 1>things like current events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be controversial and so</v>

104
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>everyone's sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

105
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>but I just said where I said what about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about buzz?</v>

106
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.830
<v Speaker 1>People have been painting in period</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and the trending feed painting in</v>

107
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>last week and viscously chunky period</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead on the home feed that's on youtube</v>

108
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:09.191
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about that?</v>

109
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Is that considered like child friendly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conservatives were.</v>

110
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Then they're looking back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

111
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were ruining the movie.</v>

112
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we here?</v>

113
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

114
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>People don't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that is a very valid discussion.</v>

115
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>That's valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you can't have been.</v>

116
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>If you can paint in period blood and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think you should be restricted.</v>

117
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I think if you want a pain period blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as I know what you're doing.</v>

118
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 1>It says painting a period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.350
<v Speaker 1>the title it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an adult.</v>

120
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might actually watch it,</v>

121
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These women,</v>

122
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might just for this to boldly channel,</v>

123
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but the porn is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I don't want to take that</v>

124
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>right away from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just.</v>

125
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused by what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

126
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not okay?</v>

127
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They embolden the right.</v>

128
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>If you silence them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you embolden the left.</v>

129
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>If you silence bold people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say you,</v>

130
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.830
<v Speaker 1>you give them power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

131
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make the whole thing bigger than it</v>

132
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are allowed to have differences</v>

133
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>of opinions and they're allowed to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ideologies,</v>

134
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.070
<v Speaker 1>but when you have a platform where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically restrict one ideology and you</v>

135
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:16.130
<v Speaker 1>openly support another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're picking aside what's kind of like</v>

136
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.100
<v Speaker 1>dinesh d'souza talks about.</v>

137
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the law is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is is it applied equally?</v>

138
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube doesn't even respect the laws.</v>

139
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Here's something can happen with</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

140
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Just to give an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to a lot.</v>

141
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no single party consent.</v>

142
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>State two party consent state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California is one of the few states</v>

143
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>where you have both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have to know they're on camera.</v>

144
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even sometimes in a two party consent</v>

145
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reasonable expectation of</v>

146
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>privacy if you're at a public event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

147
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're a public protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say,</v>

148
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't take my picture.</v>

149
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>You're there publicly protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are legal layers,</v>

150
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had someone in a single party consent</v>

151
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>state in Michigan on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a public protest sign,</v>

152
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 1>a release to give an interview and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>complained to Youtube and said,</v>

153
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be in that video.</v>

154
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter that we presented the</v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

155
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>the paperwork to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was taken out.</v>

156
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>We had to blur the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did they look bad?</v>

157
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it under false pretenses?</v>

158
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Like did they think that you were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing and then you're really doing</v>

159
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>something else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the crazy thing is this actually was</v>

160
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>a guy who agreed with them almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

161
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about that last minute.</v>

162
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.520
<v Speaker 1>He was really pissed about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

163
00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably just got a lot of feedback</v>

164
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:17.051
<v Speaker 1>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

165
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 1>this is freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get out of this.</v>

166
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a content creator,</v>

167
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

168
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>

169
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

170
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>you can understand like his perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like him trying to get it taken down.</v>

171
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're a general public person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck you're</v>

172
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.500
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say something,</v>

173
00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't put it on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized later he was raped.</v>

174
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It was much later taken down.</v>

175
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

176
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you pointed out the whole period</v>

177
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>blood thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting and period blood,</v>

178
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Silence.</v>

179
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.800
<v Speaker 1>No one said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't respond to you.</v>

180
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>And then leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

181
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to that later in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So later in the day was when they came</v>

182
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>up with this next Gen news and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

183
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it got to a point where I was hissing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

184
00:06:59.311 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Explain this because you explained it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me earlier.</v>

185
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.220
<v Speaker 1>The problem is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

186
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I have to be careful because otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take it out of context.</v>

187
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So then this is the newest portion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>

188
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.910
<v Speaker 1>this whole Youtube conference bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>out conservatives and you know that the</v>

189
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>salmon a plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think there's anything</v>

190
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.780
<v Speaker 1>gross or he was eating pasted fish in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

191
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>No way here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was quick and delicious.</v>

192
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 1>So I think it was a next gen news for</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

193
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I always get it wrong or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>

194
00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:22.900
<v Speaker 1>is the opposite side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's next year we'll go next to</v>

195
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>the lawyers would completely advocate</v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

196
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>We're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're giving such specificity.</v>

197
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 1>So this is the exact channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like hip hop and sneakers,</v>

198
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 1>sneaker hall with whatever the guy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

199
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 1>blackish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthony,</v>

200
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of stuff.</v>

201
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot of hip hop news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they come out to teach us how to do</v>

202
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.510
<v Speaker 1>news and they will sell before we show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>so and so from extend news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sizzle reel and every other word is</v>

204
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 1>the Edward m effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could see them looking back and</v>

205
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 1>they turn it down because it's the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>channel is.</v>

206
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 1>They didn't screen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

207
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>they didn't screen it and she comes out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's talking about news and how to</v>

208
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:55.840
<v Speaker 1>create content.</v>

209
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>The Algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing your audience,</v>

210
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.480
<v Speaker 1>knowing your audience is the content</v>
<v Speaker 1>creators.</v>

211
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>She's like the founders of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

212
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>complaining you're filming someone going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through sneakers.</v>

213
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to content it is.</v>

214
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>And then I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

215
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point they've been saying we're</v>

216
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 1>going to get to news all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time someone's come</v>

217
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:15.670
<v Speaker 1>out because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

218
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

219
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>we just heard about the new guidelines</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now she wants to beat advertiser</v>

220
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be family friendly,</v>

221
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>a consumer that you deal with hip hop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of pretty,</v>

222
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>pretty adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty profane content.</v>

223
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Have you been hit by at the time was</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the apocalypse.</v>

224
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been hit by this.</v>

225
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

226
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

227
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no further questions that,</v>

228
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of that stuff's fun.</v>

229
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.960
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

230
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>it's about the wrong opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it comes down.</v>

231
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>But is it fine because they're black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she wasn't black.</v>

232
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a white girl.</v>

233
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I think she was black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

234
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't see color.</v>

235
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Me saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Irish quarter.</v>

236
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about this like I more</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish</v>

237
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 2>than a lot of people that call</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves black.</v>

238
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm one quarter Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three quarters Italian,</v>

239
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look mostly Italian,</v>

240
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 2>but if I said I'm an Irish man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will be like,</v>

241
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really?</v>

242
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 2>She was like Abercrombie and Fitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black.</v>

243
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

244
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 2>She's generically ethnic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Like if I were a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have no problems with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>dating your daughter if you were kind of</v>

247
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.680
<v Speaker 2>a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew that it was a pretty slide</v>

248
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
<v Speaker 2>intimidate everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if she went to like a really fucking</v>

249
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 2>heavy duty hip hop place and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing that word around,</v>

250
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 2>they would look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

251
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 2>she even allowed to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you go blurting out the n word when</v>

252
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 2>you that white?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that she could do it with</v>

253
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>her sizzle reel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that seems like a bit of a problem.</v>

254
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like one of those weird double</v>

255
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:47.650
<v Speaker 2>standard rules in terms of like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

256
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 2>like if you are in that community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to use what is otherwise</v>

257
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 2>extremely offensive language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

258
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:56.580
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to have a hood pass</v>

259
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 2>to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you like the Platinum version?</v>

260
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really all the way to get a black</v>

261
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially on Youtube.</v>

262
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not saying there's anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with using that language.</v>

263
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation I told you about</v>

264
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had a conversation with this</v>

265
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.150
<v Speaker 2>woman from Youtube and one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were talking about was</v>

266
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 2>demonetization and we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why things get flagged and I was</v>

267
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:20.230
<v Speaker 2>talking about a conversation that got</v>
<v Speaker 2>flagged on Jamie.</v>

268
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 2>What is it called when someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommends something and they have it in</v>

269
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 2>their feed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their preferred playlist,</v>

270
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 2>like a regular person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a content creator,</v>

271
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>but if they have it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their,</v>

272
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do that.</v>

273
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.040
<v Speaker 2>You can have it in your channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could I think just like</v>

274
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:36.760
<v Speaker 2>suggested playlists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's their algorithms.</v>

275
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 2>So what it's called you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would call it a but not their</v>

276
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 2>algorithms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you would pick it,</v>

277
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 2>like say if I've watched one of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>video video on Bob Ross and I liked it,</v>

278
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 2>what would it in your queue cut that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>

279
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The q?</v>

280
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.533
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

281
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>

282
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're really stupid right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

283
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Like none of us just got that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

284
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:54.680
<v Speaker 2>We're all on youtube too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stupid asses.</v>

285
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this guy got flagged and it was just</v>

286
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 2>a conversation between Sam Harris and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other guy.</v>

287
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I forgot who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an intellectual and it was about</v>

288
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.700
<v Speaker 2>left wing culture and it was about</v>
<v Speaker 2>leftwing radical ideology and they were</v>

289
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>criticizing it and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this got his channel flagged.</v>

290
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how is this possible?</v>

291
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

292
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 2>he's advocating that people watch this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it must promote hate speech.</v>

293
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking guarantee you that doesn't</v>

294
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 2>promote hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys even watch it or does</v>

295
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 2>somebody else complained about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>flag it?</v>

296
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.010
<v Speaker 2>And then I brought up Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

297
00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>it was just here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just left.</v>

298
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be on their show there</v>
<v Speaker 2>next week to Canada</v>

299
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 2>and she said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a problem.</v>

300
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a bit of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a troublemaker.</v>

301
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a troublemaker.</v>

302
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I go with because he has his own</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions on things like what is going</v>

303
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.380
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

304
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:53.420
<v Speaker 2>what are you guys promoting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very specific ideology and anyone who</v>

305
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>differs</v>

306
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 1>from that is hate speech because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting crazy.</v>

307
00:11:57.611 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of them don't know.</v>

308
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.641
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

309
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:01.160
<v Speaker 1>is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

312
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>listening to an honest intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation between Sam Harris and</v>

<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is the guy who got.</v>

314
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.780

<v Speaker 1>Dig it down.</v>

315
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The S,</v>

316
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>p e t e R K CCX.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very bold.</v>

317
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a community guideline strike</v>

318
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.420
<v Speaker 1>for come by the way I listened to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation between Sam Harris and Doug</v>

319
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.211
<v Speaker 1>Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>

320
00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:27.330
<v Speaker 1>sorry Douglas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

321
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.750
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing offensive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

322
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 1>they're discussing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:32.630
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing is now we've scaled it</v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

324
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing if even if there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual video,</v>

325
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 1>what that is and find out what the title</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is and if maybe there's some sort</v>

326
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 1>of a description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it say what does it say?</v>

327
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:46.290
<v Speaker 1>They're just as Sam Harrison Douglas</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murray.</v>

328
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who Douglas Murray is,</v>

329
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>but click on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can click on him.</v>

330
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>A strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange death of your.</v>

331
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ima Immigration Identity Islam.</v>

332
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Douglas Murray is a.</v>

333
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.280
<v Speaker 1>He is critical of the open border policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're seeing become very</v>

334
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>problematic in some parts of Europe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

335
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 1>which is funny because Sam Harris is</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the wall against Donald Trump's</v>

336
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:13.570
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like that's just two people</v>

337
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 1>probably with differing opinions on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue to some degree.</v>

338
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is a pretty noted critic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

339
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

340
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the immigration thing,</v>

341
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 1>he's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more open borders in the states</v>

342
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>then a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

343
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

344
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I think what he's essentially saying is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about the very real</v>

345
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>issues that they're dealing with in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe and youtube size.</v>

346
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we played a video the other day of</v>

347
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Paris of some parts of Paris that</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants who have moved into and just</v>

348
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking completely wrecked.</v>

349
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandparents were immigrants,</v>

350
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying that there's a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue and this guy,</v>

351
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray was discussing this real</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with Sam Harris.</v>

352
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>That got flagged and it got labeled as</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>

353
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:54.871
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

354
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I had a fucking crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

355
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee Dorn,</v>

356
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 1>so he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he graduated like a,</v>

357
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.250
<v Speaker 1>like a University of Michigan Law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really just brilliant,</v>

358
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a Shapiro Kinda guy and he was</v>

359
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early youtubers,</v>

360
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:09.040
<v Speaker 1>early adopters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first other conservative on Youtube.</v>

361
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Very Analytical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

362
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.110
<v Speaker 1>very dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

363
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.200
<v Speaker 1>And he did a video that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just called something like the</v>

364
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Japanese were not the victims in World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War II and it was a video about the</v>

365
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 1>atrocities that the Japanese committed</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the Chinese.</v>

366
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.820
<v Speaker 1>That's all it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the rape of Nam King,</v>

367
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 1>why would he didn't get yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't get super graphic,</v>

368
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>but he was basically talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just look back and I look at</v>

369
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Hiroshima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's actually look at the</v>

370
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 1>aspirations of the Japanese empire</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical.</v>

371
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>It was removed as hate speech and here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

372
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 1>He came to me and because we had those</v>
<v Speaker 1>contacts at Youtube,</v>

373
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 1>we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They immediately apologize and fixed it,</v>

374
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.770
<v Speaker 1>but what worries me is what if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a million plus subscribers.</v>

375
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

376
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>what if I weren't there for him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one thing that I always get</v>

377
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>worried about with comedy and with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of entertainers is they,</v>

378
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.220
<v Speaker 1>they kinda pave a path and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>

379
00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I closed the door behind him like,</v>

380
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 2>well it was okay for me to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now this is,</v>

381
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.640
<v Speaker 2>that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned better.</v>

382
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 2>We should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well hold on a second.</v>

383
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 2>We're in the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you were,</v>

384
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.433
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

385
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of famine thinking</v>

386
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Speaker 2>going on in that regard where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically want to protect what they</v>

387
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>have and get nervous about it and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget what got them there in the first</v>

388
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes any of us popular is the</v>

389
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>ability to express yourself online in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that resonates with other people</v>

390
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>that are listening now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you restrict that,</v>

391
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you change that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

392
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to do real good and I'm</v>

393
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 2>making a lot of money now I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change who I am.</v>

394
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>

395
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would take it a step further and say,</v>

396
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 2>authenticity and people like you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're authentic.</v>

397
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're pretty authentic with what</v>

398
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:33.660
<v Speaker 2>we do with the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

399
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.820
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

400
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 2>people come up and they meet us at shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

401
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:40.390
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a right.</v>

402
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be authentic and play by</v>

403
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 2>youtubes rules unless you completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with them.</v>

404
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't have to agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be authentically willing to</v>

405
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.780
<v Speaker 2>abide by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the whole thing.</v>

406
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 2>There's no authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like regardless of the rules that</v>

407
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:57.260
<v Speaker 2>they claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are so ambiguous in practice,</v>

408
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.390
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

409
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I think this is indicative of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology that radiates throughout</v>

410
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is radical left progressive,</v>

411
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Neil Marxist sort of ideology and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much of that going on</v>

412
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>throughout silicon valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much in the tech community.</v>

413
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 2>So much uber progressive thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

414
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:19.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

415
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I think all of it comes from the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

416
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I think they all want no racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 2>they want no hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all want wonderful things,</v>

418
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.610
<v Speaker 2>but you can't just decide arbitrarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is and isn't based on your</v>

419
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:34.680
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

420
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at it,</v>

421
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:37.740
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

422
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're doing that.</v>

423
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I think when you look at that Douglas</v>
<v Speaker 2>Murray,</v>

424
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guy getting,</v>

425
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 2>getting a community strike for just</v>
<v Speaker 2>liking it.</v>

426
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the.</v>

427
00:16:47.491 --> 00:16:50.540
<v Speaker 2>They take an authoritarian approach to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving the whole thing,</v>

428
00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 2>which and they refuse to accept the</v>
<v Speaker 2>results,</v>

429
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:57.971
<v Speaker 2>which is the Donald Trump presidency and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've created so in their defense.</v>

430
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they did say to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the problem that you're dealing</v>

431
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.910
<v Speaker 2>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with they're dealing with is</v>

432
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:07.270
<v Speaker 2>blunt tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying these tools that D</v>

433
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:10.220
<v Speaker 2>monetize things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not good yet and she said within</v>

434
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:13.050
<v Speaker 2>the next six to eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get better bullshit</v>

435
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 2>working on them.</v>

436
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

437
00:17:15.271 --> 00:17:17.840
<v Speaker 2>but let me look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just express her perspective.</v>

438
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.340
<v Speaker 2>She was saying that they have made</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant strides since they first</v>

439
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 2>started doing it and they're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>better at it.</v>

440
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:27.530
<v Speaker 2>They're getting better at isolating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we discussed is those</v>

441
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking creepy cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

442
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've seen them as a child</v>
<v Speaker 2>molestation stuff.</v>

443
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

444
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 2>the violent stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it like babies getting hit by</v>

445
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.230
<v Speaker 2>bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen those?</v>

446
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:37.064
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things.</v>

447
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I've watched good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

448
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about now that I'd never</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it all.</v>

449
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

450
00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:46.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing where these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>get put on a kid's playlist,</v>

451
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Mickey Mouse and Minnie miles</v>

452
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>getting drunk</v>

453
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.340
<v Speaker 1>and then like someone throws a bottle up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the air and it hits a baby in the</v>

454
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 1>head and there's blood everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these same patterns are repeated over</v>

455
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of these videos,</v>

456
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them have been removed from</v>

457
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:02.274
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

458
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.340
<v Speaker 1>They've been pretty proactive about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton Tarantino making cartoons.</v>

459
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find them,</v>

460
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.350
<v Speaker 1>see what Eli Roth played on a founder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirder playlist of like this guy</v>

461
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>dissecting candy and making weird voices</v>
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>

462
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a whole list of</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos that people are saying like,</v>

463
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this channel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

464
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.050
<v Speaker 1>And it just got bigger and bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and I don't think anything's had.</v>

465
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really different than youtube kids</v>

466
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

467
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's done with the kid thing</v>

468
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more fucked up because it's always</v>

469
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>the same pattern.</v>

470
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like these kids get together with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parent,</v>

471
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 1>the parents give the kids booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids get drunk,</v>

472
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 1>they throw bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that baby gets hit in the head with a</v>

473
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:45.330
<v Speaker 1>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's blood everywhere.</v>

474
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like the same thing over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

475
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 1>There's been all these videos exposing</v>
<v Speaker 1>these videos like people that are</v>

476
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 1>analyzing and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

477
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to be foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be done in other countries</v>

478
00:18:57.091 --> 00:18:59.460
<v Speaker 1>and essentially what they're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tapping into this.</v>

479
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 1>They have a like a pattern that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

480
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.500
<v Speaker 1>They're tapping into whatever algorithm</v>
<v Speaker 1>that creates your coming up next.</v>

481
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 1>These adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

482
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So a little kid can be watching like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real donald duck cartoon and then it</v>

483
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:13.780
<v Speaker 1>leads into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's what anyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complaining about it.</v>

485
00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I think we can all find common ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's get rid of the Minnie mouse</v>

486
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:22.300
<v Speaker 1>being raped on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is I understand her</v>

487
00:19:22.301 --> 00:19:24.670
<v Speaker 1>perspective and that's what they told us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to almost a year ago,</v>

488
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.840
<v Speaker 1>but I even asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

489
00:19:25.841 --> 00:19:26.674
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

490
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You just wind and Dynas and you showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>us your whole virtual reality set.</v>

491
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.951
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

492
00:19:29.951 --> 00:19:31.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were the most advanced?</v>

493
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:32.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what youtube wants to be at the</v>

494
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:33.910
<v Speaker 1>forefront of policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

495
00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:35.950
<v Speaker 1>they're really aggressively under this</v>
<v Speaker 1>net neutrality thing.</v>

496
00:19:35.951 --> 00:19:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google really big policy wonks.</v>

497
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Really big lobbyist if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they go so okay,</v>

498
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you're super advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most technologically advanced company in</v>

499
00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:47.920
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our channels is a real life one.</v>

500
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.740
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of shit,</v>

501
00:19:50.741 --> 00:19:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but these aren't as offensive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the cartoon ones.</v>

502
00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:54.514
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This gets.</v>

503
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.260
<v Speaker 1>We're always taking a 15 minute weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

504
00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Just weird stuff happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like kids are supposed to watch this.</v>

505
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.850
<v Speaker 1>They stumble across it because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm,</v>

506
00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:02.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're watching tune with spiderman</v>

507
00:20:02.531 --> 00:20:03.700
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shows up next.</v>

508
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does she get drunk and he raped her.</v>

509
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.950
<v Speaker 1>She's getting tied up a second ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really shitty spiderman and I</v>

510
00:20:08.951 --> 00:20:10.220
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

511
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't make it past our wardrobe</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

512
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is you can't claim to the</v>

513
00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:20.030
<v Speaker 1>most advanced tech company in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in our channel you're,</v>

514
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.810
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting ads for Muslim singles</v>

515
00:20:22.811 --> 00:20:24.460
<v Speaker 1>and gay cruises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm on a second.</v>

516
00:20:24.461 --> 00:20:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Your algorithm that's kind of figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is pretty fun,</v>

517
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.410
<v Speaker 1>but we're not getting any money from</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ads.</v>

518
00:20:29.411 --> 00:20:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that if our videos are</v>

519
00:20:31.691 --> 00:20:32.530
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

520
00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:34.000
<v Speaker 1>or videos or not a violation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines,</v>

521
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.070
<v Speaker 1>there are sponsors out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we see with Walter,</v>

522
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm company came to sponsor,</v>

523
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.130
<v Speaker 1>they seek us out because it's worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>octupled to them because they want to</v>

524
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:44.050
<v Speaker 1>reach our audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Youtube says,</v>

525
00:20:44.051 --> 00:20:44.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

526
00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:45.124
<v Speaker 1>it's not advertiser friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

527
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.430
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

528
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not advertiser friendly for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you on there.</v>

529
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not gay cruise advertiser friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're telling me you have the most</v>

530
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>advanced algorithms in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running ads for young Turks on my</v>

531
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:56.450
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I really?</v>

532
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

533
00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.310
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of leftist ads and you might do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that on purpose.</v>

534
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I will be hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impression when you,</v>

535
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 1>when you went to that one conference and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went as him,</v>

536
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just goes,</v>

537
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very disappointing.</v>

538
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I would have thought that was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

539
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 1>first of all it was disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was only 20 people in there.</v>

540
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even gone out and been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

541
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 1>let's take this to a smaller place</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if a video gets out of this,</v>

542
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:25.980
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is 20 people in this one room and then</v>

543
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 1>you walked in as him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do it.</v>

544
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Like he had called me out and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had people even on this show,</v>

545
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 1>of course you wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

546
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows I didn't want to do it.</v>

547
00:21:36.231 --> 00:21:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I have to because he</v>

548
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 1>called me out and I said I accept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:40.624
<v Speaker 1>basically like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>

550
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And then he called you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so he was talking trash.</v>

551
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

552
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing.</v>

553
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:48.941
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

554
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I responded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

555
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 1>let's hash this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will mention he will rebut every Tom,</v>

556
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Dick and Harry on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not named Steven crowder.</v>

557
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.490
<v Speaker 1>So at this point I was just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get an interview with him.</v>

558
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 1>We used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had people on our show we disagree</v>

559
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it an hour long.</v>

560
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Change my mind where I sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to someone scream at me.</v>

561
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm more than willing to video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did the.</v>

562
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Were you drinking the bacon grease and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

563
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty him and funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

564
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made me laugh,</v>

565
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.460
<v Speaker 1>but the point is he forced my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

566
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I had to do it like he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that guy in diners to punch</v>

567
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:22.250
<v Speaker 1>all the people who ganged up on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball diamond throughout the day.</v>

568
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.871
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

569
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this with Cenk because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no other recourse.</v>

570
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.600
<v Speaker 1>And he kept going to the audience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason we show the audience</v>

571
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:29.700
<v Speaker 1>like youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another recourse,</v>

572
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.120
<v Speaker 1>like you have to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bain has to escalate.</v>

573
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.070
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

574
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 1>listen to like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like at this point you brought</v>

575
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 1>up the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do a pan.</v>

576
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 20 people,</v>

577
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to go up and embarrass</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

578
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 1>but he's such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just such an asshole.</v>

579
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way around it,</v>

580
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:50.800
<v Speaker 1>so we kind of retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That character to character is funny</v>

581
00:22:50.801 --> 00:22:52.730
<v Speaker 1>when you're drinking the bacon grease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

582
00:22:52.731 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 1>We brought them back this week and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that's right.</v>

583
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I've had nothing but pleasant dealings</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jank.</v>

584
00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have any hate for the guy,</v>

585
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 1>but I laughed because I run the</v>
<v Speaker 1>handshake with them.</v>

586
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It was a wonderful moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

587
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

588
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.373
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

589
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I just think like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get embroiled in conflict and then</v>

590
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>they lose perspective and then it builds</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and then it becomes something stupid</v>

591
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.900
<v Speaker 1>and I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his thing with Alex Jones is handled</v>

592
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 1>very poorly and they start screaming at</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and Anna called him a fat</v>

593
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.430
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

594
00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:23.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just is against everything you guys</v>

595
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 1>stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You calling him a fat fuck.</v>

596
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.320
<v Speaker 1>You can't just shaved him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

597
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile jenks fatter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking crazy.</v>

598
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

599
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which links put them on.</v>

600
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he realizes that yet.</v>

601
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's at the point where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes that he's,</v>

602
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's bigger than Alex.</v>

603
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's lying to himself.</v>

604
00:23:42.631 --> 00:23:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speculate on how he</v>

605
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 1>looks at herself in the mirror and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells himself in the morning and get</v>

606
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 1>to the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said my dealings with Janka had been</v>

607
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 1>nothing but pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to him.</v>

608
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I had him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to them.</v>

609
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I just think people lose their place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose their,</v>

610
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 1>lose their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

611
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 1>their view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

612
00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I think when your identity is entirely</v>
<v Speaker 1>tied up in the numbers,</v>

613
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's entirely tied up,</v>

614
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 1>his only defense was looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

615
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second that,</v>

616
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 1>that ebbs and flows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

617
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:07.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

618
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys obviously have a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful show,</v>

619
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:12.350
<v Speaker 1>but some shows are more popular than</v>
<v Speaker 1>others of course.</v>

620
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And for them they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:18.710
<v Speaker 1>this far left sort of I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive viewpoint and they've gotten</v>

622
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 1>increasingly worse is not popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when that's your only argument,</v>

623
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 1>when that's your whole identity is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very short time between that and when</v>

624
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:27.150
<v Speaker 1>the pendulum swings and that even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the,</v>

625
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need debate it.</v>

626
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro.</v>

627
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the audience the year before</v>

628
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:34.200
<v Speaker 1>was him and Dinesh D'souza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're welcome.</v>

629
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And people were clapping for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he was sitting there with</v>

630
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work.</v>

631
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Da Dinesh one,</v>

632
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.810
<v Speaker 1>he had that ace in the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that card,</v>

633
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like you went to prison as a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough card to get by.</v>

634
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is funny.</v>

635
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.610
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to picture the national</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison I'm friends with,</v>

636
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.250
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I felt like the Sam Harris one was</v>

637
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 1>a big downfall for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Affleck and all that stuff.</v>

638
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Sam just handled it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

639
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 1>when they were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had that long three hour</v>

640
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:06.020
<v Speaker 1>conversation in a three hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with someone.</v>

641
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to hide.</v>

642
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like your ideas get exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lack of knowledge gets exposed.</v>

643
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what the left doesn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know people say,</v>

644
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

645
00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 1>if we do a segment where the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>success for us this year that we're</v>

646
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:22.270
<v Speaker 1>really grateful for is that changed my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset and that's just where I</v>

647
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.480
<v Speaker 1>literally sit down and we put up a booth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says I'm pro gun changed my mind,</v>

648
00:25:25.481 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 1>or I'm prolife changed my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there are only two genders.</v>

649
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro gun change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildly unpopular here and go in the</v>

650
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:32.670
<v Speaker 1>wrong spots.</v>

651
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

652
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.600
<v Speaker 1>we had one that was like an hour long</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on abortion.</v>

653
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:41.990
<v Speaker 1>One that wasn't just at Smu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five people just lined up and I just</v>

654
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:43.820
<v Speaker 1>listened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And out of the five people,</v>

655
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 1>two of them changed their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of them we didn't find</v>

656
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 1>com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely unedited.</v>

657
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I worked at Fox News,</v>

658
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 1>everyone in cable news would have told</v>
<v Speaker 1>you this would not work and no one's</v>

659
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 1>going to watch an hour long discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no one on the left who does</v>

660
00:25:55.851 --> 00:25:56.451
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

661
00:25:56.451 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 1>they can't do it in their format.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it when they have an eight</v>

662
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:04.250
<v Speaker 1>to 10 slot or an eight to nine slot and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's every 15 minutes you have to</v>

663
00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>champ sandwich and a commercial and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all these segments that you</v>

664
00:26:06.891 --> 00:26:08.390
<v Speaker 1>have to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it,</v>

665
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 1>but that's just because their format</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>

666
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Like it's an art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an antiquated form of</v>

667
00:26:13.461 --> 00:26:15.170
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work anymore.</v>

668
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.360
<v Speaker 1>But even the lifts on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the young Turks,</v>

669
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:20.050
<v Speaker 1>they don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unedited is long form thing because</v>

670
00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>it shows are there on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube.</v>

671
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.340
<v Speaker 1>What are they like really popular ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

672
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really Sam Cedar Show,</v>

673
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority report is.</v>

674
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>He used to fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called the minority report once.</v>

675
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.040
<v Speaker 1>That's easy to easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

676
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.440
<v Speaker 1>They think I did it on purpose or were</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mad?</v>

677
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>They thought you were doing like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative talk show thing where</v>

678
00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:40.810
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

679
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats don't do that.</v>

680
00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they also call me right wing</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

681
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:47.274
<v Speaker 2>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

682
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.740
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you pick up the.</v>

683
00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they were saying was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people just decide that these</v>

684
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 2>people that we decide to help each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

685
00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 2>that the right supports themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they support like other right wing</v>

686
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:01.260
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the left needs to figure out how to</v>

687
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:02.094
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

688
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking have anybody on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

689
00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I have a left wing people on all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

690
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I have libertarians and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have people that are completely</v>

691
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:12.200
<v Speaker 2>neutral to politics on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think when you box yourself into</v>

692
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:17.210
<v Speaker 2>these ideologies when you're only pro</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and you can't see any perspective</v>

693
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 2>outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes an issue,</v>

694
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:22.530
<v Speaker 2>which is it's going to be an issue for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you today.</v>

695
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 2>After a double feature of Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson and us,</v>

696
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>they're probably going to come fast.</v>

697
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

698
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson Hall knew it when I was.</v>

699
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.830
<v Speaker 2>When I was doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

700
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

701
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll have that guy on anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of my favorite people to talk</v>

702
00:27:37.141 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a fascinating guy,</v>

703
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 2>but I knew like having to back to back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

704
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking old road zone,</v>

705
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:44.970
<v Speaker 2>which is just embracing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the notes,</v>

706
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:47.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're definitely on the characters</v>

707
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.160
<v Speaker 2>that appear in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's of all the variables.</v>

708
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.750
<v Speaker 2>What I wanted to talk to you guys about</v>
<v Speaker 2>is some of my favorite stuff that you've</v>

709
00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:58.770
<v Speaker 2>done and some of my favorite stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done is the undercover shit and</v>

710
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've found the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most disturbing was when youtube posed</v>

711
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 2>as a gay couple and you went to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>place where they were advocating</v>

712
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 2>transgender children and transitioning</v>
<v Speaker 2>children as young as three years old.</v>

713
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was.</v>

714
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I was three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but puberty blockers.</v>

715
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:14.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about.</v>

716
00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was really fucking.</v>

717
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:17.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

718
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

719
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Actually three years old was Owen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin got in an argument on twitter</v>

720
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.360
<v Speaker 2>and lost his manager because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that someone is fucking insane.</v>

721
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Forgiving puberty blockers to a three</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old kid for giving hormone blockers</v>

722
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:32.700
<v Speaker 2>to a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I am.</v>

723
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even a strong enough word.</v>

724
00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insanity.</v>

725
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Fucking insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meet your bodies aren't even developed.</v>

726
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:43.290
<v Speaker 2>You're not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about 18.</v>

727
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.360
<v Speaker 2>We're not even talking about 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is arguable.</v>

728
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you really try waiting to your</v>

729
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Speaker 2>fucking frontal cortex is fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed and figure out who you are.</v>

730
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that you're gonna know at</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

731
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 2>who are you going to be when you're 30?</v>

732
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they present the other side.</v>

733
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Banana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They act as though you're crazy.</v>

734
00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.081
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

735
00:28:58.081 --> 00:28:58.651
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

736
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:01.280
<v Speaker 2>the thing is with the puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that person looked like me with</v>

737
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 2>a look like from Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let's play.</v>

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's play some of it because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking nuts.</v>

739
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 2>When I watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

740
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.440
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are these people saying and</v>

741
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.400

<v Speaker 2>about that to really?</v>

<v Speaker 2>We had a business card.</v>

747
00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a goddamn simulation.</v>

748
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.690
<v Speaker 2>This was a town hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a simulation.</v>

749
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>This can't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Guy,</v>

750
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.240
<v Speaker 2>his name is rex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

751
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>And he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

752
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

753
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>let's play some of this and</v>

754
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 1>if there's a way for most of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are listening rather than watching.</v>

755
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 1>So you already know what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gave him the.</v>

756
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's set this up.</v>

757
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Intern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was this?</v>

758
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

759
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 1>We'll knock a jared and here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

760
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.440
<v Speaker 1>can I preface this with something again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't like.</v>

761
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.910
<v Speaker 1>We're not undercover journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do a late night show.</v>

762
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do coffee to the Mandala.</v>

763
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Would you joke sketches and we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews and then every now and then</v>

764
00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:07.870
<v Speaker 1>we stumble across something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're doing,</v>

765
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Antifa and they hand you a knife</v>

766
00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and they talk about shooting that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>

767
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:14.890
<v Speaker 1>and then when the media just lies about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

768
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.440
<v Speaker 1>like we feel compelled to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't our thing.</v>

769
00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.570
<v Speaker 1>This is one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This particular one was kind of a</v>

770
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.610
<v Speaker 1>throwaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a throne.</v>

771
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.970
<v Speaker 1>We were joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a goof.</v>

772
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.220
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even bothered with costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just walked in separate queer,</v>

773
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.360
<v Speaker 1>it was what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The health care.</v>

774
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Transgender town hall where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my transgender town hall.</v>

775
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where was it at?</v>

776
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vermont.</v>

777
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.551
<v Speaker 1>Burlington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vermont.</v>

778
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that place is crazy.</v>

779
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a plane with Bernie Sanders on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way there to wow money.</v>

780
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give it to the blacks.</v>

781
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

782
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play.</v>

783
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Has said</v>

784
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.080
<v Speaker 3>that feels like a girl playing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>dolls.</v>

785
00:30:57.081 --> 00:30:58.520
<v Speaker 3>And of course we don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>discourage it.</v>

786
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we spoke with our primary care</v>

787
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.840
<v Speaker 3>physician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

788
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:07.870
<v Speaker 3>wait until the boys fully developed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We made his own little thing.</v>

789
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.910
<v Speaker 3>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say a little inaccurate from the</v>

790
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.930
<v Speaker 3>research I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid,</v>

791
00:31:14.931 --> 00:31:16.080
<v Speaker 3>18th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two lists.</v>

792
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.690
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

793
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.670
<v Speaker 3>get rid of the pope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puberty blockers.</v>

794
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:23.330
<v Speaker 3>They just go through late puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say anything still lined up.</v>

795
00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 3>There's no indication that there's any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

796
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.480
<v Speaker 3>That's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puberty blockers are not reversible.</v>

797
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the entire point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the point.</v>

798
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.490
<v Speaker 3>The young adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone at the pre adolescent age going</v>

799
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.370
<v Speaker 3>into those Adelaide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to change the way your body</v>

800
00:31:40.371 --> 00:31:41.204
<v Speaker 3>to Bella</v>

801
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.220
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

802
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving a kid a puberty blocker,</v>

803
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.810
<v Speaker 1>letting them go through life with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>puberty blocker and then at 17 or</v>

804
00:31:48.811 --> 00:31:50.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is decided to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit off.</v>

805
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.350
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be the exact same human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

806
00:31:52.351 --> 00:31:54.570
<v Speaker 1>You would have been with the same people</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about little estrogen and milk</v>

807
00:31:54.571 --> 00:31:57.720
<v Speaker 1>cartons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then this guy say free plastic,</v>

808
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.280
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want it to alter my</v>

<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

812
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't make those decisions for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.590
<v Speaker 1>They're too young to.</v>

819
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:25.080
<v Speaker 1>child who's six years old or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>would know the consequences,</v>

820
00:32:25.081 --> 00:32:29.550
<v Speaker 1>but them saying that 18 is too late and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not that they would disagree</v>

821
00:32:29.551 --> 00:32:33.330
<v Speaker 1>with your primary care physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's too young based on the</v>

822
00:32:33.331 --> 00:32:36.420
<v Speaker 1>research that I've done.</v>

826
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another problem.</v>

827
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.590
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if youtube is going to ban</v>
<v Speaker 2>this video because of what you just said</v>

828
00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This video is going to get marked for</v>

829
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 2>demonetization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

830
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:51.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The d,</v>

831
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 2>the Jordan Peterson one just got flagged</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we talked about this book.</v>

832
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.930
<v Speaker 2>We talked about the 12 rules for life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talked about a guidelines for living</v>

833
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 2>a hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just started reading it.</v>

834
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 2>That's great book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep going.</v>

835
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.453
<v Speaker 2>Officers play</v>

836
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:09.690
<v Speaker 3>more or less to understand themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the task reads a particular length</v>

837
00:33:10.571 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 3>and the diameter and the penis is</v>
<v Speaker 3>developed enough.</v>

838
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Then there'll be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

839
00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.380
<v Speaker 3>if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to try,</v>

840
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.190
<v Speaker 3>you're going to transition to either</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

841
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the problem.</v>

842
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:21.921
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

843
00:33:21.921 --> 00:33:24.290
<v Speaker 2>jazzy and no material of creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina.</v>

844
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:27.080
<v Speaker 2>If the testicles and the peanuts are</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed enough,</v>

845
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.810
<v Speaker 2>did you know this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that unless your penis gets</v>

846
00:33:29.811 --> 00:33:31.730
<v Speaker 2>big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get a fake vagina cause</v>

847
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough tissue to invert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

848
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.241
<v Speaker 2>this is him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

849
00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:37.010
<v Speaker 2>now if you decide to transition the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other way,</v>

850
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 2>meaning if you decide to not transition</v>
<v Speaker 2>iep murder,</v>

851
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 2>how everyone made fun of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beauty pageant girl when she was</v>

852
00:33:44.151 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 2>asked about gay marriage and gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage or opposite marriage and</v>

853
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:49.520
<v Speaker 2>everyone laughed and it was silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

854
00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 2>She was conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was silly,</v>

855
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 2>but he's doing that right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like should you choose to transition or</v>

856
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 2>transition the other way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean should you choose to not cut</v>

857
00:33:57.261 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 2>off your penis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's transition the other way.</v>

858
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

859
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:02.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender community think it's</v>

860
00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:05.180
<v Speaker 2>offensive to assume that you have to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>an operation,</v>

861
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 2>get your penis removed in order to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender or Muslim.</v>

862
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:11.750
<v Speaker 2>This guy's making this big assumption</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is what you have to do in</v>

863
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 2>order to transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that are</v>

864
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:16.850
<v Speaker 2>transgender that do not have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>operation.</v>

865
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say I'm in a community focus</v>

866
00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:23.880
<v Speaker 2>group with transgender people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way too.</v>

867
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent in favor of grown adults</v>
<v Speaker 2>deciding to transition.</v>

868
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should be able to tattoo</v>

869
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:30.530
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get nose rings.</v>

870
00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

871
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.650
<v Speaker 2>But you're also asking the government to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay for your face tattoos.</v>

872
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

873
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was another thing.</v>

874
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send this to Jamie.</v>

875
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.950
<v Speaker 2>That was some research today that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

876
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 2>someone put out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll play this and I'll forward this to</v>

877
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll text this to keep playing.</v>

878
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.120
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that clip.</v>

879
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.423
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

880
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

881
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 2>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a public town hall which we attend</v>

882
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.180
<v Speaker 2>and it gets removed from youtube because</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who handed us as business card</v>

883
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.520
<v Speaker 2>rex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is serious by the way,</v>

884
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.910
<v Speaker 2>like we did the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't nearly as mad about this as</v>

885
00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:09.960
<v Speaker 2>we were just just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in,</v>

886
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.870
<v Speaker 2>in doubled over in laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's name,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he had trouble getting less secure in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the url,</v>

888
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:19.540
<v Speaker 2>writes his own initiative to her website</v>
<v Speaker 2>url.</v>

889
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I just sent this to you,</v>

905
00:35:56.581 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 1>extensive experience in gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>dysphoria,</v>

906
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says there is zero point zero evidence</v>

907
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.950
<v Speaker 1>that the concepts of gender fluidity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity have any scientific</v>

908
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

910
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 1>this is why should include zero point</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero zero.</v>

911
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:16.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the second zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's money thinking about cash doesn't</v>

912
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 1>mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thinking about cash money.</v>

913
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could have zero point zero.</v>

914
00:36:21.511 --> 00:36:23.620
<v Speaker 1>One percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have 100.</v>

915
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to make sure there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>

916
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she started in those extra characters.</v>

00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:29.160
<v Speaker 1>We just got brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's very,</v>

918
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.610
<v Speaker 1>the extra 2:40 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm of those that you say like hate</v>

919
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:34.230
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gender dysphoria is still in the DSM</v>

920
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:35.710
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

921
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.440
<v Speaker 1>the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the psychiatric journal that they</v>

922
00:36:37.441 --> 00:36:39.870
<v Speaker 1>use a reference book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they literally call it hate speech</v>

923
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:40.291
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

924
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the actual medical condition.</v>

925
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Undercover.</v>

926
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.050
<v Speaker 1>God bless my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went with us because we need other</v>

927
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Speaker 1>people to have hidden cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she posed as a lesbian movie kind</v>

928
00:36:50.461 --> 00:36:51.001
<v Speaker 1>of lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

929
00:36:51.001 --> 00:36:51.761
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Exist?</v>

930
00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And like the full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't say anything.</v>

931
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Well she remember said like I identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>as someone with bigger breasts and she</v>

932
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:01.590
<v Speaker 1>was asking how to get this covered under</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medicare,</v>

933
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:04.310
<v Speaker 1>medicaid because they were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting all these operations and Mr</v>

934
00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless them,</v>

935
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.960
<v Speaker 1>but I think we should mention that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about that gender dysphoria.</v>

937
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.220
<v Speaker 1>So for her they use gender dysphoria to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and file it medically to get new</v>

938
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.970
<v Speaker 1>tits on taxpayer dime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's considered hate speech to say</v>

939
00:37:17.971 --> 00:37:19.800
<v Speaker 1>it to the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transgenders in the room.</v>

940
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't make sense of it and I</v>

941
00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:24.320
<v Speaker 1>don't need to make sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need to not be banned for just</v>

942
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be the woman she was meant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

943
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

944
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that you can mark is bullshit.</v>

945
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you could mock it that openly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's not obvious,</v>

946
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 1>like getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting bigger tits because you identify</v>

947
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 1>as someone with bigger tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's bullshit.</v>

948
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever been in love</v>

949
00:37:41.101 --> 00:37:42.620
<v Speaker 1>with my wife that when she did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

950
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't expect that she's looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

951
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 1>She kind of nodded to someone who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger breasts.</v>

952
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see that guy that got busted</v>

953
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 1>molesting children and said he</v>
<v Speaker 1>identifies as being a 60 year old boy?</v>

954
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 1>That was a really recent case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

955
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:59.880
<v Speaker 1>people are trying this out when they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught doing things and I'm not saying</v>

956
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:02.440
<v Speaker 1>that there's not people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with being a man when they're</v>

957
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>actually a woman or vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying,</v>

958
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy people out there a lot and</v>

959
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 1>to deny that and just because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with gender.</v>

960
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>

961
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.770
<v Speaker 1>We're in Narnia now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in la La land here.</v>

962
00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

963
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you're not being real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

964
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

965
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.460
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like you said,</v>

966
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.560
<v Speaker 1>you're not right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty open about the fact that I'm</v>

967
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Speaker 1>right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching a show a while back</v>

968
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:29.810
<v Speaker 1>and you had a little little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little guy killed a buck.</v>

969
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Buck and angel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

970
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little guy that used to be a gal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

971
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

972
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I said,</v>

973
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

974
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.360
<v Speaker 2>at the same kind of conversation we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

975
00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:38.520
<v Speaker 2>like I don't just go and look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

976
00:38:38.521 --> 00:38:39.011
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're training.</v>

977
00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know.</v>

978
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.630
<v Speaker 2>I just don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

979
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to get into a fight with me.</v>

980
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to have a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's fight it out of this.</v>

981
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 2>This was years ago when you got a fresh</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot of test jacked,</v>

982
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like huge at one time.</v>

983
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh was he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

984
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:57.220
<v Speaker 2>it got up to like 185,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like super jacked because just banging</v>

985
00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 2>test in there and fucking lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was saying that his joints hurt</v>

986
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 2>really bad when he was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it's unnatural.</v>

987
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.570
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back then when you get them on</v>

988
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.620
<v Speaker 2>jacked jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a role with that guy and be like,</v>

989
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>

990
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

991
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have come on that to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind.</v>

992
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.411
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

993
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 2>exactly what the point is back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask this.</v>

994
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Did you realize it was gonna get as</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane or did he just think this is an</v>

995
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:23.800
<v Speaker 2>interesting guest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

996
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 2>he's a nice guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

997
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm more than willing to call them a man</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was one of the things that I</v>

998
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:28.721
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

999
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a person who would whatever your</v>

1000
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 2>name is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buck or fred or Wilma,</v>

1001
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you want to be called,</v>

1002
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll call you whatever noise that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>connect with you as a being,</v>

1003
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can explain to me where you</v>

1004
00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:49.550
<v Speaker 2>feel happier being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent in support.</v>

1005
00:39:49.551 --> 00:39:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What drives me crazy is people making</v>

1006
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.980
<v Speaker 2>decisions for six year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people pushing six year olds in certain</v>

1007
00:39:56.981 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 2>directions and I know that this does</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1008
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I know and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1009
00:40:00.451 --> 00:40:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I just can't get too personal about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1010
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:08.370
<v Speaker 2>but I have a friend who has an ex wife</v>
<v Speaker 2>that turned his child into a girl.</v>

1011
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1012
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:14.930
<v Speaker 2>and like tried this and was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was pushing this and kids are very</v>

1013
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:18.400
<v Speaker 2>fucking pliable man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1014
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.020
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1015
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 2>maybe some boys would've rejected it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he was leaning that way anyway,</v>

1016
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 2>but she was excited about it and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1017
00:40:26.411 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 2>This is something that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are excited.</v>

1018
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a 14 year old.</v>

1019
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think you know who the fuck</v>

1020
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:33.851
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1021
00:40:33.851 --> 00:40:35.560
<v Speaker 2>What is that girl's name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ruby rose.</v>

1022
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Is that her name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The attractive lesbian with the tattoos.</v>

1023
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.570
<v Speaker 2>She said that when she was young she</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to transition and she's very</v>

1024
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:45.940
<v Speaker 2>happy that she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wanted to become a man and she's</v>

1025
00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:48.790
<v Speaker 2>very happy that she didn't and she's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian and she's happy and she's open</v>

1026
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:52.540
<v Speaker 2>and super successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's advocating the sort of the</v>

1027
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:53.410
<v Speaker 2>same thing that I'm saying.</v>

1028
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like let people become a God damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult and then make these in in</v>

1029
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 2>alterable life changing decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy saying that hormone blockers</v>

1030
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.200
<v Speaker 2>can be turned off and then you could go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a normal puberty.</v>

1031
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:08.650
<v Speaker 2>You're out of your fucking mind and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a doctor,</v>

1032
00:41:08.651 --> 00:41:11.230
<v Speaker 2>but I have enough understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology to know that.</v>

1033
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:13.210
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just not true.</v>

1034
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely not true and that's one</v>

1035
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 2>of those things you listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can get lost in the weeds and</v>

1036
00:41:17.531 --> 00:41:19.180
<v Speaker 2>make someone look stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something specific,</v>

1037
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:20.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's.</v>

1038
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were showing me that compound</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

1039
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:23.980
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about it.</v>

1040
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1041
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:28.450
<v Speaker 2>less than room temperature Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some doctor can come in who's pro</v>

1042
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.940
<v Speaker 2>transgender and explain something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it sound like we don't know what</v>

1043
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:32.410
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it comes to that,</v>

1044
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with</v>

1045
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't agree with you on their</v>

1046
00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't know.</v>

1047
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What terms are there that you don't know</v>

1048
00:41:39.231 --> 00:41:42.640
<v Speaker 1>about a child's biological development?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>

1049
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 1>what they point to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually there are these studies that</v>

1050
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:45.130
<v Speaker 1>show that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the brain alterations occur before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across hormone replacement therapy and</v>

1052
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:50.121
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not true.</v>

1053
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 1>So we have a few transgender people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>our show,</v>

1054
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 1>but the point is with these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a conspiracy or,</v>

1055
00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:55.041
<v Speaker 1>or you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1056
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't just appeal to authority.</v>

1057
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't just say this doctor says x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I do have to at this point,</v>

1058
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 1>accepting that I'm not a doctor except</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preponderance of evidence from the</v>

1059
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:10.550
<v Speaker 1>overall medical community and combine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with the anecdotal and combined</v>

1060
00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a motive here?</v>

1061
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Is there an agenda here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of conspiracy theories and</v>

1062
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.500
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't add up because who benefits</v>
<v Speaker 1>from telling you,</v>

1063
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is flat.</v>

1064
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Who benefits from it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can understand how someone might</v>

1065
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:24.440
<v Speaker 1>benefit from a conspiracy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1066
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 1>they make a lot of money off of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or was it Tim Kennedy as a hunting</v>

1067
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Hitler thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it,</v>

1068
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:29.271
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1069
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I understand after war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1070
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 1>they thought maybe they had Hitler and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed the healing for the country.</v>

1071
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand that.</v>

1072
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:35.970
<v Speaker 1>But with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1073
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.330
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't add up as to none of the</v>

1074
00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They present that up from millennial</v>

1075
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:44.330
<v Speaker 1>parents to whack off turning the age of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their children to social experiments.</v>

1076
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:48.080
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Owen Benjamin's take Benjamin's</v>

1077
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.690
<v Speaker 1>take was that this guy in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it is,</v>

1078
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 1>who's talking about transitioning his</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old and he was like,</v>

1079
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:57.110
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was getting in trouble for this.</v>

1080
00:42:57.111 --> 00:43:00.500
<v Speaker 1>He lost his manager show because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>writes for our show now we bring them in</v>

1081
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:02.420
<v Speaker 1>on skype and we just sit and we kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>brainstorm.</v>

1082
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't really out of the closet.</v>

1083
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember at that point and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1084
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think you want this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had lost my manager.</v>

1085
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 1>And my agent was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you want this kind of</v>

1086
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:12.340
<v Speaker 1>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the conservative,</v>

1087
00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.880
<v Speaker 1>the conservative and the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real thing that's hilarious.</v>

1088
00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

1089
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1090
00:43:17.421 --> 00:43:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you want this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat.</v>

1091
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And he talked about it on our show first</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was almost like he was spit</v>

1092
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.320
<v Speaker 1>balling because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then he tweeted something that</v>

1093
00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Speaker 1>was really funny from the show and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just all hell broke loose.</v>

1094
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you that's what was going to</v>

1095
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:32.900
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now he's just full boar because</v>

1096
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't put that back in the bottle.</v>

1097
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's the crazy thing.</v>

1098
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Like Owen was the quintessential</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonpolitical,</v>

1099
00:43:39.201 --> 00:43:42.100
<v Speaker 1>just sort of happy go lucky comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally changed.</v>

1100
00:43:42.101 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And now if you see as act this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know one kind of did that on this</v>

1101
00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:47.840
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1102
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1103
00:43:49.571 --> 00:43:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Like on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about all the</v>

1104
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.520
<v Speaker 1>various things and also he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about his dad being flamboyant and his</v>

1105
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:59.180
<v Speaker 1>mom being kind of masculine and he grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in this weird environment and you</v>

1106
00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:00.014
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

1107
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.390
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's just,</v>

1108
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 1>this is his take on things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1109
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And He loves to talk shit on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves to stir things up and he does</v>

1110
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:10.100
<v Speaker 1>it too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>

1111
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I told him the exact you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1112
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.590
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just take it down.</v>

1113
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Not Love you own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1114
00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1115
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I send them a text the other day.</v>

1116
00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1119
00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.450

<v Speaker 1>You addicted to your phone.</v>

1120
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:26.871
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you're tweeting too much.</v>

1126
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:35.221
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1127
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I got to walk away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1128
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:39.700
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing about your transgender</v>
<v Speaker 2>ism or something,</v>

1129
00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:41.420
<v Speaker 2>it'll be tweeted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess reality from the left and</v>

1130
00:44:41.421 --> 00:44:44.640
<v Speaker 2>progress and then I'll respond and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear anything back and be like,</v>

1131
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Speaker 2>oh sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out chopping trees.</v>

1132
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.350
<v Speaker 2>His brother's an arborist and he helps</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brother.</v>

1133
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 2>It means literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking 20 feet up with the ropes and</v>

1134
00:44:57.211 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shifted me Maple Syrup for Christmas.</v>

1135
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.420
<v Speaker 2>I believe we're is a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The promise with Owen and when we get</v>

1136
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:04.350
<v Speaker 2>into the same room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jared,</v>

1137
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.960
<v Speaker 2>someone else has to manage us because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love him and I,</v>

1138
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I just hate that happened to them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

1139
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you want to have that conversation it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel that he needs to do is do a</v>

1140
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 2>podcast and get his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1141
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.160
<v Speaker 2>just get his stuff out there more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll find his own audience.</v>

1142
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.470
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need all this other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1143
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an illusion in Hollywood that</v>

1144
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:32.040
<v Speaker 2>you need to be cast and things you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be cast a bowl and this castable</v>

1145
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:32.910
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've said this,</v>

1146
00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:38.250
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why I have no actor</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends is because I have a couple that</v>

1147
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm friendly with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as my inner circle of people I hang</v>

1148
00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 2>around with on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comics and fighters,</v>

1149
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.440
<v Speaker 2>just people that I deal in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actors are always trying to get cast</v>

1150
00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 2>in things and there's a dynamic that</v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs when you're always trying to get</v>

1151
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 2>cast in things where you never want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say anything that's controversial.</v>

1152
00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to have any opinions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fit into the standard acceptable,</v>

1153
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 2>digestible Hollywood dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

1154
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's always left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened with Tim Allen?</v>

1155
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.250
<v Speaker 2>He came out as right wing and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>canceled his fucking shit.</v>

1156
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you and fuck your show.</v>

1157
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.320
<v Speaker 2>He was a John case at guy do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be outright.</v>

1158
00:46:15.321 --> 00:46:16.520
<v Speaker 2>John Casick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1159
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:21.710
<v Speaker 2>As big of a pussy as as the Republican</v>
<v Speaker 2>Party as a moderate Republican,</v>

1160
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:23.820
<v Speaker 2>but still right wing enough where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1161
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 2>fuck you to wiener saying you just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to touch a little boy.</v>

1162
00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:30.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like it just ruins your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disappointing and you would fix it.</v>

1163
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'd like a video of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows up on your feet.</v>

1164
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:34.710
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>House of cards.</v>

1165
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Spacey was never crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1166
00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.280
<v Speaker 2>So he's a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different animal.</v>

1167
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I guess I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never met him,</v>

1168
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:47.040
<v Speaker 2>but I guess that has been saying about</v>
<v Speaker 2>him for ever.</v>

1169
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

1170
00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:50.370
<v Speaker 2>This is like what Milo talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1171
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 2>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all very taboo stuff,</v>

1172
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 2>but in the gay community it's far more</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable for a man to be dating a 15,</v>

1173
00:46:57.571 --> 00:47:00.510
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 year old boy that's openly gay,</v>

1174
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1175
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Than it is in the straight community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the straight community have you find</v>

1176
00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 2>out that a 40 year old man is dating a</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 year old girl,</v>

1177
00:47:08.101 --> 00:47:10.620
<v Speaker 2>that guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a piece of shit and he should</v>

1178
00:47:10.621 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 2>be locked in a fucking cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you find out that in the gay</v>

1179
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:15.960
<v Speaker 2>community it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1180
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:20.360
<v Speaker 2>it's different strokes for different</v>
<v Speaker 2>smells.</v>

1181
00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can name you several people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we worked in Canadian TV particular like</v>

1182
00:47:24.021 --> 00:47:25.120
<v Speaker 2>makeup artists who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1183
00:47:25.121 --> 00:47:25.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capable.</v>

1184
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Michelle likes them young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a common thing.</v>

1185
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 2>I am not at all saying that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable.</v>

1186
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:32.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Spacey,</v>

1187
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 2>but what I am saying is what bothers me</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same with the me too campaign like</v>

1188
00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Meryl Streep coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone coming up with the Harvey</v>

1189
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the germ right.</v>

1190
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 2>We all a piece of crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>

1191
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 2>We all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not one person.</v>

1192
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:45.431
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all Kinda like,</v>

1193
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:46.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried to do that with me too.</v>

1194
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Not One person came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1195
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I got three Oscars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it,</v>

1196
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:51.640
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>

1197
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.760
<v Speaker 2>No one admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one just like no one else is saying.</v>

1198
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:55.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1199
00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 2>it's well known secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happens a lot in Hollywood.</v>

1200
00:47:57.401 --> 00:48:00.070
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of guys with young 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old boys.</v>

1201
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>It's super common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to the,</v>

1202
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 2>you go to the right bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evangelists.</v>

1203
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Well the Bryan singer thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1204
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bryan singer,</v>

1205
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:09.970
<v Speaker 2>there's photos of his party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a pool filled with boys like</v>

1206
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's fucked up about is there's</v>

1207
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:14.890
<v Speaker 2>red lights in the pool and we had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>field day with it.</v>

1208
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could imagine where we imagined the</v>

1209
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:23.371
<v Speaker 2>blood came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's literally a red pool filled</v>

1210
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:25.780
<v Speaker 2>with young hairless boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't hiding it.</v>

1211
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

1212
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fully accepted.</v>

1213
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.310
<v Speaker 2>That's why the fake outrage bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1214
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a fake outrage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1215
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the left and Hollywood,</v>

1216
00:48:36.971 --> 00:48:40.330
<v Speaker 2>not America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is outraged that Kevin Spacey</v>

1217
00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Shipping Fourteen Year Old Boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1218
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it wasn't just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what really got Kevin in trouble</v>

1219
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 2>was not just the initial story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then that he was grabbing dicks on</v>

1220
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 2>the set and he was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would get,</v>

1221
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.540
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the red pool.</v>

1222
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on son.</v>

1223
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if that was a bunch of gals and</v>

1224
00:48:56.261 --> 00:49:00.940
<v Speaker 2>you were just excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a boldly painting video for</v>

1225
00:49:00.941 --> 00:49:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all wolverines.</v>

1226
00:49:02.261 --> 00:49:03.094
<v Speaker 2>Next victim.</v>

1227
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what you guys look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the casting party for the first</v>

1228
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:10.640
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1229
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 2>what Milo was saying when he was on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

1230
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 2>which ultimately got him in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble and lost his.</v>

1231
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 2>And then also he's saying it on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>other podcast that he did with the,</v>

1232
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amazing atheist.</v>

1233
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I forget what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call their podcast?</v>

1234
00:49:24.341 --> 00:49:25.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast.</v>

1235
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I just know he got in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scoundrels or something,</v>

1236
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.083
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1237
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Jamie will find him when he comes back</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the.</v>

1238
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just bolted to the bathroom.</v>

1239
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.140
<v Speaker 2>But what he was saying essentially was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you're a young boy and you're</v>

1240
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.450
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a very positive</v>

1241
00:49:40.451 --> 00:49:44.380
<v Speaker 2>relationship with an older man who acts</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a mentor and that was extremely</v>

1242
00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 2>controversial and then ultimately cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1243
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.710
<v Speaker 2>And he was also saying that he had that</v>
<v Speaker 2>done to him on my podcast.</v>

1244
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was young.</v>

1245
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:53.380
<v Speaker 2>He was molested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>

1246
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:54.191
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

1247
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.210
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a predator,</v>

1248
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.010
<v Speaker 2>believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the predatory.</v>

1249
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:57.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1250
00:49:57.511 --> 00:49:58.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference if someone</v>

1251
00:49:58.631 --> 00:50:00.100
<v Speaker 2>doesn't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know where that line is.</v>

1252
00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 2>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1253
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:01.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you were,</v>

1254
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 2>if you try working that out in the club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe me,</v>

1255
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I was a Predator of the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is gonna go from laughing to uh,</v>

1256
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.440
<v Speaker 2>what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1259
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're 14 and you're saying that you</v>

1260
00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:16.240
<v Speaker 2>were the Predator and you're the guy on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

1261
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not the man who's talking about a</v>

1262
00:50:19.001 --> 00:50:22.660
<v Speaker 2>14 year old boy that you want to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about you being 14 and</v>

1263
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:26.430
<v Speaker 2>loving the fact that a priest molested</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and that you went after him.</v>

1264
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1265
00:50:27.911 --> 00:50:28.110
<v Speaker 2>when</v>

1266
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:29.680
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was saying that it was down to</v>

1267
00:50:29.681 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very off putting.</v>

1268
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 1>She's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's wise.</v>

1269
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:40.450
<v Speaker 1>She's an amazing smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What what he does is a lot of it is</v>

1270
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:44.750
<v Speaker 1>stick and like it's sort of like a Gonzo</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism type thing,</v>

1271
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know when.</v>

1272
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Where's the stick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's your real feelings on these</v>

1273
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then where is the distinction</v>

1274
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:56.231
<v Speaker 1>between how some heterosexual people</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this and some gay people look at</v>

1275
00:50:57.231 --> 00:50:59.810
<v Speaker 1>this because I think that the spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>

1276
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Like the spectrum of heterosexual people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think it's acceptable for ground man</v>

1277
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:07.730
<v Speaker 1>to have sex with a 14 year old is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking very small,</v>

1278
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.960
<v Speaker 1>like insanely small backwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1279
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no straight nambla with</v>
<v Speaker 1>political clout.</v>

1280
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1281
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

1282
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 1>no one has a nambla bumper sticker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for isn't real anymore is it stays</v>

1283
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:20.590
<v Speaker 1>real thing.</v>

1284
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone tried to say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something in,</v>

1289

<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the wild progressive left and</v>

1309
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the people who get in line there is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of a contingency today.</v>

<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

1317
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:33.080
<v Speaker 1>None of them are standing up and having</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conversation saying even the highly</v>

1318
00:52:33.081 --> 00:52:36.830
<v Speaker 1>controversial issue of puberty blockers</v>
<v Speaker 1>with with which most people disagree,</v>

1321
00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:44.630
<v Speaker 1>conversation because you have to draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line before puberty blockers.</v>

1322
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.720
<v Speaker 1>You have to draw the line at how far do</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to play along with your</v>

1323
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:48.360

1330
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:05.120
<v Speaker 1>that's what we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were wanting to ask</v>

1331
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 1>her boyfriend discussed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super cool dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Seems like a nice guy.</v>

1333
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Seems like Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're always asking.</v>

1334
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.060
<v Speaker 1>You're asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to.</v>

1335
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.220
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ask questions,</v>

1336
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as they leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they leave the room,</v>

1337
00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you're like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1338
00:53:23.481 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 1>why can't you just ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

1339
00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean open as possible.</v>

1340
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:30.890
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you used to be a man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're a woman.</v>

1341
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 1>He gets on the table now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1342
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could possibly be offensive after</v>

1343
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:36.030
<v Speaker 1>that are more interesting?</v>

1344
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.160
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1345
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.340
<v Speaker 1>the reason is because my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1346
00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.550
<v Speaker 1>my mom who did wardrobe for the just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs,</v>

1347
00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:41.401
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Kagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitcom,</v>

1348
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 1>so she just wardrobe for us now as we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown into these sketches and so Blair</v>

1349
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:48.540
<v Speaker 1>white was the ghost of Christmas past</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this parody that we did and so my</v>

1350
00:53:48.541 --> 00:53:51.180
<v Speaker 1>mom had to go in and do wardrobe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitting.</v>

1351
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 1>So she had some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First question comes back to me.</v>

1352
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:55.801
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1353
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I think she had the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she has that anymore.</v>

1354
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why she?</v>

1355
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Because she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1356
00:54:00.751 --> 00:54:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I did all this work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1357
00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:02.771
<v Speaker 1>but mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could just mean,</v>

1358
00:54:02.771 --> 00:54:05.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she clearly has breasts and lips,</v>

1359
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think.</v>

1360
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1361
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know I don't know what the pants.</v>

1362
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:13.810
<v Speaker 1>When we fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need conversation.</v>

1363
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Speaker 1>That's another hilarious character you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1364
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:19.950

<v Speaker 1>in the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's so funny about Bernie</v>

00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:56.070
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going from DC to Burlington,</v>

1380
00:54:56.071 --> 00:54:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Vermont and he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to you,</v>

1381
00:54:58.201 --> 00:55:03.201
<v Speaker 1>I took a picture on the absolute last</v>
<v Speaker 1>row of economy plus plus where that</v>

1382
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.430
<v Speaker 1>first glass curtain goes by.</v>

1383
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Probably ask for that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can claim it like I don't fly first</v>

1384
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:10.650
<v Speaker 1>class like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're worth $5,000,000.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You said there with 128 gigabyte ipad</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro,</v>

1386
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I could see it because they had the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>beds bevel,</v>

1387
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 1>so I could say like saving all the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with his wife's lawsuit for</v>

1388
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.280
<v Speaker 1>tanking that college in Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that college too.</v>

1389
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That story is fucking crazy that it was</v>

1390
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:30.090
<v Speaker 1>a wild purchasing scheme that that tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the college,</v>

1391
00:55:30.091 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 1>like they decided to expand the land and</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy and they.</v>

1392
00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:34.850
<v Speaker 1>They tanked the college because of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>

1393
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 1>that America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1394
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:39.630
<v Speaker 1>You're overspending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean?</v>

1395
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Why do you sound surprised?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need to do was get a rich</v>

1396
00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 1>people's was fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put on the shirt and they're like,</v>

1397
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to take a picture.</v>

1398
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 1>At this point it was what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like 1230 in the morning.</v>

1399
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.320
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't always that Burlington trinity</v>

1400
00:55:51.321 --> 00:55:56.321
<v Speaker 1>to them all and so I get off the plane</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bernie gets off the plane first</v>

1401
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:59.210
<v Speaker 1>priority plus plus plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't get the free cocktail mine to</v>

<v Speaker 1>get off the plane first done after</v>
<v Speaker 1>firstclass firstclass,</v>

1403
00:56:03.331 --> 00:56:05.100

<v Speaker 1>he gets his second back.</v>

1404
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:05.601
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1405
00:56:05.601 --> 00:56:06.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1406
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.220
<v Speaker 1>First Class and then he's economy plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus plus.</v>

1407
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So first quarter since it first class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first class and everything but name</v>

1408
00:56:12.991 --> 00:56:13.980
<v Speaker 1>only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1409
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:16.080
<v Speaker 1>he says that every debate on like my</v>
<v Speaker 1>opponent,</v>

1410
00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't sit in first class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Right Bernie.</v>

1411
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:21.770
<v Speaker 1>So he gets out first and I walked behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and it was like a,</v>

1412
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

1413
00:56:23.111 --> 00:56:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Brooks in Shawshank redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so old and everyone's walking</v>

1414
00:56:27.051 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 1>down the street and he walks down this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hallway by himself with his ipad pro</v>

1415
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.010
<v Speaker 1>and I remember calling Jerry said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

1416
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get.</v>

1417
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It's 1230 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy looks like he's at death's door</v>

1418
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.160
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't want to be that jerk a</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner and I just wanted to talk with</v>

1419
00:56:39.161 --> 00:56:40.630
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't gonna Sandbag him,</v>

1420
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:43.810
<v Speaker 1>but he looked so it was so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1421
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:47.170
<v Speaker 1>his posture so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His next sits in the middle of his</v>

1422
00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 1>sternum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Burton.</v>

1423
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1424
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:52.181
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1425
00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you got to sit up straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not healthy.</v>

1426
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.890
<v Speaker 1>You got to be in pain all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your head is like that low,</v>

1427
00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.810
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to do the blue economy.</v>

1428
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.030
<v Speaker 1>You got to get that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That blocks.</v>

1429
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 1>They could pay for my physical therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lifetime income inequality.</v>

1430
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:09.780
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a few bugs.</v>

1431
00:57:09.781 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 1>We're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1432
00:57:10.631 --> 00:57:14.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I liked about him was that what he</v>

1433
00:57:14.671 --> 00:57:17.650
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed like a uniting force with</v>

1434
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 1>white people and black people.</v>

1435
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:22.900
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing interviews with killer Mike</v>

1436
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.300
<v Speaker 1>even though he's anti gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1437
00:57:25.301 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 1>and Mike is Super Pro gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1438
00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that people are</v>

1439
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.180
<v Speaker 1>embracing this crazy old guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the stage,</v>

1440
00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 1>the stage was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh right.</v>

1441
00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.900
<v Speaker 1>So you mean he was the guiding force</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of</v>

1442
00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.890
<v Speaker 1>that was that was not the platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

1443
00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.700
<v Speaker 1>if they wanted to have a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have had a meeting.</v>

1444
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't just jump up and mix it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>White House office right now.</v>

1445
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President,</v>

1446
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 1>president now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1447
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1448
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 1>even if you have people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic socialist who were on board</v>

1449
00:57:57.341 --> 00:57:58.990
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of people who were pro</v>

1450
00:57:58.991 --> 00:58:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Bernie who then changed because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

1451
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 1>well then he went full sjw in the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives matter feminism and that's why I</v>

1452
00:58:04.931 --> 00:58:09.250
<v Speaker 1>say even if you find a leftish and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody believes that,</v>

1453
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 1>like you're saying when you're in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>town halls and they don't know that they</v>

1454
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:15.610
<v Speaker 1>all agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is a monolith and like that's</v>

1455
00:58:15.611 --> 00:58:15.970
<v Speaker 1>what they say.</v>

1456
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.460
<v Speaker 1>You're right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the truth is you could be</v>

1457
00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 1>considered right wing just like he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1458
00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I could just like Jordan Peterson could</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like my local,</v>

1459
00:58:21.911 --> 00:58:24.220
<v Speaker 1>just like mentioned and all of us have</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildly differing views.</v>

1460
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:26.320
<v Speaker 1>If you were to check the box off with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cenk,</v>

1461
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton who take your pick,</v>

1462
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 1>they will check the same boxes because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to and I think that's why</v>

1463
00:58:32.981 --> 00:58:35.320
<v Speaker 1>they're losing so much ground culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the boxes are shifting to,</v>

1464
00:58:35.321 --> 00:58:38.230
<v Speaker 1>so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the right side is expanding all</v>

1465
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.580
<v Speaker 1>the different boxes you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

1466
00:58:39.581 --> 00:58:42.040
<v Speaker 1>The left is shrinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get in line with these</v>

1467
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1468
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:46.960
<v Speaker 1>we need have a real center in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country does not have a real center and</v>

1469
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that drives people to the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the right.</v>

1470
00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a big issue or there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much toxic tribal</v>

1471
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:55.714
<v Speaker 1>thinking here.</v>

1472
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I just think when you truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like that.</v>

1473
00:58:57.741 --> 00:58:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Something that to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're left or right,</v>

1474
00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:03.640
<v Speaker 1>just don't lie to me and the left has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been able to lie to everyone because</v>

1475
00:59:03.641 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 1>they've controlled the information</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery for a long time.</v>

1476
00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds conspiratorial and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right.</v>

1477
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like what we're talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Allen.</v>

1478
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1479
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what we're talking about with</v>

1480
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:16.510
<v Speaker 1>actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you talk to most actors when it comes</v>

1481
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 1>to anything political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're almost all left wing.</v>

1482
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:21.270
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how the.</v>

1483
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1484
00:59:22.551 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a few people like we've had,</v>

1485
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Gary sinise and the show.</v>

1486
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.000
<v Speaker 1>We've had some bigger name actress where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have screw you money,</v>

1487
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just the nicest guy ever where</v>

1488
00:59:30.331 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even talk about politics.</v>

1489
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:35.840
<v Speaker 1>He just builds these smart homes for</v>
<v Speaker 1>veterans just because he's like a saint,</v>

1490
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.970
<v Speaker 1>but there are other actors that we can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even necessarily name who were like,</v>

1491
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd really like to do the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't yet when I get to this stage</v>

1492
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 1>of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've probably heard from</v>

1493
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:46.490
<v Speaker 1>those people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid.</v>

1494
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:47.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1495
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had people like that that say I</v>

1496
00:59:49.601 --> 00:59:51.010
<v Speaker 1>want to go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1497
00:59:51.011 --> 00:59:51.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1498
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.130
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1499
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.370
<v Speaker 1>let's film it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1500
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1501
00:59:56.121 --> 00:59:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't want people to know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get your food.</v>

1502
00:59:58.161 --> 00:59:58.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1503
00:59:58.701 --> 01:00:01.440
<v Speaker 1>97 percent of the country eats meat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1504
01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:03.170
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that high on that high?</v>

1505
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're paying for it,</v>

1506
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're paying for the murder,</v>

1507
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you're cool with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not cool with doing it</v>

1508
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1509
01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:10.191
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1510
01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally cool with that.</v>

1511
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want anybody else to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1512
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's part of the problem because</v>

1513
01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:19.610
<v Speaker 1>people don't want anybody else to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it becomes so scary and taboo</v>

1514
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>and very few people come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1515
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1516
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of the same thing because</v>

1517
01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like you not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not willing to express your</v>

1518
01:00:27.861 --> 01:00:30.740
<v Speaker 1>authentic self will and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university like we're going to be at</v>

1519
01:00:30.741 --> 01:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Virginia Tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it sixth a week from today,</v>

1520
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>a week from today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and already people lined getting ready</v>

1521
01:00:35.181 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>on facebook to protest and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1522
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>you haven't even seen the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what it is.</v>

1523
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:41.330
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the show on the road and broadcast</v>

1524
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:41.931
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1525
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just a powder keg because no one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to think differently.</v>

1526
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Picture collegiate campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the left.</v>

1527
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>That's their utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1528
01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you brought us something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1529
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1530
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>change the way people look at social</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors.</v>

1531
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>That lady that was in the audience in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amherst was puff.</v>

1532
01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>That was like a gift from the heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That poor gal.</v>

1533
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.940
<v Speaker 1>It was like somebody created the</v>
<v Speaker 1>caricature.</v>

1534
01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>You assume her gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did</v>

1535
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>confident I'm a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when she was screaming at you,</v>

1536
01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not real.</v>

1537
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rex,</v>

1538
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>this is not x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's even worse.</v>

1539
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not real.</v>

1540
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>This can't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman's not really.</v>

1541
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>This is like a caricature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

1542
01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>this is a Michael J.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox movie from the eighties.</v>

1543
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:38.031
<v Speaker 1>Were you like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

1544
01:01:38.031 --> 01:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1545
01:01:39.131 --> 01:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you remember how stressed I was about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because here's the deal.</v>

1546
01:01:41.701 --> 01:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Like this is my first time I was there.</v>

1547
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It was Milo and Christina Hoff summers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at this point,</v>

1548
01:01:45.051 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I only remember you should use a mac or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a coca cola when you went to college</v>

1549
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>back when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was my experience with colleges</v>

1550
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.600
<v Speaker 1>and I hated it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the first time I know now that</v>

1551
01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be protesting to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant degree,</v>

1552
01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just wanted to go out and do their</v>

1553
01:01:59.061 --> 01:01:59.811
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do some,</v>

1554
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:00.441
<v Speaker 1>like I was telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1555
01:02:00.441 --> 01:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I do here because like</v>

1556
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to speak and lecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to do just,</v>

1557
01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 20 minute set,</v>

1558
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really tough because if,</v>

1559
01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't acknowledge the Heckler,</v>

1560
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>if you don't acknowledge the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you come out and it's just</v>

1561
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>ugly puff who doesn't have enough middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers to give.</v>

1562
01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I've never given anyone that figure from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage.</v>

1563
01:02:16.401 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I've never gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>

1564
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized immediately I'm not gonna be</v>

1565
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>able to do stand</v>

1566
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the ramp that went viral,</v>

1567
01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:23.510
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1568
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to do my set and then</v>

1569
01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:29.550
<v Speaker 2>afterwards we'll do a q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't allow it and I just saw</v>

1570
01:02:29.551 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 2>her and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't.</v>

1571
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 2>She looked like the abroad from Monsters</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inc at the front desk.</v>

1572
01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I was just laugh like she really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1573
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 2>just show and everyone wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

1574
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was my parents who maybe said</v>

1575
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 2>this to me when I was young and I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocky about something at one point and</v>

1576
01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ever Brag because it it,</v>

1577
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps us from being able to brag for</v>

1578
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let someone else do it.</v>

1579
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1580
01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with strictly.</v>

1581
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Did they say it with an accent?</v>

1582
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.470
<v Speaker 2>We don't get to brag for you that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>had within this.</v>

1583
01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.313
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1584
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:02.970
<v Speaker 2>so she had the work done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll think about this if truly puff</v>

1585
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:07.650
<v Speaker 2>didn't come out there and probably for</v>
<v Speaker 2>about eight seconds,</v>

1586
01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:08.580
<v Speaker 2>she took it out pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1587
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 2>her dash didn't have the stamina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs carbs.</v>

1588
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 2>If she didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would always sit in.</v>

1589
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:15.720
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about how if we just saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1590
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.180
<v Speaker 2>how we feel bad for her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1591
01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1592
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:19.100
<v Speaker 2>that girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope she gets it,</v>

1593
01:03:19.101 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel it would be sympathetic,</v>

1594
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.400
<v Speaker 2>but you prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you preclude us from being empathetic</v>

1595
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.310
<v Speaker 2>when you act like an absolute piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1596
01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Your whole life threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden we've shut off this</v>

1597
01:03:30.061 --> 01:03:33.120
<v Speaker 2>empathy for people because of the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>they behave.</v>

1598
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 2>We would all be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

1599
01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 2>poor girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope she finds a guy.</v>

1600
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she'll find a guy who likes</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1601
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and you know,</v>

1602
01:03:38.221 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 2>she'll cheat and get it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

1603
01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some people turn it around,</v>

1604
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 2>but when she does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>

1605
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand speed.</v>

1606
01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.091
<v Speaker 2>Boldest hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1607
01:03:44.091 --> 01:03:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was so ridiculous that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

1608
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously I wasn't in the room while</v>

1609
01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:51.960
<v Speaker 2>she was screaming at me while I was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stage.</v>

1610
01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I probably would have been furious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sitting back watching it from the</v>

1611
01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:57.090
<v Speaker 2>comfort of my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching it on Youtube,</v>

1612
01:03:57.091 --> 01:03:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck happened?</v>

1613
01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 2>That's poor kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just like,</v>

1614
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:04.100
<v Speaker 2>this is used to be someone you know as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who has a daughter,</v>

1615
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:07.020
<v Speaker 2>so like this is someone's baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then became this,</v>

1616
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.570
<v Speaker 2>like someone didn't pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

1617
01:04:09.571 --> 01:04:13.800
<v Speaker 2>They fed her bad food and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's there by herself.</v>

1618
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole thing was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep your hate speech off.</v>

1619
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.140
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1620
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff summers by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't be a nicer person and it was</v>

1621
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.420
<v Speaker 2>so funny watching her with you and Milo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's like,</v>

1622
01:04:24.421 --> 01:04:25.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that.</v>

1623
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islams stuff got.</v>

1624
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.060
<v Speaker 2>She got uncomfortable because on there</v>
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't be a nicer lady.</v>

1625
01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I really love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's really sweet.</v>

1626
01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:35.670
<v Speaker 2>We'll think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were on there.</v>

1627
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.170
<v Speaker 2>She's basically kind of a lifelong</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats</v>

1628
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 2>branded right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's branded all right.</v>

1629
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 2>She is a super feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she calls herself the factual</v>

1630
01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:49.170
<v Speaker 2>feminist and her idea is that when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>distort reality,</v>

1631
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:51.300
<v Speaker 2>when you start biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start facts,</v>

1632
01:04:51.301 --> 01:04:54.780
<v Speaker 2>you are doing your cause a disservice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is her cause.</v>

1633
01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Being an actual feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a real feminist and she doesn't</v>

1634
01:04:57.841 --> 01:04:59.310
<v Speaker 2>think there's anything wrong with being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman.</v>

1635
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't think there's anything wrong</v>

1636
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:04.310
<v Speaker 2>with wearing dresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting on makeup and lipstick.</v>

1637
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:05.580
<v Speaker 2>You're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1638
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.250
<v Speaker 2>probably two boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't check in the left column,</v>

1639
01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.320
<v Speaker 2>therefore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1641
01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with not doing that either.</v>

1642
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.660
<v Speaker 2>She's very open minded but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she calls bullshit and because she</v>

1643
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:22.600
<v Speaker 2>calls bullshit on that group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's shoved into this fucking Nazi</v>

1644
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:24.470
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so crazy to me.</v>

1645
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the danger with that is let's say 10</v>

1646
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:27.760
<v Speaker 2>years down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1647
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.880
<v Speaker 2>you refer to me as not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you refer to Joe Rogan is a Nazi,</v>

1648
01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>not as a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff summers.</v>

1649
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.590
<v Speaker 2>You know what happens is when you refer</v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone as a Nazi for reasonable use</v>

1650
01:05:35.591 --> 01:05:37.510
<v Speaker 2>for just long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start saying,</v>

1651
01:05:37.511 --> 01:05:38.081
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1652
01:05:38.081 --> 01:05:41.890
<v Speaker 2>let's go with Nazi and people actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for the pendulum swings further the</v>

1653
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>other way.</v>

1654
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're seeing with Europe</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1655
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.670
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing what this far right rise</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>

1656
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like spend computer who works for us.</v>

1657
01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:48.760
<v Speaker 2>We brought them over from Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

1658
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain point for young people</v>

1659
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:51.910
<v Speaker 2>don't want to go to every museum and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1660
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>we suck because it had nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

1661
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.950
<v Speaker 2>He was in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pay 65 percent income tax if you're</v>

1662
01:05:56.951 --> 01:06:00.790
<v Speaker 2>under the age of 30 school is free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

1663
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:04.540
<v Speaker 2>For a 65 percent it's 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but spend was telling us there's some</v>

1664
01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:06.490
<v Speaker 2>additional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically 65 percent and it's</v>

1665
01:06:06.491 --> 01:06:08.680
<v Speaker 2>entirely based on your age bracket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're under 30,</v>

1666
01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you pay 65 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your effective tax rate.</v>

1667
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:16.270
<v Speaker 2>So you have these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money that hurts.</v>

1668
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what you see.</v>

1669
01:06:17.591 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 2>You see this far right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rising Europe,</v>

1670
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 2>because if you call someone a Nazi for</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long,</v>

1671
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:21.051
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1672
01:06:21.051 --> 01:06:21.430
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>

1673
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want Paris to become a</v>

1674
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:24.814
<v Speaker 2>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>

1675
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1676
01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:29.380
<v Speaker 2>when you go from calling someone a Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you see Charlottesville,</v>

1677
01:06:29.381 --> 01:06:31.350
<v Speaker 2>when you see guys with Nazi tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

1678
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:33.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's not exactly.</v>

1679
01:06:33.691 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 2>This is a real Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a moron with a swastika tattooed</v>

1680
01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:42.421
<v Speaker 2>on his chest and a dodge challenger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this craziness left and right.</v>

1681
01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hoping it settles and what you</v>

1682
01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:48.010
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truth.</v>

1683
01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truth.</v>

1684
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's where I always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1685
01:06:51.901 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I know people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get upset.</v>

1686
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think truth is necessarily in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle.</v>

1687
01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I think truth is truth and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really far to the right and</v>

1688
01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:01.180
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there's much truth in</v>

1689
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 2>today's progressive left now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an ideological war going</v>

1690
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 2>on and I think especially with trump in</v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

1691
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:10.420
<v Speaker 2>they feel like the gloves are off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all rules are out the window and</v>

1692
01:07:10.421 --> 01:07:11.254
<v Speaker 2>anything goes.</v>

1693
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are flabbergasted and.</v>

1694
01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling Jamie before the show like</v>

1695
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1696
01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not without my criticisms for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to admit every time stuff just</v>

1697
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:26.170
<v Speaker 2>rolls off his back like water on a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start fucking laughing like they were</v>

1698
01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 2>like the stormy Daniels thing is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sink them.</v>

1699
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine who's who's gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's the nicest guy in the world,</v>

1700
01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:33.940
<v Speaker 2>but he's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1701
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:36.200
<v Speaker 2>that's our Monica Lewinsky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's harmonically.</v>

1702
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1704
01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:39.900
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna.</v>

1705
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna disappear in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago.</v>

1706
01:07:41.381 --> 01:07:43.660
<v Speaker 2>We're in a 10 hour new cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand this?</v>

1707
01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 2>I go in 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some new shit comes along and nobody</v>

1708

<v Speaker 2>and nobody gives a fuck about this guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a new guy and there's a new</v>

<v Speaker 2>this porn star thing is not going to</v>

1713
01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 2>sink him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to deny it.</v>

1714
01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Fake News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake nose and he's going to keep moving</v>

1715
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.980
<v Speaker 2>and there's going to be nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1716
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what happened with</v>

1717
01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:10.630
<v Speaker 2>that exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me I remember I just was like,</v>

1718
01:08:10.631 --> 01:08:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I got a disconnect for a bit because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been just going,</v>

1719
01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:12.911
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

1720
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 2>So I disconnected and like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>popped my head in for half a day</v>

1721
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>just because we're moving to a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>studio,</v>

1722
01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>kind of like you've been doing and upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head it was like,</v>

1723
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:19.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the news?</v>

1724
01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>What's this outrage right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I need to know about Donald Trump?</v>

1725
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1726
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called a Haiti a shit hole.</v>

1727
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I just popped my head back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1728
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1729
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 1>No one cares anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course Haiti is that.</v>

1730
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:33.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you hate Haitians said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do these people from these shithole</v>

1731
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>countries want to come here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a supposedly said.</v>

1732
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>He says he didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say he did.</v>

1733
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Other people say he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1734
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.340
<v Speaker 1>So we're in a weird quagmire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he says he did,</v>

1735
01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1736
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not the appropriate thing for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the United States to say,</v>

1737
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>but does it make sense that Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say that?</v>

1738
01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1739
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1740
01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to know how you know it's a</v>

1741
01:08:55.971 --> 01:08:59.210
<v Speaker 1>shit hole because French Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the most racist people you will</v>

1742
01:08:59.211 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 1>find love you mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they create these French laws.</v>

1743
01:09:01.581 --> 01:09:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pure land.</v>

1744
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It means pure wool because they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of all the anglophone.</v>

1745
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then they had a huge Asian</v>

1746
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 1>immigration because there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and people from Cameroon,</v>

1747
01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.420
<v Speaker 1>special diseases because of inbreeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were furious.</v>

1748
01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:14.020
<v Speaker 1>So they try to create laws to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitians out because they were.</v>

1749
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It was just a clash of cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

1750
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Haiti is whether Donald trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senator not as a country,</v>

1751
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:23.900
<v Speaker 1>a shitty place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think anyone cares anymore.</v>

1752
01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.750
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't mean I hate Haitians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean I'm not empathetic to them,</v>

1753
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.690
<v Speaker 1>but fortunate that they're in a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1754
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but how is it racist if especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're criticizing a government which</v>

1755
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:35.840
<v Speaker 1>comprises of black people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>screwing a black citizenry.</v>

1756
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing it for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never gotten rain.</v>

1757
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Wilson took a picture from sandals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickled pitcher from Club Med sandals.</v>

1758
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even know what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1759
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>The resort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>

1760
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bahamas,</v>

1761
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I think Jamaica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those places.</v>

1762
01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:57.110
<v Speaker 1>No locale and all the other shit holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1763
01:09:57.111 --> 01:09:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where I think</v>

1764
01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump has allowed people and we</v>

1765
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:04.880
<v Speaker 1>weren't trump people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got so much flak from the outright</v>

1766
01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.830
<v Speaker 1>because we didn't support them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

1767
01:10:06.831 --> 01:10:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And you were more in support of a Ted</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruz,</v>

1768
01:10:09.561 --> 01:10:10.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1769
01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll let Carly Fiorina and Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ben Carson a little bit,</v>

1770
01:10:15.471 --> 01:10:16.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was hysterical.</v>

1771
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's like,</v>

1772
01:10:19.501 --> 01:10:20.450
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1773
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.120
<v Speaker 1>he's like a Jim Henson care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing was him with Jesus.</v>

1774
01:10:23.121 --> 01:10:26.830
<v Speaker 1>The painting that Jesus on his shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1775
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.710
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

1776
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:30.680
<v Speaker 1>neurosurgeon during an absolute genius</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>

1777
01:10:30.681 --> 01:10:34.840
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have the sense of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit.</v>

1778
01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson said something that's</v>

1779
01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:40.070
<v Speaker 1>very brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said there is absolutely no</v>

1780
01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:42.440
<v Speaker 1>correlation with being smart and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>

1781
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1782
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking smart things,</v>

1783
01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 1>but they are not wise in terms of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they behave and how they think and how</v>

1784
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:56.381
<v Speaker 1>they conduct their life and whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not they pay for a Jesus painting their</v>

1785
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:58.310
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look like Jesus.</v>

1786
01:10:58.311 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a Puerto Rican</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude is slinging tacos.</v>

1787
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

1788
01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:07.520
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just knew this guy up here.</v>

1789
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1790
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's new.</v>

1791
01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.200
<v Speaker 1>We um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to have stars,</v>

1792
01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the panels were too</v>

1793
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 2>dark in this room because the lighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>is different here.</v>

1794
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:20.130
<v Speaker 2>So we change them to clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got The American flag into that.</v>

1795
01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:23.610
<v Speaker 2>So people also think you're right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about America or when do you ever</v>

1796
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 2>see a leftist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.900
<v Speaker 2>When do you ever see the current</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive leftist with patriotic</v>

1798
01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:31.650
<v Speaker 2>symbolism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually have a American flag,</v>

1799
01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:34.530
<v Speaker 2>a case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I ordered one for the iphone x and I</v>

1800
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>didn't get it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1801
01:11:36.151 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I love America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think America represents a beautiful</v>

1802
01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 2>place of opportunity and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect,</v>

1803
01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's the best place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to a lot of different places.</v>

1804
01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:45.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think there's something wrong</v>

1805
01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 2>with being patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're fucking crazy.</v>

1806
01:11:47.581 --> 01:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think America represents the</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst aspects of us.</v>

1807
01:11:50.071 --> 01:11:55.071
<v Speaker 2>I think it represents possibility and</v>
<v Speaker 2>promise and that you have this ability</v>

1808
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 2>to do whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

1809
01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 2>There's not a class structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can literally go from the bottom to</v>

1810
01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:01.210
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

1811
01:12:01.211 --> 01:12:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1812
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.660
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever the fuck you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do in this country.</v>

1813
01:12:03.661 --> 01:12:06.030
<v Speaker 2>There's some restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say it's not a free country.</v>

1814
01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Canada.</v>

1815
01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:09.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more fucking free than Canada</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Canada.</v>

1816
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 2>You can go to jail for not using</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's preferred gender.</v>

1817
01:12:12.841 --> 01:12:17.841
<v Speaker 2>Pronouns is a case that just was out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago where some woman had</v>

1818
01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 2>a sign and it was a it and they boiled</v>
<v Speaker 2>it down to like one word,</v>

1819
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:27.780
<v Speaker 2>but her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her sign said that I'm a transgender</v>

1820
01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:32.340
<v Speaker 2>woman is a man and you're just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel something like that.</v>

1821
01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:36.120
<v Speaker 2>It does not overtake biology and</v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis like long thing.</v>

1822
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm just transgenders person wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>file a human rights violation case</v>

1823
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:46.281
<v Speaker 2>against her and get her arrested and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that the only way this person would</v>

1824
01:12:46.561 --> 01:12:50.850
<v Speaker 2>not would be willing to not do that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>b would be to sit down with this woman</v>

1825
01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:53.160
<v Speaker 2>and have coffee with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained to her why she's wrong.</v>

1826
01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't think she's wrong,</v>

1827
01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.440
<v Speaker 2>so that's where you can't just decide</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this person has to act.</v>

1828
01:12:57.441 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 2>We ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to give into your particular</v>

1829
01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:03.180
<v Speaker 2>ideology and your line of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it's hate speech.</v>

1830
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.480
<v Speaker 2>That's not the answer like the answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1831
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:10.050
<v Speaker 2>If you think someone's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is proving them wrong.</v>

1832
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Having a conversation about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some someone deciding that not only</v>

1833
01:13:14.311 --> 01:13:16.180
<v Speaker 2>is it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to lock you up for it,</v>

1834
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 2>sue you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1835
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think especially with that Trudeau</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy up there like,</v>

1836
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deepen,</v>

1837
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.180
<v Speaker 2>remove a couple of bucks and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could've just to run for office with</v>

1838
01:13:27.181 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 2>that speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very inspiring.</v>

1839
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I could probably get up there and be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could be a Canadian.</v>

1840
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:34.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan,</v>

1841
01:13:34.561 --> 01:13:37.210
<v Speaker 2>but they've got a few problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1842
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 2>the first person ever voted for was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephen Harper.</v>

1843
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the deal back then.</v>

1844
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm open about it.</v>

1845
01:13:42.091 --> 01:13:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>

1846
01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 2>everyone who harper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven Harper was prime minister before</v>

1847
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Trudeau.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Stephen Harper is the Canadian</v>

1848
01:13:47.281 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be like a little left to</v>

1849
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.070
<v Speaker 2>have John Casick here in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's there,</v>

1850
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Megan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of heard that he was.</v>

1851
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have the housing bubble</v>

1852
01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.470
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't do the subprime</v>
<v Speaker 2>loans.</v>

1853
01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Candidate was doing really well for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time was hiring the economic</v>

1854
01:14:01.621 --> 01:14:04.560
<v Speaker 2>freedom index in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I voted for him and everyone hated him.</v>

1855
01:14:04.561 --> 01:14:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he was a practicing Christian</v>

1856
01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 2>conservative who believed in some form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of limited government.</v>

1857
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they have trudeau.</v>

1858
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.633
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1859
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I remember Steven Watson was a pastor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I talked about this a lot and this</v>

1860
01:14:15.281 --> 01:14:17.020
<v Speaker 1>was a slippery slope thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a no,</v>

1861
01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:17.471
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

1862
01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you're just crazy religious nutbag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Steven Wilson was a pastor who</v>

1863
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I think was jailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He certainly was fine just because he</v>

1864
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what the laws of the land.</v>

1865
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to marry two men in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>congregation.</v>

1866
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to recognize that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

1867
01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you agree with them or not.</v>

1868
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:33.060
<v Speaker 1>This was years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1869
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:35.260
<v Speaker 1>people in the left back then supporting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because like,</v>

1870
01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only affects the,</v>

1871
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>the Christian pastor doesn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>marry dudes.</v>

1872
01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Beckon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now it doesn't.</v>

1873
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Now it affects the person who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're born a man,</v>

1874
01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>you're a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it affects Mike Ward,</v>

1875
01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:45.680
<v Speaker 1>the comedian who was put before human</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights tribunal for making fun of the</v>

1876
01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>make a wish kid foundation.</v>

1877
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

1878
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point you have to draw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and we want to decide that we're</v>

1879
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 1>going to draw the line when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

1880
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:56.940
<v Speaker 1>puberty blockers or do we draw the line</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone tries to strangle Ben</v>

1881
01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro and the Dr drew show because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>implies that the guy with a penis is</v>

1882
01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 1>still a man still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

1883
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>That was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a rough one because the guy was</v>

1884
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:08.950
<v Speaker 1>literally threatening violence and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was okay because Ben had ms dot</v>

1885
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:10.590
<v Speaker 1>gendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him and they cared have to have been</v>

1886
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:10.841
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1887
01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:11.411
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you knew that was gonna not only touched</v>

1889
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:16.210

<v Speaker 1>putting his hands on him,</v>

1890
01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.670
<v Speaker 1>which is very threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone's threatening me and they're</v>

1891
01:15:18.671 --> 01:15:20.760
<v Speaker 1>putting their hands on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on def con nine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>bitch?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're gripping me and holding me and</v>

1897
01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:31.390
<v Speaker 1>you're way bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was way girl.</v>

1898
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Shit way bigger than Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ben's Ben was fucking strong.</v>

1899
01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.190
<v Speaker 1>That seems wildly inappropriate is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those guys</v>

1900
01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 1>were sitting there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

1901
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.240
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1902
01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.870
<v Speaker 1>if you don't sound like the joker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wind up.</v>

1903
01:15:46.871 --> 01:15:47.920
<v Speaker 1>If you don't speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want it.</v>

1904
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:49.420
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go home in an ambulance.</v>

1905
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to beat me up because I</v>

1906
01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:54.170
<v Speaker 1>say the wrong word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1907
01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1908
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 1>You were a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like the clubber Lang of trainees</v>

1909
01:15:59.010 --> 01:16:00.760
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that I got</v>

1910
01:16:00.761 --> 01:16:03.220
<v Speaker 1>into it with someone online about Fallon</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox.</v>

1911
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said she was always a woman.</v>

1912
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1913
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got a man.</v>

1914
01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.910
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a penis.</v>

1915
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 1>She used to be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got a woman pregnant and had a kid</v>

1916
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:15.640
<v Speaker 1>with that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1917
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:17.050
<v Speaker 1>was she a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she goes,</v>

1918
01:16:17.051 --> 01:16:18.520
<v Speaker 1>even then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>

1919
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:19.890
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in.</v>

1920
01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:20.920
<v Speaker 1>We're in Narnia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1921
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:25.510
<v Speaker 1>documented that a woman is to youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't expect that.</v>

1922
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1923
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's cool if you get your</v>
<v Speaker 1>penis removed to beat the fuck out of</v>

1924
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:35.650
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like that's a safe thing to</v>

1925
01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:38.310
<v Speaker 1>start</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a contribution.</v>

1926
01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.270
<v Speaker 1>People like you're a bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1927
01:16:40.271 --> 01:16:41.680
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1928
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should at least tell them.</v>

1929
01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:46.030
<v Speaker 1>They used to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1930
01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:49.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a medical procedure and it has no</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis whatsoever on your physical</v>

1931
01:16:49.331 --> 01:16:50.164
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1932
01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.720
<v Speaker 1>well that's not even structurally true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make any sense.</v>

1933
01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:55.310
<v Speaker 1>The physical body's built differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1934
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if brock lesnar decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a woman?</v>

1935
01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Just just imagine just not enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone blockers in the world.</v>

1936
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Keep that and then they didn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell anybody.</v>

1937
01:17:03.221 --> 01:17:04.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a medical procedure.</v>

1938
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.600
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't want you to tell people you have</v>

1939
01:17:07.601 --> 01:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>aged so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a penis as much.</v>

1940
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:13.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the one you're on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chad with not wonderful.</v>

1941
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It used to be a felony and now it should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1942
01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know you have a fatal disease and</v>

1943
01:17:20.031 --> 01:17:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you fuck someone in the but without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>condom,</v>

1944
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.400
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'd read pool party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can't just be.</v>

1945
01:17:25.401 --> 01:17:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be transferred by playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spin the bottle.</v>

1946
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the guy who authored</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1947
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The folsom street fair with the little</v>

1948
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>leather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Bryan singer Pool Party.</v>

1949
01:17:35.301 --> 01:17:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

1950
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It's hysterical that that guy pass that</v>
<v Speaker 1>through its people weren't paying</v>

1951
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's crazy.</v>

1952
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't care if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if it's aids or if you</v>

1953
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 1>could give someone cancer you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have cancer and you know,</v>

1954
01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it was a communicable disease</v>

1955
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.080
<v Speaker 1>and you decided to make out with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't have cancer and he gave it</v>

1956
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:56.450
<v Speaker 1>to them like fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just killed somebody.</v>

1957
01:17:56.451 --> 01:18:00.020
<v Speaker 1>You just smoked a pipe and kissed me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I have a soft skull cancer.</v>

1958
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:03.000
<v Speaker 1>The bigger conversation on that too is</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1959
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 1>like obviously it's not fatal anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of protease inhibitors and all</v>

1960
01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:10.160
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just compared age to cancer was</v>

1961
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:12.320
<v Speaker 1>once a day where you could just compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>aids to aids.</v>

1962
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to Callie's the gay cancer,</v>

1963
01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when aids first came out.</v>

1964
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:18.620
<v Speaker 1>They called it the gay cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1965
01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:20.120
<v Speaker 1>we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a thing on that where we did a</v>

1966
01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 1>defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a show wishbone.</v>

1967
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.520
<v Speaker 1>We did a parody with our dog hopper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did the AIDS epidemic and the AIDS</v>

1968
01:18:25.521 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 1>epidemic was always a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was never an epidemic.</v>

1969
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Basically if you were not doing heroin</v>
<v Speaker 1>with dirty needles or having unprotected</v>

1970
01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 1>sex with George Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were pretty much safe.</v>

1971
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 1>People got so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew it.</v>

1972
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just.</v>

1973
01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:37.970
<v Speaker 1>People knew what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the kinison bit?</v>

1974
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

1975
01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>The kid isn't bit hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1976
01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.080
<v Speaker 1>so we had a guy who came on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually very civil who disagreed</v>

1977
01:18:44.081 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 1>with by the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just said,</v>

1978
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:46.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it just disagreed because the</v>

1979
01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:48.300
<v Speaker 1>way you said it was so incendiary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

1980
01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:51.080
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it in Cindy or I am the one</v>

1981
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 1>actually trying to prevent people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting aids.</v>

1982
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:56.690
<v Speaker 1>There are very specific patterns of</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior that you avoid.</v>

1983
01:18:57.170 --> 01:18:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't have gang protected sex and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck stop.</v>

1984
01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't do heroin and the East village</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rent.</v>

1985
01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Where ever wanting to be rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever see that movie?</v>

1986
01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm straight.</v>

1987
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I was crying at rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1988
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 1>and like every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single person was doing heroin and</v>

1989
01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.840
<v Speaker 1>the East village and having unprotected</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with each other.</v>

1990
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.350
<v Speaker 1>If you make it past noon without getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>aids,</v>

1991
01:19:17.351 --> 01:19:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you're on borrowed time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how am I?</v>

1992
01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel bad for you at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had people,</v>

1993
01:19:21.351 --> 01:19:24.290
<v Speaker 1>they give us so much flack over the aids</v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemic and none of them disagreed with</v>

1994
01:19:24.291 --> 01:19:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not supposed to say it.</v>

1995
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Think about that for a second though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue with that folsom street fair,</v>

1996
01:19:29.781 --> 01:19:31.550
<v Speaker 1>a senator or congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1997
01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy with the beautiful leather</v>
<v Speaker 1>vest.</v>

1998
01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.730
<v Speaker 1>No shirt on underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wander through the streets with a tire</v>

1999
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:40.070
<v Speaker 1>around his neck that looks suspiciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a leash.</v>

2000
01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:42.880
<v Speaker 1>It was a hot topic discount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Donald Trump had got</v>

2001
01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Speaker 1>on sale at the hello kitty backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his argument,</v>

2002
01:19:48.891 --> 01:19:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2003
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:51.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these laws,</v>

2004
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.970
<v Speaker 1>only these disclosure laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2005
01:19:52.971 --> 01:19:54.890
<v Speaker 1>for people who don't know what means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to disclose that you have aids</v>

2006
01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:56.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're having sex with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2007
01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 1>These was only served to stigmatize</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2008
01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it mean that we cannot stigmatize</v>

2009
01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:07.410
<v Speaker 1>anyone or anything ever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot stigmatize Abe's,</v>

2010
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2011
01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't mean we hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we consciously delivering it into</v>

2012
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:13.530
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

2013
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.510
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like being aware.</v>

2014
01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:16.940
<v Speaker 2>At what point are we okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stigmatized,</v>

2015
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what does it take to say like,</v>

2016
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:20.010
<v Speaker 2>well you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2017
01:20:20.011 --> 01:20:23.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should stigmatize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I were to use an absurd example in a</v>

2018
01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:24.090
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be like,</v>

2019
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should stigmatize knowingly</v>

2020
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 2>transferring aids to somebody through</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprotected sex as a goof.</v>

2021
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:32.180
<v Speaker 2>But instead like how we don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stigmatize.</v>

2022
01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 2>You're not even supposed to say aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2023
01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Because it's HIV and then HIV gives a</v>
<v Speaker 2>aids,</v>

2024
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get aids because your immune system</v>

2025
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>is compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What aids is a syndrome acquired immune</v>

2026
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.440
<v Speaker 2>deficiency syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got more hate in all the years I</v>

2027
01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 2>did this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then one of the early,</v>

2028
01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:50.340
<v Speaker 2>early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early episodes.</v>

2029
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 2>What was that doctor's name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doctor from the University of</v>

2030
01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:54.953
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley.</v>

2031
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:58.230
<v Speaker 2>He is ostracized from the medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

2032
01:20:58.231 --> 01:21:00.270
<v Speaker 2>but he's a Duisburg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2033
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Dr Peter Duesberg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote an article in Spin magazine</v>

2034
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:04.171
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2035
01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:06.990
<v Speaker 2>way back in the day and his assertion</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that</v>

2036
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:13.550
<v Speaker 2>HIV is a very weak virus and that HIV is</v>
<v Speaker 2>appearing in the systems of these people</v>

2037
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:16.800
<v Speaker 2>because they have compromised immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

2038
01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not HIV that's giving these people</v>

2039
01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:23.250
<v Speaker 2>compromised immune systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They already have compromised immune</v>

2040
01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:27.360
<v Speaker 2>systems and he was saying the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having these compromised immune</v>

2041
01:21:27.361 --> 01:21:32.361
<v Speaker 2>systems is because of aml nitrate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crystal meth and party drugs,</v>

2042
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:37.110
<v Speaker 2>and he showed overwhelming like in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his mind,</v>

2043
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:42.350
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming evidence that all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that got aids were getting their</v>

2044
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:45.630
<v Speaker 2>immune system was compromised because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>partying.</v>

2045
01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.360
<v Speaker 2>They were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why it's so prevalent in the gay</v>

2046
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:50.330
<v Speaker 2>party community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like you,</v>

2047
01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:55.340
<v Speaker 2>and he was talking about how you destroy</v>
<v Speaker 2>your immune system with animal nitrate.</v>

2048
01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:59.790
<v Speaker 2>You destroy your immune system with</v>
<v Speaker 2>crystal meth and if you check the immune</v>

2049
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 2>system of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's going to be devastated.</v>

2050
01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:05.940
<v Speaker 2>They're doing hardcore party drugs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing them all the time.</v>

2051
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:11.100
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said this and he published a bunch of</v>

2052
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:12.900
<v Speaker 2>stuff on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People went crazy.</v>

2053
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2054
01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:18.960
<v Speaker 2>it was not a scientific debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more of a social issue.</v>

2055
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:21.570
<v Speaker 2>How dare you stigmatize crystal Meth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it wasn't,</v>

2056
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:23.580
<v Speaker 2>but if it wasn't a gay thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

2057
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:28.800
<v Speaker 2>If aids was just something you found</v>
<v Speaker 2>truckstop people who were just doing</v>

2058
01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:32.070
<v Speaker 2>math and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shooting heroin and they're all,</v>

2059
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:34.860
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason they're getting this</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

2060
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:35.820
<v Speaker 2>you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2061
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I bet it disease is probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe has something to do with the fact</v>

2062
01:22:38.911 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 2>they're all doing meth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2063
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.370
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unrelated but,</v>

2064
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:43.590
<v Speaker 2>but meth bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2065
01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:44.424
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

2066
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.590
<v Speaker 2>But I'm anal nitrates devastate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2067
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:50.010
<v Speaker 2>instant brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Able nitrate causes instant brain</v>

2068
01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:51.470
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pop one of those stages of</v>

2069
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:55.290
<v Speaker 2>ammonia poppers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2070
01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:56.000
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

2071
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently opens.</v>

2072
01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of power lifters would do those</v>

2073
01:22:58.771 --> 01:23:00.930
<v Speaker 2>before big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like setting some smelling salts.</v>

2074
01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different different stuff.</v>

2075
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Email nitrate is a potent drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2076
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody talked about that yesterday.</v>

2077
01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Ben Greenfield talked about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

2078
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Some insanely disgusting smelling salt</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could barely hold up to your</v>

2079
01:23:13.331 --> 01:23:17.130
<v Speaker 2>nose and you do lifts like right after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that excites your,</v>

2080
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your central nervous system.</v>

2081
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.820
<v Speaker 2>It's firing lavender</v>
<v Speaker 2>cinnamon.</v>

2082
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

2083
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the facts are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fucking biologist.</v>

2084
01:23:28.451 --> 01:23:30.020
<v Speaker 2>This guy is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a.</v>

2085
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.440
<v Speaker 2>he's a tenured professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The University of California.</v>

2086
01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley can't get funding for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done.</v>

2087
01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Rock solid research on cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has really interesting guy,</v>

2088
01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.640
<v Speaker 2>but all the other aids researchers</v>
<v Speaker 2>denounce him.</v>

2089
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else that's involved in HIV and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be right.</v>

2090
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.890
<v Speaker 2>They very well could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's right or he's</v>

2091
01:23:44.891 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me more likely that he's</v>

2092
01:23:46.931 --> 01:23:49.870
<v Speaker 2>wrong because no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one has come forward like</v>

2093
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.080
<v Speaker 2>legitimately on his side in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific research.</v>

2094
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Based on what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I hear,</v>

2095
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm like my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My inclination is sounds like he may be</v>

2096
01:23:56.981 --> 01:23:57.910
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

2097
01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm not offended that you brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking biologist,</v>

2098
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:03.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what's crazy about it that</v>

2099
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.230
<v Speaker 2>that's why I can't think of any shows on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

2100
01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.360
<v Speaker 2>let's say center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2101
01:24:07.361 --> 01:24:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Other side of the political spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they wouldn't be offended by that.</v>

2102
01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had so much crap.</v>

2103
01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's wrong from everything I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about HIV and aids.</v>

2104
01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Seems as though he's wrong.</v>

2105
01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough to say he's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard enough people that know</v>

2106
01:24:20.351 --> 01:24:22.720
<v Speaker 2>enough that say he's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I believed them,</v>

2107
01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.810
<v Speaker 2>but people were sending me messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blood's on your hands and this and that.</v>

2108
01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you went out and had unprotected,</v>

2109
01:24:29.411 --> 01:24:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but sex after listening to the Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

2110
01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:34.900
<v Speaker 2>you deserve what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2111
01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to me and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2112
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Peter Duesberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send it in.</v>

2113
01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Rex Bite is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't demonize conversations and I</v>

2114
01:24:46.871 --> 01:24:50.350
<v Speaker 2>don't know enough about the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I listened to.</v>

2115
01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.260
<v Speaker 2>That guy's take on it and it's fuel for</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

2116
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:54.400
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's right,</v>

2117
01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.150
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to a lot of people that I</v>

2118
01:24:57.151 --> 01:24:59.770
<v Speaker 2>don't figure right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to some crazy fucking people</v>

2119
01:24:59.771 --> 01:25:04.771
<v Speaker 2>on the show and I think you got to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to have conversations.</v>

2120
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.830
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

2121
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we might agree on 60 percent of</v>

2122
01:25:08.231 --> 01:25:09.011
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 50,</v>

2123
01:25:09.011 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's somewhere between 40 and 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2124
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:12.700
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be okay,</v>

2125
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:15.350
<v Speaker 2>but should be totally fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing when we do know</v>

2126
01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:18.550
<v Speaker 2>change my mind segments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most time people it's pretty amicable</v>

2127
01:25:18.551 --> 01:25:21.470
<v Speaker 2>and then you just get someone who comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and wants to commit assault truly</v>

2128
01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:23.590
<v Speaker 2>puffs and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a big skill.</v>

2129
01:25:23.591 --> 01:25:26.310
<v Speaker 2>We've kind of had to learn this because</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nikee jared knows,</v>

2130
01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we first had guests,</v>

2131
01:25:28.301 --> 01:25:30.750
<v Speaker 2>if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was a guest which disagreed with,</v>

2132
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2133
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I will not edit you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will not be taken out of context.</v>

2134
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.020
<v Speaker 2>But I would sit down for three hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them because they would be like,</v>

2135
01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:38.920
<v Speaker 2>don't cut me off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't come up.</v>

2136
01:25:38.921 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 2>And you realize it just repeating</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2137
01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.990
<v Speaker 2>So finding that balance of seeing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people out there now who are</v>

2138
01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:46.870
<v Speaker 2>open to hearing these points that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are open to hearing these ideas,</v>

2139
01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 2>being able to identify them and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to identify the people who</v>

2140
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:52.420
<v Speaker 2>are so bought in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't even listen.</v>

2141
01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.860
<v Speaker 2>You need to make an example of them for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people you can convince and</v>

2142
01:25:56.861 --> 01:25:58.690
<v Speaker 2>understanding the two different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2143
01:25:58.691 --> 01:26:01.070
<v Speaker 2>The trigger puffs versus uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2144
01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson,</v>

2145
01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:05.510
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably never saw himself as</v>
<v Speaker 2>even political at all until he came out</v>

2146
01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 2>and said something that would seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>so benign and caused an uproar.</v>

2147
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I think being able to identify those</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

2148
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:16.280
<v Speaker 2>not so much just about left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who can hear who won't and how to handle</v>

2149
01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2150
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you hear?</v>

2151
01:26:18.411 --> 01:26:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Can you not hear because it interferes</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your ideology or can you not hear</v>

2152
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 2>because it's what they're saying is</v>
<v Speaker 2>illogical.</v>

2153
01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Like which one is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

2154
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.180
<v Speaker 2>are you honestly listening to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying?</v>

2155
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And can you give factual refute?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you give some sort of a factual</v>

2156
01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>review of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it just,</v>

2157
01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.740
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't jive with your view of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world you have,</v>

2158
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:41.330
<v Speaker 2>you have some rock solid view of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world that you're not,</v>

2159
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:44.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not willing to look at it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your perspective because that's the</v>

2160
01:26:44.731 --> 01:26:46.550
<v Speaker 2>undercover thing with negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2161
01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:49.830
<v Speaker 2>balls of steel doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that one because what</v>

2162
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 2>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got video of that one too.</v>

2163
01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went undercover with the Antifa and</v>

2164
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:59.480
<v Speaker 2>that fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one was disturbing to me because</v>

2165
01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:02.900
<v Speaker 2>first of all you look like slide right</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like a glove buddy.</v>

2166
01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I was almost matching the guy when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got there.</v>

2167
01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:05.721
<v Speaker 2>Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gal,</v>

2168
01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:07.360
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2169
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:10.940
<v Speaker 2>and I thought our costume wardrobe lady</v>
<v Speaker 2>had actually just just stolen his</v>

2170
01:27:10.941 --> 01:27:13.880
<v Speaker 2>clothes because it was almost identical</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what he was wearing.</v>

2171
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny though that when you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>slender man,</v>

2172
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:19.760
<v Speaker 2>like people assume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2173
01:27:19.761 --> 01:27:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I can get away with so much crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

2174
01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2176
01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:27.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it about slender people</v>

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Hm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I say third wreck?</v>

01:27:42.751 --> 01:27:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what it is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2185
01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else and designs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check them out on it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can usually tell when someone's</v>

2191
01:27:55.191 --> 01:27:57.170
<v Speaker 4>approaching us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're friendly or fell by their</v>

<v Speaker 4>The biggest passing out solid shotguns</v>

<v Speaker 4>and our goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it.</v>

2199
01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:17.450
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did know because I was like,</v>

2200

<v Speaker 4>I had done two and now I get made every</v>
<v Speaker 4>time I go out after you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>My wig flies off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She still goes along with it.</v>

2203

<v Speaker 4>I'm on every message.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to go in there and a technical</v>

2204
01:28:28.351 --> 01:28:31.220

<v Speaker 4>team six Michigan between Wednesday and</v>

<v Speaker 4>Friday shelf.</v>

2206
01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 4>So it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what happened is then when you were</v>

2207
01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to go back.</v>

2208
01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:37.040
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just.</v>

2209
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.370
<v Speaker 4>How did it get psyched to explain to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it got set up,</v>

2210
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:41.730
<v Speaker 4>how you did it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

2211
01:28:41.731 --> 01:28:44.260
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the meeting balls of stuff.</v>

2212
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2213
01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean these kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These things are much different than the</v>

2214
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Burlington Vermont kind of gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was a throwaway.</v>

2215
01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:54.020
<v Speaker 4>This one took months of planning is</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrench to Britain to especially to a,</v>

2216
01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:57.390
<v Speaker 4>to infiltrating the back end of Antifa</v>
<v Speaker 4>red and red.</v>

2217
01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.990
<v Speaker 4>We call them regional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a guy who does research for us.</v>

2218
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

2219
01:29:00.930 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 4>don't make an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't get into</v>

2220
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.890
<v Speaker 1>anything specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is the high level professor.</v>

2221
01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a,</v>

2222
01:29:06.610 --> 01:29:11.610
<v Speaker 1>he has a 650 something pound squat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd like Bain in real life and a</v>

2223
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.590
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the one who found the salon</v>

2224
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:15.880
<v Speaker 1>pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we broke that pedophile</v>

2225
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:17.143
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2226
01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:19.520
<v Speaker 1>We were the first ones to write about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he was currently actively a</v>

2227
01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 1>pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sent it to me within 10 minutes,</v>

2228
01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:24.280
<v Speaker 1>but he's the man of the chairman of gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently out.</v>

2229
01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a practicing pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2230
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:27.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

2231
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:28.770
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about grooming and all that</v>

2232
01:29:28.771 --> 01:29:30.170
<v Speaker 1>stuff and we wrote about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2233
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Really double down on it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then three more articles.</v>

2234
01:29:34.051 --> 01:29:34.884
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is registered as Reggie does.</v>

2236
01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remove those articles.</v>

2237
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they did,</v>

2238
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:43.680
<v Speaker 1>but they did like two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Reggie is a brilliant researcher.</v>

2239
01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And so at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain that though,</v>

2240
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:47.220
<v Speaker 1>because you were glossing over this for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are just listening.</v>

2241
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Please explain like what that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those articles.</v>

2242
01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

2243
01:29:50.701 --> 01:29:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're starting off with a salon.com.</v>

2244
01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>What was their first articles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pedophile,</v>

2245
01:29:55.261 --> 01:29:58.260
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was talking about how you know,</v>

2246
01:29:58.261 --> 01:29:59.640
<v Speaker 1>the way to deal with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2247
01:29:59.641 --> 01:30:00.840
<v Speaker 1>not to stigmatize us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2248
01:30:00.841 --> 01:30:01.501
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

2249
01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:02.580
<v Speaker 1>To a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm empathetic,</v>

2250
01:30:02.581 --> 01:30:05.040
<v Speaker 1>but we send you to therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still want to have sex with kids,</v>

2251
01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.570
<v Speaker 1>we take you out of the village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shoot you.</v>

2252
01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.040
<v Speaker 1>We can't take that risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2253
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:09.090
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2254
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.530
<v Speaker 1>so he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a monster.</v>

2255
01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And talked about how his struggles with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his family.</v>

2256
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of understand it.</v>

2257
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:19.290
<v Speaker 1>But then Reggie did some research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found all of his online message board</v>

2258
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:23.130
<v Speaker 1>is pseudonyms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is usernames and coded language about</v>

2259
01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:25.630
<v Speaker 1>grooming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grooming me,</v>

2260
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:28.830
<v Speaker 1>like your grooming kids online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we found all of it and we released an</v>

2261
01:30:28.831 --> 01:30:33.180
<v Speaker 1>article on it and then salon released</v>
<v Speaker 1>another article where he responded and</v>

2262
01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:34.014
<v Speaker 1>didn't call us up by name.</v>

2263
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It was like my week in the right wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>hates fear and they rated it on salon,</v>

2264
01:30:39.361 --> 01:30:43.410
<v Speaker 1>like we're the bad guys because we found</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that you're grooming children and</v>

2265
01:30:43.411 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 1>they released a few and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just realized,</v>

2266
01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:46.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>

2267
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.750
<v Speaker 1>kinda like hormone blockers for kids'</v>
<v Speaker 1>salons.</v>

2268
01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With an active file.</v>

2269
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's move on now we're not going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2270
01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:54.720
<v Speaker 1>There's no more convincing to be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2271
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So red was the one who found it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reggie was the one who infiltrated a lot</v>

2272
01:30:58.141 --> 01:30:59.490
<v Speaker 1>of the antifa groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2273
01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.440
<v Speaker 1>that that's not his real name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has so many.</v>

2274
01:31:01.441 --> 01:31:03.900
<v Speaker 1>This guy's just brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had been doing research on the</v>

2275
01:31:03.901 --> 01:31:04.980
<v Speaker 1>back end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2276
01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.470
<v Speaker 1>upon request and was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had all this research.</v>

2277
01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:09.870
<v Speaker 1>We knew who these people were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of knew what they were planning</v>

2278
01:31:09.871 --> 01:31:11.370
<v Speaker 1>with Ben Shapiro going into Utah.</v>

2279
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a matter of fact,</v>

2280
01:31:13.441 --> 01:31:15.240
<v Speaker 1>we were going to go to Berkeley right</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>

2281
01:31:15.241 --> 01:31:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but then last minute we found out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't going to do it because we</v>

2282
01:31:18.061 --> 01:31:21.690
<v Speaker 1>know where they meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We run their cryptic apps where they</v>

2283
01:31:21.691 --> 01:31:23.250
<v Speaker 1>would text you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as these apps that you would</v>

2284
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:24.590
<v Speaker 1>download,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know if we're allowed.</v>

2285
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Are we allowed to say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2286
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI came to us for information</v>

2287
01:31:29.731 --> 01:31:30.181
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2288
01:31:30.181 --> 01:31:31.014
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were tracking these.</v>

2289
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:35.330
<v Speaker 1>There were arrests made a because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your undercover thing will arrest,</v>

2290
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:37.360
<v Speaker 1>made on the people seen undercover same</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2291
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:40.380
<v Speaker 1>So they committed crimes again later</v>
<v Speaker 1>that day and were arrested.</v>

2292
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:43.320
<v Speaker 1>So the same person who handed him a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shank later that day assaulted,</v>

2293
01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>so the rest of so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Reggie gets you the information and</v>

2294
01:31:46.681 --> 01:31:50.160
<v Speaker 1>then you how do you make contact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people?</v>

2295
01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.460
<v Speaker 1>We will be part of their facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>grouping.</v>

2296
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:54.750
<v Speaker 1>So we found out where they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet.</v>

2297
01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:59.620
<v Speaker 1>When I'm went aware and we showed up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus and I walk in as</v>

2298
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Jason Antifa person new to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>organization,</v>

2299
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:09.060
<v Speaker 4>say I want to be involved glue content</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's all it takes on context slide</v>

2300
01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.090
<v Speaker 4>blue contexts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because we're on a budget,</v>

2301
01:32:13.091 --> 01:32:14.290
<v Speaker 4>we need to disguise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why?</v>

2302
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:16.810
<v Speaker 4>Why do you need to disguise?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't think you could slip up.</v>

2303
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:18.920
<v Speaker 4>You thought people would recognize it a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

2304
01:32:18.970 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 4>We could have been on their radar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then now they tried to find this in</v>

2305
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:22.511
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

2306
01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:26.230
<v Speaker 4>in Austin and to put it on posters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we tape the interview with Tim Kennedy</v>

2307
01:32:26.231 --> 01:32:29.470
<v Speaker 4>and they were passing out flyers just</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get waterboarded no,</v>

2308
01:32:29.490 --> 01:32:31.630
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was another time that would much</v>

2309
01:32:31.631 --> 01:32:32.820
<v Speaker 4>rather than whining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2310
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:33.730
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

2311
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:36.000
<v Speaker 4>That was no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'd rather do that than the CNN 16</v>

2312
01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:37.210
<v Speaker 4>hour live stream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a joke.</v>

2313
01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.790
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather be waterboarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways.</v>

2314
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.713
<v Speaker 4>Good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dot.</v>

2315
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:43.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we show up this coffee house there me</v>

2316
01:32:44.150 --> 01:32:49.150
<v Speaker 4>starbucks on campus</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he just put me to starbucks.</v>

2317
01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:56.180
<v Speaker 4>So I found him met up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gives me the cryptic messaging APP a.</v>

2318
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:58.510

<v Speaker 4>Did you find out?</v>

2319
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:00.370
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was sure it was a heat because it was</v>

2320
01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:05.371
<v Speaker 4>a wedding band in this shit up zero zero</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there with his wedding band,</v>

2321
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:09.100
<v Speaker 4>a iphone seven and is brought on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

2322
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.080
<v Speaker 4>It gives me the APP and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll see you tomorrow.</v>

2323
01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:12.123
<v Speaker 4>So I say,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They did roll call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roll call and said,</v>

2326
01:33:17.061 --> 01:33:19.860
<v Speaker 4>okay everyone roll call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got Jason and the group like,</v>

2327
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:23.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like fire bird fibered uh,</v>

2328
01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:28.630
<v Speaker 4>well they went down to like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like firebird and rogue two in flame</v>

2329
01:33:28.631 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 4>thrower nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there was,</v>

<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.960
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will name feral family fund immediately</v>

2332
01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:36.820
<v Speaker 4>because I wasted so swiftly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll.</v>

2333
01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:37.870
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy to find.</v>

2334
01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:39.550
<v Speaker 4>How could you figure out who will was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2335
01:33:39.551 --> 01:33:41.140
<v Speaker 4>because the phone numbers are also</v>
<v Speaker 4>listed.</v>

2336
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:44.530
<v Speaker 4>It's encrypted messaging APP doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>lie,</v>

2337
01:33:44.531 --> 01:33:46.540
<v Speaker 4>take screenshots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it turns out if you have another</v>

2338
01:33:46.541 --> 01:33:49.310
<v Speaker 4>phone you can take a photo of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>screen.</v>

2339
01:33:49.410 --> 01:33:52.330
<v Speaker 4>She's a physical camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't seem to work out this</v>

2340
01:33:52.331 --> 01:33:54.970
<v Speaker 4>kink in the plans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the snapchat thing,</v>

2341
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 4>when people are sending Dick Pics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like normal going to see it.</v>

2342
01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.980
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to see what you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

2343
01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:01.740
<v Speaker 4>You can't do screenshots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just informs the person,</v>

2344
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:03.670
<v Speaker 4>which is so much worse than if someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually took it.</v>

2345
01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just makes it worse for everybody</v>

2346
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:09.520
<v Speaker 4>to take a photo of it with another</v>
<v Speaker 4>camera.</v>

2347
01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Like you said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2348
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:11.680
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so go ahead.</v>

2349
01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.350
<v Speaker 4>So all these people role playing there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there in dungeons and dragon.</v>

2350
01:34:15.351 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we,</v>

2351
01:34:17.171 --> 01:34:18.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we go back to her hotel,</v>

2352
01:34:18.491 --> 01:34:20.180
<v Speaker 4>get ready for the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2353
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 4>and show up on campus where they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to,</v>

2354
01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to meet up and get to your nervous as</v>

2355
01:34:24.911 --> 01:34:28.810
<v Speaker 4>hell because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was more nervous the day before</v>

2356
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:30.740
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't know what I was walking</v>
<v Speaker 4>out short.</v>

2357
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Is it want to play it first?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're all like 30 seconds.</v>

2358
01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about to license from a,</v>

2359
01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:37.880
<v Speaker 4>from Antifa for which one do you want me</v>
<v Speaker 4>to start with our,</v>

2360
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.710
<v Speaker 4>the</v>
<v Speaker 4>producer around</v>

2361
01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.620
<v Speaker 4>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So different than me.</v>

2362
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:49.120
<v Speaker 4>They were openly advocating violence and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were openly.</v>

2363
01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:52.440
<v Speaker 4>They were offering to give you a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not at first.</v>

2364
01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 4>Not at first because you actually said</v>
<v Speaker 4>the funny part before you said we got</v>

2365
01:34:57.501 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 4>into a fight and you said this is not my</v>
<v Speaker 4>job description.</v>

2366
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 4>And I said it is exactly in your job</v>
<v Speaker 4>description.</v>

2367
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.440
<v Speaker 4>You have to go do this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2368
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:07.850
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had security in everything,</v>

2369
01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:10.250
<v Speaker 4>but I remember you were really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then after the clips,</v>

2370
01:35:10.251 --> 01:35:14.600
<v Speaker 4>you'll see after they gave you the knife</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were filing reports with the cops</v>

2371
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 4>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2372
01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go back in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it can really mess with him.</v>

2373
01:35:17.551 --> 01:35:17.871
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2374
01:35:17.871 --> 01:35:20.420
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just handed you a prison shank and</v>

2375
01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:23.120
<v Speaker 4>told you they had a sawed off shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't go back in there.</v>

2376
01:35:23.121 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 4>So once he was in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had to rein him back.</v>

2377
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.270
<v Speaker 4>It was like a little little jewelry a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple times crazy.</v>

2378
01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.900
<v Speaker 4>A little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2379
01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:34.210
<v Speaker 4>So let's play this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my meeting.</v>

2380
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:38.090
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like product placement needs</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy.</v>

2381
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:41.350
<v Speaker 4>This is a guy I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>

2386

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they're doing is,</v>

2398
01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:51.720
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that person never stabbed anybody in</v>

2399
01:36:51.721 --> 01:36:52.680
<v Speaker 4>their fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2400
01:36:52.681 --> 01:36:56.010
<v Speaker 4>So these are dorks and what they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing is they're deciding now they're</v>

2401
01:36:56.011 --> 01:37:00.420
<v Speaker 4>going to take action and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to enlist the aid of a bunch of other</v>

2402
01:37:00.421 --> 01:37:03.030
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you think at that point in time like</v>

2403
01:37:03.031 --> 01:37:06.990
<v Speaker 4>maybe these people are looking for</v>
<v Speaker 4>suckers that are willing to do fucked up</v>

2404
01:37:06.991 --> 01:37:10.260
<v Speaker 4>shit for them stabbing anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely.</v>

2405
01:37:11.370 --> 01:37:12.570
<v Speaker 4>When I showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met.</v>

2406
01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.610
<v Speaker 4>There was like four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then when I got there they were all</v>

2407
01:37:14.611 --> 01:37:16.320
<v Speaker 4>running late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The socialists were all running late,</v>

2408
01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.970
<v Speaker 4>late</v>
<v Speaker 4>show time.</v>

2409
01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 4>And one of them actually said a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweetheart there.</v>

2410
01:37:23.110 --> 01:37:24.300
<v Speaker 4>Honeybee was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2412
01:37:27.631 --> 01:37:29.910
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there is a silver lining I guess.</v>

2413
01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:31.820
<v Speaker 4>But just eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was,</v>

2418
01:37:41.190 --> 01:37:42.720
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know about the weapons</v>

<v Speaker 1>you bring us the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are cops right there.</v>

01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:41.980
<v Speaker 1>So we tell the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>quad or whatever they're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke right here,</v>

2446
01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2447
01:38:50.530 --> 01:38:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2448
01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get corrupted.</v>

2449
01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:57.370
<v Speaker 1>File here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go around the circle.</v>

2450
01:38:57.371 --> 01:38:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And they were handing out sharp objects</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stab people with.</v>

2451
01:38:59.471 --> 01:39:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So they had someone come up with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

2452
01:39:00.521 --> 01:39:03.370
<v Speaker 1>worked for local ones to take to late</v>
<v Speaker 1>night hosts,</v>

2453
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.510
<v Speaker 1>comedians to find this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2454
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:07.641
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2455
01:39:07.641 --> 01:39:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You just saw correctly even being shown</v>
<v Speaker 1>the footage in the presence of police</v>

2456
01:39:11.541 --> 01:39:15.230
<v Speaker 1>officers to confirm authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walked away.</v>

2457
01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should note,</v>

2458
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:19.010
<v Speaker 1>this is from nightline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was on my podcast.</v>

2459
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.410
<v Speaker 1>He knew about the footage and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>story too.</v>

2460
01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I like offered it to them and asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned you give us a brief spot</v>

2461
01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and when they actually put together</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks later after I'd video to come out.</v>

2462
01:39:27.531 --> 01:39:29.840
<v Speaker 1>So he had to acknowledge it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he put together a small little brief</v>

2463
01:39:29.841 --> 01:39:34.841
<v Speaker 1>montage of our video that took place on</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful event was not without some</v>

2464
01:39:35.421 --> 01:39:36.254
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>

2465
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.660

2471
01:39:45.891 --> 01:39:48.260

<v Speaker 1>show them a cryptic app and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So we're showing it to him and he walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2482
01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2483
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:07.981
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2484
01:40:07.981 --> 01:40:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2485
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:11.720
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a part of your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't.</v>

2486
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.230
<v Speaker 1>He didn't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that to me was in St.</v>

2487
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:17.600
<v Speaker 1>we weren't looking for it necessarily a</v>
<v Speaker 1>school trying to get this as wide as</v>

2488
01:40:17.601 --> 01:40:19.280
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a rhyme going down the street</v>

2489
01:40:19.281 --> 01:40:20.520
<v Speaker 1>with her protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had to get.</v>

2490
01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he did.</v>

2491
01:40:21.801 --> 01:40:24.700
<v Speaker 1>He was doing Internet mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see people peacefully protesting</v>

2492
01:40:24.701 --> 01:40:26.000
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold up his instagram,</v>

2493
01:40:26.001 --> 01:40:26.721
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2494
01:40:26.721 --> 01:40:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't have authority that he</v>

2495
01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.180
<v Speaker 1>was trying to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't fit the narrative.</v>

2496
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with a guy from nightline</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't fit.</v>

2497
01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So the narrative was the anti trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>protesters,</v>

2498
01:40:36.891 --> 01:40:39.590
<v Speaker 1>which is what people were tuning into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news for wasn't.</v>

2499
01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.090
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful.</v>

2500
01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.330
<v Speaker 1>There were snipers on the roof tops for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little Jew.</v>

2501
01:40:44.331 --> 01:40:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was two weeks after.</v>

2502
01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:49.860
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a smart man,</v>

2503
01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:51.280
<v Speaker 1>a little bastard I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

2504
01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I could see how he pisses people off.</v>

2505
01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.260
<v Speaker 1>But he's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

2506
01:40:54.450 --> 01:40:57.470
<v Speaker 1>very smart because my first lawyer</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating my contracts,</v>

2507
01:40:57.490 --> 01:40:58.990
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even entertainment lawyers had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

2508
01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.890
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of vowels and your last</v>
<v Speaker 1>name and I have a contract with money at</v>

2509

2510
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I think I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we became friends.</v>

2511
01:41:07.271 --> 01:41:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2512
01:41:08.751 --> 01:41:10.930
<v Speaker 1>So this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the heat of the ANTIFA</v>

2513
01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last summer I ran up to Berkeley,</v>

2514
01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:16.930
<v Speaker 1>they were really specifically about</v>
<v Speaker 1>antifa trying to downplay the violence</v>

2515
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:20.560
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the undercurrent that I've seen given</v>

2516
01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:22.660
<v Speaker 1>that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to have accepted the fact that</v>

2517
01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:24.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

2518
01:41:24.101 --> 01:41:25.340
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this,</v>

2519
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hate not to toot our own horn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think things like this and that</v>

2520
01:41:29.111 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 1>got what 15 million plays on facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a few million on,</v>

2521
01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.290
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2522
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:32.740
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube.</v>

2523
01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.990
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we got more mileage</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the news refused to cover it.</v>

2524
01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And then was it the dean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone.</v>

2525
01:41:37.331 --> 01:41:40.240
<v Speaker 1>There's some student activities advisor</v>
<v Speaker 1>released the official statement saying</v>

2526
01:41:40.241 --> 01:41:42.310
<v Speaker 1>nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we called him.</v>

2527
01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:46.600
<v Speaker 1>So that was a followup call member</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to a Washington,</v>

2528
01:41:46.630 --> 01:41:48.760
<v Speaker 1>what we made up something Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harold or something.</v>

2529
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:49.211
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2530
01:41:49.211 --> 01:41:50.640
<v Speaker 1>it was a really stupid name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what it was.</v>

2531
01:41:50.650 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 1>And we asked who made the statement that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was entirely peaceful because</v>

2532
01:41:53.051 --> 01:41:54.790
<v Speaker 1>honeybee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he's speaking on behalf of the</v>

2533
01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:57.790
<v Speaker 1>police but never actually quoted a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>

2534
01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:01.140
<v Speaker 1>we figured out very quickly he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking on behalf of himself and he was</v>

2535
01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.070
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found out he was actually a delegate</v>

2536
01:42:03.130 --> 01:42:04.730
<v Speaker 1>or some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was actually officially involved</v>

2537
01:42:04.731 --> 01:42:05.880
<v Speaker 1>with holistic statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2538
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Ties to Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2539
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.990
<v Speaker 1>he was a Clinton staffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive and for this like open,</v>

2540
01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:11.530
<v Speaker 1>supportive.</v>

2541
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2542
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:16.010
<v Speaker 1>do you know this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got like professors hitting</v>

2543
01:42:16.011 --> 01:42:19.150
<v Speaker 1>people in the head with bike locks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this sounds absurd,</v>

2544
01:42:19.151 --> 01:42:20.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a wise group.</v>

2545
01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:25.540
<v Speaker 1>This is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a smartly organized refusal</v>

2546
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.810
<v Speaker 1>of some crazy power structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are.</v>

2547
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.400
<v Speaker 1>This is chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2548
01:42:30.450 --> 01:42:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It's your question earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2549
01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I do think they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they prey on losers of society</v>

2550
01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.320
<v Speaker 1>to become part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were so quick to welcome me in</v>

2551
01:42:38.890 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 1>because they need the numbers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to accept anybody.</v>

2552
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:45.490
<v Speaker 1>There was no filtration system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to say that if that was a real</v>

2553
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:48.490
<v Speaker 1>faction of anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the sad.</v>

2554
01:42:48.491 --> 01:42:50.790
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking faction that that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

2555
01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Case and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're as bad as anybody tell them later</v>

2556
01:42:53.591 --> 01:42:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Honeybee got arrested for tasting</v>

2557
01:42:56.191 --> 01:42:57.730
<v Speaker 1>your guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasing a guy the same.</v>

2558
01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Who she taze know the guy sucker punched</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different guy.</v>

2559
01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a desktop.</v>

2560
01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Are you dot gender?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2561
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:08.743
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never do that.</v>

2562
01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honeybee was actually,</v>

2563
01:43:10.541 --> 01:43:12.820
<v Speaker 1>they're not my character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honeybee was the late socialist.</v>

2564
01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Got Arrested for chasing the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after jail was texting.</v>

2565
01:43:19.001 --> 01:43:21.100
<v Speaker 1>You remember that she wanted her knife</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2566
01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does she know the picture?</v>

2567
01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Because I texted a picture of me sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to two Shapiro.</v>

2568
01:43:26.891 --> 01:43:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Full getup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flipping them the bird.</v>

2569
01:43:28.810 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 1>You texted them a picture in the crypto</v>
<v Speaker 1>in encryption APP.</v>

2570
01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've brought the phone to give me</v>

2571
01:43:36.031 --> 01:43:37.750
<v Speaker 1>the knife back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the cops who were like,</v>

2572
01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me the knife.</v>

2573
01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.630
<v Speaker 1>So next it just says thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2574
01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.040
<v Speaker 1>We told them like when it was going up</v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube,</v>

2575
01:43:45.041 --> 01:43:47.680
<v Speaker 1>like keep an eye out tomorrow at 6:00 on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

2576
01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.750
<v Speaker 1>So she gets arrested for tasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

2577
01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2578
01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Then what happens now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No heat</v>

2579
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.590
<v Speaker 2>for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For all this video of her saying she's</v>

2580
01:43:54.591 --> 01:43:57.070
<v Speaker 2>got a handgun and we don't know we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2581
01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:59.960
<v Speaker 2>can we say now we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a lot of phone calls with,</v>

2582
01:44:00.010 --> 01:44:03.110
<v Speaker 2>with the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obs on the premise with the FBI and they</v>

2583
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:08.111
<v Speaker 2>knew that my footage was not terribly</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising to any of them because they</v>

2584
01:44:09.111 --> 01:44:11.720
<v Speaker 2>were all already on their radar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did ask how you got into</v>

2585
01:44:11.721 --> 01:44:12.790
<v Speaker 2>cryptic APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did that.</v>

2586
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:17.390
<v Speaker 2>They were picking my brain for how they</v>
<v Speaker 2>function because they are organized to a</v>

2587
01:44:17.391 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 2>certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if there is ignored as organized</v>

2588
01:44:19.881 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 2>as the Berkeley faction or as any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>faction,</v>

2589
01:44:22.311 --> 01:44:23.780
<v Speaker 2>that's called trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

2590
01:44:24.110 --> 01:44:28.160
<v Speaker 2>but to some level they are and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the FBI used us to to kind of help</v>

2591
01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:29.240
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's what we were talking about</v>

2592
01:44:29.241 --> 01:44:32.240
<v Speaker 2>earlier that my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My take on it is that if you're trying</v>

2593
01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:36.860
<v Speaker 2>to suppress people that hardcore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a guy who's talking and net</v>

2594
01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:39.770
<v Speaker 2>guy turns out to be Ben Shapiro and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're calling him a Nazi,</v>

2595
01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:41.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you see those dangerous in?</v>

2596
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:44.060
<v Speaker 2>They called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the Yarmulke on his head?</v>

2597
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro's and Nazi,</v>

2598
01:44:46.110 --> 01:44:48.470
<v Speaker 2>are you out of your mind like this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2599
01:44:48.471 --> 01:44:53.420
<v Speaker 2>you're so far gone that you like with</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single one of these things,</v>

2600
01:44:53.421 --> 01:44:56.750
<v Speaker 2>it diminishes the credibility of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This whole movement,</v>

2601
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:58.970
<v Speaker 2>like the whole thing just seemed</v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>

2602
01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Like you're calling everybody a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even a Jewish guy with a Yamaka on.</v>

2603
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:05.330
<v Speaker 2>He's a Nazi because he's a white</v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacist.</v>

2604
01:45:05.331 --> 01:45:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Tells you how the fuck is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you listen to what he's saying.</v>

2605
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:09.980
<v Speaker 2>He's not a white supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>

2606
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:13.490
<v Speaker 2>he's a conservative and if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that he's correct,</v>

2607
01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:14.870
<v Speaker 2>go debate him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2608
01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.970
<v Speaker 2>It's probably goes racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't good enough.</v>

2609
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Calling him a bigot wasn't good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just escalated to okay,</v>

2610
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.430
<v Speaker 2>well not to get your intention in</v>
<v Speaker 2>escalates that way.</v>

2611
01:45:22.431 --> 01:45:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I know what's happened to Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson and with a woman who had</v>

2612
01:45:25.821 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 2>recorded the conversation between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>professors that were chastising her for</v>

2613
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:30.290
<v Speaker 2>showing.</v>

2614
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Just showing a clip of Jordan Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing gender pronouns and the</v>

2615
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:38.690
<v Speaker 2>professors equated her are equated him</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Hitler.</v>

2616
01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 2>They literally equated Jordan Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Hitler and Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

2617
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:44.920
<v Speaker 2>which is a big spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Annapolis hit.</v>

2618
01:45:44.921 --> 01:45:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

2619
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:48.620
<v Speaker 2>only Nautilus Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no two people who hated each</v>

2620
01:45:48.621 --> 01:45:50.120
<v Speaker 2>other more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2621
01:45:50.121 --> 01:45:52.390
<v Speaker 2>And they're just like all writers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Milo Yiannopoulos and Benji</v>

2622
01:45:52.391 --> 01:45:54.170
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize how much they despise</v>

2623
01:45:54.171 --> 01:45:58.130
<v Speaker 2>each 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro was the number one recipient</v>

2624
01:45:58.131 --> 01:46:00.570
<v Speaker 2>of antisemitic hate online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one.</v>

2625
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2626
01:46:01.671 --> 01:46:06.671
<v Speaker 2>that's how crazy it is to call a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's Super Jewish to get Jewish as it</v>

2627
01:46:08.831 --> 01:46:09.664
<v Speaker 2>gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

2628
01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't even send them texts if we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting near Saturday.</v>

2629
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:15.530
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2630
01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.000
<v Speaker 2>they do the shaving thing where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>use an electric trimmer in one port in a</v>

2631
01:46:18.001 --> 01:46:18.834
<v Speaker 2>straight razor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2632
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.550
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2633
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.310
<v Speaker 2>So logical and every other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2634
01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:23.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so hardcore with that.</v>

2635
01:46:23.181 --> 01:46:25.010
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love to talk to them about that.</v>

2636
01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Such as Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so hardcore with velocity.</v>

2637
01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Velocity is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben and I had been friends for a long,</v>

2638
01:46:33.441 --> 01:46:34.400
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2639
01:46:34.401 --> 01:46:36.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even when I was on the show it</v>

2640
01:46:36.101 --> 01:46:36.501
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2641
01:46:36.501 --> 01:46:39.440
<v Speaker 2>listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never planned to be a debate or</v>

2642
01:46:39.450 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of was thrust upon me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we have people on the show.</v>

2643
01:46:42.710 --> 01:46:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a marginally intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2644
01:46:45.081 --> 01:46:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just kind of took a while for people</v>

2645
01:46:48.861 --> 01:46:50.520
<v Speaker 2>to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on the show is I get Ben as a</v>

2646
01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:53.920
<v Speaker 2>kind of guy if you want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and really have someone who goes in</v>

2647
01:46:53.921 --> 01:46:55.710
<v Speaker 2>the lion's den and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just doesn't care.</v>

2648
01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:56.880
<v Speaker 2>He just does not care.</v>

2649
01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.690
<v Speaker 2>He's not afraid of any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't afraid of,</v>

2650
01:46:58.750 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 2>of Milo during that time when listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking consideration.</v>

2651
01:47:01.531 --> 01:47:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro during this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2652
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro Leaves Breitbart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're smearing his name.</v>

2653
01:47:05.311 --> 01:47:07.890
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like Steve Bannon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is well known.</v>

2654
01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breitbart is really powerful.</v>

2655
01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Steve Bannon is getting cozy with Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

2656
01:47:12.661 --> 01:47:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro can't stand Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milo Yiannopoulos is the most popular</v>

2657
01:47:16.201 --> 01:47:18.600
<v Speaker 2>right wing sort of commentator and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going after Ben.</v>

2658
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a period where I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty rough for him and he still</v>

2659
01:47:22.681 --> 01:47:25.240
<v Speaker 2>stuck to his guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to respect that guy.</v>

2660
01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I and I like him.</v>

2661
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:28.470
<v Speaker 2>He's a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had him on the show.</v>

2662
01:47:28.471 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Had a great time talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a very nice guy,</v>

2663
01:47:31.141 --> 01:47:34.950
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's something happening</v>

2664
01:47:34.951 --> 01:47:38.700
<v Speaker 2>right now culturally be so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are freaking out because Donald</v>

2665
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Trump is the president that everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>is ramped up and no one can be left wing</v>

2666
01:47:42.631 --> 01:47:46.410
<v Speaker 2>enough and I think this is probably one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why someone would justify</v>

2667
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:51.740
<v Speaker 2>having an article like that pedophile</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing on salon.com and why people just.</v>

2668
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:55.710
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be that like you can't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive enough like everything is</v>

2669
01:47:55.711 --> 01:48:00.270
<v Speaker 2>getting so over the top and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous that people are calling other</v>

2670
01:48:00.271 --> 01:48:02.840
<v Speaker 2>progressive's out for not being</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive enough and it's.</v>

2671
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:05.480
<v Speaker 2>They're eating their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pussy hat thing have you that?</v>

2672
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:06.481
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2673
01:48:06.481 --> 01:48:09.760
<v Speaker 2>The transgender community is very upset</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are and you,</v>

2674
01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:13.080
<v Speaker 2>if you are a white woman wearing a pussy</v>
<v Speaker 2>hat,</v>

2675
01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 2>you are mocking people that are women</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't have policies,</v>

2676
01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:21.570
<v Speaker 2>specifically black women and black women</v>
<v Speaker 2>because black women's.</v>

2677
01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like maybe you've seen a couple</v>

2678
01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 2>but don't say always because that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just wrong internally.</v>

2679
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

2680
01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:31.621
<v Speaker 2>Who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2681
01:48:31.621 --> 01:48:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you that and just taking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bus.</v>

2682
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I spoke out of turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are dark,</v>

2683
01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.370
<v Speaker 2>but the point is like that's how crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left wing has gotten like that.</v>

2684
01:48:41.370 --> 01:48:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Wearing a pink pussy hat is offensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's offensive to people who are</v>

2685
01:48:46.951 --> 01:48:48.630
<v Speaker 2>women who have penises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2686
01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Literally that's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people of color who also don't have</v>

2687
01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:54.450
<v Speaker 2>pink pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like fuck you.</v>

2688
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Like pink is obviously a universal color</v>
<v Speaker 2>for women.</v>

2689
01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 2>You're wearing a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got cat ears.</v>

2690
01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>

2691
01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:02.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck.</v>

2692
01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:05.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not like give a goddamn vagina on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hat.</v>

2693
01:49:05.410 --> 01:49:09.050
<v Speaker 2>And some people did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people did say insurance.</v>

2694
01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:09.661
<v Speaker 2>Bitterness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually,</v>

2695
01:49:09.661 --> 01:49:11.490
<v Speaker 2>we just didn't have the budget because</v>
<v Speaker 2>lansing was really.</v>

2696
01:49:11.491 --> 01:49:12.870
<v Speaker 2>They were actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was lansing,</v>

2697
01:49:12.871 --> 01:49:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the places had like abandoned the</v>

2698
01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:16.730
<v Speaker 2>pussyhat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just want to show up with fitbit.</v>

2699
01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:17.491

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2700
01:49:17.491 --> 01:49:18.201
<v Speaker 2>there was one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2701
01:49:18.201 --> 01:49:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna speak out of turn on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>off with land place out of van someplace</v>

2702
01:49:20.941 --> 01:49:23.370
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just actively discourage it and we</v>

2703
01:49:23.371 --> 01:49:27.360
<v Speaker 2>just wanted to show up with 50 guys who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like hardcore feminist that I'm</v>

2704
01:49:27.370 --> 01:49:29.280
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm on their side.</v>

2705
01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Shows you that people in Pussy hats and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

2706
01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:33.770
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute,</v>

2707
01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:36.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's all the socialists pay for new</v>
<v Speaker 2>hats.</v>

2708
01:49:36.361 --> 01:49:39.720
<v Speaker 2>They just bought them last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fight in these cat hats.</v>

2709
01:49:39.721 --> 01:49:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cat.</v>

2710
01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:45.750
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't have a double entendre</v>

2711
01:49:45.751 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You explain that to your kid.</v>

2712
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dead.</v>

2713
01:49:49.930 --> 01:49:52.900
<v Speaker 1>A little fella that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like cats.</v>

2714
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:55.660
<v Speaker 1>How hard is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they screaming?</v>

2715
01:49:55.661 --> 01:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't touch my pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your puberty blockers and shut up.</v>

2716
01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:01.950
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2717
01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I remember when that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was right after the women's March and</v>

2718
01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you and I were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2719
01:50:05.621 --> 01:50:08.940
<v Speaker 1>we were kind of talking a at that point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're sort of analyzing our idea,</v>

2720
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:11.380
<v Speaker 1>put the economics and the wage gap and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about this and why that</v>

2721
01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:14.560
<v Speaker 1>wasn't necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're still beyond that.</v>

2722
01:50:14.561 --> 01:50:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I just go look at it thrown hats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2723
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:21.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a joke for the night of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2724
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.270
<v Speaker 1>That really is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so crazy.</v>

2725
01:50:25.271 --> 01:50:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Left wing progressive over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking each other that you can't wear</v>

2726
01:50:29.681 --> 01:50:31.860
<v Speaker 1>a pussy hat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who defends it is my point,</v>

2727
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:35.890
<v Speaker 1>like let's say like an experian or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shanker who I'm just using them as an</v>

2728
01:50:35.891 --> 01:50:36.724
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

2729
01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.050
<v Speaker 1>It would be who of them to go on air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2730
01:50:40.051 --> 01:50:41.350
<v Speaker 1>It might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really,</v>

2731
01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 1>this is why the left loses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2732
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Because now you're upset about the pussy</v>
<v Speaker 1>hats.</v>

2733
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And we mentioned like instead they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with it.</v>

2734
01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2735
01:50:48.450 --> 01:50:49.690
<v Speaker 1>we really should have caught that</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

2736
01:50:49.691 --> 01:50:52.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point they got a point we should have</v>

2737
01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:53.320
<v Speaker 1>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>

2738
01:50:53.321 --> 01:50:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are.</v>

2739
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:54.951
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2740
01:50:54.951 --> 01:50:55.784
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2741
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:58.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a cat and a vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2742
01:50:58.541 --> 01:51:00.370
<v Speaker 1>you can't make fun of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2743
01:51:00.371 --> 01:51:02.050
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in this weird position where it</v>

2744
01:51:02.051 --> 01:51:04.030
<v Speaker 1>fits a left wing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make fun of it.</v>

2745
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's like obviously ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just ignore it.</v>

2746
01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:11.170
<v Speaker 1>You ignore it and avoid it because to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mock it would be to attack your own team</v>

2747
01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.300
<v Speaker 1>and that that's what it feels like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2748
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:14.680
<v Speaker 1>their own shrinking deal.</v>

2749
01:51:15.010 --> 01:51:18.150
<v Speaker 1>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is totally just me kind of asking,</v>

2750
01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:20.170
<v Speaker 1>throwing this to the room and maybe to</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually</v>

2751
01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm just asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2752
01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.490
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antifa the pussy.</v>

2753
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of all disappeared a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

2754
01:51:31.230 --> 01:51:32.620
<v Speaker 1>You think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the news.</v>

2755
01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:35.650
<v Speaker 1>They're really not very active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been like a couple of months you</v>

2756
01:51:35.651 --> 01:51:38.400
<v Speaker 1>think of how exponentially volatile</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything want us.</v>

2757
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like it's kind of</v>

2758
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.133
<v Speaker 1>fierce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2759
01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's faded because it's proof</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these huge grass root movement,</v>

2760
01:51:46.871 --> 01:51:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I think they ran out of budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think spend it that,</v>

2761
01:51:49.630 --> 01:51:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we were talking about the</v>

2762
01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.580
<v Speaker 1>women's March and it was like at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point they were saying the biggest march</v>

2763
01:51:54.581 --> 01:51:56.260
<v Speaker 1>of all time said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>

2764
01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:57.580
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the next one.</v>

2765
01:51:57.581 --> 01:51:59.080
<v Speaker 1>The next one we went to Denton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

2766
01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.840
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't find 40 people because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were paid to show up.</v>

2767
01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:03.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight for 15.</v>

2768
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:05.110
<v Speaker 1>The are these leftist organizing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denton,</v>

2769
01:52:05.111 --> 01:52:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Texas and La was giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2770
01:52:06.911 --> 01:52:08.410
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women's march was huge everywhere,</v>

2771
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:11.140
<v Speaker 1>but the point is they did a follow up</v>
<v Speaker 1>march and there was no one.</v>

2772
01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:14.290
<v Speaker 1>When you don't pay people to show up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not knitting the hats and given</v>

2773
01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:15.190
<v Speaker 1>them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one shows up.</v>

2774
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:16.540
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where though?</v>

2775
01:52:16.570 --> 01:52:17.650
<v Speaker 1>In Denton Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2776
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:18.670
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>

2777
01:52:18.671 --> 01:52:20.800
<v Speaker 1>They weren't paying people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2778
01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.960
<v Speaker 1>absoluTely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2779
01:52:22.961 --> 01:52:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You think they were paying was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 900,000 thousand people downtown.</v>

2780
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:30.500
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them a dollar and have them spend.</v>

2781
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I think what's a half a million dollar</v>
<v Speaker 1>budget.</v>

2782
01:52:32.651 --> 01:52:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who works for a leftist think</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

2783
01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who works for a leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonprofit,</v>

2784
01:52:36.730 --> 01:52:39.610
<v Speaker 1>everyone who works for the fciu or as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the union,</v>

2785
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:42.730
<v Speaker 1>this now becomes a part of your job</v>
<v Speaker 1>description to show up in solidarity and</v>

2786
01:52:42.731 --> 01:52:44.650
<v Speaker 1>support them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same reason they support antifa</v>

2787
01:52:44.651 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>even though it's silly and they support</v>
<v Speaker 1>black</v>

2788
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.900
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not think you're right about that.</v>

2789
01:52:47.901 --> 01:52:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>love to march.</v>

2790
01:52:50.841 --> 01:52:54.380
<v Speaker 2>They lOve a some sort of a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they're doing the right</v>

2791
01:52:54.381 --> 01:52:56.090
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they're out there protesting.</v>

2792
01:52:56.091 --> 01:52:58.160
<v Speaker 2>They get excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on a saturday.</v>

2793
01:52:58.550 --> 01:53:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of these people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting paid.</v>

2794
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 2>These people are excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're out there.</v>

2795
01:53:02.451 --> 01:53:06.480
<v Speaker 2>They're chanting and cheering and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what they want to stand proud and be</v>

2796
01:53:06.890 --> 01:53:08.720
<v Speaker 2>solidified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and two weeks later,</v>

2797
01:53:08.721 --> 01:53:10.580
<v Speaker 2>none of them show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

2798
01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:12.530
<v Speaker 2>If there were many women's marches after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2799
01:53:12.531 --> 01:53:14.930
<v Speaker 2>The follow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like you look at the tea party</v>

2800
01:53:14.931 --> 01:53:17.600
<v Speaker 2>when it started there was to do one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to keep going all over</v>

2801
01:53:17.601 --> 01:53:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

2802
01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Twentieth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 10 days ago this.</v>

2803
01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the recent one.</v>

2804
01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like every.</v>

2805
01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 2>They do it once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can gather their troops.</v>

2806
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I think you crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2807
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we signed it for the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 15.</v>

2808
01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:34.110
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sea.</v>

2809
01:53:34.111 --> 01:53:36.170
<v Speaker 2>You were on all the mailing lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're on all the mailing lists as to</v>

2810
01:53:36.171 --> 01:53:38.870
<v Speaker 2>where these things meet and win the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for 15.</v>

2811
01:53:38.871 --> 01:53:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Was that a hashtag fight for 15?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

2812
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:45.470
<v Speaker 2>That's the fight for 15 minimum wage</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage thing.</v>

2813
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with the women's marches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when we showed up and we asked</v>

2814
01:53:48.231 --> 01:53:51.470
<v Speaker 2>them the ones outside of the big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only people who were there were paid</v>

2815
01:53:51.570 --> 01:53:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2816
01:53:53.031 --> 01:53:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Well that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2817
01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 2>That's a different march,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the women's march is pretty</v>

2818
01:53:57.051 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 2>legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these people are doing it</v>

2819
01:53:58.551 --> 01:54:01.070
<v Speaker 2>because they don't like having this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in power.</v>

2820
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:03.200
<v Speaker 2>They wAnted a woman is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two things going on.</v>

2821
01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.700
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted a woman to be president.</v>

2822
01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:07.880
<v Speaker 2>They thought a woman was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>president and then it was snatched from</v>

2823
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:09.850
<v Speaker 2>snatched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snatched,</v>

2824
01:54:10.290 --> 01:54:14.030
<v Speaker 2>snatched away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in a hat and framework.</v>

2825
01:54:14.031 --> 01:54:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Then now he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a fucking crazy guy,</v>

2826
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:21.590
<v Speaker 2>like donald trump's a crazy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to be a crazy guy the</v>

2827
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:23.150
<v Speaker 2>next month when you're doing another</v>
<v Speaker 2>protest,</v>

2828
01:54:23.151 --> 01:54:25.730
<v Speaker 2>but no one shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think somehow or another that it's</v>

2829
01:54:25.731 --> 01:54:27.410
<v Speaker 2>gonna have an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

2830
01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:30.050
<v Speaker 2>It does culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people are aware of it,</v>

2831
01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have any impact on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2832
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Most don't even know what theY want said</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2833
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.690
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they want to impact on find his</v>

2834
01:54:35.691 --> 01:54:38.240
<v Speaker 2>tweet because it was god damned</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious about the women's march,</v>

2835

<v Speaker 2>about what a wonderful day.</v>

2836
01:54:44.250 --> 01:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Those are the moments where things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe years,</v>

2837
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:49.270
<v Speaker 2>silverware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at pro life marches.</v>

2838
01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:51.890

<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

2839
01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.480
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

2840
01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Trump tweets in support of women's march</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also protesting him.</v>

2841
01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Go to the tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it</v>

2842
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:04.840
<v Speaker 2>all over the country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say depression.</v>

2843
01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get out there to celebrate the historic</v>

2844
01:55:07.791 --> 01:55:09.500

2845
01:55:09.501 --> 01:55:12.590
<v Speaker 2>success and wealth creation that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken place over the last 12 months</v>

2846
01:55:13.110 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 2>because I was female and employment at</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 years.</v>

2855
01:55:36.730 --> 01:55:39.230
<v Speaker 2>A lot of sites that have live punched</v>
<v Speaker 2>into laptops.</v>

2856
01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:41.990
<v Speaker 2>People were angry at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was hilarious.</v>

2857
01:55:41.991 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>When we went to the about the marches or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

2858
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.420
<v Speaker 1>protests we went to in grand rapids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the socialist march,</v>

2859
01:55:47.421 --> 01:55:47.870
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2860
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:51.050
<v Speaker 1>we ambulatory market is being really big</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>

2861
01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:55.320
<v Speaker 1>But to your point that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were pissed off that the students</v>

2862
01:55:55.321 --> 01:55:59.470
<v Speaker 1>who were like a lot of people just</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore the movement were pissed off</v>

2863
01:55:59.471 --> 01:56:01.790
<v Speaker 1>that the union people didn't show up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's coming in the busloads,</v>

2864
01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:05.010
<v Speaker 1>the union workers and didn't show where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people paid by the organization.</v>

2865
01:56:05.011 --> 01:56:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing we found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like the Utah antifa and the reason</v>

2866
01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:10.620
<v Speaker 1>we say this is every time we show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found it actually from a leftist</v>

2867
01:56:10.621 --> 01:56:13.860
<v Speaker 1>activist group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about what do we average a twelfth</v>

2868
01:56:13.861 --> 01:56:15.780
<v Speaker 1>of the people who say they're interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in going,</v>

2869
01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.760
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like a twelfth,</v>

2870
01:56:17.761 --> 01:56:19.010
<v Speaker 1>like reggie came up with a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2871
01:56:19.011 --> 01:56:20.760
<v Speaker 1>if they like facebook and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have to show up.</v>

2872
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If 120 18 we'll say attending,</v>

2873
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.740
<v Speaker 1>it'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be like eight and it's this</v>

2874
01:56:25.741 --> 01:56:29.310
<v Speaker 1>consistent to the point where we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>determine what events we go to or what</v>

2875
01:56:29.311 --> 01:56:32.400
<v Speaker 1>is funny enough to cover because even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will say a few thousand people are</v>

2876
01:56:32.401 --> 01:56:34.500
<v Speaker 1>going to a march,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably it's far,</v>

2877
01:56:34.501 --> 01:56:36.750
<v Speaker 1>far less to run through the bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>agora algorithms do.</v>

2878
01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:39.990
<v Speaker 1>We've had so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does This depend on where you're talking</v>

2879
01:56:39.991 --> 01:56:41.670
<v Speaker 1>about like if you're in lansing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan,</v>

2880
01:56:41.671 --> 01:56:42.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in la,</v>

2881
01:56:42.871 --> 01:56:45.780
<v Speaker 1>these marches or while you're in la now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some.</v>

2882
01:56:45.781 --> 01:56:47.700
<v Speaker 1>But for every one that you see that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media says,</v>

2883
01:56:47.701 --> 01:56:49.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna you know this is all hands</v>

2884
01:56:49.111 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 1>on deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 40 no one shows up.</v>

2885
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.570
<v Speaker 1>You know we had that even in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>city with the fight for 15.</v>

2886
01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And we sense though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many times can you get people</v>

2887
01:56:57.151 --> 01:56:57.984
<v Speaker 1>to march?</v>

2888
01:56:58.170 --> 01:57:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even show up for any protests.</v>

2889
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:02.130
<v Speaker 1>You know how many times you can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to protest.</v>

2890
01:57:02.131 --> 01:57:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can only get a few of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a person in a year.</v>

2891
01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:07.980
<v Speaker 1>You disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think people are just down to do it</v>

2892
01:57:07.981 --> 01:57:10.110
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was hundreds of thousands.</v>

2893
01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Like every other month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like clockwork.</v>

2894
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And then they won an election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different though.</v>

2895
01:57:14.890 --> 01:57:16.710
<v Speaker 1>The yj 20 group.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know they're all sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching and he's,</v>

2963
01:59:56.890 --> 02:00:00.160
<v Speaker 1>he's doing all the talking and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies with all of them.</v>

2964
02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:02.650
<v Speaker 1>He wants you to think that they came</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight out of central casting.</v>

2965
02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:04.480
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>SomE of them.</v>

2966
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them.</v>

2967
02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Were they paid by the same people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay the women to march?</v>

2968

<v Speaker 1>Ciu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Source.</v>

2969
02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:14.520

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2970
02:00:14.710 --> 02:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Was one of the best moments ever when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2971
02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones got high on the podcast and</v>

2972
02:00:19.601 --> 02:00:21.400
<v Speaker 1>then it came up during his divorce</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing.</v>

2973
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only smoked marijuana once a year to</v>

2974
02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>find out if george soros is making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

2975
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2976
02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:30.130
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something of the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to test it for potency.</v>

2977
02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Soros is imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soros sitting there and it's fucking</v>

2978
02:00:34.541 --> 02:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>castle somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack up the potency and the weed.</v>

2979
02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>He makes the kids on kitten high enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually say,</v>

2980
02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>tell them he not only said that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't remember his kids' teachers'</v>

2981
02:00:53.111 --> 02:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he said,</v>

2982
02:00:54.191 --> 02:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a big bowl of chili today.</v>

2983
02:00:55.871 --> 02:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said I have a big bowl of chili.</v>

2984
02:01:00.311 --> 02:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has he been on the show since then?</v>

2985
02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much of a liability with the</v>

2986
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:05.120
<v Speaker 1>cheating on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have them on.</v>

2987
02:01:05.650 --> 02:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted it for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If his lawyers won't be careful.</v>

2988
02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>He just hasn't been in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked me to do his show in austin and</v>

2989
02:01:11.261 --> 02:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry alex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do it.</v>

2990
02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I was in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in like two hours before my shows.</v>

2991
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I had two shows that night out had fly</v>
<v Speaker 1>out at 7:00 AM and the next day,</v>

2992
02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>well he's a very hospitable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's aggressively hospitable because he</v>

2993
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>tried to get us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left me a voicemail and you're all</v>

2994
02:01:24.631 --> 02:01:25.510
<v Speaker 1>saying that and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't don't be a pussy.</v>

2997
02:01:28.210 --> 02:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Just</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing us around.</v>

2998
02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find this guy punched him and let</v>

2999
02:01:33.071 --> 02:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>us know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have people snapping pictures of us.</v>

3000
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we got to go.</v>

3001
02:01:35.891 --> 02:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>This is what we did a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were undercover at a south by</v>

3002
02:01:39.111 --> 02:01:39.944
<v Speaker 1>southwest</v>

3003
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.640
<v Speaker 2>and and we could avoid them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>

3004
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand why you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have studios here and we can protect</v>

3005
02:01:44.031 --> 02:01:47.090
<v Speaker 2>you or it's like you don't understand we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are halfway to waco or out of town.</v>

3006
02:01:47.091 --> 02:01:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Is there a total or not be opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

3007
02:01:48.910 --> 02:01:50.960
<v Speaker 2>It was really trying to be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>hospitable,</v>

3008
02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 2>but we were just trying to get out oF</v>
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>

3009
02:01:53.090 --> 02:01:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I got more hate from that episode too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I was like,</v>

3010
02:01:56.121 --> 02:01:57.710
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you see why I love him?</v>

3011
02:01:58.130 --> 02:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Like you see him when he's drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stoned and we're having a great time.</v>

3012
02:02:01.161 --> 02:02:04.950
<v Speaker 2>It's talking about interdimensional</v>
<v Speaker 2>child molesters and when he was chris,</v>

3013
02:02:04.951 --> 02:02:06.530
<v Speaker 2>great television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's crazy.</v>

3014
02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:09.200
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell like Alex Jones is a fun guy.</v>

3015
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:10.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>

3016
02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe everything he believes.</v>

3017
02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean he believes sandy hook was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake,</v>

3018
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a rough one.</v>

3019
02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I think he's dropped that since then and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tries to come up with some caveats or</v>

3020
02:02:20.391 --> 02:02:21.760
<v Speaker 2>something like that or some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

3021
02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:25.590
<v Speaker 2>some things when we're not shown that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were real or new evidence has come to.</v>

3022
02:02:26.430 --> 02:02:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck that was all</v>

3023
02:02:28.911 --> 02:02:30.980
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that one from a few careless</v>

3024
02:02:30.981 --> 02:02:31.581
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3025
02:02:31.581 --> 02:02:32.810
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that,</v>

3026
02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:35.180
<v Speaker 2>but then there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vegas thing was a conspiracy.</v>

3027
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:38.390
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people take that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one,</v>

3028
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:40.460
<v Speaker 2>but nothing's come up since then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was weird.</v>

3029
02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:42.230
<v Speaker 2>The way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the vegas one.</v>

3030
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's weird about the vegas one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's differing opinions</v>

3031
02:02:46.281 --> 02:02:48.620
<v Speaker 2>on timelines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's different stories rather on</v>

3032
02:02:48.621 --> 02:02:51.770
<v Speaker 2>timelines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's possibility that someone may</v>

3033
02:02:51.771 --> 02:02:54.420
<v Speaker 2>have aided him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and he,</v>

3034
02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.190
<v Speaker 2>the guy was a fucking evil cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He covered his tracks.</v>

3035
02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's almost like he wanted people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go crazy.</v>

3036
02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Search warrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>document shows.</v>

3037
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Second person of interest after las</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegas.</v>

3038
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:06.890
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this class a couple of hours really</v>

3039
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 2>unsealed documents in a guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>douglas haig or something popped up and.</v>

3040
02:03:10.161 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there you go.</v>

3041
02:03:11.090 --> 02:03:12.710
<v Speaker 2>That's interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that makes sense.</v>

3042
02:03:12.711 --> 02:03:13.544
<v Speaker 2>The biggest review,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3043
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:15.200
<v Speaker 2>who else is reporting this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me everywhere.</v>

3044
02:03:15.201 --> 02:03:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3045
02:03:16.311 --> 02:03:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

3046
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that what's going on is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably so many that helped him</v>

3047
02:03:21.021 --> 02:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>get the guns and help to move them up</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the room or something along that.</v>

3048
02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3049
02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:26.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people saying like the</v>

3050
02:03:26.781 --> 02:03:29.180
<v Speaker 2>bodies were fake and I kind of stepped</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of their mind.</v>

3051
02:03:29.181 --> 02:03:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I know somebody who got shot there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3052
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I know somebody who got shot there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the girls who was the ring card</v>

3053
02:03:34.011 --> 02:03:38.210
<v Speaker 2>girl was there while it happened and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>escaped narrowly with her life while</v>

3054
02:03:38.211 --> 02:03:41.080
<v Speaker 2>people were dropping right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>her as she was running rooms.</v>

3055
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Ashley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as she was running,</v>

3056
02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:44.840
<v Speaker 2>people were getting shot right in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of her.</v>

3057
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Dan bilzerian was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan told me,</v>

3058
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>lady's head get blown off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3059
02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 2>He does hit a lady's head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploded right in front of them.</v>

3060
02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where.</v>

3061
02:03:54.381 --> 02:03:55.880
<v Speaker 2>That's where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's a conspiracy,</v>

3062
02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:56.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>

3063
02:03:56.351 --> 02:03:56.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

3064
02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's say this is the second person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Help them.</v>

3065
02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's even say there's a second shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could have been.</v>

3066
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't undo the horror.</v>

3067
02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:05.510
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean there was some</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy necessarily to cover up a</v>

3068
02:04:05.511 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>second shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's new information that's</v>

3069
02:04:06.861 --> 02:04:09.980
<v Speaker 2>come to light and there's often a grain</v>
<v Speaker 2>of truth sometimes and then people go</v>

3070
02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>there for better da da da da da da,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just was trying to tell me what</v>

3071
02:04:15.471 --> 02:04:17.960
<v Speaker 2>they reported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shooters that all these other casinos,</v>

3072
02:04:17.961 --> 02:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>but then the news never covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3073
02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:20.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand.</v>

3074
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:24.680
<v Speaker 2>When there's 50 people to get murdered</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a guy who's shooting out of a fucking</v>

3075
02:04:24.681 --> 02:04:27.320
<v Speaker 2>mandalay bay window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have chaos and when you</v>

3076
02:04:27.321 --> 02:04:29.060
<v Speaker 2>have chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people run into casinos.</v>

3077
02:04:29.090 --> 02:04:30.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a shooter,</v>

3078
02:04:30.590 --> 02:04:33.230
<v Speaker 2>they'll run into circus circus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're running into mgm.</v>

3079
02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.640
<v Speaker 2>They'll scream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a shooter.</v>

3080
02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:36.260
<v Speaker 2>People get on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call,</v>

3081
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:39.210
<v Speaker 2>they call security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A shooter at the mgm doesn't mean as a</v>

3082
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:41.640
<v Speaker 2>shooter at the mgm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means there's chaos.</v>

3083
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get a lot of bad information,</v>

3084
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:45.420
<v Speaker 2>puts it a lot of echo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure too.</v>

3085
02:04:45.421 --> 02:04:47.340
<v Speaker 2>So in the middle of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know where it's coming from.</v>

3086
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:52.850
<v Speaker 2>The mandalay bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the girls that was at the ufc,</v>

3087
02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 2>she got her leg blown out because</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone had got shot and killed right in</v>

3088
02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:58.920
<v Speaker 2>front of her and the guy fell on her leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it blew her acl out.</v>

3089
02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the fighters from the ufc.</v>

3090
02:05:01.330 --> 02:05:01.831
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3091
02:05:01.831 --> 02:05:03.090
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the girls who was at the,</v>

3092
02:05:03.091 --> 02:05:05.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the event and then dana white got a</v>

3093
02:05:05.341 --> 02:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people that got shot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and dana white's the best and</v>

3094
02:05:08.671 --> 02:05:11.190
<v Speaker 2>he brought these people to the event and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3095
02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:13.920
<v Speaker 2>it's like we did an event that week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3096
02:05:14.190 --> 02:05:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I did a comedy show that week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a comedy show at the mirage that</v>

3097
02:05:19.531 --> 02:05:21.720
<v Speaker 2>fried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I donated all the money to the vegas</v>

3098
02:05:21.721 --> 02:05:23.530
<v Speaker 2>victims fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like,</v>

3099
02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was weird.</v>

3100
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:26.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

3101
02:05:26.731 --> 02:05:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is weird to sing country music</v>

3102
02:05:29.371 --> 02:05:30.630
<v Speaker 2>festival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3103
02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:32.250
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a right wing people.</v>

3104
02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not saying this as a left wing</v>

3105
02:05:33.721 --> 02:05:35.340
<v Speaker 2>extremists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is weird that we didn't really</v>

3106
02:05:35.341 --> 02:05:37.890
<v Speaker 2>hear a whole lot after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy didn't give a fuck who he was</v>

3107
02:05:37.891 --> 02:05:38.340
<v Speaker 2>killing.</v>

3108
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.530
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't trying to kill country music</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3109
02:05:40.531 --> 02:05:44.930
<v Speaker 2>He dId this at other music events to</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he showed up and scanned it in and</v>

3110
02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:48.990
<v Speaker 2>got hotel rooms and overlooked the exact</v>
<v Speaker 2>same sort of a scenario.</v>

3111
02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.930
<v Speaker 2>He was plotting this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to kill a bunch of people</v>

3112
02:05:51.931 --> 02:05:52.890
<v Speaker 2>and then kill himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3113
02:05:53.490 --> 02:05:55.980
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another guy that was on some sort</v>

3114
02:05:55.981 --> 02:05:59.610
<v Speaker 2>of psych medication and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>constant and these mass shooters and</v>

3115
02:05:59.611 --> 02:06:03.510
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things that gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored and it should be fucking front</v>

3116
02:06:03.511 --> 02:06:05.730
<v Speaker 2>and center and everybody's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be thinking,</v>

3117
02:06:05.731 --> 02:06:08.280
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing to people by giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>them these pills?</v>

3118
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are we doing on xanax or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

3119
02:06:11.041 --> 02:06:13.420
<v Speaker 2>He wAs on anti anxiety medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

3120
02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>which has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

3121
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:17.610
<v Speaker 2>same kind of shit that chris cornell was</v>
<v Speaker 2>on when he hung himself.</v>

3122
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:20.220
<v Speaker 2>That antianxiety medication is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3123
02:06:20.221 --> 02:06:23.680
<v Speaker 2>and who knows what kind of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>adverse reaction you're going to have to</v>

3124
02:06:23.681 --> 02:06:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3125
02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:27.390
<v Speaker 2>People react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do the genetic testing now and I've</v>

3126
02:06:27.391 --> 02:06:29.100
<v Speaker 2>done that for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've done that now</v>

3127
02:06:29.101 --> 02:06:31.590
<v Speaker 2>they do it as a consumer thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty three and me I think,</v>

3128
02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:34.740
<v Speaker 2>but actually my doctor actually did</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic testing where we did it in the</v>

3129
02:06:34.741 --> 02:06:35.670
<v Speaker 2>office to check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3130
02:06:35.671 --> 02:06:38.790
<v Speaker 2>for predispositions towards diseases and</v>
<v Speaker 2>also you can check to see which</v>

3131
02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:41.040
<v Speaker 2>medications you might have negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions with.</v>

3132
02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they found out for me there were</v>

3133
02:06:43.111 --> 02:06:46.350
<v Speaker 2>certain painkillers that would be really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad that I wouldn't process super</v>

3134
02:06:46.351 --> 02:06:47.820
<v Speaker 2>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some that would work.</v>

3135
02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing as far as even like,</v>

3136
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a celebrex would've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse for me to take advil.</v>

3137
02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:56.820
<v Speaker 2>So things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this actually works better with</v>

3138
02:06:56.821 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 2>your body chemistry and when you get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotropic medication.</v>

3139
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had negative interactions with a</v>

3140
02:07:03.361 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 2>list of whatever antidepressants run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3141
02:07:05.491 --> 02:07:06.810
<v Speaker 2>do Not take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a green,</v>

3142
02:07:07.050 --> 02:07:08.580
<v Speaker 2>green column,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yellow column,</v>

3143
02:07:08.581 --> 02:07:10.950
<v Speaker 2>red column,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most people don't know and it's not</v>

3144
02:07:10.951 --> 02:07:13.650
<v Speaker 2>entirely accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're saying that it's increasing</v>

3145
02:07:13.890 --> 02:07:17.490
<v Speaker 2>the efficacy of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of medication by like 50 percent using</v>

3146
02:07:17.491 --> 02:07:19.600
<v Speaker 2>this as a guideline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is fascinating.</v>

3147
02:07:20.610 --> 02:07:21.960
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

3148
02:07:21.961 --> 02:07:23.940
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole family is fucking crazy.</v>

3149
02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:26.850
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad was a serial bank robber.</v>

3150
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:30.240
<v Speaker 2>The guy's brother got busted for child</v>
<v Speaker 2>pornography.</v>

3151
02:07:30.241 --> 02:07:31.860
<v Speaker 2>that's what whitney cummings brought up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day.</v>

3152
02:07:31.861 --> 02:07:33.720
<v Speaker 2>She thought it was the shooter is</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually his brother.</v>

3153
02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I remember it after the fact on some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his computer</v>

3154
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 1>to apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

3155
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:41.020
<v Speaker 1>The whole family is fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't the shooter?</v>

3156
02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laptops that was in the room or that one</v>

3157
02:07:44.261 --> 02:07:46.990
<v Speaker 1>of the five laptops had apparently so</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe borrowed it from his brother.</v>

3158
02:07:47.890 --> 02:07:49.530
<v Speaker 1>That's his excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed.</v>

3159
02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:51.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what he told the cop before he</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot himself.</v>

3160
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently someone fired a gun in the</v>

3161
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>room besides him to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who fucked knows.</v>

3162
02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:58.780
<v Speaker 1>That was one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The room service bill.</v>

3163
02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That was something that there was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of conspiracies and</v>

3164
02:08:01.541 --> 02:08:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that's like an example where I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>people said no one had been to the room</v>

3165
02:08:03.971 --> 02:08:05.610
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and then there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>room service bill.</v>

3166
02:08:05.611 --> 02:08:08.590
<v Speaker 1>It said someone had been in the room</v>
<v Speaker 1>room service and then it looked like,</v>

3167
02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I think by the aMount of food that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were possibly two people in the room,</v>

3168
02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:14.500
<v Speaker 1>like I've known fat people who go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive through number two,</v>

3169
02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.420
<v Speaker 1>diet cokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come me feel less guilty.</v>

3170
02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:19.400

<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>room service and people like how many</v>

02:08:51.670 --> 02:08:52.331
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

3188
02:08:52.331 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 1>we were somewhere and he just asked the</v>
<v Speaker 1>server.</v>

3189
02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:57.520
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please double meat.</v>

3190
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:58.591
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3191
02:08:58.591 --> 02:08:59.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want,</v>

3192
02:08:59.471 --> 02:09:02.170
<v Speaker 1>you want a dollar more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went to ladders mores figure it</v>

3193
02:09:02.171 --> 02:09:03.004
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3194
02:09:05.630 --> 02:09:09.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing to say to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's handling your food this</v>

3195
02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>out bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the room service bill,</v>

3196
02:09:10.711 --> 02:09:11.950
<v Speaker 1>that was something where I read it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

3197
02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:12.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's curious,</v>

3198
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:13.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The room service bell.</v>

3199
02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:16.060
<v Speaker 1>That's my point is with the kernel of</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth in some of these conspiracies,</v>

3200
02:09:16.061 --> 02:09:17.320
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go on a second,</v>

3201
02:09:17.321 --> 02:09:21.010
<v Speaker 1>the room service bill has to tuna fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwiches and one steak tartare.</v>

3202
02:09:21.070 --> 02:09:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Therefore the jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3203
02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:22.991
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3204
02:09:22.991 --> 02:09:26.500
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making a huge leap and it makes</v>

3205
02:09:26.501 --> 02:09:27.170
<v Speaker 1>it hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

3206
02:09:27.170 --> 02:09:30.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a plus side to new media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we talk about this all the time.</v>

3207
02:09:30.101 --> 02:09:33.010
<v Speaker 1>We feel a lot of responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially being more of a entertainment</v>

3208
02:09:33.011 --> 02:09:37.030
<v Speaker 1>show where it's great because you can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show and you don't have the same</v>

3209
02:09:37.031 --> 02:09:40.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of time constraints and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about things authentically as long</v>

3210
02:09:40.001 --> 02:09:42.070
<v Speaker 1>as you know for the youtube stuff they</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow us to.</v>

3211
02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:45.040
<v Speaker 1>BuT on the flip side is anyone can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>information out there and there are</v>

3212
02:09:45.041 --> 02:09:47.260
<v Speaker 1>people willing to capitalize on that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>proactively lie.</v>

3213
02:09:47.290 --> 02:09:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like I get it,</v>

3214
02:09:49.330 --> 02:09:51.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the solution is not to have a bunch</v>

3215
02:09:51.641 --> 02:09:54.190
<v Speaker 1>of people in silicon valley determining</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's right,</v>

3216
02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:55.360
<v Speaker 1>what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3217
02:09:55.361 --> 02:09:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like those flat earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks.</v>

3218
02:09:57.550 --> 02:10:00.520
<v Speaker 1>You can make a video on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want to make a video and</v>

3219
02:10:00.521 --> 02:10:02.620
<v Speaker 1>if it's compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same flat earth guy,</v>

3220
02:10:02.621 --> 02:10:06.790
<v Speaker 1>he's got a video on dinosaurs not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>real nuclear bombs being fake satellites</v>

3221
02:10:06.791 --> 02:10:11.791
<v Speaker 1>being fake really jitsu doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wing chung is the shit fucking mind this</v>

3222
02:10:12.131 --> 02:10:14.590
<v Speaker 1>guy and people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People ignore that.</v>

3223
02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:16.700
<v Speaker 1>They ignore that and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3224
02:10:16.701 --> 02:10:17.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's flutter.</v>

3225
02:10:17.741 --> 02:10:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Think pretty compelling man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GoTta look into it.</v>

3226
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to quito,</v>

3227

<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be there.</v>

3228
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

3229
02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I would not be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd sidestep you.</v>

3230
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3231
02:10:26.591 --> 02:10:27.880
<v Speaker 1>that's what it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorite things to do</v>

3232
02:10:27.881 --> 02:10:31.180
<v Speaker 1>is watch those on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I post those on instagram left and</v>

3233
02:10:31.181 --> 02:10:31.901
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3234
02:10:31.901 --> 02:10:34.640
<v Speaker 1>The hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just look up hashtag legit as</v>

3235
02:10:34.641 --> 02:10:36.710
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my hashtag.</v>

3236
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I put put up with all fake martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos of like,</v>

3237
02:10:40.941 --> 02:10:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of them I posted</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever illuminati frame somewhere in</v>

3238
02:10:44.541 --> 02:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>there that I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop posting a man because now when you</v>

<v Speaker 1>repost them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm my fucking instagram is getting</v>

3240
02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>flagged with people are claiming them</v>
<v Speaker 1>with martial arts videos.</v>

3241
02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Even if they didn't make them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can claim them and say it's theirs</v>

3242
02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:00.500
<v Speaker 1>and they can get it taken down from</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook or instagram.</v>

3243
02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Shake you down for a few books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't necessarily film them,</v>

3244
02:11:03.501 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>but if they say it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you have to prove it's not.</v>

3245
02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:09.110
<v Speaker 1>There's like there's a lot of squirrelly</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there when it comes to videos</v>

3246
02:11:09.111 --> 02:11:11.320
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially people who were flooded with</v>

3247
02:11:11.321 --> 02:11:13.230
<v Speaker 1>clayton claimers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

3248
02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:16.190
<v Speaker 1>One person tried to argue that with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know the whole mandela effect.</v>

3249
02:11:16.191 --> 02:11:17.024
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3250
02:11:17.110 --> 02:11:17.811
<v Speaker 1>Into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3251
02:11:17.811 --> 02:11:19.940
<v Speaker 1>it's parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's berenstein bears,</v>

3252
02:11:19.941 --> 02:11:21.610
<v Speaker 1>not berenstein bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you thought it was going to</v>

3253
02:11:21.611 --> 02:11:24.830
<v Speaker 1>convince me I'm going last because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because I am not shizam that genie</v>

3254
02:11:24.831 --> 02:11:26.530
<v Speaker 1>movie with shack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a big thing for that.</v>

3255
02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the hill they die on with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same person was a flat earth or and said</v>

3256
02:11:29.811 --> 02:11:30.644
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3257
02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:31.940
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an easy test.</v>

3258
02:11:32.130 --> 02:11:33.350
<v Speaker 1>The earth is spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3259
02:11:33.351 --> 02:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>If it's spinning a thousand miles an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

3260
02:11:34.551 --> 02:11:36.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go up in a helicopter,</v>

3261
02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:37.610
<v Speaker 1>don't move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back down.</v>

3262
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:39.800
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lie,</v>

3263
02:11:39.801 --> 02:11:40.401
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3264
02:11:40.401 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not a scientist,</v>

3265
02:11:42.351 --> 02:11:44.780
<v Speaker 1>but I know if I throw a baseball from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of the bus,</v>

3266
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:47.600
<v Speaker 1>it's going to the front of the bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're starting at the same</v>

3267
02:11:47.601 --> 02:11:48.120
<v Speaker 1>velocity.</v>

3268
02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is basic physics that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will learn in high school.</v>

3269
02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:51.651
<v Speaker 1>So that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

3270
02:11:51.651 --> 02:11:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like my mount saint helens volcano</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

3271
02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:58.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't understand science.</v>

3272
02:11:58.461 --> 02:12:00.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand physics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just.</v>

3273
02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:02.270
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say things and it's compelling to</v>

3274
02:12:02.271 --> 02:12:04.970
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's photos of the fucking glaciers</v>

3275
02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:06.470
<v Speaker 1>in antarctica and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3276
02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it's the oldest wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they really believe there's an ice</v>

3277
02:12:08.961 --> 02:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty bad ass will be saved.</v>

3278
02:12:12.101 --> 02:12:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump's some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but managing anybody keeping that</v>

3279
02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine someone like some high.</v>

3280
02:12:17.550 --> 02:12:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jamie's got round earth.</v>

3281
02:12:18.831 --> 02:12:20.990
<v Speaker 1>She'll tee shirts for sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young jamie.com.</v>

3282
02:12:21.210 --> 02:12:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Hold on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3283
02:12:22.101 --> 02:12:24.800
<v Speaker 1>do your pitch with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question to why,</v>

3284
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:28.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're not scientists and there's a</v>

3285
02:12:28.041 --> 02:12:30.200
<v Speaker 1>bunch that you could probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone could come on and talk about the</v>

3286
02:12:30.201 --> 02:12:32.090
<v Speaker 1>earth's core and talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitational pull that we'd be like,</v>

3287
02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:32.360
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

3288
02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:33.710
<v Speaker 1>That's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

3289
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can all.</v>

3290
02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone want to convince me?</v>

3291
02:12:38.961 --> 02:12:40.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a flat earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3292
02:12:40.970 --> 02:12:43.190
<v Speaker 1>What is your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone want to convince you</v>

3293
02:12:43.191 --> 02:12:44.400
<v Speaker 1>that it's round?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually flat.</v>

3294
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the ground earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This property.</v>

3295
02:12:46.971 --> 02:12:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just love bullshit.</v>

3296
02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:50.930
<v Speaker 1>They get off on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no audience for it,</v>

3297
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:55.310
<v Speaker 1>but they enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they really enjoy bullshit.</v>

3298
02:12:55.490 --> 02:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I think people get excited about</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they can try to uncover some</v>

3299
02:13:00.561 --> 02:13:02.060
<v Speaker 1>human thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3300
02:13:02.090 --> 02:13:04.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think they're going to attack us,</v>

3301
02:13:04.011 --> 02:13:06.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's like a secret,</v>

3302
02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a secret,</v>

3303
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but like a thing in your head about</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncovering secrets.</v>

3304
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what that Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3305
02:13:12.230 --> 02:13:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it appeals to the contrarians</v>
<v Speaker 1>too because they just liked to piss</v>

3306
02:13:14.971 --> 02:13:15.380
<v Speaker 1>people off.</v>

3307
02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:18.590
<v Speaker 1>They liked to do and a lot of them were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just really uneducated.</v>

3308
02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean super uneducated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they just don't understand basic</v>

3309
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:24.560
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just a few things.</v>

3310
02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:26.450
<v Speaker 1>The martial arts thing is a good example</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>

3311
02:13:26.451 --> 02:13:30.380
<v Speaker 1>because not get joe to starting to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starting to do jujitsu and a weight</v>

<v Speaker 1>Super nice guy.</v>

3335
02:14:13.871 --> 02:14:16.470
<v Speaker 1>like we church going christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always kind of joke about him and</v>

3336
02:14:16.471 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3337
02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3338
02:14:18.871 --> 02:14:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see there's something burning</v>

3339
02:14:20.011 --> 02:14:20.761
<v Speaker 1>beneath the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3340
02:14:20.761 --> 02:14:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not.</v>

3341
02:14:22.130 --> 02:14:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to kill him.</v>

3342
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point he was doing security.</v>

3343
02:14:27.650 --> 02:14:29.250
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see him walking up to.</v>

3344
02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

3345
02:14:30.541 --> 02:14:32.600
<v Speaker 1>sTop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see just that little bit with</v>

3346
02:14:32.770 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 1>the shortest fuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's always amazing to me that that</v>

3347
02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:37.710
<v Speaker 1>people just deny it and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3348
02:14:37.711 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me what you tell him about the flat</v>

3349
02:14:39.841 --> 02:14:41.030
<v Speaker 1>earth thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Akita,</v>

3350
02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:45.240
<v Speaker 1>show me one video ever in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind.</v>

3351
02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Have a kito winning a fight against a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts guy.</v>

3352
02:14:49.170 --> 02:14:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Or I had someone who believed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>steven seagal was a legitimate fighter.</v>

3353
02:14:51.481 --> 02:14:52.314
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3354
02:14:52.410 --> 02:14:56.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one video ever in the history of steven</v>

3355
02:14:56.701 --> 02:15:01.160
<v Speaker 1>seagal fighting and I'm willing to never</v>
<v Speaker 1>got more crap than our bruce or Bruce</v>

3356
02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Lee video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3357
02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:05.280
<v Speaker 1>we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said he was a good theorist and he was</v>

3358
02:15:05.281 --> 02:15:07.140
<v Speaker 1>one of the early sort of mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts adopters,</v>

3359
02:15:07.141 --> 02:15:12.141
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is Bruce Lee would get</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed by a decent flight in use and</v>

3360
02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you?</v>

3361
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:14.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3362
02:15:14.770 --> 02:15:18.400
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also The reality is the martial arts</v>

3363
02:15:18.401 --> 02:15:22.210
<v Speaker 2>from 1970 versus the martial arts from</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018,</v>

3364
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:25.090
<v Speaker 2>there's been more radical change in</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>

3365
02:15:25.091 --> 02:15:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3366
02:15:25.690 --> 02:15:30.690
<v Speaker 2>the understanding of techniques since</v>
<v Speaker 2>1993 to 2018 than there's ever been.</v>

3367
02:15:30.761 --> 02:15:34.000
<v Speaker 2>And The history of martial arts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Lee was responsible for a big</v>

3368
02:15:34.001 --> 02:15:37.300
<v Speaker 2>shift from 1970 to the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3369
02:15:37.301 --> 02:15:39.700
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to find a single ufc</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

3370
02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:42.580
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't a Bruce Lee fan or isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently a Bruce Lee fan,</v>

3371
02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>including me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that what he did was</v>

3372
02:15:45.521 --> 02:15:48.090
<v Speaker 2>introduced this open minded approach to</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>

3373
02:15:48.091 --> 02:15:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking what's useful from boxing,</v>

3374
02:15:50.261 --> 02:15:51.550
<v Speaker 2>from wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3375
02:15:51.551 --> 02:15:52.680
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you enter the dragon,</v>

3376
02:15:52.690 --> 02:15:55.840
<v Speaker 2>he's doing an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know he killed somebody killed chuck</v>

3377
02:15:55.841 --> 02:15:56.674
<v Speaker 2>norris with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3378
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:59.200
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand what you're saying,</v>

3379
02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:01.310
<v Speaker 2>but he's doing weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing.</v>

3380
02:16:01.311 --> 02:16:03.190
<v Speaker 2>He's eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He obviously wasn't a black belt in</v>

3381
02:16:03.191 --> 02:16:05.050
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3382
02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:06.300
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we talked about,</v>

3383
02:16:06.301 --> 02:16:08.950
<v Speaker 1>what people got really mad at is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying he would cream anybody like</v>

3384
02:16:08.951 --> 02:16:10.410
<v Speaker 1>in your class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

3385
02:16:10.411 --> 02:16:13.230
<v Speaker 1>well hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's two inches shorter and 25 pounds</v>

3386
02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:14.170
<v Speaker 1>lighter than knock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey jared,</v>

3387
02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:17.710
<v Speaker 1>and so we had not get jared and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee punch is coming and people</v>

3388
02:16:17.711 --> 02:16:20.860
<v Speaker 1>were furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 25 pounds heavier and two inches</v>

3389
02:16:20.861 --> 02:16:23.850
<v Speaker 1>taller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an idea as to how small of a man</v>

3390
02:16:23.851 --> 02:16:25.620
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not dealing with.</v>

3391
02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:27.570
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that he didn't write a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good towel,</v>

3392
02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.550
<v Speaker 1>didn't write a good book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book's great,</v>

3393
02:16:29.551 --> 02:16:29.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's also</v>

3394
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:34.000
<v Speaker 2>a plagiarized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told really passages in full without</v>

3395
02:16:34.001 --> 02:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>any accreditation at all and took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to say it in a bad way</v>

3396
02:16:37.241 --> 02:16:39.970
<v Speaker 2>because I think what he was trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just like his whole style.</v>

3397
02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:44.380
<v Speaker 2>He just took big chunks of books on</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing and other different martial arts</v>

3398
02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:49.360
<v Speaker 2>and took verbatim passages from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe plagiarizing is not the right word</v>

3399
02:16:49.361 --> 02:16:54.361
<v Speaker 2>because what is what he did was like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>collection of martial arts technique and</v>

3400
02:16:54.701 --> 02:16:59.480
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things he did see if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have to follow me and he was.</v>

3401
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't an author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what he was.</v>

3402
02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:07.180
<v Speaker 2>He was a martial artist and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>collecting different writings on</v>

3403
02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:10.990
<v Speaker 2>different styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See a Bruce Lee,</v>

3404
02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:14.430
<v Speaker 2>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tao tao of jeet kune doe.</v>

3405
02:17:14.610 --> 02:17:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm plagiarized passages and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a giant Bruce Lee fan.</v>

3406
02:17:18.701 --> 02:17:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shitting on him but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

3407
02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also very important.</v>

3408
02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I owned the tao of jeet kune do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very important that he did</v>

3409
02:17:25.630 --> 02:17:28.600
<v Speaker 2>collect these important works on</v>
<v Speaker 2>different martial arts and he was the</v>

3410
02:17:28.601 --> 02:17:31.090
<v Speaker 2>first dude when I first started out</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing martial arts.</v>

3411
02:17:31.091 --> 02:17:33.490
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to just do taekwondo.</v>

3412
02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:37.030
<v Speaker 2>When I branched out and started doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>muay thai and kickboxing,</v>

3413
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:40.200
<v Speaker 2>they were very against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the traditionalist was very</v>

3414
02:17:40.210 --> 02:17:42.190
<v Speaker 2>against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very against trying out other</v>

3415
02:17:42.191 --> 02:17:44.050
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't,</v>

3416
02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:45.670
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't think it was necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3417
02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:48.280
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've sparred with these guys getting</v>

3418
02:17:48.281 --> 02:17:49.930
<v Speaker 2>kicked in the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking aWful.</v>

3419
02:17:50.170 --> 02:17:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to learn how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys.</v>

3420
02:17:52.140 --> 02:17:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna not learn this.</v>

3421
02:17:53.951 --> 02:17:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Somebody kicked my leg once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3422
02:17:55.510 --> 02:17:57.120
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3423
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:58.390
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got,</v>

3424
02:17:58.391 --> 02:18:01.360
<v Speaker 2>we got a new thing to change this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I got to learn that same thing with</v>

3425
02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:01.780
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu.</v>

3426
02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:03.190
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I did jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3427
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got fucking raped.</v>

3428
02:18:05.590 --> 02:18:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally like ragdoll by some</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who is exactly the same size as me.</v>

3429
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3430
02:18:09.911 --> 02:18:12.190
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I got to learn this because there's</v>

3431
02:18:12.191 --> 02:18:14.860
<v Speaker 2>no fucking way I can go through life</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking I know how to fight,</v>

3432
02:18:14.861 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 2>why this guy's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3433
02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.540
<v Speaker 2>It was a purple belt too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even like,</v>

3434
02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:19.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't bigger than me.</v>

3435
02:18:19.890 --> 02:18:22.420
<v Speaker 2>It was like close to my age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He killed me.</v>

3436
02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:23.740
<v Speaker 2>And then even your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3437
02:18:23.741 --> 02:18:24.790
<v Speaker 2>you're a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're accomplished.</v>

3438
02:18:24.791 --> 02:18:26.350
<v Speaker 2>And then you roll someone like I rolled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3439
02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm fortunate enough to have some good</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys because I travel and you'll be</v>

3440
02:18:29.951 --> 02:18:30.141
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3441
02:18:30.141 --> 02:18:31.030
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a black belt.</v>

3442
02:18:31.031 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 2>This guy's kicking my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it rolled with the worst I've</v>

3443
02:18:33.581 --> 02:18:34.570
<v Speaker 2>ever had in my life.</v>

3444
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So please don't mistake.</v>

3445
02:18:36.761 --> 02:18:38.810
<v Speaker 2>This was lucas late jay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3446
02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:42.100
<v Speaker 2>he was not flow like I've rolled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>marcelo garcia.</v>

3447
02:18:42.101 --> 02:18:44.020
<v Speaker 2>We've had boucher come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And gabriel vela cyborg,</v>

3448
02:18:44.021 --> 02:18:47.320
<v Speaker 2>like all these different cities guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lucas late,</v>

3449
02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just like if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger guy and you go and you roll with</v>

3450
02:18:49.841 --> 02:18:51.390
<v Speaker 2>them and he actually accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

3451
02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:53.060
<v Speaker 2>he did a collar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pole was key.</v>

3452
02:18:53.061 --> 02:18:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It was so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put my hand out to post and I popped</v>

3453
02:18:56.291 --> 02:18:57.580
<v Speaker 2>my shoulder out of the socket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3454
02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:00.970
<v Speaker 2>the first 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then he gets my back and I was</v>

3455
02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can see.</v>

3456
02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:03.940
<v Speaker 2>And the tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I still have it,</v>

3457
02:19:03.941 --> 02:19:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this to turn your shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in and it was so fast.</v>

3458
02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

3459
02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So that's what that's like because my</v>
<v Speaker 2>slo was so nice where they can get more,</v>

3460
02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.640
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more pressure,</v>

3461
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:17.590
<v Speaker 2>more pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you always,</v>

3462
02:19:17.591 --> 02:19:18.880
<v Speaker 2>you never want to hurt the black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3463
02:19:18.890 --> 02:19:19.360
<v Speaker 2>RIght.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3464
02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:20.350
<v Speaker 2>there's no chance you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3465
02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:21.310
<v Speaker 2>you could hurt them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3466
02:19:21.450 --> 02:19:23.400
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go agro on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3467
02:19:23.590 --> 02:19:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Because these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to take their head off,</v>

3468
02:19:25.330 --> 02:19:26.650
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't want to be that,</v>

3469
02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:28.280
<v Speaker 2>but late shay was just super</v>

3470
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.260
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But pop my shoulder on 12 seconds,</v>

3471
02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:33.440
<v Speaker 1>just the guys that are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They roll hard or they don't roll it</v>

3472
02:19:33.441 --> 02:19:34.274
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3473
02:19:34.290 --> 02:19:35.030
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3474
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was hard.</v>

3475
02:19:35.991 --> 02:19:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it was so swift from timer went</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and it was a basic.</v>

3476
02:19:40.340 --> 02:19:43.630
<v Speaker 1>He was sitting and just grab the collar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just just like,</v>

3477
02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:44.610
<v Speaker 1>just pull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3478
02:19:44.610 --> 02:19:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're kind of expecting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

3479
02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Toronto will make dragon will know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

3480
02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Oldschool collar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yankee and I just posted and filter.</v>

3481
02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Did you find anything on Bruce Lee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started looking it up.</v>

3482
02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of like forum posts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>

3483
02:19:57.651 --> 02:20:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I found one blog post that has like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>annotated thing and it sort sorta shows</v>

3484
02:20:02.331 --> 02:20:04.610
<v Speaker 1>a quote from it and then says where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote was from.</v>

3485
02:20:04.770 --> 02:20:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the best.</v>

3486
02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:10.610
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I hope I'm not wrong because this</v>

3487
02:20:10.611 --> 02:20:13.880
<v Speaker 1>is what somebody who I know and respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well told me.</v>

3488
02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and then I remember reading it</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

3489
02:20:15.890 --> 02:20:18.080
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take anything away from how I</v>

3490
02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:21.410
<v Speaker 1>feel about Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's very important in the</v>

3491
02:20:21.411 --> 02:20:23.780
<v Speaker 1>history of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one of the most important figures</v>

3492
02:20:23.781 --> 02:20:26.360
<v Speaker 1>ever outside of hoists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gracie and leo gracie.</v>

3493
02:20:26.390 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It's those things where the truth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and you wonder why people feel</v>

3494
02:20:28.890 --> 02:20:30.760
<v Speaker 1>like the truth isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3495
02:20:31.130 --> 02:20:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you don'T need to embellish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the truth was worship.</v>

3496
02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:34.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3497
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a slightly racist caricature of</v>

3498
02:20:36.291 --> 02:20:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you as Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight.</v>

3499
02:20:37.701 --> 02:20:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I can see how people are my tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She put tape on your eyes.</v>

3500
02:20:40.521 --> 02:20:41.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did do that one.</v>

3501
02:20:41.601 --> 02:20:44.470
<v Speaker 1>So because we did him doing the mickey</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooney breakfast at tiffany's and so</v>

3502
02:20:44.471 --> 02:20:45.500
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is still racist.</v>

3503
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:47.390
<v Speaker 1>He's literally a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make your breakfast at tiffaNy's.</v>

3504
02:20:47.391 --> 02:20:48.370
<v Speaker 1>What do you think would make your own?</v>

3505
02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:49.960
<v Speaker 1>He's a white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

3506
02:20:49.961 --> 02:20:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would have seen.</v>

3507
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious.</v>

3508
02:20:53.091 --> 02:20:53.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3509
02:20:53.781 --> 02:20:55.610
<v Speaker 1>how about when they used to have the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>played charlie chan.</v>

3510
02:20:55.650 --> 02:20:57.500
<v Speaker 1>He was in the widest motherfucker that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>

3511
02:20:58.070 --> 02:21:02.760
<v Speaker 1>He's playing like a six foot three white</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy playing a chinese detective and like</v>

3512
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:05.570
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let chinese people act</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

3513
02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were going to make a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>

3514
02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:10.340
<v Speaker 1>like the star of a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to be a bike guy,</v>

3515
02:21:10.341 --> 02:21:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but we send the new spiderman though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3516
02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:14.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of wonder if that's something</v>

3517
02:21:14.901 --> 02:21:17.100
<v Speaker 1>we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say.</v>

3518
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Can you ask what can we address?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elephant in the room was pretty</v>

3519
02:21:20.211 --> 02:21:22.520
<v Speaker 1>clear that often asians are not the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>actors.</v>

3520
02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:26.270
<v Speaker 1>You son of a bitch come on son of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>put dean cain in there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love doing as well as your interviews.</v>

3583
02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:47.070
<v Speaker 1>No one talks about his article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks about his brother's murder and</v>

02:23:47.071 --> 02:23:49.010
<v Speaker 1>his brain tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh see there you go.</v>

02:24:00.451 --> 02:24:02.700
<v Speaker 1>theories are all coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What conspiracy theories?</v>

3589
02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was somewhere and it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I couldn't tell you.</v>

3592
02:24:06.691 --> 02:24:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to speak out of turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have been surprised because I knew</v>

3593
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:11.460
<v Speaker 1>it was far left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like kind of like big brother</v>

3594
02:24:11.461 --> 02:24:11.971
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3595
02:24:11.971 --> 02:24:13.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird for You to think big</v>

<v Speaker 1>brother's watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but want a bigger,</v>

3597

3598
02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:17.400
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3599
02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem,</v>

3600
02:24:18.331 --> 02:24:20.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think nine slash 11 truther oh,</v>

3601
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:23.250
<v Speaker 1>is that one of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3602
02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:25.620
<v Speaker 1>mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marky mark.</v>

3603
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:30.210
<v Speaker 1>AnoTher one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you look at it after the fact</v>

3604
02:24:30.211 --> 02:24:31.950
<v Speaker 1>and you go look at all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>

3605
02:24:31.951 --> 02:24:32.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3606
02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:34.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just chaos.</v>

3607
02:24:34.830 --> 02:24:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And two guys flew planes into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or a bunch of guys flew planes into</v>

3608
02:24:37.501 --> 02:24:38.640
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3609
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:41.640
<v Speaker 1>the problem is I think they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing what we were talking about.</v>

3610
02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:42.930
<v Speaker 1>RighT?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is real.</v>

3611
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:45.360
<v Speaker 1>No one wanted to cover the entire issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to.</v>

3612
02:24:45.390 --> 02:24:48.090
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to talk about the puberty</v>
<v Speaker 1>blockers to kids and this being</v>

3613
02:24:48.091 --> 02:24:49.770
<v Speaker 1>considered hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

3614
02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:51.690
<v Speaker 1>There is a media coverup of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

3615
02:24:51.691 --> 02:24:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Certainly I would say sort of a cover up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a monopoly on informational</v>

3616
02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:56.730
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3617
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:58.770
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real people.</v>

3618
02:24:58.771 --> 02:25:00.600
<v Speaker 1>When you find that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of opens your eyes.</v>

3619
02:25:00.601 --> 02:25:00.991
<v Speaker 1>You're goIng,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3620
02:25:00.991 --> 02:25:04.710
<v Speaker 1>what else don't I know so people take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then try and capitalize on it</v>

3621
02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:08.850
<v Speaker 1>with lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you didn't know jay z's in the</v>

3622
02:25:08.851 --> 02:25:12.120
<v Speaker 1>illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine slash 11 was an inside job and it</v>

3623
02:25:12.121 --> 02:25:15.900
<v Speaker 1>just goes on because there's some truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and you put the problem is you</v>

3624
02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:17.720
<v Speaker 1>want to get people searching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does it.</v>

3625
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Truth has to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your post office orchestrated the</v>

3626
02:25:20.251 --> 02:25:23.500
<v Speaker 1>biggest terror attack on american soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's unquestionably.</v>

3627
02:25:23.501 --> 02:25:24.340
<v Speaker 1>There were some</v>

3628
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:30.330
<v Speaker 2>taking advantage of the events in order</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pass policy that wasn't possible</v>

3629
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:34.810
<v Speaker 2>before and the patriot act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the patriot act was drafted long before</v>

3630
02:25:34.811 --> 02:25:37.580
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 and they pushed it through</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's.</v>

3631
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:41.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot that I think you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>attribute to them taking advantage of</v>

3632
02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.160
<v Speaker 2>this tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that they orchestrated it,</v>

3633
02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:46.240
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this just.</v>

3634
02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

3635
02:25:48.450 --> 02:25:50.770
<v Speaker 2>The burden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the burden of proof is on them to say</v>

3636
02:25:50.771 --> 02:25:53.920
<v Speaker 2>that when they did see loose change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3637
02:25:53.921 --> 02:25:57.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I find that crazy about that is</v>

3638
02:25:57.881 --> 02:25:58.570
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3639
02:25:58.570 --> 02:26:01.030
<v Speaker 2>this crazy corrupt government than nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 commission report.</v>

3640
02:26:01.031 --> 02:26:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George bush,</v>

3641
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:03.130
<v Speaker 2>like a mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rough flow.</v>

3642
02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:05.170
<v Speaker 2>But theN you look at the drone strikes</v>
<v Speaker 2>with baraka was like,</v>

3643
02:26:05.470 --> 02:26:06.670
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's code?</v>

3644
02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:09.250
<v Speaker 2>All of thIs goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one that's consistent.</v>

3645
02:26:09.251 --> 02:26:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3646
02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate George Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm probably in the minority</v>

3647
02:26:11.531 --> 02:26:12.820
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was a great president.</v>

3648
02:26:12.821 --> 02:26:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's as bad as a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3649
02:26:14.231 --> 02:26:15.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green day thinks he was.</v>

3650
02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was a great president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is I don't want George</v>

3651
02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Bush to have unfettered power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor barack obama nor Donald Trump.</v>

3652
02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:25.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not selective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust any of them.</v>

3653
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike baker used to be in the cia,</v>

3654
02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:32.300
<v Speaker 2>told me that those drone strikes are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are designed or rather,</v>

3655
02:26:32.301 --> 02:26:34.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictated by lawyers.</v>

3656
02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:35.481
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3657
02:26:35.481 --> 02:26:38.290
<v Speaker 2>what gets passed and what gets passed</v>
<v Speaker 2>through its lawyers.</v>

3658
02:26:38.291 --> 02:26:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Lawyers make the final decision and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
