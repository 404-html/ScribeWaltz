00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.601
Did you ever have an experience?

2
00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:09.120
Podcast starts the same way every fucking time and that shit's boring.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.710
I'm tired of doing it this way.
Brian came some music.
Want me to trip you out?

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.660
Music?
Just a little bit of music.
Just a little piano.
Just little something

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.180

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.270
I don't know.
People ask me what is the deal with,

10
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.040
why does desk squad associated with a cat?

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.230
I'll tell you why because I've got a crazy fucking employee.

12
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.210
I don't know what's wrong with this kid.
He's got issues.

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.290
He tries cats with Charlie Chaplin mustaches on the,
load it up with dynamite.

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.780
Look at this.
That's the logo.
What does that mean?

15
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.020
That doesn't mean anything but it means something and the new one is even

16
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:54.990
freakier.
All of them are available at desk squad,

Yeah,
I'm a grown man.

26
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.130
I'm a grown man and I would tee shirt company with mushrooms and monkeys.
Yeah.

27
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.340
All right.
Where am my higher prime shirt the other day?
Yes he did.

28
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.180
Nothing's wrong with monkeys and nothing's wrong with monkeys on mushrooms are

29
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.910
cats.
It's um,
I'm a silly person folks.
All right.

30
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.070
We are also brought to you by on at.com,
makers of Alpha brain,
shroom tech,

31
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090
shroom tech,
immune trim,
tech sport,
um,

32
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.270
all the different nootropics that we carry.
Uh,
if you don't know an entropic is,

33
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:56.910
it's essentially vitamins that enhance your brain function.

34
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.360
It's all things that have been shown in various studies to give you some sort of

35
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.170
a cognitive boost.

36
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.150
And it's not just nothing like rain Manish,
and it's nothing like that.

37
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:11.730
Bradley Cooper movie,
which is calming for sure.

38
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.830
They're going to figure that out eventually they're going to come up with a
pill.

39
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.270
It's going to make you a super genius,

40
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.650
but for now it will enhance the way your brain works.
It's all fascinating stuff.

41
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.660
Uh,
different people's bodies react different ways.

42
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:22.590
No one's trying to rip you off.

43
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:27.060
So we have a 100% money back guarantee on the first order of 30 pills.

44
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.400
You don't have to return the product to just say,
look,
goes,

45
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.460
shit didn't do anything for me.
And then we give you your money back.

46
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.800
Nobody's trying to rip you off.
We're just trying to sell you the best shit.

47
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.840
And it's all stuff that I used way before I had anything to do with on it and we

48
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.210
continue that same thought process into our line of fitness equipment,

49
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.690
so the kettle bells that we sell,
they're all Troy kettlebells.

50
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.530
They are the best kettle bells you can get.
They're perfect.

51
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.110
They will last your lifetime.
They are not cheap.

52
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.260
We were essentially sending cannon balls through the fucking mail.

53
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.000
Giant cannon balls with handles on them,

54
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.830
but you buy these things and you literally never need to go to a gym again.

55
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.120
You need a chin up bar and some kettlebells and you're good and then get some

56
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.110
battle ropes for your conditioning.

57
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.100
All of these things are available at [inaudible] Dot Com o.N ,N ,
I t.

58
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.540
If you use a code name Rogan,

59
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:17.620
you will save 10% off any and all supplements that that does not work with the

60
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.890
fitness equipment because we say that shit as cheap as humanly possible.

61
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.850
All right,
Franks Amber Lyon is here and shit's about to get crazy.

62
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.710
<v 1>Joe Rogan experience.</v>

63
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.530
<v 2>Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast,
my night all day.</v>

64
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.830
<v 0>Amber Lyon.
First of all,
welcome to the podcast.</v>

65
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:44.730
Thank you very much for coming on.
You're one of our first serious guests.

66
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.600
You're like a legit human that was working for CNN.
Like we have credentials now.

67
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:49.730
Dude,
do you feel this?
Brian,

68
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.290
do you feel a change to come back and get a wiki someday?

69
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.310
You can get a Wikipedia.
I think this week I think we're going to make it happen.

70
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.720
But uh,
thank you very much for coming on the show.

71
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.720
I became aware of you because of the Internet and I became aware of you

72
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:05.040
specifically because of your interview with my crazy friend Alex Jones.

73
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.940
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Alex.
I love Alex Jones.
Alex was great.
He had me on to talk about,</v>

74
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.850
I mean this is a topic I'm discussing that is,

75
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.410
is difficult to get people to have you on to talk about it because they not Alex

76
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.060
though.
No,
not Alex at all.

77
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.450
<v 2>That's fine.
We found more corruption.</v>

78
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.540
I can't believe this Saturday if at all.

79
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.050
<v 3>You have to love his passion.
He's a good friend of mine.
I love him.
Yeah,</v>

80
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:32.050
he is so passionate.
And when you follow your passion,

81
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:34.480
successful following that's happened with,
with Alex.

82
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.200
<v 0>He's so passionate that people think it's fake.
They think that the,
like,</v>

83
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.790
he's like some sort of a CIA plant and he's like,
you know,
living this lie of,

84
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.030
you know,
it's like the idea of it

85
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.730
<v 1>putting out,
I almost wish it was fake.
That because of like,</v>

86
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:49.890
I feel I always tell them every time I hang out with them,
like,

87
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.520
you sure you stress me out or just stress.
Like,
like I feel bad for him.

88
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:56.940
I can't calm down.
He's always,
yeah,
he's intense when he's eaten hot dogs.

89
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.950
I need another old fucking hot dogs now.
Where's she going with those hot dogs?

90
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.850
Yeah,

91
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.740
<v 0>he was,
uh,
we came with us to the UFC.
That's a great time with that guy.</v>

92
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.380
He was fun.

93
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.890
<v 3>Dude,
I have to tell you,
after interviewing with him for an hour,
he,
he's genuine,</v>

94
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.580
genuinely cares about the direction this country is going in and he's willing to

95
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:17.560
put his neck out on the line.
Yeah.
Just like you,
you do Joe.
And,
uh,
and,

96
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.040
and that's admirable because you're,

97
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.890
you're seeing a lot of people just kind of shut up right now.
Yeah.

98
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:25.790
It takes the real heroes to really come forward and talk about everything that's

99
00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:29.250
going on or crazy.
Be Fun.
Tell me,

100
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.320
are you freaking out of your mind?
Are you nuts

101
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.250
<v 0>for folks who don't know the story?</v>

102
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.030
The story that I got from the Alex Jones show is,

103
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.720
and this is a subject that I had been really curious about why this wasn't

104
00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:45.230
receiving any mainstream coverage.
When we would see all this coverage,

105
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.280
what was going on in Syria and all this coverage is going on in Egypt and in

106
00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:52.940
Libya.
But no,
we never saw anything on Bahrain.
And,
uh,

107
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:57.941
I saw some horrific videos that I found online of just the military

108
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.300
<v 4>assassinating descent or,
uh,</v>

109
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.400
assassinating a different people that were protesting.
And you,

110
00:06:03.401 --> 00:06:06.020
you look at the video and you're like,
how is this not huge?

111
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:08.930
How is this not all over the news every day?
How was,

112
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.530
how were we not imposing sanctions on this country?
How are we not,
you know,

113
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.660
speaking out against this horrific show of just,

114
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.580
it was just horrifying to watch.

115
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.860
But it was weird how silent the mainstream news was about it.

116
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.540
It was like there was nothing,
and you ran into this.

117
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.610
<v 3>Oh yeah.
I didn't an only run into it.
I was knocked over by it and run over.
Huh?</v>

118
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.520
<v 4>They just hire you thinking you're a beautiful woman.</v>

119
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:38.340
You just want to be like a model who's going to read the news and you're just

120
00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:39.270
going to shut the fuck up.

121
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.360
<v 3>I think so.</v>

122
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.960
And unfortunately I'm Greek and I'm a Scorpio and turned.

123
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.870
Yeah,
that's not good.
That's dangerous.
Super Dangerous.
I don't think they,

124
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:53.320
I really don't think that they knew I wasn't just a talking head puppet when I

125
00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:57.130
was hired.
I was actually hired by someone who ended up leaving the network.
Um,

126
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.320
and uh,
and so,
so I think they were surprised.
Uh,
I fucked up.

127
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.610
They didn't see it coming.

128
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.900
I think in 10 years of people go back in and evaluate the situation though,

129
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.850
<v 4>they thought you were going to be a female Ryan Seacrest and just run with this.</v>

130
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.820
Well there's a weird trend,
especially in Fox News,

131
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.010
these gorgeous women reading the news.

132
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.550
I'm like that is such a sneaky trick because especially if you're a guy who

133
00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:23.580
can't get laid,
like having a beautiful woman talk about anything.

134
00:07:23.581 --> 00:07:26.420
So I just want to hear her talk.
I just want to just tell him.

135
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.300
He would tell him what's going on.

136
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.500
And so like what better way to program people for your right wing agenda then

137
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:33.520
have like the hottest chicks in a planet.
Of course.

138
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.410
Tell you what's wrong with the left and then also have them say weapons of mass

139
00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:39.350
destruction.
Hello.

140
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.380
<v 3>Damn.
And it worked.
You know,</v>

141
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:47.570
obviously we ended up in Iraq and Afghanistan and they're continuing to bleed at

142
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.470
hot chips.

143
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.540
<v 4>Propaganda is strong for sure.
Well tell us your experience cause you,</v>

144
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.090
you know better than anyone.
You were working on CNN.

145
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.120
I saw some of the other stuff that you did.
That was amazing though.

146
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:03.320
Especially the thing,
the piece on the child prostitutes in Las Vegas.

147
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.400
It was hard.
I felt for that mom.

148
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.790
It was so horrible seeing that mom holding one baby,

149
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.380
talking about her other baby who's now 13 and is just running around as a

150
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:17.810
prostitute.
It was insane.
It was insane to watch.

151
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.530
So I know you did serious work for them and that's like,

152
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.770
so that was some really deep shit and it was a long piece.

153
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.320
What is it like to,

154
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:32.350
to go from that to just running into this wall and this one particular subject

155
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.770
that set you off this ball issue.
Like what was that like?

156
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.890
<v 3>It was,
well,
for me it was really disturbing.
Um,
I was,
I,
it was</v>

157
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.590
horrific because I knew these people in buffering were being tortured and abused

158
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.600
and um,
and systematically killed and doctors can be killing doctors

159
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.830
<v 4>for taking care of people who protested,
who shot</v>

160
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.730
<v 5>for d for treating these people.
They got tortured.
Yeah,
they got tortured.</v>

161
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.490
Some of them are still in jail.
These are genuinely good people.

162
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:06.060
A ambulance drivers were beat journalists.
One was arrested,

163
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.740
his body showed up a couple of days later,

164
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:10.230
just fill it full of of torture marks and,

165
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.830
and what really bothered me is because I grew up in the Midwest and I know how

166
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.850
the American people get taken advantage of and our tax dollars are going to this

167
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:22.020
Bob Rain regime to support them and they're the ones doing this to their people.

168
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.070
How much money do we send to Bahrain?
Every year we send a,

169
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.720
I don't know the exact amount of money,

170
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:30.630
but I know that we send more than a billion dollars worth of weapons.

171
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:32.700
We've given them more than a billion dollars worth of a weapons.

172
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.870
They're using some of these weapons,

173
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:37.470
some of this tear gas that they're using to systematically guests or people

174
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.040
which they are doing.
They're taking weapons that they're allowed to use,

175
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:44.820
which is tear gas in bird shot,
and instead of using those for crowd control,

176
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:48.450
they're using those to systematically kill their people and gas them.

177
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:51.660
And this is being made in Pennsylvania?
Tear gas.
Yeah.

178
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.510
They're there because it's you and approve southern,

179
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.660
literally dropping tear gas on these villages every single day,

180
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:59.220
all day long and night.
And,

181
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.090
and Physicians for Human Rights and Nobel Peace Prize winning organization has

182
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:05.910
been trying to raise hell about this because it's,

183
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:09.300
it's tearing up these people's lungs.
People who are asthmatic are dying,

184
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.530
elderly are dying,

185
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:13.620
they're suffocating in their homes and they're misusing this gas.

186
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.020
And it's a very systematic way that they're doing it.

187
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:18.450
People are having miscarriages,
women,
um,

188
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.840
some of these doctors are now connecting it to the tear gas.
Uh,
so,

189
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.960
so this is something that needs to be talked about,
uh,
urgently,

190
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.530
because these people as I speak right now,
they're,
they're being guests.

191
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.310
How many people have died from this so far?
So far?

192
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.310
They don't know it because they can't 100%,
uh,
you know,

193
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:36.810
say you were gassed in a couple of days later,

194
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:38.790
you die because you have a respiratory issues.

195
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:41.430
You can't 100% connected to the gas,

196
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.870
but so far more than a couple dozen people have been killed and they just

197
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:49.730
continually do this.
So just continually all day long.
Yeah.
And,

198
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.060
and I think it's a way,
it's a way that they're trying to suppress the protests.

199
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:56.210
Also a way that they're trying to,
uh,

200
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.160
to silence the opposition and get people in these,

201
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.650
in these neighborhoods to convince the youth to quit protesting because they

202
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.000
keep getting gassed.
His as a result of it.
What is our business there?

203
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.770
What is our business with Paul rand that we support them?
Well,

204
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:13.350
this means everything to us right now.
And a lot of people will say,
okay,

205
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:15.960
Bahrain is so far away.
What does it matter to me?

206
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:18.870
I always explain this to my sister because she's in that mindset.

207
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:21.630
She doesn't really know about the politics in the region.
Well,
we,

208
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:24.930
we keep hearing more and more about Iran and a potential war with Iran.

209
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:29.710
So we need,
we have a navy base in Bahrain in Bahrain is right across a,

210
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.340
there's a body of water separating bufferin and Iran.

211
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.100
So we need that naval base if we're going to go in and eventually attack you.

212
00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:41.010
Ron.
It's very strategic for the u s that's why we have buffering is an ally.
Um,

213
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.660
and so this situation is a situation where the u s is giving Bob Green money and

214
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:49.470
keeping our base there and allowing these atrocities to happen because of a

215
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:54.010
potential war with Iran.
So,
so your tax dollars are going directly to

216
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.300
<v 3>this regime.
Not only that,</v>

217
00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.370
covering up the story further gets us into some,
uh,
potential conflict,

218
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.850
um,
with Iran because you're not knowing.

219
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.340
We're demonizing people who we want to attack.
And then we're,

220
00:12:07.341 --> 00:12:09.220
we're praising people who we want to keep is our,

221
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.940
is our allies who we really should probably should be attacking.
Exactly.
If,

222
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:13.774
if people knew

223
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.890
<v 4>I wanted to stop atrocities in the world,
you wouldn't be looking at Iran.</v>

224
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.990
You'd be looking at fucking bar ranch.

225
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.230
<v 3>Exactly.
You know,
we were detained violently there.
We were thrown on the ground.</v>

226
00:12:22.231 --> 00:12:25.680
We had machine guns pointed at our heads and they tried to erase all of our

227
00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:30.570
video.
Uh,
and this was about 10 a 10 minutes drive from the naval base worth.

228
00:12:30.571 --> 00:12:34.590
15,000 Americans are living.
And,
um,
you know,

229
00:12:34.591 --> 00:12:37.750
and they tried to,
uh,
to bury the story.
But,

230
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.730
but fortunately I was with another female producer.
We were able to hide these,

231
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.990
these media discs actually in our,
in our bras during the a detainment.

232
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.320
Yeah.
Um,
now that I look back on it,
it's kind of funny,

233
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.430
but at the time we were very worried about that.

234
00:12:52.431 --> 00:12:55.660
The discs falling out is you're laying on the ground and you have a gun pointed

235
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:57.790
at your head and racing your video.

236
00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:01.360
You don't want that just to drop out on the floor.
What do you say to them?
Oops,

237
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:05.820
I don't know where that came from.
My tits actually.
Dot.

238
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.970
Uh,
so it was a,
uh,

239
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:14.170
it was a situation that was just pretty eyeopening.
That's intense.

240
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:17.050
And you tried to go back.
Oh,
I've,
I've tried many times.

241
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:19.540
They won't let me back into that.
Would you go back after that?

242
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.620
Because you find a connection to this story as a journalist when you know

243
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:28.150
something's happening.
Um,
I,
he,
you're crazy.
In other words,

244
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.670
the people are really good people.
When you meet them,
you,
you just remember them.

245
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.230
You,
you hold,
uh,
a big place in your heart for them and,
and for,

246
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.310
um,
for their survival and,
and you feel duty to tell their story

247
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.740
<v 4>in about the Middle East that makes these crazy dictators.</v>

248
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.250
I mean that's really the last place in the world were dudes are still rocking
it.

249
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:54.170
Old School like that where there's like a king running a whole country.

250
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.610
There's only the Middle East.

251
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.120
And it's really fascinating when you look at human history and you find out that

252
00:13:59.121 --> 00:14:00.920
that's where the original civilization,

253
00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:05.570
the oldest known civilization as soon mirror,
that's where Iraq is.
So like,

254
00:14:05.571 --> 00:14:08.570
so those people that are,
they're essentially the townies of the world.

255
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.960
It's like people in the Middle East that are like these dictators.

256
00:14:11.961 --> 00:14:15.230
I mean they really are running things the way they did thousands of years ago.

257
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:18.770
They have never had to evolve.
They've never had to move on.

258
00:14:18.771 --> 00:14:20.410
Like the rest of the world has its,

259
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.140
I don't think we can even wrap our heads around the idea of kings in this

260
00:14:24.141 --> 00:14:25.610
country.
It's like,
it seems,

261
00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:29.630
even though as our police state clamps down on our right start slipping away

262
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.510
every day with the more of these insane bills that pass,

263
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.680
I still don't think we understand what it would be like to be under the rule of

264
00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:41.681
Saddam Hussein and having his Uday and whatever his other sons name those crazy

265
00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:45.320
evil psychopaths sons are running around torturing and killing people.

266
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.760
I don't think we can even understand that.

267
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.770
I think that's almost outside of our range.

268
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.810
So as long as something like this,
Bahrain isn't reported on,

269
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:56.600
it's not talked about in the news.
We don't have to focus on it.
We don't,

270
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.780
we don't really,
it doesn't,
it doesn't register with us

271
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.350
<v 3>and,
and we're keeping them in power.
We're keeping these dictators in power.</v>

272
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:06.530
So that's another thing that I don't think,
um,
our,

273
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.550
our current government wants us to discuss because they don't want the people to

274
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:12.560
be outraged and make us leave.

275
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.980
And they don't want this protest to succeed because if the protest succeed,

276
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.230
these protesters are going to kick the u s out.

277
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.950
I mean the u s has a aided this regime.
And,

278
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.920
and oppressing them for decades and,
and so,

279
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:31.310
so that's another reason the US doesn't want this reported on in the mainstream

280
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:32.870
news.
Wow.

281
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.480
<v 4>It's so crazy because I guess the idea is by not have taking military action</v>

282
00:15:37.481 --> 00:15:39.730
against someone like that,
you're,
you know,

283
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.780
what are you just turning a blind eye to it or what do you,
I mean,
how do you,

284
00:15:43.781 --> 00:15:47.590
how do you continue to continue to send them weapons?

285
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.690
How's that possible?
It seems,
it just seems unconscionable.
It seems like at a,

286
00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:57.640
at a certain point in time,
someone has to cross some line somewhere and just go,

287
00:15:57.641 --> 00:15:59.500
what,
what are,
what exactly are we doing?

288
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.490
Like is it really that important to go into Iran that were allowing this country

289
00:16:03.491 --> 00:16:06.430
to run like this?
Like what,
what,
why are we supporting this?

290
00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:10.000
Like what are we doing as a country?
Are we completely about dollar bills now?

291
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.140
Is it just about controlling oil ports and,
and,
and,
and pathways?
I mean,

292
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:18.490
that's really what the Iran thing is about,
right?
It's about controlling the,

293
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:22.390
about being able to get oil out of a,
what does that,
that,
that shipping route.

294
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.300
Yes,
there.

295
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.380
<v 3>And um,
and it's about,
it's about exactly.
And it's not,</v>

296
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:29.840
don't let people lie to you and tell you it's about,

297
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.110
they're worried about human rights abuses in any Ron because look what we're

298
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:35.390
doing in buffering in order to potentially attack you,

299
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:40.391
run where we're helping them oppress hundreds of thousands of people on a daily

300
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:44.180
basis.
So,
so if we really cared about human rights,
we wouldn't,

301
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.480
we would have left buffering long time ago.
We wouldn't be sending them weapons.

302
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.470
We would be in Mexico when,
right,
exactly.
And we're being in a,

303
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.420
and once again,
Joe,

304
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:58.070
this goes back to the American public being lied to systematically by the media.

305
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:01.280
And,
and it's a real shame.
I think so many people say,
oh,

306
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:05.840
well the Americans are stupid and they don't know what's going on.
And no,
it's,

307
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:09.880
Americans are being fed lies constantly,
all day long and,

308
00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:12.860
and it really needs to stop.
Um,
it's,
it's a shame.

309
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:17.200
<v 4>Now you were there,
you're inside,
you're on CNN now.</v>

310
00:17:17.201 --> 00:17:21.070
What was it that you wanted to report on that you couldn't,
what was the,

311
00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:22.540
the exact censorship,
what did,

312
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.880
did they tell you what you could or couldn't say about it?

313
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.440
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
what happened was once I got back from buffering,
um,</v>

314
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.870
they were surprised when obviously the Bahrain regime,

315
00:17:30.871 --> 00:17:32.550
when we started airing this video,

316
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.200
cause we were able to sneak out with the video.

317
00:17:34.201 --> 00:17:36.750
They thought that they had erased over a video.
Uh,

318
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.750
and so we started hearing these stories and at first it was great.

319
00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:44.430
CNN was letting us air all of these.
Um,
and that was for about a week or so.

320
00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:45.780
It was very easy to get covered on.

321
00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:49.710
But then Barbary and started calling and complaining and their companies,

322
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:50.460
they pay

323
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.880
<v 5>US citizens and US PR companies to do PR for them.
Uh,</v>

324
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:58.350
the people can't afford that,
but of course the regime can.
And um,
and then,
uh,

325
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:02.760
eventually three months later we finished our documentary and we found out that

326
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:07.170
it wasn't going to be airing on CNN international.
It aired once on CNN,
us,

327
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.400
but never on CNN international to the target audience,
which is,

328
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:15.930
is the most,
uh,
the most viewed English news station in the region.

329
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.310
And so,
uh,

330
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.150
we need these people needed to see this documentary and it was an airing.
And,

331
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.750
and I've had documentaries I've done at CNN,
the dinner,
Aaron,
CNN international,

332
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:27.270
but this entire documentary was shot overseas.

333
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.430
And what really got me was my bosses directly above me or it were dumbfounded.

334
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.280
We would have phone calls and emails and people said,

335
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.280
I don't know why this is an airing.
I don't know what's going on.
Um,

336
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.610
my producers were very,
very upset.
I mean,

337
00:18:41.611 --> 00:18:43.590
they had risks are lives to tell this story.

338
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.380
Our sources had risked their lives to Telsia and their story.
Uh,

339
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.170
one guys who worked for Doctors Without Borders has house was burnt down after

340
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:56.170
he talked with us.
And,
um,
and yeah,
I mean,
and our,

341
00:18:56.171 --> 00:18:59.220
our main source and the documentary,
he's in prison right now.

342
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:02.020
His mom just died yesterday and he didn't even get to say goodbye to her.
Real,

343
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.710
real job.
He's in prison for the next three years.

344
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.730
And he's a peace activist who has a picture of Gandhi on his cell phone.
Um,

345
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.500
and so all of these sources that helped us film this documentary or punished and

346
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.300
harassed for helping CNN.

347
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.680
And so we still couldn't believe why they had an air that on CNN international.

348
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.400
And so I kept getting people writing me and calling me and telling me,

349
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.910
you need to look into this.
There's something going on here.
Uh,
they're,
it's a,

350
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:31.020
it's a much bigger story and seeing as how I don't have a family and you know,

351
00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:36.021
I'm not tied down to a retirement plan or I really could give a crap about,

352
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:37.800
about the money.
Um,

353
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.770
I started looking into it and realizing the bub rain's actually a paying

354
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:45.410
customer at CNN.
They are literally paying the network for programming,

355
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.130
uh,
journalistically.

356
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.460
I don't know if a lot of people out there listening know about journalistic

357
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.430
ethics,
but we're supposed to be watchdogs on government.

358
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.140
We are not supposed to accept money from them.
Not only accepting money.
Okay,

359
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:00.870
that's different.
If you accept money and you air a commercial,

360
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.380
but they're actually airing our long programs on CNN,

361
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.730
paid for by the buffering regime,
not only Bob rain,
we're talking Georgia,

362
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:11.790
Kazakhstan and other,
uh,
other regimes.

363
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.960
And this has been going on for decades and it bothers me cause people are being

364
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:16.794
lied to.

365
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.470
<v 4>So it's just paid propaganda.
Yeah.
They're,</v>

366
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.970
they're programming unit for propaganda.
So instead of being the news,

367
00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:27.971
they're there select pieces of information that these governments want Americans

368
00:20:28.401 --> 00:20:32.600
and whoever watches CNN to see.
So they pay them for it.
Yeah,
they pay on illegal.

369
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.470
<v 5>Well,
journalistically it's,
it's,
um,
I would,
if there were a journalist's police,</v>

370
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.220
I would arrest them.
Uh,
but it,
it is legal,

371
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:46.110
but is it right?
Uh,
because when the air,
some of these programs,
Joe,

372
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:50.440
they don't let the viewers know that that's paid for by the government.

373
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:50.921
<v 4>Right.</v>

374
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:54.790
When you watch like one of those wacky fake talk shows where they're selling a

375
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:58.120
blender,
they have to tell you this is a paid infomercial.

376
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.140
They have to tell you when this,
this blender guys in his talk show showing,

377
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:06.070
you know how you make cucumbers slice,
releasing and stuff.
They have to tell you,

378
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.110
why don't they have to tell you that on CNN?

379
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:10.450
That seems way more important than the fucking blender.

380
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.040
<v 5>Well exactly because it's shaping our foreign policy.</v>

381
00:21:13.041 --> 00:21:16.610
I mean they're feeding the American public this propaganda so that they think

382
00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:18.710
everything's rosy and happy.

383
00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:23.711
And in Bahrain when really the situation there is is horrific.

384
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.330
And if you look at one of these programs,
you can youtube it.

385
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.410
It's called I list Bob Rain.
They have their host to Richard Quest.

386
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:35.600
They have him live at the race track for a week in Bahrain talking about how

387
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.000
wonderful the country is and how progressive it is.

388
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.860
And he interviews the crown prince and calls him a reformer.
And,

389
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:46.861
and this is the same crown prince who was in power when troops shot and killed

390
00:21:47.271 --> 00:21:48.230
in broad daylight,

391
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:53.240
these tanks to shot out into a crowd of protesters and just killed him in broad

392
00:21:53.241 --> 00:21:55.430
day light.
This is the prince that two years earlier,

393
00:21:55.431 --> 00:21:58.910
CNN was telling the public was great,
was progressive reformer.

394
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.180
And it's not fair to the public.
When you watch these,

395
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.620
the disclosures are so minimal or they're not even there if you go on youtube,

396
00:22:06.621 --> 00:22:08.150
the videos,
you know,
um,

397
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.870
it's not fair to not only seen as journalists to our sources,
but,

398
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.340
but to the people watching because they don't know they're getting propaganda.

399
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.450
<v 4>So this has been going on for decades,
decades.
For decades.</v>

400
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:20.740
We haven't had real news.

401
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:25.520
We've had a mixture of some real news and some bullshit that's paid for by other

402
00:22:25.521 --> 00:22:25.930
countries.

403
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:26.763
<v 5>Yes.</v>

404
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.540
And we wonder why we end up in Iraq and Afghanistan and these conflicts,

405
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.420
you know,
and this hair.
It is,
we're seeing it now.
Yeah.

406
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.490
<v 4>Leaders are striving to meet international expectations for a high profile</v>

407
00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:42.760
football tournament.
Europe,
second largest country.

408
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.390
<v 5>If you look up
the Ukraine,
I mean they're,</v>

409
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.890
they're letting the Ukraine pay look up.
Uh,

410
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:54.850
I list bufferin commercial and you can watch the whole commercial and you'll see

411
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:59.230
not once in the commercial.
That's like progressive,
fabulous new.

412
00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.170
This week we're talking about buffering.
You know,

413
00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:07.100
it never says in the commercial that this is paid for by buffering and,

414
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.210
and so that's not fair to the people.
It's not,

415
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:13.150
it's not fair to view was beyond creepy.
How big is Bahrain?

416
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.070
Bahrain is about the size.
Bahrain is small.
It's about the size of San Francisco.

417
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.090
Population wise,

418
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:24.150
<v 4>you can't say Bahrain.
Bahrain.</v>

419
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.550
Okay.
You know what I mean?
It's like one of those words,

420
00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:28.420
like if you commit to saying it correctly,
every time

421
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.700
<v 5>a,
B,
a,
h,
r a I n and m and also we can,</v>

422
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.490
you can see a video of these protests.
They're insane.

423
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:40.590
You watch them and you just see miles of people protesting and,

424
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.870
and then you really realize this is a true revolution they're trying to have

425
00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:48.620
there,
but it's being oppressed by the United States.
Um,
because you know,

426
00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:51.170
if the people get in power,
they're going to kick the U s out there.

427
00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:54.480
Very upset because the US has,
has kept a regime in power for,

428
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.600
<v 0>so we're helping this creepy fuck by giving them $1 billion worth of weapons use</v>

429
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:59.750
tear gassing people to death.

430
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.090
<v 5>Oh yeah.
Wow.
And,
and not only that,</v>

431
00:24:03.091 --> 00:24:06.370
they're systematically getting it off the,
the news in the u s as,

432
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.100
as what happens to me it was,
it was,

433
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.320
it became nearly impossible to cut through the red tape.

434
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.270
<v 0>Well,
this is really disturbing.</v>

435
00:24:12.271 --> 00:24:15.660
If you had any hope whatsoever that we were going to avoid some sort of conflict

436
00:24:15.661 --> 00:24:19.410
with Iran because it seems like that is just there.
They are dead set on it.

437
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.600
<v 5>That's why another reason I came forward urgently,</v>

438
00:24:22.601 --> 00:24:26.660
because this is about much more than Bahrain and the systematic cover up of

439
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:28.460
what's happening about rain only tells you what's,

440
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.120
what's potentially going to happen in the future and,
and,
and in the near future.

441
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:36.660
And that's,
uh,
an attack on Iran or potentially some people,
if you,

442
00:24:36.661 --> 00:24:40.580
if you go to the far side who have really analyzed this could say this could

443
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:42.320
potentially become a world war three,

444
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.790
<v 0>Jesus Christ and it's all just to control oil,
right?
I mean,</v>

445
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.070
is that what it's about?
I mean,
it's just a control oil and it's just,

446
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.540
this is the way they've always done it.

447
00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:54.010
So they're going to continue to do it this way,

448
00:24:54.011 --> 00:24:57.730
even though now people are paying attention finally for the first time in human

449
00:24:57.731 --> 00:24:58.564
history.

450
00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.171
<v 5>Yeah.
Well,</v>

451
00:24:59.171 --> 00:25:03.210
they're going to tell you if you talk to people who are very pro Israel,
um,
and,

452
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:06.790
and once again,
I don't have an opinion on,
on any of that area.

453
00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.290
I try to cover that objective.
Lee,
I've,

454
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:10.480
I've covered stories in the West Bank and in Israel,

455
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.320
but they're going to tell you that Iran,
uh,

456
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.020
often deny God said he will wipe Israel off the map and they're going to repeat

457
00:25:17.021 --> 00:25:20.360
that over and over because that's there for ward propaganda that they're going

458
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:23.290
to start feeding to you.
And they already have for years.

459
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.200
And actually if you go back to that speech that they're referring to aqua

460
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:29.860
dinners,
I'd never said that it was mistranslated,

461
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.180
but instead they rolled with that in the US.

462
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.080
Media has continued to roll with that watch Erin Burnett show.

463
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.810
<v 0>Yeah,
I've seen the,
uh,
the original,
when they went,
it's translated correctly.</v>

464
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:41.390
It's a totally different meaning.
It wasn't that we were,
but it was,

465
00:25:41.391 --> 00:25:44.720
it wasn't nice,
but it wasn't the same thing.
Exactly.

466
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.600
I think it was in response to if Israel attacked Iran,
you know,

467
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.370
we would wipe them off the map or something along those lines,
wasn't it?

468
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.140
<v 5>I'm saying that he,
they want the regime out of Israel.</v>

469
00:25:56.141 --> 00:25:57.280
They want that government out.

470
00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.990
It was more a rhetoric then than physically like we want to go in and murder you

471
00:26:01.991 --> 00:26:05.770
all and kill you.
It was more w we want you to be,
be kicked out of office.

472
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.400
<v 0>So we sort of have equated it to like Khrushchev banging his heel,
you know,</v>

473
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:14.830
saying we will bury you like that.
That's sort of a thing that's like,
so we've,

474
00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:16.670
we've decided to run with that as the big threat.

475
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.080
<v 5>Yup,
exactly.
And they say it's,
it's,
if Iran gets a nuke,</v>

476
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.390
they're going to send it right in and wipe Israel off the map.

477
00:26:22.391 --> 00:26:23.920
So that's what they're trying to use that for.

478
00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:28.390
And everyone needs to pay attention.
It is,
it is propaganda.
It is forward word.

479
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.000
It's just like weapons of mass destruction.
I see them now.

480
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.010
Now that I've been in inside,

481
00:26:33.011 --> 00:26:36.550
I know how they start feeding propaganda and this is exactly what they're doing

482
00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:38.000
was saying,
well it will be,

483
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.490
Ron's going to wipe Israel off the map so we need to go in and attack and,
and,

484
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:47.670
and I mean this could potentially get us into a conflict with much more

485
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:52.710
permanent and damning implications then than Iraq and Afghanistan ever,

486
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.544
ever wore.

487
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.760
<v 4>Yeah.
It seems like this would be huge.</v>

488
00:26:55.761 --> 00:26:58.760
This would be much bigger if we actually wanted to.
I run,
it's a,

489
00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:03.200
it's another level of civilization above what was going on in Afghanistan and in

490
00:27:03.201 --> 00:27:06.500
Iraq and theirs does no reason for it.
It doesn't make any sense.

491
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.220
There's no way the rest of the world is going to tolerate it.
It's gonna be,

492
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:11.083
it's gonna be chaos.

493
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.720
<v 5>Yeah.
We have Russia and China to worry about as well.
If we go in and,
and,
and,</v>

494
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.580
and Lord knows what can happen from there.

495
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:21.300
I just hope that the American people realize that they are being fed propaganda

496
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.260
with,
with the Iran situation now in the same people behind Iraq,

497
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.070
same forces are behind this push to get us in Iran.

498
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.670
<v 4>Did you see?
Of course he did,</v>

499
00:27:30.671 --> 00:27:33.670
but what did you think when you saw the Netanyahu cartoon?

500
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.520
When he's explaining with his fucking Wiley Coyote?

501
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.060
<v 5>You know what?
I wanted to laugh,
but it was,</v>

502
00:27:40.061 --> 00:27:45.061
it was so sad because I just see the logic that the lack of logic and how

503
00:27:45.671 --> 00:27:48.730
they're actually able to,
to get that to work.

504
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.330
<v 4>He's just saying,
okay,
you guys are children,</v>

505
00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:57.770
so I'm going to draw you a child's cartoon and see,
I can't explain to you this.

506
00:27:57.771 --> 00:28:01.850
I'm going to show you on the fake bomb that no one's ever seen a bomb.

507
00:28:01.851 --> 00:28:04.310
It looks like that.
That's a bomb from a cartoon.
I mean,

508
00:28:04.311 --> 00:28:06.530
it's so weird that they chose that

509
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.400
<v 5>image for this like really ridiculous propaganda.
Oh,</v>

510
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.620
you know what that tells you,
Joe,

511
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.470
that tells you what they think of the intelligence of the American public.

512
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:19.570
That that they think he could go up with some stupid ass cartoon and and try to

513
00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:23.680
feed us that bullshit to get us into another war.
I mean does,

514
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.100
does he think that the American public,
is that,
is that stupid?

515
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.180
<v 4>Did you see the lobbyist for Israel who was a thinly veiled,</v>

516
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:38.100
trying to promote some sort of a false flag event who was talking about what we

517
00:28:38.101 --> 00:28:38.701
need to do?

518
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:42.450
We need to have a green light to start our war with Iran and it's just like we

519
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:47.190
needed Pearl Harbor to happen for us to attack Japan.
We need the Gulf of Tonkin.

520
00:28:47.191 --> 00:28:50.370
He's the Gulf of Tonkin,
which is a known false flag event.

521
00:28:50.371 --> 00:28:52.680
I mean it's been proven that the Gulf of Tonkin,
there was,

522
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:57.710
the whole thing was a big fake story to in order to get people to be excited

523
00:28:58.051 --> 00:29:00.630
about going to war in Korea or a nun and a Vietnam.

524
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.020
And he was talking about that as if it was like some sort of a,

525
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.790
an actual historical event.

526
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.950
Like to bring it up like that in 2012 it's either you have to either plead

527
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:15.840
extreme ignorance or you've got to say that this is a thinly veiled statement

528
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:19.230
that we need another false flag event because we're going to go into Iran no

529
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:19.681
matter what.

530
00:29:19.681 --> 00:29:23.370
So let's just pretend Iran tried to blow something up and go fuck him up.

531
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.460
<v 5>And they did try to do that in 2007 and perhaps the most hunted a whistleblower</v>

532
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.260
is not Julian Assange,
just,

533
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.800
it's a woman named Gweneth Todd who worked for in the administration.

534
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.090
She was an advisor to the military and she actually blew the whistle on a 2007

535
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.100
false flag event,
uh,
where they were going to try to do exactly that.
Um,

536
00:29:44.101 --> 00:29:46.390
that was bushes.
Last thing before getting out of office,

537
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:49.630
they wanted to take out Iran and she blew the whistle and potentially saved

538
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:51.850
thousands of lives.
Now she's in Australia hiding.

539
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.760
<v 4>Uh,
well no,
you just gave her up.
Now they know that she's in Australia.
No,
no.
Uh,</v>

540
00:29:55.910 --> 00:30:00.030
there was a story done on it.
A couple of stories guys.
I'm not trying to,

541
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.810
not trying to get her in trouble here.
Um,
but she,
she's a real hero and that,

542
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.150
and that did,
they did try to do that in 2007.

543
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.360
What was the false flag event though?
It's,
it's funny when you save the two,

544
00:30:09.361 --> 00:30:11.220
like who exactly is it that's doing it?

545
00:30:11.221 --> 00:30:13.690
Like how many people are involved in something like that?

546
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:13.921
<v 5>Well,</v>

547
00:30:13.921 --> 00:30:18.780
that's what worries me is because when it says that the same forces behind that

548
00:30:18.781 --> 00:30:22.020
and Iraq are now behind the current push to get into Iran.

549
00:30:22.021 --> 00:30:25.620
And I trust her because she risked everything to come forward and,

550
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:30.130
and reveal that and now is in hiding in Australia.
And,
um,

551
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.420
I don't know all of the details about it,
but I do know that they were,

552
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.930
they were going to try to make it look like,
um,

553
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.920
Iran had had blown something up or a attacked,
uh,
uh,

554
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:45.810
one of our us basis.
I don't know exactly.
Listen to me rambling.
I,

555
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.290
yeah,
if you look it up,
it's called,
um,
uh,
if you just look up,

556
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.670
just look up Gwyneth Todd.

557
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.220
<v 4>Hi.
Spoke one of the Gw,</v>

558
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:58.850
y n e t h and then t o d d to do,

559
00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:03.430
I won't even let me,
it just says,
do you mean Paltrow?
Yeah,
of course.

560
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:06.580
That's what would come up.
You know,
Google's trying to,
trying to fucking,
yeah.

561
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.620
<v 5>Um,
it's a pretty,
an unbelievable story.
I tweeted about it.</v>

562
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:15.310
If you go to add amber Lyon and scroll down somewhere down in my timeline,

563
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:15.710
I tweeted

564
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:20.180
<v 4>back a couple days ago.
She was a US senator,
I guess.
Huh?
Um,
no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

565
00:31:20.181 --> 00:31:23.900
I'm sorry.
This is a Patrick Leahy and US senator who is,

566
00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.690
I guess there's responding to what she revealed.
Yeah.

567
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.310
And he's saying that there should be an investigation of the false flag terror

568
00:31:31.311 --> 00:31:32.000
plot.

569
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.960
<v 5>Yeah.
And it was huge.
I mean this,
this was,
they were going to try to start,</v>

570
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.310
start a war with Iran with this,
and this was a u s making up lies and they,
and,

571
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:45.020
and one thing they were going to do is use these protesters in buffering and

572
00:31:45.021 --> 00:31:46.640
make them also look like terrorists.

573
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.300
And this attack had it succeeded and it would've worked because most people

574
00:31:50.301 --> 00:31:52.750
haven't been to Bahrain.
They don't know if these people are extremists,
right?

575
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.270
They're terrace.

576
00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:57.000
<v 4>How did we get to be such a nation of cunts?
What,</v>

577
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.250
what went wrong with us?
Because that's not what the American people,

578
00:32:01.251 --> 00:32:04.760
if you talk to the average American person,
they think of what is America?
Well,

579
00:32:04.761 --> 00:32:08.300
America is about freedom.
We're about,
you know,
carving your own path.
We're about,

580
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:09.140
well,

581
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:14.140
how did we get to be this nation of people that are led by these really evil

582
00:32:15.381 --> 00:32:18.530
corporations?
I mean,
that's essentially what the military is.

583
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.210
If you look at the military,
it's,
it's,

584
00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.500
it's something that the banks and the people that are in power,

585
00:32:24.501 --> 00:32:28.550
the people that put presidents in power or using in order to force their

586
00:32:28.551 --> 00:32:32.720
corporate agenda,
it's all about controlling some resource.
You know,

587
00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.560
extracting some resource,
controlling some areas.
That's all it's about.

588
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.760
It's not as nothing like whenever they call it defense,
it's so offensive.

589
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.240
Cause like,
what are you defending us against your out there fucking people up.

590
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.460
Like it almost has nothing to do with defense.

591
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.170
It has everything to do with offense.

592
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:50.700
If you say the best defense is good offense,
well then I,

593
00:32:50.701 --> 00:32:52.880
I guess maybe you can call it defense,

594
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.210
but it's not what we think of ourselves.

595
00:32:56.211 --> 00:33:00.740
We don't think of ourselves as this horrific force that's destroying,

596
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.570
you know,
parts of the world in order to control its resource.

597
00:33:03.571 --> 00:33:05.560
We don't think about that at all.
We think of ourself.

598
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.960
Most people like to think of America as a fucking eagle or something.
You know,

599
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:12.560
we like to think of ourselves as proud people who,
you know,

600
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:17.510
can you come here and anybody can make it and just there's no caste system here

601
00:33:17.511 --> 00:33:20.750
and you can really work hard and get ahead and hello,

602
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.010
fuck did we become this nation run by assholes.
It's just,
it's weird.

603
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.630
<v 5>I know.
And it's,
it's weird when you wake up at that moment and realize,</v>

604
00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.231
oh my God,

605
00:33:29.231 --> 00:33:33.580
you've been lied to almost all of your life about about certain things that are

606
00:33:33.581 --> 00:33:34.810
happening in this country.

607
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.250
<v 4>Is it just that we have too much power as this is,</v>

608
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:42.290
there's too many American military bases.
There's too many areas we control.

609
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:45.380
Is that what it is?
Is that,
is it,
we just too greedy with it?

610
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.360
<v 5>You know,
I,
I don't know exactly what's behind this but,
but I do know that,</v>

611
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.570
I mean if you look at Nda and things that have happened over,

612
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.470
just I know just in my career over the past decade,
I covered the oil spill.

613
00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:59.390
I've covered the nuclear industry,

614
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:04.220
the all the wars and really getting into it.
I started,
the more I analyze it,

615
00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:07.550
the more I think we've really lost control of the country that people have.

616
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.660
<v 4>It doesn't seem to be about the people at all.</v>

617
00:34:09.661 --> 00:34:14.490
It seems to be about having the legal means to squash any dissent anywhere they

618
00:34:14.491 --> 00:34:18.090
want and that's in place now because of NDA,
which some people don't understand.

619
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.250
Keep rallying against it,
talking about it like,
God,

620
00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:22.380
why are you so freaking out about this?
Well,
this is why.

621
00:34:22.381 --> 00:34:26.070
Because they can essentially throw you in jail.
You can't call your lawyer,

622
00:34:26.071 --> 00:34:28.620
you have no trial.
The,
they can do whatever they want with you.

623
00:34:28.621 --> 00:34:30.300
Now if there is no rights anymore,

624
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.410
it's essentially they put into law that they are just like a king.

625
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.520
I can do what a king wants to do.
Now this is Bradley Manning Guy who pulled the,

626
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.300
pulled the plug on Wiki leaks and the guy who distribute all the information to

627
00:34:42.301 --> 00:34:46.610
them or the who blew the whistle rather he pulled the plug?
Well,
no,

628
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.280
he gave them,
he gave him those documents.
He's in.

629
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.900
He's in solitary confinement and they've,
they've had him there for years now.

630
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:57.570
They're not gonna do shit with them.
They're just got to let them rot,
you know,

631
00:34:57.571 --> 00:35:00.990
they've got barely feed them and keep the lights on and let them go.
Crazy.

632
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.850
Good luck.
You know,
that's,
that's America.
That's America.
If you,
if we,

633
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:08.070
you expose the bad things that we've done,

634
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.210
we're going to do a horrific thing and literally torture you for the rest of

635
00:35:12.211 --> 00:35:15.690
your life.
And that's torture.
24 hours a day of light,
you know,
no,

636
00:35:15.691 --> 00:35:19.170
no people to talk to and no booth books to read.

637
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.840
Just just you by yourself.
Good luck.

638
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:23.160
<v 5>And that's another story.</v>

639
00:35:23.161 --> 00:35:27.210
It was really difficult to cover a stories of leaks and,
and stuff.
Uh,

640
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:31.200
what while I was at CNN and overall and in general,
uh,

641
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.230
because of Obama's Warren whistleblowers and journalists.
Now,

642
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.790
<v 4>isn't that amazing?
When you think of Obama,</v>

643
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.290
you think a guy that everybody thinks of as this really progressive guy?
Well,

644
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.020
he's a socialist Steven.
You know,

645
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:47.430
he's a guy who just had a single mom and it was raised in very,

646
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.140
very moderate family.
You know,

647
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:51.750
it didn't have money and it really made his own way.

648
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:53.310
Very intelligent guy made through Harvard.

649
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:58.490
And here he is doing some of the worst shit to this,

650
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:00.360
to the constitution,
to the,

651
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.410
to the the principals this country's founded on that has ever happened in our

652
00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:06.240
lifetime.
And this guy's doing it.

653
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:11.380
And this guy is going after whistle blowers in a way that even Bush and,

654
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.890
<v 5>and journalists,
he right now,</v>

655
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:18.810
and he's been subpoenaing journalists for their sources and he's gone after more

656
00:36:18.811 --> 00:36:21.390
journalism,
was the blowers in any other president in history.

657
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:24.630
And including one journalist James Rise in of the New York Times,

658
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:26.190
a Pulitzer prize winning journalist.

659
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.670
He's gone after him with subpoenas to try to get him to reveal information about

660
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:33.120
its sources as journalists.
We don't give up our sources.
I mean,

661
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:37.720
that's a number one rule.
So,
and in effect,
he's turned journalism into,
uh,

662
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:42.210
a criminal behavior and turned us into criminals.
And,
and,
and that's,

663
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.620
uh,
for me that's,

664
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:47.880
it's terrifying because if someone comes to me and leaks a document that's vital

665
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:52.470
to the public good that we need to know about in order to fix our government,
uh,

666
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.730
then I become a target too because they come after me and Nda.

667
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:58.140
That's another fear.
They have a fear.

668
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:00.210
It will be used against journalists because they will,

669
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.950
because we're not giving up our sources.

670
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:06.780
They will consider us to be aiding terrorist or terrorism and,
um,

671
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.820
and,
and lock us up as well.

672
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:12.570
And I think there's a lot of fear amongst the investigative reporters,

673
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.140
investigative reporting community that this could happen under Nda.

674
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.160
<v 4>So you're at CNN,
all this is going down and you're,
you're,</v>

675
00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:26.220
you're realizing that your piece has been pulled from the international arm of

676
00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:30.250
CNN and w what is a,
what is the next step?
What do you do?
Do you,

677
00:37:30.251 --> 00:37:34.020
do you start asking questions?
Do you try to poke around or is it,
uh,
and what,

678
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.960
what kind of a atmosphere is CNN like when it comes to this issue?

679
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.950
<v 5>Yeah,
I did.
I,
I went,
um,
on,</v>

680
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:45.360
on behalf of my crew and I went in and made a meeting with the head of CNN

681
00:37:45.361 --> 00:37:49.590
international,
Tony Maddix.
And um,
and not a lot of people do that.

682
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.960
Uh,
and my crew was,
was,
uh,
I just saw the looks on their faces.

683
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:56.580
They were very upset.
Um,

684
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.030
so I met with him and he didn't give me any answers as to why it never aired.

685
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:00.990
I met with them twice.

686
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.440
<v 4>Did he say,
what was his response when you asked him?
Why didn't it get aired?</v>

687
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:05.590
Heard

688
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:09.280
<v 5>the first time he said he'd get back to me and then he never got back to me.</v>

689
00:38:09.281 --> 00:38:11.260
So I made an appointment months later.

690
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.720
And at that point he questioned me as to why a,

691
00:38:14.721 --> 00:38:16.600
a well known New York Times reporter,

692
00:38:16.601 --> 00:38:20.050
Nick Christoff had tweeted about the fact that they never aired the documentary.

693
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:24.520
He tweeted something to the effect of CNN,
why didn't you air amber lions?

694
00:38:24.521 --> 00:38:27.070
I revolution documentary intimidation.

695
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.150
I'm suggesting that Bahrain had intimidated CNN.
It's not airing it.

696
00:38:31.151 --> 00:38:34.870
And so he only questioned me about that.
And a more of a kind of condescending,

697
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:39.790
you better not be talking kind of way.
Uh,
and then I,

698
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:43.210
um,
eventually our unit was dissolved at CNN,
so I was forced out.

699
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.200
They just all do our documentary and investigative unit.
And,
um,

700
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.200
and I kept having this in the back of my head,
like,
you know,

701
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.160
when you can't sleep at night because you know,
something is going on.

702
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.830
And I didn't know how to come out and tell people about it because it's,

703
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.990
it is a very,
um,

704
00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.700
I had to get all my ducks in a row because time Warner is a very powerful enemy

705
00:39:03.701 --> 00:39:07.600
to have a against you.
Um,
and,
and so finally,

706
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:11.830
when I came out and I,
I just to test the waters mentally,

707
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.970
I tweeted about the fact that they had,
um,
sensor the documentary.

708
00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:20.520
And then right away my agent was called.
Um,
and I was told,
uh,

709
00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:23.200
on behalf of all the main executives at CNN my age,

710
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:25.900
I was called in and told on behalf of these executives,

711
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:28.420
you need to be quiet or you're gonna lose your health insurance and your

712
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:31.430
severance.
And at that point when I knew,

713
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.030
when they called to threaten me,
I knew that,

714
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.540
that I had to come out with this full fledge because,

715
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.850
because at that point it solidified that they're,

716
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.120
they're trying to cover something up and shut me up.
Wow.

717
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.350
<v 6>So creepy
movie.
It's,
um,
who,</v>

718
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.600
who would be the star of this movie?
John Cusak.
Yeah.

719
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.080
I think John Cusack would be like a guy who you work with in the office.

720
00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:00.510
Oh No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

721
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.390
I wouldn't offend you like that.
How dare I'm thinking about who would play you.

722
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.960
I guess you could go with Jennifer Aniston,
Oprah,
but she,

723
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:10.960
Jennifer Aniston is a little long in the tooth for you.
We need,

724
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:14.360
which is still pretty hot,
long in the tooth.
She goes,
well,
how old are you?

725
00:40:14.361 --> 00:40:18.790
Are you vote?
Let me gas.
I was going to be 28 you're,
you're right.

726
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:22.420
I'm 29.
Oh,
San Diego.
Jennifer Aniston is gorgeous,

727
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:27.100
but she's 40 you know that's creepy.
Was an older lady play you?
It was like this.

728
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.910
You'd watch the movie like this,
but just not 28 the fuck is going on.
You know,

729
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:34.500
I've been compared to a Claire Danes on homeland.
I haven't,

730
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.890
I've never watched that show.

731
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.930
But every once I showed you don't know if that would work.

732
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.900
You're a more attractive version.

733
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.190
That really annoying check that's in a lot of movies.

734
00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.460
It was for the one from the Dr TV show.
The fuck's her name,

735
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.850
the one who was in the movie with um,
uh,
Seth Rogen where he got her pregnant.
Oh.

736
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.690
Oh,
Katherine Heigl.
There you go.
Yeah.
She seems a little annoying.

737
00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.030
Really?
Not really.
It just the type it sheets.
It's not her.

738
00:41:01.031 --> 00:41:05.080
I'm sure she's a great person.
Just the type of movies.
It's always these wacky,

739
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:08.230
romantic,
oh,
she's got handcuffs dangling from her finger.

740
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:11.190
She's a rascal and this guy,
they're not going to get together wall,

741
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.000
but maybe they are
really serious plots there,
you know?
Yeah.

742
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:19.750
They look brutal.
Have you ever worked with the vice guys before?

743
00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:21.310
Or like if I vice.com

744
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:25.060
<v 5>I am a fan of their work.
I do like,
I like the stuff that they do.</v>

745
00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:28.660
I like their style of reporting is very candid.
It's,
I mean

746
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.930
<v 6>that's been one of the suggestions.</v>

747
00:41:30.931 --> 00:41:33.290
It keeps coming up over and over on Twitter and people are like,

748
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:37.790
you got to get amber together with the vice guys cause they can sneak it back
in.

749
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:42.230
They don't give a fuck.
They'll drop you from an airplane and a and to Bahrain.

750
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.560
Yep.
Yeah.
I've been trying to figure out how to get back in there.
I can't give,

751
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:48.170
I go,
you're crazy.
You need to stay out of there.
They're going to kill you.

752
00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:52.790
I was thinking if I,
if I borrowed a friend's passport and then you know,

753
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.300
my hair brown,
but I don't think it would work.

754
00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:00.740
Or You can talk about it on the Internet now that I'm letting them know exactly

755
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.950
what you need is like one of those Eddie Murphy,
big Mama Body things,

756
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.810
big fat body suit.
I smell sex change.
Eddie,
Eddie Murphy.

757
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:19.280
When he had that,
uh,
the big suit on what move we was at,
big mamas.

758
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.250
Black guys have done that.
God Damn it Martin.
Lawrence does that shit.

759
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:26.380
He's got the Big Mama,
right?
Isn't Martin Lawrence Big Mama?

760
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.790
That was a good movie.

761
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.040
It's not that I'm dissing on it.

762
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:37.010
I'm saying it's a weird phenomenon that these black dudes will,

763
00:42:37.011 --> 00:42:41.270
were these giant black woman outfits and a black dude would pretend to be a

764
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:42.890
black woman,
an older black woman.

765
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:47.650
It's like Super Common Medalia and that Tyler Perry guy,
period.

766
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.490
Nonstop.
Nonstop.
That's what he does.

767
00:42:49.491 --> 00:42:53.000
He's a guy and he pretends to be an old black woman.
It's weird,

768
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:57.870
but it's a black thing.
It's Chris and Chris,
not Chris Rock.
Um,

769
00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.650
I think,
uh,
Dave Chappelle was,

770
00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:04.970
was talking about how strange that is once in an interview.
It's strange.

771
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.090
It's very strange how many versions there are of it,
you know,

772
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.350
like Jamie Foxx and in living color member,
he was that crazy.
Uh,

773
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.930
crazy black woman.
Yeah,

774
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.380
that was,
that is that,
I don't know.
Gosh,
I think that was,

775
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.550
I think that that was what it was.
But yeah,
that's a weird phenomenon.
You know,

776
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.550
there's not a lot of black guys that pretend to be women.

777
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.050
It's like Robin Williams.

778
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:33.590
Mrs Doubtfire was like the last one I can remember what other dudes,

779
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:38.160
white dudes pretended to be women.
Not that many.
Right?

780
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.090
Um,
Robin Williams.
Mrs Doubtfire.
Yeah.

781
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.423
<v 7>MMM.</v>

782
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.560
<v 6>What was the show with Tom Hanks?
Bosom buddy buddies.
Yeah.</v>

783
00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:52.420
That's might be the last time.
And then there was white girls,

784
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:55.360
but that was the Wayans brothers.
They pretended to be girls.
Right?

785
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.700
I don't know how the fuck we got on this tangent.

786
00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.680
I don't think that's going to work though.
I don't
picture you in a black.

787
00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.090
That's a big black woman.
Do you think you'd do a big black woman voice?

788
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.700
Like say welcome to Bahrain.
Why are you here?

789
00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:16.540
What'd you say?
I'm just here to check out Joe Country Holiday.

790
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.180
I heard you got a beautiful country up in here.
Oh,

791
00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:25.330
that's terrible.
That's a white woman under there.
Pull that rubber off.

792
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:27.850
This shit is not real

793
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.040
impersonations.

794
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.260
<v 3>Always about end up becoming Spanish.</v>

795
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.690
<v 6>Pretend that you don't speak English.
I bet they don't speak Spanish.</v>

796
00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.540
I bet you know you get fucking fudge your way through the whole experience fee

797
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.630
request though.
She doesn't have a voice like choice.

798
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.180
She looks,
do you find that,
uh,
knowing Spanish,

799
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:52.100
you realize how perverted all the Mexicans here?
Yeah.

800
00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.590
<v 3>Oh my God.
I have the best story about that.
Not only that,</v>

801
00:44:56.591 --> 00:44:58.070
and so I grew up in the Midwest,

802
00:44:58.071 --> 00:45:01.300
so the middle of the country where no one speaks Spanish,
uh,
Saint Louis,

803
00:45:01.301 --> 00:45:05.980
Missouri.
And uh,
and so I was at a restaurant,
there were all of the,

804
00:45:05.981 --> 00:45:10.660
a lot of the staff speaks Spanish very loudly because they know no one in Saint

805
00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.500
Louis,
no Spanish.

806
00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:15.250
And one time I'm sitting there and I'm ordering food and I hear the guys talking

807
00:45:15.251 --> 00:45:20.251
about my body and breasts and everything else and clearly understand it.

808
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.380
And,

809
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.400
and toward the end I let them go on for a couple minutes and toward the end I

810
00:45:24.401 --> 00:45:27.090
turned to them and I said,
ah,
Kate,

811
00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.010
three stake a DNS when a bad gap again.
Yeah.

812
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:32.920
Which really means how sad that you have a small penis.

813
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:35.650
And they laughed so hard.

814
00:45:35.651 --> 00:45:39.730
They were throwing stuff around the room and I really got them.

815
00:45:39.731 --> 00:45:42.130
And that's kind of the way I do it.
Like,
if I hear something,

816
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.910
I'll turn it and I'll just say that kind of slide to them and then they get a

817
00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:47.380
laugh out of it.
And then maybe you know,

818
00:45:47.381 --> 00:45:49.960
in the future the people speak their language,

819
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:53.810
<v 6>especially Spanish.
That's a pretty common one.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

820
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.110
That's one of the most common second languages that totally,
totally,
yeah.

821
00:45:57.111 --> 00:45:59.720
It's gotta be a weird thing to be able to just yell shit out and nobody

822
00:45:59.721 --> 00:46:02.480
understands what you're saying,
you know?
Yeah.
My,
my ex girlfriend,

823
00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:05.150
she could speak and she would tell me like all the time,

824
00:46:05.151 --> 00:46:07.850
like that person just said I had nice tits and while we were walking by him,

825
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:11.240
but she learned after a while she wouldn't tell me until like minutes later

826
00:46:11.241 --> 00:46:13.550
cause I kept on getting pissed.
I'd be like,
what the fuck?
You know,

827
00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:17.540
dude tried to get all aggro.
No,
I just become an asshole.

828
00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:20.930
Like I'm going to do so let me Susan.
Yeah,
they just,
they,

829
00:46:20.931 --> 00:46:23.720
it's almost like they're doing it on the Internet.
Yeah.
You know,

830
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:25.420
they do it anonymously.

831
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.340
They think they're just getting away with it and it's not even really,

832
00:46:28.341 --> 00:46:31.340
it was actually the opposite of doing on the Internet because it's only for
them,

833
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.020
you know,
it doesn't even reach you.

834
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:36.660
It's like them saying something conti about you but you can't even read it.
Yeah.

835
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.090
You see my George Washington put pictured

836
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.300
the George Washington with a terminator gun.
Hey Logan,

837
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:49.760
what does that about?
Uh,
this,
this artists on Etsy just makes all these like,

838
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.110
like presidents,
like,

839
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.370
like in like crazy situations like riding horses and Unicorns and tigers and

840
00:46:55.371 --> 00:46:55.730
stuff.

841
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:59.720
It's fascinating that when you go back to the constitution and when you go back

842
00:46:59.721 --> 00:47:03.980
to these guys that were originally starting off this country and they kind of

843
00:47:03.981 --> 00:47:05.240
saw the shit common,

844
00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:09.860
it's really amazing when you really look at like the obvious patterns of

845
00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:13.040
corruption that people in power seem to follow over and over and over again.

846
00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:18.170
Those guys all saw it coming.
They all,
they all saw it coming.
They had,
you know,

847
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.210
they have provisions,
they had it set up.

848
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.780
So you're supposed to protect people from that as much as possible.

849
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.170
Not supposed to use the military to control civil unrest.

850
00:47:27.171 --> 00:47:30.070
You don't supposed to be used the army on it's citizens.
All

851
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.920
<v 4>that was changed by Nda.
That's the,</v>

852
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.000
another thing that a lot of people don't know that was,

853
00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.740
you're allowed to use the military.
Now.

854
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.360
The military can come in the army against US citizens.
That's,

855
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:44.440
that's crazy.
The whole country can be declared a battlefield.

856
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:48.040
<v 3>Yeah.
And,
and that only,
you only know what I mean.</v>

857
00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:51.790
If they're going to all of these lengths to,
to create the ability to do that.

858
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:55.090
What,
what's in store when it comes to descent?
You know,
I mean,

859
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:59.600
did you see the photos out of Anaheim?
Yes.
Uh,
of all the police,
Johnson.
Yeah.

860
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.590
I was there a camouflage.
You see the Walmart one the other day?

861
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:07.210
They had like the sound canyons and everything like that at a Walmart protest.

862
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.360
Some of those a protests.
Yeah,
I'll find it.
Yeah,

863
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:10.550
<v 4>I know.
The,
um,</v>

864
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.880
the Anaheim thing was weird because there was a media blackout about it.
Yeah.

865
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.710
And,
uh,
you know,
the,
the,
it was,
it was really ugly.

866
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:21.760
The watching people wearing full military gear with Cammo desert cammo walking

867
00:48:22.831 --> 00:48:25.910
through the streets.
It's really unsettling because first of all,
why?

868
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:30.150
Why are they wearing fucking Cammo?
You know,
that's a,
what are you hiding?

869
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:34.500
Are you pretending we're in Iraq?
Are you reminding me that these people are,

870
00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.890
are trained killers that go to Iraq and now I'm the enemy?

871
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:39.390
Is that what this is supposed to be?

872
00:48:39.391 --> 00:48:43.500
The am I supposed to feel unpatriotic for not giving in to what's going on here?

873
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.040
A cop shot a kid in the back and people were freaking out.

874
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.970
That's everybody should be freaking out.
Obviously some horrible thing happened.

875
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.920
Everybody should be freaking out,

876
00:48:52.921 --> 00:48:55.080
including these people that are holding these guns,

877
00:48:55.081 --> 00:48:57.750
including these people wearing Camo with body armor.

878
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.570
You should be freaking out too,
because this is all America.

879
00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:03.900
This is all part of your community and someone who was in a position of power

880
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.080
made a horrible mistake and these people want justice and you know what?

881
00:49:07.081 --> 00:49:10.110
They should get it.
There's are,
they should,
they should be able to feel safe.

882
00:49:10.111 --> 00:49:15.111
There's a terrible gap between the way people are in power,

883
00:49:15.331 --> 00:49:17.790
whether it's police officers,
whether it's a mill,

884
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:22.380
anybody that is in a position of power and the people that gets suppressed with

885
00:49:22.381 --> 00:49:22.741
those people,

886
00:49:22.741 --> 00:49:27.440
that that gap is a a really scary thing and what a cop is,

887
00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:31.260
who was in a position of power shoots a kid and then they see no repercussions.

888
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:35.070
They see a completely different reaction than if the kid had shot the cop.

889
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.150
Everybody has a right to freak out because we are supposed to be equal in this

890
00:49:39.151 --> 00:49:43.690
country and someone who's in a position of power clearly crossed all the legal

891
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:45.270
lines.
They clearly fucked up.

892
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.110
They clearly violated the relationship between the person in power and the

893
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:53.310
person they're supposed to be protecting and to see people reacting.

894
00:49:53.311 --> 00:49:57.730
That's the way they chose to react by sending in the military.
Whoa,
Whoa,
that's,

895
00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.100
that's not how you're supposed to do it.

896
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.250
You're supposed to do it by sitting down with the community and figuring out

897
00:50:02.251 --> 00:50:04.140
what we can do to make sure this never happens again,

898
00:50:04.141 --> 00:50:07.260
and to make sure that the person who did this never has the opportunity to do

899
00:50:07.261 --> 00:50:11.280
this again.
Whether it's put them in jail,
whether it's taken him out of office,

900
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:15.630
you know,
fire them instantly and put them in jail,
whatever it is,
whatever,

901
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.590
you know,
the,
the courts deem the correct action.
But you have to have justice.

902
00:50:19.591 --> 00:50:21.180
Do you have to have justice for everybody?

903
00:50:21.181 --> 00:50:25.020
It can't just be for people who can afford it.

904
00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:27.730
It can't just be for people in power.
It just be,

905
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:31.610
<v 6>it's,
it's,
we're in a weird place now.</v>

906
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.840
It's a weird place.
Is this,
what is this?
This is it.
The Walmart photos,

907
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.780
which I got a check out these,
uh,
like that.

908
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:43.040
That's one of those sound o and l Rad device.
Yeah.
Now what happened?

909
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:44.510
And they have look at that.

910
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:47.770
<v 5>That's just what Heather just mean.
It looks like something out of judge Dredd.
I,</v>

911
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:51.540
I,
I just,
you know what that is?
That's intimidation.
See that.
See those people,

912
00:50:51.541 --> 00:50:55.290
they are,
they're not armed.
They're not.
Look at that old older man.
It's,

913
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.910
it's an intimidation tactic.

914
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.310
I saw that when I was covering the protests in Anaheim.

915
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.400
It's a way to try to make people scared.

916
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.810
<v 6>Did just so it's not that they're,</v>

917
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:05.540
they're anticipating that they're going to need all that armor.

918
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.050
They're only doing that because they want everybody to freak out that the storm

919
00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:09.510
trooper,

920
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.850
<v 5>and you're starting to see that,
uh,</v>

921
00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.790
we saw it at the Republican National Convention.

922
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:15.710
You're starting to see that all over the country.
And that's why,
uh,

923
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:20.470
where he's music as a journalist.
Um,
Anaheim was,
I mean,
that guy,
man,

924
00:51:20.471 --> 00:51:23.500
we'll Diaz was shot in broad day light.
So people were obviously upset.

925
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:27.100
And I remember being there and we were in the middle of the road at a march and

926
00:51:27.101 --> 00:51:31.960
I looked over my shoulder and I saw the trucks coming down the street with guys,

927
00:51:31.961 --> 00:51:34.840
with police officers dressed in Camo.
And I had to,
I,

928
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.870
it's almost like everything just came to a stop.
Even the protesters,

929
00:51:37.871 --> 00:51:39.970
everyone could not believe what they were seeing,

930
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:45.270
that these officers were dressed like that for unarmed children and women and

931
00:51:45.731 --> 00:51:50.470
men who were protesting.
And,
uh,
you know,
it's,
it's,
uh,

932
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.860
I feel a systematic,
uh,

933
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.040
crushing of dissent or protests by,

934
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.580
by police departments across the country.

935
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:04.950
<v 6>Was there any danger what it was there?
Any looting or any rioting?
We,</v>

936
00:52:04.951 --> 00:52:09.510
what was going on that they would feel the need to bring in and essentially,

937
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.870
you know,
tanks and military.
What did,
what is that?

938
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:16.130
<v 5>They were trying to head to Disney land.
So the protesters are upset.</v>

939
00:52:16.131 --> 00:52:19.160
They feel like it was influenced somehow by Disneyland because they were going

940
00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:21.650
to march and they felt that the you,
you see them.
Yeah.

941
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:25.280
There they are on horseback.
Oh,
I remember I took a shot of that lady tail.
Um,

942
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.510
and so they,
they literally made it impossible for the protesters to march.
Look,

943
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:29.930
that's,

944
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:33.560
that's what I saw when I was walking down the street shooting photographs and I

945
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:38.360
couldn't believe it.
Horses dudes on.
Um,
yeah.
And,
and look,

946
00:52:38.361 --> 00:52:39.710
they're carrying Boykins in their hands.

947
00:52:39.711 --> 00:52:43.580
Those are wooden Japanese swords to hit people with Si.
See that officer there.

948
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.840
Um,
not only that,
they were firing beanbag rounds and,

949
00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:52.700
and tear gas and the horses were bog goggles on and right there that's at the

950
00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:53.301
intersection.

951
00:52:53.301 --> 00:52:56.780
And they wanted to go down that intersection and turn and head to Disneyland to

952
00:52:56.781 --> 00:53:00.860
protest because they felt soldiers with fucking machine guns.
If you,

953
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:05.861
I have another video look up Tim pool and Amber Lyon shot at by Anaheim police

954
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:10.580
because we were trying to cover this Joe and um,
and the police we had noticed,

955
00:53:10.581 --> 00:53:14.540
kept setting up walls to keep us behind the police officers as we were covering

956
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:16.880
it so we wouldn't be there with the people,
uh,

957
00:53:16.881 --> 00:53:18.290
to see how they were being treated.

958
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:23.291
Also to see how they were being shot with these nonlethal Wa rounds.

959
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:28.841
And at one point I was actually fired on by the Anaheim police department with

960
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.230
Leslie's lethal rounds,
but they,

961
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.590
I was clearly standing in a busy street and they knew,
here we are.

962
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.850
<v 8>I can see something,
I can see Kara.</v>

963
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:41.070
<v 3>So we're in a busy street and there I am right there.</v>

964
00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.480
And the guy yells,
fucking pigs and then listen,
now

965
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.980
see the u haul,
right.

966
00:53:50.981 --> 00:53:55.870
Then I stopped and I was literally sitting there and I hit him between two u

967
00:53:55.871 --> 00:53:58.060
hauls as,
as rounds kept going past,

968
00:53:58.061 --> 00:54:00.940
he was able to smart enough to be able to scale a wall.
But Watch,

969
00:54:00.941 --> 00:54:01.930
he gets fired on again.

970
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:06.720
<v 0>By the way,
those bullets and nonlethal they can take your eye out easily.</v>

971
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.160
<v 3>Not only that,
if they hit you in the ribs,
um,
and your,</v>

972
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:15.810
your ribs go into your heart,
it can kill you if it hits you in the neck.
Um,
and,

973
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:18.960
and in the header can crack your skull.
I've seen it happen overseas.

974
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:28.120
Jesus Christ.
And this isn't just a neighborhood of an Anaheim.
People were,
were,

975
00:54:28.121 --> 00:54:28.470
uh,

976
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:32.100
<v 0>so they fired on you.
Like you guys are like this is a war.</v>

977
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.780
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

978
00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:36.440
And I was hiding between the two u hauls and I was yelling for Tim because I

979
00:54:36.441 --> 00:54:40.290
didn't know he had gotten away and I thought he had been hit.
And so

980
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:45.390
<v 3>yelling for him to see if he was okay and then,
um,
and look,</v>

981
00:54:45.391 --> 00:54:48.390
he's running now cause they're just shooting down the streets.
I mean,

982
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.430
these poor people living in this neighborhood.
Um,

983
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.580
<v 5>Jesus Christ.
And,</v>

984
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:57.470
and so at this point I come out and this is just the cops doing this.
Yeah,

985
00:54:57.471 --> 00:54:59.590
this is the police.
So who are we really scared of here?

986
00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:03.170
The protesters or the police cause of protesters weren't shooting at me.
And,

987
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:07.090
and I,
and I clearly have blond hair and a bright green shirt on and,

988
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:10.070
and was shooting photos of a dumpster that had been set on fire.
And I,

989
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.080
and finally,
when,
uh,

990
00:55:12.081 --> 00:55:15.020
after a couple of minutes I ran out and I screaming press and the,

991
00:55:15.021 --> 00:55:18.230
and they quit firing.
And one of the officers looked at me and said,

992
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:22.700
I was really worried about you.
And then,
and then he also said,

993
00:55:22.701 --> 00:55:24.080
don't you know how to cover a riot?

994
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.650
And then he pointed back at a photographer who was behind the police line with

995
00:55:27.651 --> 00:55:28.910
them following the police,

996
00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:31.790
instead of actually hanging out with the protesters like we're supposed to do as

997
00:55:31.791 --> 00:55:33.050
journalists.
We're,
we're,

998
00:55:33.051 --> 00:55:36.110
we're out there to be a watchdog on authority and protect the public.

999
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.550
And in other words,
that's,

1000
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:41.720
that's what I believe they were doing is trying to keep me from being with the

1001
00:55:41.721 --> 00:55:46.550
protesters to film their injuries as civilians and bystanders or getting hit by

1002
00:55:46.551 --> 00:55:50.240
these,
these less,
less lethal rounds.
Um,
and,

1003
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:54.380
and that that's pretty scary because they're trying to oppress not only these,

1004
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:57.860
these voices of dissent but journalism and journalists.

1005
00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.480
How was that possible

1006
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.510
<v 4>that are the system of government that we have that the people that are in power</v>

1007
00:56:04.511 --> 00:56:09.511
are slowly tightening things down on us in the same age as the,

1008
00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.620
the information we're getting from the,
the Internet now the,

1009
00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:19.090
the same age of instant information,
instant about anything,
answers,

1010
00:56:19.091 --> 00:56:23.020
any question.
The,
the distribution of information through social,

1011
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:27.550
through podcasts and Twitter and Facebook,
it's never been greater.

1012
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:31.660
The the access to information,
it's like so instant and so,
so she,

1013
00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:35.950
but yet at the same time you have these crazy crackdowns as crazy police state.

1014
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:37.480
It's almost like we're putting,

1015
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:41.620
turning the light on a vampire and it's shrieking and reacting and showing us

1016
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:43.840
it's true self like in this,

1017
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:47.470
these days gone by when we didn't have the access to information,

1018
00:56:47.471 --> 00:56:49.870
when we didn't know what was going on during the Gulf of Tonkin and we didn't

1019
00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:53.260
know what was going on during who knows how many different United States

1020
00:56:53.261 --> 00:56:57.600
ventures overseas we w w when we didn't know we,

1021
00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.920
we had a different impression of ourselves.

1022
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:02.680
We have a different impression of the whole system of government that we

1023
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:06.610
operated under.
We had a,
is it that or is it things are getting worse?

1024
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.070
Is it that or we really do have crooks in,

1025
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:13.750
in office and they are acting differently than Jimmy Carter would have or Bill

1026
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.520
Clinton would have.
I mean,
is that what's going on?

1027
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:18.460
<v 3>I think that it's a little bit of both.</v>

1028
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:22.570
I think that it's surprising law enforcement that,
oh my gosh,
wait a minute.

1029
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.590
I can't just shoot it.

1030
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:26.470
Someone now the video is going to go on youtube and people will know forever

1031
00:57:26.471 --> 00:57:30.130
that I did this.
Uh,
so,
so thank goodness for social media.

1032
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:34.920
It's making a lot of this stuff,
this video,
this,
these cops shooting at you.
Um,

1033
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.530
people picked it up,
our t picked it up,
people criticize our t,

1034
00:57:38.531 --> 00:57:41.610
but our tea at least has covering what's happening in this country.
Um,

1035
00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.730
and a couple other people,
um,
because it's,
uh,
they say,
you know,

1036
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:49.120
it's state sponsored and they're not accurately portraying what's happening in

1037
00:57:49.121 --> 00:57:50.300
Russia.
Um,

1038
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:54.460
but regardless though they are accurately covering what's happening here in the

1039
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.830
U S and,
um,
and,
and that should have been,

1040
00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:01.180
if you're really looking at the situation with journalism and in the u s and the

1041
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:01.691
survival,

1042
00:58:01.691 --> 00:58:05.260
and what's an important story that should have been on all of the mainstream

1043
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:08.160
media outlets.
I mean,
we were,
we were just,
we were shot at,

1044
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:12.420
<v 4>well,
not just that,
those cops should go to jail.
What the fuck is that?</v>

1045
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:14.910
Someone yells out pigs.
So you start shooting him,

1046
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.160
really shooting them with rubber bullets.

1047
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.760
That's an asshole that has rubber bullets.
That's all it is.
That there's no,

1048
00:58:20.761 --> 00:58:22.020
this guy getting shot right here.

1049
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.000
<v 3>Yeah.
Oh Gosh.</v>

1050
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:33.743
<v 8>Hello.</v>

1051
00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:41.410
<v 3>Drop your car right now.
He's loading a shotgun with um,
those are,
um,</v>

1052
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:42.560
beanbag rounds.

1053
00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:48.940
It's essentially a legend who maintained your line and look at them.

1054
00:58:49.281 --> 00:58:51.050
They're,
uh,
the majority of the,

1055
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:55.490
so the community there is more than 50,

1056
00:58:55.491 --> 00:58:58.910
3% Hispanic.
The police forces about 24%.

1057
00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:02.090
This is so hard to talk about.
I get tongue tied.
I get back.

1058
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.220
<v 4>I don't know what to say.
It just,
it doesn't,</v>

1059
00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:09.530
it seems it's like a horrible scene in a movie.
It doesn't seem real.
You know,

1060
00:59:09.531 --> 00:59:13.310
when you see this weird tightening down,

1061
00:59:13.311 --> 00:59:14.690
this weird police state,

1062
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.430
this in impending police state that just keeps getting bigger and bigger and

1063
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:23.420
worse and worse,
fucking flaming dumpsters.
I mean,
this is a God damn video game.

1064
00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.800
<v 5>Yeah.
And these guys were just,
they were walking down in rows.</v>

1065
00:59:26.801 --> 00:59:30.290
The police just walking through these neighborhoods and you'd see people

1066
00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:32.010
appearing out their gates fare.

1067
00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:36.880
They're looking just horrified as walls of police officers.

1068
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:41.500
Um,
uh,
we'd just come through their neighborhoods and just start firing and going

1069
00:59:41.501 --> 00:59:45.760
through a dark alleyways and firing.
There are many times I had to scream,
press,

1070
00:59:45.761 --> 00:59:46.331
see,
look at that.

1071
00:59:46.331 --> 00:59:48.820
Right now they're just walking through these neighborhoods with their guns

1072
00:59:48.821 --> 00:59:52.720
pointed.
And these are elderly people and right.

1073
00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.120
There's those are beanbag rounds.

1074
00:59:55.121 --> 00:59:57.970
And then the red things are pepper balls and what the pepper balls do.

1075
00:59:57.971 --> 00:59:59.620
It's like a paintball but filled with,

1076
00:59:59.621 --> 01:00:03.340
with pepper spray and it comes out,
you know,

1077
01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:05.650
it makes it hard to breathe the beanbag rounds.

1078
01:00:05.651 --> 01:00:09.800
Those are what worry me because those have a led pellet wrapped around,
uh,

1079
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:13.840
a pillow wrapped around a led pellet and they can still tear open your skin.

1080
01:00:13.841 --> 01:00:14.890
And like we were talking about earlier,

1081
01:00:14.891 --> 01:00:18.430
if they hit you in the chest and your ribs were to break and Pierce your heart,

1082
01:00:18.431 --> 01:00:20.890
you could die as well as it could crack your skull.

1083
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.720
It's killed people if it hits you in the neck.

1084
01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:25.210
And that's why it's terrifying to be shot at like that.

1085
01:00:25.211 --> 01:00:27.100
And you saw those people just standing in the street

1086
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:31.690
<v 4>doing it like it's nothing just like it's nothing and shoot at that guy when</v>

1087
01:00:31.691 --> 01:00:34.990
he's just standing up holding his hands.
That's in fucking insane.
That's insane.

1088
01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:35.824
Yeah.

1089
01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.830
<v 5>A lot of pedestrians were,
um,
were hit or had to dodge bullets because they,</v>

1090
01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.690
they just came out to see what was happening.

1091
01:00:42.691 --> 01:00:45.090
They saw a dumpster on fire instead of what's going on.

1092
01:00:45.091 --> 01:00:48.600
And they would stand on the street corners and just look to see what was going

1093
01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:51.950
on.
They weren't even involved in a protest and they were fired on,

1094
01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.560
<v 4>is this how it's always been?
It doesn't seem like it.</v>

1095
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:58.580
It doesn't seem like that would have happened just a decade ago.
Don't let me,

1096
01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.970
doesn't it was,
was,
was this how it was?
I mean,

1097
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:05.030
obviously they had a clamp down during the la riots,

1098
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.510
but it seems like the La riots was a far more violent protest and was,

1099
01:01:08.511 --> 01:01:13.400
it was far crazier and it was a huge racial divide.
But even then,

1100
01:01:13.401 --> 01:01:14.690
I don't remember seeing this.

1101
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.350
I don't remember seeing people just walking down streets just firing

1102
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:20.090
indiscriminately into alleys and shooting it.

1103
01:01:20.091 --> 01:01:23.990
Reporters shooting at people that call them pigs.
I mean,
someone calls you a pig,

1104
01:01:23.991 --> 01:01:27.410
you're allowed to shoot at him.
It was,
I mean,
really,
that's crazy.
Yeah.

1105
01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.010
<v 5>And,
and I think that,
um,
you know,</v>

1106
01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:33.460
that has been a journalistically a lot of us have been trying to analyze whether

1107
01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:38.230
things have gotten worse or they haven't.
And um,
I've just noticed myself,

1108
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.790
I've been covering the protest for a year.

1109
01:01:39.791 --> 01:01:44.410
I've noticed things getting worse as far as the garb that police are wearing.

1110
01:01:44.411 --> 01:01:48.250
The,
the video game,
like intimidation tactics.

1111
01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.350
Why when they wear these ridiculous uniforms to a,

1112
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:53.620
a couple of old people in front of Walmart,

1113
01:01:53.621 --> 01:01:57.280
you saw that this is systematically dangerous for this country.

1114
01:01:57.281 --> 01:02:00.430
Because what it does is it instills fear and,

1115
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.990
and people and it makes people scared sometimes to get out and protests.

1116
01:02:04.991 --> 01:02:08.380
Not only that,
it agitates people look at Anaheim,
they were fine.

1117
01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:11.830
They just had come out to get upset about Manuel Diaz and then the police show

1118
01:02:11.831 --> 01:02:13.180
up and start firing on them.

1119
01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.540
I don't know if you saw the video of the police dog getting loose on the crowd.

1120
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.350
I did,
yeah.
I mean that's another hard one.
Watch

1121
01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.920
<v 4>anywhere.
Just cop said that it slipped and it lost the leash.
Whoops.
Yeah,</v>

1122
01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.730
sorry.
I'll let the monster go

1123
01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.400
<v 5>on.
Women and children and they were walking with their guns and just firing on</v>

1124
01:02:30.401 --> 01:02:32.260
people in broad daylight?
No.

1125
01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.520
<v 4>What did the protesters do that started the,
I mean there was ed.</v>

1126
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:38.610
Was there any violence at all that started this escalation?

1127
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:43.160
<v 5>I,
I think,
uh,
at first it started with the police dog getting loose on the crowd.</v>

1128
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.960
Um,
are you talking about just Anaheim?

1129
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:47.060
<v 4>Yeah.
Like what did,
what did Anaheim did,</v>

1130
01:02:47.061 --> 01:02:50.210
what did the protesters do that started this escalation?

1131
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:50.940
<v 5>Well,</v>

1132
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:54.620
what happened was first the police dog got released on the crowd and then there

1133
01:02:54.621 --> 01:02:57.720
were firing on women and children.
And so that created a lot of anger.

1134
01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:01.380
Then they went to city hall to complain and then the protesters didn't leave the

1135
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:04.650
front of City Hall.
So that night,
um,
a,

1136
01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:07.710
I think a couple rocks had been thrown or,
um,

1137
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:11.550
I know a bottle at one point came right past my head and hit the ground.

1138
01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:14.230
So I don't know,
but I didn't see who threw it.
Um,

1139
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:19.200
but it did come from the crowd of,
of protest or so.
So that could have been what?

1140
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:22.330
Agitated the situation.
Um,
but at the same time,

1141
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.240
<v 4>she's fairly minimal.
For what the way the escalation that you see in that video?</v>

1142
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:30.330
<v 5>Yeah.
And and right after a bottle or a rocks were thrown,
I mean the,
uh,</v>

1143
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:35.010
wall of officer's w when I say a wall,
a wall of officer's just started Bam,
Bam,

1144
01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:38.790
Bam,
Bam into the,
into the crowd.
And there were women and children.
And

1145
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.970
<v 4>is this video quick close up?
Yeah.
It's so crazy.</v>

1146
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.090
I mean,
I know that Obama can't have his finger on every trigger.

1147
01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:52.180
He can't be the one that's calling for all of this.
But it just,

1148
01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:57.250
it's so shocking for me after the,
the idea that every,

1149
01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.090
everybody kind of thought when this guy got into office that at least socially

1150
01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:02.410
this was a change for the better.

1151
01:04:02.411 --> 01:04:06.060
This was a guy who was obviously really intelligent,
really like edge,

1152
01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:10.750
highly educated,
thoughtful,
a great speaker,
young and vibrant,

1153
01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:13.900
and this sort of represented hope.
A black guy.
He's the president.

1154
01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:17.530
It just represented like this new breath of fresh air.

1155
01:04:17.531 --> 01:04:19.770
Like finally we got this guy in the office.

1156
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:22.150
This is fucking president in my whole life.

1157
01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:25.750
I've been waiting for this guy to be in the office and then this shit happens.

1158
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:29.360
It's like,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's crazy.
It's,

1159
01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:33.220
it's the best evidence ever that the president doesn't really get to ever really

1160
01:04:33.221 --> 01:04:35.260
be the president that the president is just a puppet.

1161
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:39.540
<v 5>And that's when I came to that realization because I,
I,
um,</v>

1162
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.550
when I saw that,
that everyone,
everyone had called for change.
And,

1163
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.330
and then when I saw not only that,
but the historically speaking,
uh,

1164
01:04:49.331 --> 01:04:53.250
the Democratic Party has been more favorable toward journalism and journalists.

1165
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:55.500
Um,
and,
um,

1166
01:04:55.650 --> 01:05:00.570
and to see the way he's attacking systematically journalism with Nda and with

1167
01:05:00.571 --> 01:05:04.890
the subpoenas,
um,
and,
and how things just really haven't changed.

1168
01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:08.730
The only thing that's changed as we've had now,
uh,
our,

1169
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:12.390
our first amendment rights taken away from us at an alarming rate.

1170
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.940
And it kind of makes you think you really have to,

1171
01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:18.820
you really have to stop and think you are not being extremist in your views and

1172
01:05:18.821 --> 01:05:22.150
you're not out there to really logically put things together,

1173
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.960
put the pieces of this puzzle together and realize that we don't have control of

1174
01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:26.890
this country anymore.

1175
01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.260
<v 4>It's,
it is,
uh,
uh,
nicely dressed dictatorship.</v>

1176
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.920
That's what it's like.
It's a,
it's got a cute costume on,

1177
01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:39.100
let's got this costume on it.
But if you look at the rules,

1178
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:44.250
the rules are essentially a dictatorship with MDA specially that's just once you

1179
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:45.340
become,

1180
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:49.210
Julian Assange is essentially just did what a journalist is supposed to do.

1181
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:51.370
I know there's a lot of people that are confused about what he did.

1182
01:05:51.371 --> 01:05:52.001
There's a lot of people,

1183
01:05:52.001 --> 01:05:56.200
there's a lot of misinformation about his releasing of names of people that were

1184
01:05:56.201 --> 01:06:00.160
undercover.
That's not true at all.
If you,
if you look at what he actually did,

1185
01:06:00.161 --> 01:06:02.950
what he actually did was released some horrific facts,

1186
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.830
and that's supposed to be what journalism is about.

1187
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:09.790
Journalism is supposed to be holding people accountable so that we don't have to

1188
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.730
have this distorted perception of what we're doing overseas.

1189
01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:17.240
So we actually can see the horrific nature of of these crimes.
And they're,

1190
01:06:17.241 --> 01:06:19.420
they're fucking more crimes.
They're,
they're horrible things.

1191
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:22.810
And it's a daily day to day thing and all of a sudden it was thrust into the

1192
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:23.530
public eye,

1193
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:26.590
but it wasn't by the New York Times and it wasn't by the Washington Post.

1194
01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.460
It wasn't by the Boston Globe.
It was by this one freaky dude with white hair,

1195
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.050
you know,
and so it was really easy to call this guy in enemy.
It's really easy.

1196
01:06:35.051 --> 01:06:37.570
And that's what they've gotten him labeled.
Now he's an enemy of the state.

1197
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:39.700
They have him labeled as an enemy of the state.

1198
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:44.770
But you look at his actual actions,
there were really has been nothing horrible.

1199
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:47.680
Even if he was a United States citizen,
there's nothing he did.
He what he did,

1200
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.530
if he was a United States citizen would essentially be patriotic.

1201
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:55.710
What he did was expose the bad elements of our government so that the good

1202
01:06:55.751 --> 01:06:57.400
elements could clean up the mess.

1203
01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.690
Because when you find a cop that's doing something illegal,
you find a cop.

1204
01:07:01.691 --> 01:07:04.600
It's selling drugs.
You don't,
it's not,

1205
01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:09.601
you're not supposed to bring that up and expose that and then you go to jail for

1206
01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:12.970
being an enemy of the state.
No,
it's supposed to be.

1207
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.840
You have exposed a corrupt part of our system.

1208
01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.180
Thank you very much for doing that.

1209
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:24.010
We got 'em now we arrest them like on CSI or on some fucking movie.

1210
01:07:24.011 --> 01:07:25.480
They would arrest him and throw him in jail,

1211
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:30.280
but in the case of the u s most in the case of the US military were completely

1212
01:07:30.281 --> 01:07:33.700
beyond that.
We're completely beyond any accountability.

1213
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.400
They're completely beyond any,

1214
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:42.060
any exposure of any sensitive information that they don't leak themselves is

1215
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:45.010
thought to be treasonous.

1216
01:07:45.011 --> 01:07:49.540
It's thought to be a crime against the state and that's a sickness.

1217
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.220
That's a real sickness.
You are.

1218
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:56.340
There is a bunch of crazy fox in power that are treating us the same way at king

1219
01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:59.470
treats his,
his,
his disciples.
It's really the same thing.

1220
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:04.980
If you can't release clear video that show something wrong that has not been

1221
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:09.700
addressed and that people did not know about and something that was going to

1222
01:08:09.701 --> 01:08:13.210
make people reconsider the way they think about the military.

1223
01:08:13.211 --> 01:08:17.180
We consider the way they think about what it is to have your own children over

1224
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:21.980
there as as soldiers doing these things like what are we really doing?

1225
01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:24.320
If you look at that collateral murder video,

1226
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:28.820
that's a disturbing fucking video and that's a good video for everyone to see

1227
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:33.350
because it lets people know the truth and let's people know this really happened

1228
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.830
and your government did not want you to know about it and they tried very hard

1229
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.210
to keep this information from you.

1230
01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.720
Here's a bunch of other shit that really happened.
I mean the,

1231
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:44.960
with each passing thing that they release,

1232
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:49.710
it becomes more and more obvious how corrupt this entire system is from a

1233
01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:54.400
lobbyist and special interest groups to be being beholden to corporations to get

1234
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.710
into control,
to controlling natural resources and different countries.

1235
01:08:57.711 --> 01:09:01.250
It's a giant money grab.
I mean that's all it is.
It's a,

1236
01:09:01.251 --> 01:09:04.520
and anybody that steps in and tries to fuck the money grab up is a terrorist.

1237
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:05.620
<v 5>Exactly.</v>

1238
01:09:05.621 --> 01:09:09.610
And that's what's so terrifying about Nda and that's what has journalists

1239
01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:12.730
concerned and,
and whistleblowers concerned.
And,
and I,
and I love Joe,

1240
01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:15.790
that you guys talk about whistleblowers and hold them in the light.

1241
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:18.670
They should be,
uh,
the light that should be shown on them.
And that's it.

1242
01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:20.050
They're heroes.
We need them.

1243
01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:23.980
We need them to point out the broken parts of the machine so that we can fix

1244
01:09:23.981 --> 01:09:26.170
those parts one by one and keep the machine going.

1245
01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.200
<v 4>Yes,
the machine needs to be going.
It's not like the Ma,</v>

1246
01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.060
we want to overthrow the government.
It's not,

1247
01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.600
we just don't want it to be corrupt and thought,
that's amazing that that is,

1248
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:38.160
that that is controversial in 2012 with the amount of access to information that

1249
01:09:38.161 --> 01:09:42.390
we have,
we,
we should have evolved much further as a civilization.

1250
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.040
<v 5>If we had more whistle blowers,
we would,</v>

1251
01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:46.320
because they'd be able to do what I've done with CNN.

1252
01:09:46.321 --> 01:09:48.680
And I said that this isn't right.
Look what they're doing with it.
As a viewer,

1253
01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.850
you should know when you're watching this at state sponsored.

1254
01:09:50.851 --> 01:09:53.130
It's just a little thing that will help enlighten some people.

1255
01:09:53.131 --> 01:09:56.400
We need that information.
It's power and ma overhaul.

1256
01:09:56.490 --> 01:10:00.330
Overwhelmingly Americans are amazing positive people who,

1257
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:03.360
who are able to make a difference and would be horrified if they knew of some of

1258
01:10:03.361 --> 01:10:06.390
the things that are happening in the military and in these corruptions.

1259
01:10:06.391 --> 01:10:09.840
And that's why they're going to such great lengths to keep people from coming

1260
01:10:09.841 --> 01:10:10.600
forward.

1261
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.750
<v 1>I remember.
Why do you hate America?
Yeah.
Why do you hate America?</v>

1262
01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:17.570
I know.
Well that scares me too.
Yeah.

1263
01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:20.050
<v 4>Do you ever hear that kind of talk to speak to,
do you get that?</v>

1264
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:24.510
<v 5>Um,
I,
I do and I,
and I also get the,
uh,</v>

1265
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.240
<v 1>oh Geez,
you guys are coming knocking on the door.
I don't have the government.
Oh,</v>

1266
01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.190
this didn't we all get arrested on,
on video?

1267
01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:36.450
That'd be hopefully the cops or UFC fans tickets if you don't shoot us.

1268
01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:42.990
I love it.
We laugh about that.
But um,
do you worry?
I do worry and I've had,

1269
01:10:42.991 --> 01:10:46.260
I've actually had hundreds at this point of emails.

1270
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:50.400
Mostly from Alex is folks worried about my safety and they just want to fuck
you.

1271
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.370
Yeah.
I'll come to your personal battle.
I'm worried about your safety.

1272
01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:00.090
Lucky I have body armor specifically for your size.
Yeah.

1273
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.330
<v 4>In my compound there's plenty of food.</v>

1274
01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:03.680
We could live on the ground for six months.

1275
01:11:03.681 --> 01:11:05.480
That's all it takes for the radiation to die down.

1276
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:09.190
<v 1>Yeah.
I have had a lot of a body guard offers.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1277
01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.260
So maybe that's why I'm getting that.
But uh,

1278
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:14.130
I know there is a feeling and the journalist community now that

1279
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.540
<v 5>especially with Nda,</v>

1280
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:18.660
that we are scared that one day there's going to be a knock on the door

1281
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.970
<v 0>and get arrested.
Yeah.</v>

1282
01:11:19.971 --> 01:11:23.510
And you gonna get taken away and you can get detained and you can get detained

1283
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.650
indefinitely.
And that's a,
that's the law now.
You don't have to,
you don't,

1284
01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:30.900
you don't have the rights that you had just a year ago.
And for people,

1285
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:32.330
people need to wrap their head around that.

1286
01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:36.050
Like it's not innocent until proven guilty.
It's,
there's none of that.

1287
01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.420
It doesn't exist anymore.
Like that's gone away.

1288
01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.450
And that's not what we think of when we think of this country.

1289
01:11:41.451 --> 01:11:42.500
We think of the constitution.

1290
01:11:42.501 --> 01:11:45.350
We think of all the rights that were endowed with we,
we,

1291
01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:47.480
we don't understand that that's gone.

1292
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.680
<v 5>Yeah.
And then people don't,
people like you center.</v>

1293
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.890
Just why are you talking about NDA?
Well,
it,

1294
01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:57.180
it's so terrifying because this is now,
I mean,
come on,

1295
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:00.990
let's get to it.
The,
the black and white of it.
What,
what's a terrorist anymore?

1296
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.770
Nelson Mandela was called a terrorist.
Martin Luther King.
I mean,

1297
01:12:04.771 --> 01:12:09.660
now you can use terrorist to pretty much to try to take out any of your enemies

1298
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.920
or anyone who is,

1299
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.630
is maybe an investigative report or a radio show host who against what the

1300
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:19.770
government's doing.
And,
and that is so scary for so many of us.

1301
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.620
<v 0>I love it when they became insurgents and what's hers is going on now to become</v>

1302
01:12:24.621 --> 01:12:28.740
an insurgent.
You know,
you know,
you're not the enemy anymore.
They're insurgents.

1303
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:32.070
They're doing battle with insurgents.
Like surgeon,
I don't even know.

1304
01:12:32.071 --> 01:12:35.680
I'm a turtle.
It's don't even know what the hell it is.
But it became sort of a,

1305
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.520
a word that was forced into the vernacular.
It's like that all,

1306
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.640
I'd never used that word insurgent my whole life.

1307
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:45.090
I went 39 plus years by using the word and surgeon,

1308
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.670
and then all of a sudden it's just be tossed around in the news every day.

1309
01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:50.670
And I'm like,
where the fuck network come from?
Never even heard of it before.

1310
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:53.640
It's just a cute way of saying,
you know,
some dudes we're going to shoot,

1311
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:58.410
you know,
some people that are angry at us,
the enemy,
whatever it is.
Um,

1312
01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:58.950
what do you,

1313
01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:03.950
what else did you see that you thought was being censored or downplayed?

1314
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.060
How mean how much of Wiki leaks was,
uh,
how much of that was,
was,

1315
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.830
you know,
censored over there?

1316
01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.230
<v 5>Yeah,
I mean,
I don't even know how much I can,
it's just,</v>

1317
01:13:14.231 --> 01:13:16.570
I feel like I could talk about all of this forever,

1318
01:13:16.571 --> 01:13:18.480
but this is really one of the first times I'm,

1319
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:21.580
I'm talking about the Wiki leaks issue.
Um,
but that was,

1320
01:13:21.581 --> 01:13:26.200
that was another hands off kind of red tape story as well.

1321
01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:29.890
And,
um,
and that,
that was,
uh,
that was,

1322
01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:32.620
it was difficult to get coverage of that,

1323
01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.280
especially with any type of leaks.
This is what's happening now.

1324
01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:39.850
If someone comes forward with a leak to the mainstream media now because of

1325
01:13:39.851 --> 01:13:40.730
Obama's subpoenas,

1326
01:13:40.731 --> 01:13:44.410
they have to analyze the legal aspect and whether they're willing to pay the

1327
01:13:44.411 --> 01:13:48.280
money if it's potentially subpoenaed.
And so that makes stories more expensive.

1328
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.970
Um,
when it comes to leaks.
Also,
a story that I saw,
uh,

1329
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:57.090
that was very difficult to cover was ICU have a mask over their anonymous.
Um,

1330
01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.900
that became really difficult to cover because pretty much at this point,

1331
01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:05.170
the FBI came out last year in,
um,

1332
01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:10.530
last winter and talked about how they feel a cyber terrorism is as one of the

1333
01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:14.350
biggest to the country.
And,
and in that speech,

1334
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:16.630
Robert Mueller also mentioned,
uh,

1335
01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.920
he threw an aline about script kitties and people working on computers and they

1336
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.420
are in their parents basements,

1337
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.330
which pretty much meant he was referring to anonymous.
So,

1338
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:28.180
so journalistically that became,
if you cover anonymous,

1339
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:30.490
you have a chance of getting subpoenaed because the federal government is

1340
01:14:30.491 --> 01:14:34.930
against a nonce.
And so it became very difficult to cover that story as well.

1341
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.860
And um,

1342
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:41.050
and became a more of an analysis on whether we're able to spend the legal money

1343
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:43.540
than whether the story is journalistically important.

1344
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:44.920
I think the anonymous story is,

1345
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:48.700
is very important because we can't allow the federal government to come out and

1346
01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:53.701
just call people terrorists or stay cyber terrorists or try to instill fear.

1347
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:58.990
We need to know there's a mask,
the guy Fawkes mask.
Uh,
we need to know,

1348
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.980
we as journalists,

1349
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:04.120
we need to be able to talk to these people to see what they're really all about.

1350
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:07.630
We all know now we can't trust our government to tell us who our enemies should

1351
01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:09.520
be.
We need to know as journalist,

1352
01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:12.940
we need to be able to go and talk to people even down to al Qaeda.

1353
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:15.490
We need to be able to get in and talk to these indigenous

1354
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:18.870
<v 0>sure.
What could possibly be the justification and on the side of the government</v>

1355
01:15:18.871 --> 01:15:22.830
could,
could they be like,
we have to do this to protect people?

1356
01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.890
Could they be thinking that we have to clamp down on all these rights in order

1357
01:15:25.891 --> 01:15:29.940
to ensure the safety of the United States?
I mean,
what,
what the fuck?
Or they,

1358
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.630
or they just look were corrupt,
were just corrupt.
This is how we do it.

1359
01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.590
We're just assholes,

1360
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:41.860
<v 5>you know,
or,
or it really lets you know who's the agenda there they're on.</v>

1361
01:15:41.861 --> 01:15:45.340
Like if you look at the situation with the FBI going after anonymous and

1362
01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:48.340
spending those kinds of resources on,
on anonymous,
wait a minute,

1363
01:15:48.341 --> 01:15:50.740
why aren't you going after the bankers here?

1364
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.710
Why are you spending these resources doing these elaborate missions to,

1365
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:55.660
to try to crush hackers who,

1366
01:15:55.661 --> 01:15:58.570
the majority of them are actually on human rights missions and aren't even

1367
01:15:58.571 --> 01:16:01.540
hackers.
They're just disseminating information on the internet.

1368
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:05.050
And that's when I knew that that was another thing because they'd hit some

1369
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:07.360
corporations and so it's like,
okay,

1370
01:16:07.361 --> 01:16:11.870
so they're going after anonymous because the corporations are controlling our,

1371
01:16:11.871 --> 01:16:13.360
our law enforcement decisions.

1372
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.790
I mean that was the black and white of this situation.

1373
01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:18.520
Why aren't they going after bankers?
Why are they going after anonymous?

1374
01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.140
And that's why it's important for us as journalists to be able to get in and,

1375
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.760
and,
and talk to these individuals.

1376
01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:28.120
<v 0>I wonder how they justify it at the highest level.</v>

1377
01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:31.750
I really would love to see the meetings when,

1378
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.410
when they get together and draft something like the National Defense

1379
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:37.070
Authorization Act.
I would love to see what the,
the,

1380
01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.480
the conversation is like when you like what do you want to put in there?
Oh,

1381
01:16:40.481 --> 01:16:44.230
we were fucking lock them up,
but for whatever,
for whatever.
Anything.

1382
01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:47.140
If you want to just put for being an enemy of the state.
Yeah.

1383
01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:50.350
Let me say that's good.
That's good enemy of the state,
which is such a vague,

1384
01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.380
you know,
terminology that you can use it for journalists,

1385
01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:57.040
a guy like Julian Assange because Julian Assange with wikileaks and not with the

1386
01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:00.010
New York Times of Julia and the was with the New York Times,

1387
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:02.620
The New York Times released all those wikileaks documents.

1388
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.730
It would have been a very different story.
But because he's in this wiki leaks,

1389
01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:10.070
what the fuck is a Wiki leak?
It's connected to Wikipedia,
which is sort

1390
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.270
<v 4>of silly as it is,
not completely reliable,
you know?</v>

1391
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:18.500
So it's sort of this we easy Lee,
it's dismissed.
It's not the New York Times.

1392
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:22.700
New York Times has been around.
This is a new thing because it's a new thing.

1393
01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:27.200
We can say,
it doesn't count.
Like you can't have new journalism doesn't,

1394
01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.780
doesn't exist.
The only the stuff that already is here,

1395
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:31.400
because we've got that shit under wraps.

1396
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.890
So because it wasn't with the New York Times,

1397
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:36.920
then all of a sudden this guy can be labeled an enemy of the state.
I mean,

1398
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.821
could you imagine?
I mean,

1399
01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:41.210
it would be a very different reaction at the New York Times printed that and the

1400
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:43.560
government went after the New York Times and called the New York Times,

1401
01:17:43.561 --> 01:17:45.530
the enemy of the state.
Then people would have to go,
whoa,

1402
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:48.980
like what's going on here?
But because it's Wiki leaks,
they should have,

1403
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.780
everybody should have every journalism,
uh,
every,

1404
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.610
but every person that cares about true principles,
every journalist should have.

1405
01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.480
Stan stood up and I mean it should have been the front page of every newspaper.

1406
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:02.150
It should have been like,
this can't happen.
This is why it can't happen.

1407
01:18:02.151 --> 01:18:05.270
This is why we need people to watch after the government we need,

1408
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.040
we need people to make sure that all,

1409
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:11.180
you can't just trust the government to look out for the good of the people.

1410
01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:15.020
You need people watching them,
and that's what journalism has always been about.

1411
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.410
It seems like that's what that guy's doing.
It seems.

1412
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:20.300
It doesn't seem like he's doing anything different,

1413
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:24.700
but yet he's in hiding in a fucking embassy in London now and they're circling

1414
01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:28.190
in the house trying to figure out how to get them out.
I mean it's,
it's nuts.

1415
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.130
It's really weird because essentially they're saying,

1416
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.450
I mean they're talking about going in,

1417
01:18:32.451 --> 01:18:33.740
they've talked about going in several times,

1418
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:36.340
but essentially they're saying that the rules are bullshit.
Like we've,

1419
01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:39.250
we've tenders rules,
but there really are no,
no rules.
You're,
you're,

1420
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:43.010
what is it a consulate and embassy look through?
It's a fucking house.

1421
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.200
It's right there.
And the guy we wants in there,
we're going to go and get them.

1422
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.470
And that's really what's happening right now.
And he's just there,

1423
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:51.620
just waiting him out.
He's sitting there for months waiting him out

1424
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.820
<v 5>and they've succeeded in.
And their main goal in all of this was to distract.</v>

1425
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:59.570
It's a PR tactic.
Let's distract,
distract,
distract,
and they've succeeded.

1426
01:18:59.571 --> 01:19:01.550
They've distracted from the actual leak.

1427
01:19:01.551 --> 01:19:06.200
And now it's become more about Julianne and him having to hide in the embassy

1428
01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:08.120
and,
and these,
um,
you know,

1429
01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:12.260
accusations out of Sweden and it hasn't become about what we really should be

1430
01:19:12.261 --> 01:19:16.790
looking into and that was the leak and how we can,
can fix that in the future.
So,

1431
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:21.440
so that,
uh,
horrific situations of civilians getting shot by US troops don't,

1432
01:19:21.441 --> 01:19:22.690
don't happen again,
but,

1433
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:25.820
but we're not focusing on that now because we're too busy focusing on where's

1434
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:29.030
Julian now?
And,
and that's what they want.
And they've succeeded.

1435
01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:31.310
<v 4>The fact that they're putting so much attention,</v>

1436
01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:35.990
emphasis and focus on this one guy and that they're doing it because he had

1437
01:19:35.991 --> 01:19:39.410
surprise sex with someone really doesn't mean it's not even,

1438
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:42.560
they're not even calling it rape.
I mean it's not,
he's not a murderer,

1439
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:44.360
he's not an armed robber.

1440
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:48.650
He's someone who had consensual sex with someone and then then there's some like

1441
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:52.430
weirdness that went on.
I don't know what it was,
but whatever it was,

1442
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:53.690
even if he was guilty of it,

1443
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.890
it doesn't seem like it's nearly enough to warrant this kind of attention.

1444
01:19:57.891 --> 01:19:59.120
I mean,
this is fucking crazy.

1445
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:02.780
If we had to go over every guy who did something creepy sexually and we had a,

1446
01:20:02.781 --> 01:20:06.060
you know,
send a fucking army after them.
I mean that's the,

1447
01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.790
that's never happening.
That's not,
that's not going to happen.
This is,

1448
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:12.330
it's bullshit and it,
but it's the most obvious bullshit.
It's like,

1449
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:16.440
it's so thinly veiled.
It's insulting and how ridiculous it is.

1450
01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:20.070
If you look at them like the Julian Assan standing on those little balcony and

1451
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:22.650
he can't leave the embassy and they go,
why is he there for?

1452
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:25.620
And then you find the actual thing that they're going after and be like,
what?

1453
01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:29.970
Wait a minute.
What?
That's crazy.
Like this is what they're using.

1454
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:33.960
There's some weird sex thing that he did in Norway or Sweden or whatever the

1455
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:34.794
fuck.
Where was it?

1456
01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.510
<v 5>Oh,
sweet.
Sweden.
Uh,
and you know,
uh,</v>

1457
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:41.650
they're also trying to send a message with that to journalists like myself and

1458
01:20:41.651 --> 01:20:43.990
others is,
look,
what's going to happen to you if you,

1459
01:20:43.991 --> 01:20:48.670
if you leak the leaks and,
and,
and that's what they're doing to it.

1460
01:20:48.671 --> 01:20:52.030
It's a systematic way to try to prevent people from leaking information about

1461
01:20:52.031 --> 01:20:52.840
corruption.

1462
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.840
But those leaks are vital to the survival of whatever ounce of democracy we have

1463
01:20:57.971 --> 01:21:01.510
left in this country.
And we need leaders.
We need whistleblowers.
They're heroic.

1464
01:21:01.511 --> 01:21:02.650
They're fantastic.

1465
01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.430
If something is happening in your corporation that you know is,

1466
01:21:06.431 --> 01:21:09.400
is violating the public good,
you should leak that information too.

1467
01:21:09.401 --> 01:21:12.000
Because if no one knows what's happening,
we can't,
we can't fix it.

1468
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.130
<v 4>A true patriot is supposed to be someone who protects against enemies,</v>

1469
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.290
both domestic and foreign.

1470
01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:24.030
That's supposed to be the idea is that it's not that we can't have foreign

1471
01:21:24.031 --> 01:21:25.860
people that we love and that our allies,

1472
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.950
and it's not that we can't have domestic people who are truly our enemies.

1473
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:29.311
I mean,

1474
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:34.311
and anybody who's trying to turn this country into what it's becoming.

1475
01:21:35.341 --> 01:21:38.940
When you see these fucking soldiers walking down streets,
when you,

1476
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.990
you read the language and the NDA and you go,
Whoa,
I can sign this.

1477
01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:46.820
Like how did this get through?
Oh,
that's the enemy.
There's,

1478
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.580
there's an and one of the whether or not that enemy,
I don't know.

1479
01:21:50.581 --> 01:21:53.700
I don't know if it's on the political side.
I don't know if it's corruption.

1480
01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.170
I don't know if it's incompetence.

1481
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.320
I mean they say that no one ever reads any of those fucking bills anyway.

1482
01:21:58.321 --> 01:21:59.250
That they're too long.

1483
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.240
They say that if the Congress really read everything that they sign,

1484
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.710
it would be in physically impossible.
Like they would have,

1485
01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:09.550
like if you talk to them about what's in things,
like there's a lot of them that,

1486
01:22:09.610 --> 01:22:13.520
that don't,
they,
they can't read it.
They can,
you know,

1487
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:16.830
<v 5>that's where journalists failed in journalism failed because we should have had</v>

1488
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:17.130
a,

1489
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:22.130
a tremendous amount of reports on NDA and really a lot of more people raising

1490
01:22:22.231 --> 01:22:26.610
hell about it.
Um,
but it's been censored by the mainstream media and,

1491
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:29.640
and so,
uh,
Congress reacts to pressure.

1492
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:33.090
If the public doesn't pressure Congress not to sign the NDA,

1493
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:37.890
then then they're going to sign it.
And,
and,
and that's what happened.

1494
01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:43.470
<v 4>God,
it's so weird.
It's a,
it's just you,
you,
you look towards the future.</v>

1495
01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:44.550
And I have young children,

1496
01:22:44.551 --> 01:22:48.730
I have a two year old and a four year old and I look at what their life is going

1497
01:22:48.731 --> 01:22:51.620
to be 10 years from now,
20 years from now.
And if,

1498
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:55.280
if things keep clamping down the way they are,
it's,

1499
01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:00.540
it's a fucking horrific mess.
And it seems to be,

1500
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:03.450
if you look at the amount of money we're spending overseas,

1501
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:06.400
and if you look at the incredible military budget,
I mean,

1502
01:23:06.401 --> 01:23:10.930
it's just astounding how much money,
it's not a lack of resources that we have.

1503
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:13.480
It's just how those resources are being allocated.

1504
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:16.360
Those resources have been allocated.
And these really weird ways.

1505
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:20.530
Is it because we just need,
in order to keep our lifestyle,

1506
01:23:20.531 --> 01:23:23.080
we need to control these,
these natural resources,

1507
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:27.520
whether it's in Iran or whether it's in whatever it is that we need to do in

1508
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:31.930
other car.
Is that really what's going on?
Is it to protect our lifestyle here?

1509
01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:33.790
I don't know.
I don't know what it is,

1510
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.940
but I definitely know this is not the right way to do it.

1511
01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:42.550
There's gotta be a better way for the whole system to be run unquestionably.

1512
01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.870
And it seems like it's almost like there's like,

1513
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.050
like they're conceding that it's out of control.

1514
01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.960
So in conceding that it's out of control,
they're like,
look,

1515
01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.970
we've got to fucking take away their rights.

1516
01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.610
We got to make sure that we can take their computers.

1517
01:23:57.730 --> 01:24:00.700
We want to be able to just fucking take all their money out of the bank.

1518
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:02.560
We can do that whenever we want.
We can just say,

1519
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:05.020
you don't have any money money home anymore.
Now it's all ours.

1520
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.560
We've gotta be able to figure out how to stop some Arab spring type shit from

1521
01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:11.380
happening here.
And this is how to stop it.
Stop it.

1522
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:14.410
Well we make essentially doing whenever we want legal.

1523
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:19.570
So all shit that should be completely illegal because they wrote some things

1524
01:24:19.571 --> 01:24:22.270
down and some asshole signed it that didn't read it.

1525
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:26.530
Then what's horrific now becomes law.
Yeah.

1526
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:29.880
<v 3>And it's uh,
and I think it,</v>

1527
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:32.320
they want people want you to think it's out of control.

1528
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:36.880
But this is very systematic.
That language in the NDA is very systematic.

1529
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.050
The crackdown down on dissent in this country is very systematic.

1530
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:45.910
And the crackdown on journalism who could expose the descent is systematic.

1531
01:24:45.911 --> 01:24:50.080
And the fact that this stuff has not airing on all these mainstream outlets that

1532
01:24:50.081 --> 01:24:54.940
are connected to all these corporations and governments is systematic.

1533
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.720
So they may make it appear to be more chaotic than it is,
but,

1534
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:03.290
but it really is a systematic crackdown on,
on dissent and,

1535
01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.010
and people who are criticizing the government,

1536
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:10.060
<v 4>the average person who works in hours a day,
who has a mortgage bills,</v>

1537
01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.120
Carly's things to think about relationship troubles.

1538
01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:16.480
Do they even know what the fuck is going on?
Does,

1539
01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:19.390
what percentage of the population is waking up?

1540
01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:24.650
<v 3>I,
I'd say it's,
it's small,
but it is,
is an army of people waking up.
Um,</v>

1541
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:28.440
I,
and I know that from after going on Alex Jones show and,

1542
01:25:28.441 --> 01:25:31.750
and the response I got after that,
uh,
I was really relieved.
I said,
okay,

1543
01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:35.500
I'm not shouting alone.
There are people out here that see what's happening.

1544
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.270
But at the same time,
you know,
I'll,
I'll then go and talk with,
uh,

1545
01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.310
my family living in the Midwest and then they're not aware of what's happening

1546
01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:47.260
there.
They're busy watching a real housewives of orange county or you know,

1547
01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.890
<v 4>or they'll say something like,
well,
they're over there fighting for our freedom.</v>

1548
01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.430
<v 3>Yeah.
Or just,
yeah,
the propaganda.</v>

1549
01:25:52.431 --> 01:25:54.680
They'll just recite the propaganda that they've been fed.

1550
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:57.330
<v 4>That's one that hurts.
They're over there fighting for freedom.</v>

1551
01:25:57.331 --> 01:26:00.630
That one fucking hurts.
That hurts.
My brain hurts.

1552
01:26:00.631 --> 01:26:03.920
It hurts when you see the caskets that they're not to photograph.

1553
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:08.740
It hurts when you hear people that have lost friends,
loved ones eat,

1554
01:26:08.741 --> 01:26:12.020
run into people that have no legs.
They'd come back from Iraq and you're like,

1555
01:26:12.021 --> 01:26:14.720
for what?
For what?
What are they doing this for?
Really?

1556
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:17.270
This is the only way to do it.
This is the best way to do it.

1557
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.490
Where's that money going?
Billions and billions and billions of dollars a month.

1558
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.380
I mean,
it's somewhere around six to $7 billion per month.
It's costing us.

1559
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:30.070
It's insane.
It's insane.
When you think about if,

1560
01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:35.100
if that money could be turned on just just helping the United States,

1561
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.510
just helping the poor community,

1562
01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.940
United States trying to figure out alternative fuel sources.
Trying to,

1563
01:26:40.941 --> 01:26:42.140
I mean just putting into,

1564
01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:47.030
it's like there's a stranglehold on the way things are run now and the,

1565
01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:47.241
the,

1566
01:26:47.241 --> 01:26:52.241
the money that's being extracted with the way things run now has such incredible

1567
01:26:52.881 --> 01:26:57.710
power over our lives.
It's really amazing how small groups,

1568
01:26:57.711 --> 01:26:59.300
relatively small groups of people.

1569
01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:02.510
If you stop and think about the actual amount of people that are involved in oil

1570
01:27:02.511 --> 01:27:03.344
corporations,

1571
01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.410
the amount of people that are involved in government and you compare it to the

1572
01:27:06.411 --> 01:27:08.240
whole world,
it's a very,
it's relatively small,

1573
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:13.100
but that relatively small group of people has this insane effect on our day to

1574
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.340
day lives and the future of humanity.

1575
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:21.460
The future of literally the human race because if we are the biggest superpower

1576
01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.600
in the world,
if then that's what we are.

1577
01:27:23.601 --> 01:27:25.880
I mean there's never been anything like the United States.

1578
01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:29.810
Rome was never even fucking close to,
as crazy as we are.

1579
01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.440
We have military bases in over a hundred countries and there's a lot of people

1580
01:27:33.441 --> 01:27:38.441
that don't know that and this is all falling apart right before our eyes and

1581
01:27:40.491 --> 01:27:45.350
it's all crumbling right before and it's all going down like a crazy fucking

1582
01:27:45.351 --> 01:27:49.940
movie,
like some crazy apocalyptic movie.
It's going on right before our eyes.

1583
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.220
And most people are just stuck in traffic.

1584
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.220
They're just listening to some fucking Kanye West Song.

1585
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:59.540
Can't wait to get home to watch the latest Kim Kardashians show.
And it's,
it's,

1586
01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.360
we are,
we are fucking strange.

1587
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:05.760
<v 3>It's been set up that way.
I mean,
the more ignorant people are,</v>

1588
01:28:05.761 --> 01:28:08.730
the more you can get away with and look at our programming or television

1589
01:28:08.731 --> 01:28:09.481
programming.
It's,

1590
01:28:09.481 --> 01:28:12.630
I was talking with some producers other day who have been trying for years to

1591
01:28:12.631 --> 01:28:16.450
feed these networks,
intelligent programming and hardcore new shows and,

1592
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.970
and chose to educate the public.

1593
01:28:17.971 --> 01:28:22.830
And instead they said a show about some people catching alligators in swamps was

1594
01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:26.910
approved.
So this has been a systematic over the years.
It is a great show,

1595
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:32.010
but over the years it's been
this one here,
honey booboo.

1596
01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:36.690
Honeyboo Ville.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's been a systematic bigfoot hunter.
Okay.

1597
01:28:36.691 --> 01:28:40.110
I haven't watch that Sasquatch or finding big foot rather,
dude,

1598
01:28:40.111 --> 01:28:43.840
I'm not going off on these shows.
But we need,
we need some educational program.

1599
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:45.190
We do,
we do.
Do

1600
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:49.050
<v 4>we,
we need a better system.
We needed,
need a better system,</v>

1601
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:51.960
not just of government,
but of life.
You know,
there's,

1602
01:28:51.961 --> 01:28:55.280
there's too many people in this world that are living these really horrible and

1603
01:28:55.281 --> 01:28:58.230
fulfilling lives.
And I don't think that's necessary.

1604
01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.320
I think there's too many people out there are in what feels to them an

1605
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:07.530
unproductive,
unsatisfying cow cog in a wheel.

1606
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:12.890
And all of that leads to this feeling of detachment from the events of our

1607
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:14.364
world.

1608
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:18.660
And we sort of allow the people that are in the positions of power to manipulate

1609
01:29:18.661 --> 01:29:20.760
these great masses of people.
I mean,

1610
01:29:20.761 --> 01:29:24.390
I've always said that the idea of a country's really kind of ridiculous at a

1611
01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:27.000
certain point,
if it's not ridiculous today,
it's ridiculous.

1612
01:29:27.001 --> 01:29:27.840
A hundred years from now.

1613
01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:32.010
The interconnectedness of human beings through technology is eventually going to

1614
01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:36.810
make the idea as a physical bow of boundaries and barriers where you can't go

1615
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:39.570
over there because this dirt is controlled by these people.
But you can't go.

1616
01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:42.080
It's,
it's crazy.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's a,

1617
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:46.260
eventually we're going to have to accept the idea of a world community.

1618
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:48.350
And uh,
when,

1619
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:53.460
when you think of the future and you think of what a world communicate community

1620
01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:54.654
would be like,

1621
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.400
one thing's for sure is you're not going to be able to control all those people.

1622
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.930
You're not going to,
they're going to have to,
it's people are going to have to

1623
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:10.260
be served by,
by,
by the notions and,

1624
01:30:10.261 --> 01:30:15.210
and then the,
the beliefs that they have by,
by the ideas of community,

1625
01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:18.870
by the ideas of sharing the ideas of making.

1626
01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:21.590
And enhancing each other's lives.
The idea of,

1627
01:30:21.591 --> 01:30:26.160
of having a real community of human beings on this one planet instead of these

1628
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:28.950
ridiculous little teams that were on,
whether it's fucking,

1629
01:30:28.951 --> 01:30:32.340
I hate Texas because I'm from Oklahoma,
or you know the United States,

1630
01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.200
England can go fuck themselves.
You know,
it's,

1631
01:30:34.201 --> 01:30:36.420
it's at a certain point in time we're going to,

1632
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.110
we're going to connect to each other to the point where we realize we are really

1633
01:30:40.111 --> 01:30:43.380
just one giant community and if we're one giant community,

1634
01:30:43.381 --> 01:30:47.670
we can't get led by these one people that have more ones and zeros that want to

1635
01:30:47.671 --> 01:30:50.880
send giant metal killing machines.
The places we've never been,

1636
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:53.610
because there's minerals there or because there's heroin there are,

1637
01:30:53.611 --> 01:30:56.630
because there's oil there because there's whatever the fuck it is [inaudible]

1638
01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:58.080
that's not gonna work anymore.

1639
01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.020
It's going to get to a point in time where that's not going to work.

1640
01:31:01.021 --> 01:31:05.400
And I think that's what this big clamoring for taking away rights is all about.

1641
01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:09.030
I think the writing on the wall is that the,
the Internet,

1642
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:13.610
the Internet is changing the game.
It's changing humanity.
It's changing.
We,

1643
01:31:13.690 --> 01:31:15.540
I don't even think we even realize when,

1644
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:19.170
when history looks back and they look at 1993,

1645
01:31:19.171 --> 01:31:22.660
94 whenever AOL started,
when they look at that to now,

1646
01:31:22.661 --> 01:31:27.661
and that is a Co Raisie change and the way people look at the world and just,

1647
01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:31.890
uh,
just just by access,
just access to each other,

1648
01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.050
just the ability to communicate with each other and find out.

1649
01:31:34.050 --> 01:31:36.330
There's other people that think like you find out there's other people that are

1650
01:31:36.331 --> 01:31:40.330
scared and confused and find his other countries that are taking over their

1651
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:43.770
country.
They're taking it back and they're fighting against corruption.
And then,

1652
01:31:43.771 --> 01:31:47.670
you know,
the United States sees that and goes,
fuck this.
Start cutting cords.

1653
01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:50.280
You need to,
we need to be able to cut the internet.

1654
01:31:50.281 --> 01:31:53.400
We need to be able to shut off people's cell phones,
which is the latest apple.

1655
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:54.360
Thanks a lot apple,

1656
01:31:54.361 --> 01:31:59.130
you fucking twats this ridiculous new thing that they've done when they've made

1657
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:00.160
third party

1658
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.130
<v 6>option so that someone can turn off video cameras.</v>

1659
01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:07.780
So all cops have to do that.
You can't take your battery out of your,
your iPhone.

1660
01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:10.840
You shut it,
like can you take your battery out?
I've always wondered that.

1661
01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:14.200
Well because it's supposed to be a larger battery.
If,
if you,

1662
01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:17.260
if you have a smaller battery,
if it's a removal,
if it's removed,

1663
01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:21.370
you have to have a housing in a place where it attaches and that that space is

1664
01:32:21.371 --> 01:32:23.600
all used up.
It really was about the march,

1665
01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.730
<v 3>you know?
Um,
I,</v>

1666
01:32:25.731 --> 01:32:28.520
I've just heard a lot of people with an insecurity community and train of

1667
01:32:28.521 --> 01:32:32.030
thought that,
that,
that right now are speculating,

1668
01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:34.730
why can't you take your battery out?
Well,
if you can't take your battery out,

1669
01:32:34.731 --> 01:32:37.340
then your gps can ever shut off and you can never,
I've,

1670
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:40.310
I've had meetings with sources where I've had to throw them,
throw,

1671
01:32:40.311 --> 01:32:43.520
literally throw my iPhone out the window because they said they wouldn't talk to

1672
01:32:43.521 --> 01:32:47.450
me if I had an iPhone with me because there's no physical way to shut that phone

1673
01:32:47.451 --> 01:32:50.800
off.
It's,
so if anyone was monitoring me there,
there'd be no way.

1674
01:32:50.801 --> 01:32:52.070
If I had that phone in my presence

1675
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.950
<v 6>to keep it off.
It's really creepy that apple decided to include that.</v>

1676
01:32:56.250 --> 01:33:01.050
The ability of a third party to shut off your video camera remotely and they
say,

1677
01:33:01.051 --> 01:33:03.960
well they will.
Well,
hey,
it's for concerts.
It's for guys like you,

1678
01:33:03.961 --> 01:33:06.900
Joe Rogan to do your comedy.
We don't want anybody recording.

1679
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:10.770
That's not what it is.
[inaudible] there he does.
It's just stopping it.
Done.
Done.

1680
01:33:10.771 --> 01:33:13.920
Yeah.
Can't shut that little get to jump.
Brian loves it.
He loves it though.

1681
01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:17.820
He doesn't care.
He's like,
dude,
track me.
He makes love to that phone.

1682
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:19.110
The phone is sexual to him.

1683
01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:22.380
<v 3>I,
I've put 'em I've had to put postits over my,</v>

1684
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:24.450
my camera was on my phone and on my,

1685
01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:29.100
my laptop because when I see this sir,
the software that they have,

1686
01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.980
one of my friends who is a,
um,

1687
01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:36.130
is very savvy with knowing software and hacking and stuff,
um,

1688
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:39.570
has shown me programs where they can install it on your laptop and someone can

1689
01:33:39.571 --> 01:33:42.830
get in and they can control your camera so they can monitor you all the time.
Oh,

1690
01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:45.120
they can.
They can literally,
if you have a wifi connection,

1691
01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:47.790
they can go in and suck your information out of your laptop through the Wifi and

1692
01:33:47.791 --> 01:33:51.330
send it to another computer.
I mean,
all this stuff has been going on for years,

1693
01:33:51.331 --> 01:33:53.730
you know,
but I,
I didn't ever really hit me in my head and I said,
Gosh,

1694
01:33:53.731 --> 01:33:58.590
how many times have you had your laptop open when maybe you haven't been dressed

1695
01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:00.120
or other things,
you know,
so,

1696
01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:05.150
so now I just sticky sticky note over my laptop camera.

1697
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:09.860
<v 6>Yeah.
There's going to be completely grossed out by me that just maybe an off.</v>

1698
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.240
Yeah.
Nonstop.

1699
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:16.590
<v 3>I had a friend who was hired by corporations to hack into computers.</v>

1700
01:34:16.810 --> 01:34:21.250
Um,
and he,
he said one,
one guy,
he acted his computer and he,

1701
01:34:21.251 --> 01:34:24.220
as he was recording the video off his computer camera,

1702
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:29.320
he has all these videos of the guy picking his nose and doing other things,
uh,

1703
01:34:29.321 --> 01:34:34.300
that men tend to do in front of their,
their,
uh,
computers.
I'm not gonna

1704
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:37.470
<v 6>say what it is,
but you can assume videos of this guy beating off.</v>

1705
01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:41.250
<v 3>Yeah.
And,
and he actually brought this stuff to them as,
as part of is,
you know,</v>

1706
01:34:41.251 --> 01:34:43.310
look what we have on you now.
Reveal the other end.

1707
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.860
<v 6>Wow.
So just so you know,</v>

1708
01:34:46.861 --> 01:34:50.420
I would note what was the guy doing?
Like what was the worthy,

1709
01:34:50.421 --> 01:34:52.770
they so interested in him for?
Well,
we'll,

1710
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:57.680
<v 3>um,
it was,
it had to do with,
uh,
uh,
legal dispute with a firm.</v>

1711
01:34:57.710 --> 01:34:58.100
But

1712
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.980
<v 5>something to know is that,
um,
you know,</v>

1713
01:35:00.981 --> 01:35:04.460
as that anyone can access your computer at any time.

1714
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:09.490
So to be the by class we just start shaving a little bit better or crazy.

1715
01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:14.330
How long has this technology been available?
Oh Gosh.
For years.
We're just,

1716
01:35:14.331 --> 01:35:15.320
anytime I figure,

1717
01:35:15.321 --> 01:35:18.770
anytime you find out about security technology or hacking technology has been

1718
01:35:18.771 --> 01:35:19.640
out for years,

1719
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:23.210
sometimes decades since her mom finding out about the iPad or something.

1720
01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:25.790
<v 0>That's so crazy and scary.</v>

1721
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:29.690
How many people do you think that they've done that and lawsuits and stuff like

1722
01:35:29.691 --> 01:35:34.250
that way and people just shut up about it because they have photos of them in

1723
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:35.090
front of the computer?

1724
01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:39.080
<v 5>Well,
I think that's what's so scary for people about this new NSA facility that</v>

1725
01:35:39.081 --> 01:35:43.640
they're building.
The next thing I want to talk to you about,
bluffed,
Dale,
Utah.

1726
01:35:43.641 --> 01:35:46.220
If anyone wants to take a vacation for your civil rights,

1727
01:35:46.221 --> 01:35:49.810
that's where you should go.
You know,
tell everybody what that is.
Uh,

1728
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:54.290
they're building a $2 billion domestic spying facility,
uh,
to,

1729
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.380
to literally gather your information and you and your communications.

1730
01:35:57.381 --> 01:35:59.900
And most people say,
I always hear this over and over.
Well,

1731
01:35:59.901 --> 01:36:03.230
I'm not doing nothing wrong.
You know,
it doesn't matter if they're monitoring me.

1732
01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:07.400
It does matter because they're going to have a file on you for your entire life

1733
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:08.440
of communication.

1734
01:36:08.441 --> 01:36:13.441
So say one day you do something that upset someone or say potentially a

1735
01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.690
potential employers hack into this database.
Okay.

1736
01:36:17.691 --> 01:36:19.970
So we want to find out what job's been up to over the years.

1737
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:23.750
What we see based on his phone,
gps records that he tends to,
uh,

1738
01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.610
visit the casino too much.

1739
01:36:25.611 --> 01:36:30.611
So we don't want to hire him or we also see he's not religious or we see that,

1740
01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.910
you know,
he's been visiting an oncologist and he potentially has cancer,

1741
01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:35.611
so we don't want to,

1742
01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:37.850
we don't want to hire him for those health insurance reasons.

1743
01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:42.500
It is dangerous to allow the government to collect this kind of information on

1744
01:36:42.501 --> 01:36:43.131
its citizens.

1745
01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:47.210
Any of that information can be used down the road to blackmail you or keep you

1746
01:36:47.211 --> 01:36:50.930
from whistle blowing or as a journalist keep me from leaking a story or keep me

1747
01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:54.640
from even having the story in general because they know no way to track them on.

1748
01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:58.950
<v 0>Do you think there's a way that they can ever stop everything from being public</v>

1749
01:36:58.951 --> 01:37:02.100
information?
Because it seems to me that that's the trend.

1750
01:37:02.130 --> 01:37:07.130
It seems to privacy as slowly eroding and it doesn't seem to just be like one

1751
01:37:08.311 --> 01:37:09.870
group of people that has access.

1752
01:37:09.871 --> 01:37:14.100
It seems to be that there's going to be a point in time where everybody's going

1753
01:37:14.101 --> 01:37:17.490
to have access.
That technology is going to really,

1754
01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.970
it's going to bypass boundaries.
There's going to be no boundaries anymore.

1755
01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.040
<v 5>Yeah.
We're almost getting to that point.
I know as an investigative reporter now,</v>

1756
01:37:25.041 --> 01:37:27.920
we kind of,
a lot of us do things the old fashioned way.

1757
01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:31.970
We write things in notebooks now or just remember things because we can't,

1758
01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:35.610
I can't trust.
Oh,
I just dropped it.
Well now it's broken.
Um,

1759
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:38.180
you're sending your tracking device.
I can't,

1760
01:37:38.181 --> 01:37:40.100
I can't trust my tracking device and I can't,

1761
01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:44.120
I can't trust that this hasn't been hacked into.
Or

1762
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:46.860
<v 0>do you have an android phone?
Because you can take the battery out.</v>

1763
01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.860
<v 5>Yeah,
I got rid of my iPhone specifically because of that,</v>

1764
01:37:49.861 --> 01:37:53.370
because I went through six iPhone.
So that's one thing about it.

1765
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:57.630
I went through six them because of those reasons.
I'd meet resources.

1766
01:37:57.631 --> 01:38:00.750
They said what you have to give her to that phone or um,
you know,

1767
01:38:00.751 --> 01:38:04.560
I had weird things.
Um,
so I,
yeah,
I don't,

1768
01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:06.780
I use the android system now

1769
01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.830
<v 4>you are living a very non stereotypical 29 year old girl.</v>

1770
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:15.400
You're the,
you're liking a crazy movie.
I mean you're,

1771
01:38:15.401 --> 01:38:20.080
you're going to foreign countries and exposing things and removing cell phone

1772
01:38:20.081 --> 01:38:23.620
batteries and you're worried about being spied on,
covering your,
your,

1773
01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.890
your lens of your laptop.
Like what a weird world we live in.

1774
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:28.410
What a weird world you live.

1775
01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:32.380
<v 5>I know.
It is strange,
but that's,
I mean,
that's unfortunately,</v>

1776
01:38:32.381 --> 01:38:35.020
that's the way it's become the reality.
It's become press journalists.

1777
01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.880
I even know journalists now who are contemplating leaving the United States and

1778
01:38:39.881 --> 01:38:43.760
go,
where,
where would you go?
I,
um,
I,

1779
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:48.640
I don't want to say want to keep it on the DL.
I'll tell you where I'm going.

1780
01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:53.500
Vancouver,
Vancouver,
I,
Columbia,
Montreal,
Vancouver.

1781
01:38:53.501 --> 01:38:58.501
I've heard a lot of people I know they're called a source of mine in a

1782
01:38:58.661 --> 01:39:01.330
documentary I'm doing,
went to Canada.
You know,

1783
01:39:01.331 --> 01:39:06.331
a lot of people are people and that are planning where they're going to go.

1784
01:39:06.911 --> 01:39:10.950
If things get really bad,
would say Canada.
Toronto is amazing.

1785
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:15.300
I love Canada.
I want to know what her secret spot is though.
She's not.

1786
01:39:17.210 --> 01:39:20.260
When the apocalypse hits,
you can't live with her.
Okay.

1787
01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:25.360
I don't need anybody guards.
I don't need,
no.
Uh,
I don't,
you know,

1788
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:29.290
because I haven't,
I,
I've been thinking about it and I don't quite know.

1789
01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.153
I don't know.

1790
01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.150
I think for me it's almost too much to handle the thought of having to leave.

1791
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.280
Um,
but for especially investigative journalists after the NDA pass,

1792
01:39:39.281 --> 01:39:43.090
that's a reality for all of us because we're going to piss people off and the

1793
01:39:43.091 --> 01:39:47.580
government.
So how are they going to come after us,
you know?
Um,
and,

1794
01:39:47.650 --> 01:39:52.090
and why did you pick Canada?
Why,
why was that your a,
your choice to Vancouver?

1795
01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:53.013
I love it up there.

1796
01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.310
<v 4>Yeah,
go there all the time.
I do a lot of gigs in Canada.</v>

1797
01:39:56.550 --> 01:40:00.900
I probably more popular in Canada than I am in America podcast.
The podcast is,

1798
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.520
we're regularly in the top three in the iTunes,
in the comedy section in America.

1799
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:09.630
But in Canada,
we're regularly number one at all the podcasts.
It's weird.

1800
01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:12.090
We have a crazy following in Canada.
We were just in Toronto.

1801
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:14.880
I did Massey Hall in Toronto.
It was amazing.
It was crazy.

1802
01:40:14.881 --> 01:40:18.510
The fucking people are so nice.
There's 20% less douche bags up there.

1803
01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:22.260
The streets are way cleaner.
Everything is cleaner.

1804
01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:25.710
You see people like sweeping up and cleaning things.
They're just,

1805
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:28.960
it's a better country.
It's,
they're not greedy assholes.

1806
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.700
It's a completely different vibe.
The way you interact with people.

1807
01:40:32.701 --> 01:40:35.910
They don't have the same expectations as Americans do.
They don't have to.
Same,

1808
01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:39.960
the same point of view,
the same arrogance.
It's just a completely different vibe.

1809
01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.860
It's like someone took America and said,
you've got to,

1810
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.740
we kind of remove some of the continents out of Americans and try,

1811
01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:48.570
let's try another civilization.
Let's try this.

1812
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:52.560
This civilization that's not trying to overthrow the world.
They look the same.

1813
01:40:52.561 --> 01:40:54.020
They talk the,
I think I'm may escape

1814
01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:58.600
<v 5>to North Korea.
I think that's the goal.
Go to.
Yeah.
That's good.
Why North Korea?</v>

1815
01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.620
He's being silly.
Yeah,
that's,
there's another place.

1816
01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:05.800
If we really cared about human rights,
why aren't we in Mexico and North Korea?

1817
01:41:05.801 --> 01:41:09.220
Those are two places were really would be a cracking down and that's why

1818
01:41:09.221 --> 01:41:12.450
everyone needs to wake up because we're being led into a war with Iran.
I,

1819
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.000
the writing's on the wall and it's a rock number two.
And instead of this time,

1820
01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:20.320
it's with Iran and Iran has some pretty tough allies in China and Russia,

1821
01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.680
and the American public is being fed bs and we're being led into Iran by the

1822
01:41:25.901 --> 01:41:29.090
same forces that led us into a rock.
And we need to wake up because it's,
it's,

1823
01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:33.250
it's going to happen soon.
And,
um,
and because we,
I mean,

1824
01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:37.540
all you have to do this is everyone's test.
Just turn on,
turn on the news,

1825
01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:41.350
the mainstream outlets,
CNN,
ABC,
CBS,
and Fox.

1826
01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.900
And you're going to see a constant demonization of Iran.

1827
01:41:43.901 --> 01:41:47.230
Not that they don't deserve it,
but based on everything happening here,
it's,

1828
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:49.690
it's absurd.
What do they deserve it for?

1829
01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:55.590
Iran is doing anything bad.
What is it?
I think that,
you know,
a,

1830
01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.620
you have Aquaman,
Dennis,
John,

1831
01:41:56.621 --> 01:42:00.340
who doesn't have traditional western beliefs when it comes to homosexuality.

1832
01:42:00.341 --> 01:42:04.360
And also,
you know,
there is a beef they have with Israel.

1833
01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:09.310
That being said,
what he's been doing his for Toric,
he's been talking,
okay,

1834
01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.370
we don't just go and attack every single leader because of their,

1835
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:16.870
they're insane rhetorical or we would be in every country including Mexico and

1836
01:42:16.871 --> 01:42:18.400
we're not.
And so,

1837
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:22.060
so now you have to sit back and now that you can pull yourself away and first

1838
01:42:22.061 --> 01:42:24.370
step to recognizing what's happening is,

1839
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:28.030
is to know that you're being fed propaganda.
And once you know that,

1840
01:42:28.031 --> 01:42:32.080
then you can stand back and you can analyze it intelligently and realize,
I mean,

1841
01:42:32.081 --> 01:42:34.420
look at the movies we have coming out,
Argo,

1842
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.280
you think that is just coming out randomly,
Ben Affleck movie.

1843
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:45.040
It's on a hostage situation that's going on in Iran.
I mean,

1844
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:48.160
look at the timing of that.
Call me a conspiracy theorist.

1845
01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:49.540
I think this is systematic.

1846
01:42:49.541 --> 01:42:54.230
I think the public is systematically being fed fear of Iran.
How's that?

1847
01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:58.750
A Ben Affleck,
a CIA agent,
that work it is,
um,

1848
01:42:59.410 --> 01:43:01.360
it's,
it's that,
uh,

1849
01:43:01.361 --> 01:43:05.500
Americans were taken hostage and Iran and so it,
so,

1850
01:43:05.501 --> 01:43:07.870
and in the end,
maybe it's a heroic movie,

1851
01:43:07.871 --> 01:43:12.160
but in the end you also feel you have a fear of Iran.

1852
01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:16.420
It's going to put a fear of a Ron and everyone that goes and sees that,
um,

1853
01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:19.270
and,
uh,
that's a government plot

1854
01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:25.330
that they thought would be timely.
I mean,
maybe they,
maybe they thought that,

1855
01:43:25.331 --> 01:43:27.490
but regardless,
it's going to have an effect of,

1856
01:43:27.491 --> 01:43:31.420
of people that leave that theater are going to have more of a fear of Iran,
uh,

1857
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.770
instilled in them at a time where the news is constantly demonizing Iran at a

1858
01:43:35.771 --> 01:43:40.630
time where we're about to potentially approved military action on the country.

1859
01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:43.830
Contrary to popular belief,
the,

1860
01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.840
the youth of Iran are very westernized in a lot of ways and they are not happy

1861
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:52.160
with the way

1862
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:55.910
<v 0>that their country is portrayed.
They're not happy with,
with the,</v>

1863
01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:00.840
the whole situation.
The situation of,
uh,
you know,
the way Iran treats its,

1864
01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:05.600
uh,
its foreign policy.
The,
the,
the young people there,
they're very Americanized.

1865
01:44:05.601 --> 01:44:07.490
There's a lot of that going on there.
Yeah.
You know,

1866
01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:09.940
you see them in the universities and you see the,

1867
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:11.960
the different protests as they have over there.

1868
01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:15.830
It's really strange to think that you buy a shitty roll of the dice.

1869
01:44:15.831 --> 01:44:16.670
Could have been born there.

1870
01:44:16.671 --> 01:44:20.060
I could have been born there and we could be a part of this youth movement

1871
01:44:20.061 --> 01:44:23.240
that's trying to figure out why the fuck this country is so crazy.
Why?

1872
01:44:23.241 --> 01:44:26.390
Why are we trapped in this crazy empire with this wacky,

1873
01:44:26.391 --> 01:44:30.800
a minute jot guy out there speaking for us overseas,
making a mockery.

1874
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:34.040
I mean he seems like a character chore,
Bad Guy.

1875
01:44:34.041 --> 01:44:36.740
He seems like we gave him the script and we're like,
listen dude,

1876
01:44:36.741 --> 01:44:39.140
first thing you want to do is say there's no gains and Iran.
He's like,

1877
01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:42.080
let's put posters.
Yeah,
I know it was preposterous,
but we want you to say it.

1878
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:45.830
There's no gays in Iran.
I mean,
he's like a cartoonish bad guy.

1879
01:44:45.831 --> 01:44:48.890
Like the stuff he talks about it.
It's so stupid.
It's like,

1880
01:44:48.891 --> 01:44:53.350
how did you get to be the guy who talks when that's the shit that you're saying?

1881
01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.350
<v 5>And,
and that's also the way the media,
I mean,</v>

1882
01:44:55.351 --> 01:44:57.960
if you also look at the media has covered,
it's not that I'm defending him,

1883
01:44:57.961 --> 01:45:01.620
but the media tends to pick up on only cover those kinds of situations.

1884
01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.180
They don't cover the times when,
when he's speaking intelligently,
right.
Course.

1885
01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.690
And that's what's,
that's what's dangerous too is because we're not giving,

1886
01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:12.120
given the whole,
the whole story,
I'm trying to get an interview with him now.

1887
01:45:12.610 --> 01:45:15.450
I want to sit with him and a,
and I have a not,

1888
01:45:15.451 --> 01:45:17.400
well now that I mentioned it'll probably be stopped,

1889
01:45:17.401 --> 01:45:20.130
but I want to sit down with him and I want to get to the bottom of a lot of

1890
01:45:20.131 --> 01:45:21.470
these situations with,

1891
01:45:21.471 --> 01:45:24.210
with the whole wiping Israel off the map and in other situations,

1892
01:45:24.211 --> 01:45:28.980
because I can't trust that we've been fed the correct story on that,
uh,
through,

1893
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:32.510
through the mainstream media.
I mean it,

1894
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:36.920
the situation now is that even the other day Hockman dinners,

1895
01:45:36.921 --> 01:45:39.730
God was speaking in front of the UN and uh,

1896
01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.060
there's a video on the Internet now of,
um,

1897
01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:45.930
CNN cut him off and then the reporters started talking over him at a point when

1898
01:45:45.931 --> 01:45:47.640
he was talking about the fact that these countries,

1899
01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:50.400
all the countries could get together and get along peacefully.

1900
01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.240
He was talking about the potential for peace and said they went in and cut them

1901
01:45:54.241 --> 01:45:58.000
off and then,
oh yeah,
yeah,
listened to him and now he's trying to do this and,

1902
01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:02.610
and really demonizing him.
And in journalistically you,
you can't just do that.

1903
01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:06.960
And they didn't give him his fair share.
So maybe he's not quite as insane as,

1904
01:46:06.961 --> 01:46:10.200
as we've been led to believe.
There are many forces,

1905
01:46:10.201 --> 01:46:15.201
very powerful forces that want you to hate him and think he's freaking nuts so

1906
01:46:15.601 --> 01:46:18.240
that it justifies us going in and attacking him.

1907
01:46:18.570 --> 01:46:21.030
And when you start to realize that and look back at the Info you,

1908
01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:24.960
you realize you may be not being fed that the whole,
the whole picture here.

1909
01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:29.450
<v 0>Knowing what you know and being in the position that you are,
you,
you know,</v>

1910
01:46:29.451 --> 01:46:34.451
being a person who is behind the scenes at a major news outlet like CNN and you

1911
01:46:34.761 --> 01:46:38.870
get to see sort of the,
the strings that that hold the puppets up.

1912
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:41.030
Is there a way to fix this?

1913
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:46.270
Is there a way to the turn this ship around and sort of write America or is this

1914
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:50.130
a constant protest until we fall

1915
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.650
<v 4>off the face of the earth and have a nuclear war?
Is it,</v>

1916
01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:57.180
do we just scream and throw our hands up and pout and yell and scream until they

1917
01:46:57.181 --> 01:46:59.580
launched the missiles and that wipes us all out?

1918
01:46:59.581 --> 01:47:02.370
Or is it possible that with education,

1919
01:47:02.371 --> 01:47:05.400
with the distribution of information that's available today with,
you know,

1920
01:47:05.530 --> 01:47:08.670
people like us talking about it with people that are young,

1921
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:13.460
like David Seaman growing up and becoming political leaders,
these is,

1922
01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:18.500
is it possible that we can write this thing that what we have is a group of

1923
01:47:19.261 --> 01:47:22.350
people that are in control of this country that really came from another era.

1924
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:26.650
They came from an era of no disclosure.
They came from an era where,
you know,

1925
01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:28.140
Watergate happened every now and then,

1926
01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:30.960
but really it was because they wanted to catch them.
You know,

1927
01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:33.390
there's plenty of information that they have on everybody.

1928
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.510
Let's just keep this thing going.
The along the way,
it's always gone along.

1929
01:47:36.810 --> 01:47:37.760
I mean,
is it,
is it,

1930
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.800
is it possible that we can end this era and move into an era of transparency,

1931
01:47:43.561 --> 01:47:48.210
move into an era where people who are the leaders of this country are doing it

1932
01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:49.290
for the right reasons.

1933
01:47:49.291 --> 01:47:52.650
They're doing it because they truly are patriotic because they truly believe in

1934
01:47:52.651 --> 01:47:56.640
that.
The real ideals that we liked.
When we think of ourselves in the best light,

1935
01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:58.980
those ideals,
the ideals of being an American,

1936
01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:02.700
they can actually bring us more in line,

1937
01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:06.090
bring our actions more in line with that.
Is that possible?

1938
01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:11.540
<v 5>It's only possible if people have access to information,
um,
and,
and in,</v>

1939
01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:15.790
in a way that can compete with the main stream.
Um,
and,

1940
01:48:15.791 --> 01:48:17.230
and that doesn't quite exist yet.

1941
01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:21.730
There are a lot of strong forces outside your,
your show,

1942
01:48:21.731 --> 01:48:26.620
Alex Jones.
Um,
and,
and other,
uh,
entities that are,

1943
01:48:26.650 --> 01:48:27.910
that are actually bringing out,

1944
01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:31.060
talking about these things at the mainstream isn't talking about Nda.

1945
01:48:31.150 --> 01:48:33.580
I'm all these other issues affecting our civil liberties.

1946
01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:38.710
If those forces can't compete and get the message out just as loudly as the

1947
01:48:38.711 --> 01:48:41.530
mainstream,
then,
then I don't,

1948
01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:44.060
I don't know what direction this country is headed in,
but we need,

1949
01:48:44.061 --> 01:48:47.440
we need that information.
That information is power and it's,

1950
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:51.640
it's definitely not getting to the masses,
um,
quite yet.

1951
01:48:52.090 --> 01:48:54.640
But if we get to a point where we can compete with,

1952
01:48:54.670 --> 01:48:58.360
with the mainstream and and really get,
get this information out,

1953
01:48:58.361 --> 01:48:59.830
then people will be enlightened and they'll,

1954
01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.040
and they'll know when things are happening and,

1955
01:49:02.041 --> 01:49:04.540
and can make a difference and actually look for solutions.

1956
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:06.890
<v 4>The real question is how long can they hold that off for?</v>

1957
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.810
Is it possible that they can fight that off with shit like Nda with all these

1958
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:16.910
passing,
these sweeping bills about controlling the internet,

1959
01:49:16.911 --> 01:49:21.911
the Sopa type bills that they keep force feeding and pushing through it.

1960
01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:22.490
You know,

1961
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:26.060
how long can they really stop that from happening because it seems like this is

1962
01:49:26.061 --> 01:49:29.720
a new era to me.
It seems like when I talked to people today,
like what?

1963
01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.440
I can mention this,
when I spoke with David Seaman,
when we,

1964
01:49:32.441 --> 01:49:35.900
we had him on the show,
it's like,
I didn't know anything when I was your age.

1965
01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:39.560
I was like,
he's 26 years old.
I was like,
Dude,
when I was 26 I was retarded.

1966
01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.290
I didn't know anything about the way the world goes.
And you hear,

1967
01:49:42.291 --> 01:49:44.120
you are educating me on things.
You're,

1968
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:47.170
you're completely immersed in the way this country is being run.

1969
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:49.810
The corruption of lobbyists and corporations,

1970
01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:54.250
corporate influence on w w the way we do everything from grow our food to

1971
01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:57.620
extract oil.
Is this a new era?
I mean,
are,

1972
01:49:57.621 --> 01:50:02.290
are we dealing with this new wave of people who are informed,

1973
01:50:02.291 --> 01:50:06.850
who are growing into adulthood to push these old douche bags out of office?

1974
01:50:06.851 --> 01:50:07.684
I mean,

1975
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:10.960
is that what's going to happen or are we going to blow ourselves up before we

1976
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:15.961
get there are these old old fuck heads hanging on by kitty cat claws on a

1977
01:50:16.571 --> 01:50:18.880
curtain just barely hanging on.

1978
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:23.710
They hit the red button and the whole thing gets wiped back to 10,000 years ago.

1979
01:50:23.711 --> 01:50:24.544
Again,

1980
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:27.220
<v 5>I am an optimist,</v>

1981
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:31.990
so I hope that's not our future in our future,
uh,
plans.
But I,

1982
01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.160
I think that,
that the way things are going now,

1983
01:50:36.161 --> 01:50:37.810
we're not in control of our country.

1984
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:41.330
The people of America are not in cool wheels specifically.
Well,

1985
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:45.040
that's a good question because obviously it's not the presidency because

1986
01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:50.041
otherwise NDA wouldn't have been passed and we wouldn't have this ridiculous war

1987
01:50:50.411 --> 01:50:54.000
on,
on whistleblowers.
And journalists who went to improve the country.

1988
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:56.110
<v 4>So you think the presidency has,</v>

1989
01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:59.800
that's definitely not within what they're looking for?

1990
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.880
<v 5>Um,
no.
And,
and I think that,
um,
I,
because it can't be anymore.</v>

1991
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:07.730
I mean if Obama passed a signed NDA with,

1992
01:51:07.731 --> 01:51:11.960
with those kind of provisions to be able to detain a American citizens without

1993
01:51:11.961 --> 01:51:14.820
trial,
that violates the Fifth Amendment,
uh,

1994
01:51:15.770 --> 01:51:18.740
it's no longer in on behalf of the people.

1995
01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:20.870
I don't think they're making decisions on behalf of the people.

1996
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:24.020
You have some people that speculate who's really in control.

1997
01:51:24.021 --> 01:51:28.770
Some people say the Federal Reserve,
uh,
that,
that worries them significantly.
Uh,

1998
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:30.710
that's where we borrow most of our money.

1999
01:51:30.711 --> 01:51:33.080
No one really knows who's in charge of the Federal Reserve.

2000
01:51:33.081 --> 01:51:35.800
Some people say they're the ones pulling the strings.
Um,

2001
01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:40.250
you hear all these conspiracy theories.
Um,
but,
but one thing's for sure is,

2002
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:42.560
is the people of the United States.

2003
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:47.060
I feel personally based on my last 10 years of really getting behind the scenes

2004
01:51:47.061 --> 01:51:51.800
and investigating,
uh,
all of these major disasters we've had in the country,

2005
01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.350
the people are no longer in control.

2006
01:51:54.351 --> 01:51:57.710
Decisions are not being made on behalf of the people.

2007
01:51:57.890 --> 01:52:00.650
If decisions are being made on behalf of the people,
the United States,

2008
01:52:00.651 --> 01:52:02.810
we would not be about to be entering Iran.

2009
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:07.040
We would be taking that money and giving it toward education and health care and

2010
01:52:07.041 --> 01:52:10.460
improving the economy.
If decisions were being made on behalf of the people,

2011
01:52:10.461 --> 01:52:13.340
we'd be going after the bankers that got us in this mess.

2012
01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.170
<v 4>What's staggering to me is that if you look at what we're doing overseas,</v>

2013
01:52:17.171 --> 01:52:20.520
where we're spending all this money,
this,
a lot of the,

2014
01:52:20.521 --> 01:52:23.310
the contracts that have gone to Halliburton for reconstruction,

2015
01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:26.740
a lot of the different desalination plants they have over there,

2016
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:32.070
we could have easily had businesses profiting off of government contracts to fix

2017
01:52:33.191 --> 01:52:37.960
our infrastructure,
to fix our bad communities,
to fix our impoverished places,

2018
01:52:37.961 --> 01:52:41.530
to try to heal up America.
I've always said that the best way,

2019
01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:46.490
if you want to make America better,
the best way to do it is make less losers.

2020
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:51.740
Right?
So the way to make less than later,
you got to go after you.

2021
01:52:51.741 --> 01:52:53.600
You have to try to help children.

2022
01:52:53.630 --> 01:52:58.630
You have to try to brace poor neighborhoods and try to prop them up and try to

2023
01:52:59.241 --> 01:53:01.250
figure out a way to,
you know,

2024
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:06.310
to bring some sort of economic prosperity to that area in education.

2025
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:10.340
Help people work,
give them role models you get,
there's,

2026
01:53:10.341 --> 01:53:14.360
there's money to be made and their satisfaction to be gained from the people

2027
01:53:14.361 --> 01:53:15.590
that could help those people.

2028
01:53:15.591 --> 01:53:19.730
That's like a beautiful human experience of helping people out and propping them

2029
01:53:19.731 --> 01:53:23.510
up.
And it can be profitable because these is going to have to,

2030
01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:25.280
there's guys that have to spend money doing that,

2031
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:28.640
so corporations are gonna make money.
Tax dollars will go there.

2032
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:32.900
It seems like it's just sort of a redistribution for,
you know,
of,

2033
01:53:32.901 --> 01:53:36.800
of the way we're spending our money from spending it on war to spending it on

2034
01:53:36.801 --> 01:53:39.680
love.
And it seems like there's money in love too,

2035
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:44.360
but we've been tricked into thinking there's only money in war and to think that

2036
01:53:44.361 --> 01:53:48.440
all of our resources and everything that we have and everything that we project

2037
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:52.430
can only be profitable if we're killing people.
That seems crazy.

2038
01:53:52.431 --> 01:53:53.300
It seems like that's just,
no,

2039
01:53:53.301 --> 01:53:58.220
that's just the way we've always been doing it and in viewing the world as one

2040
01:53:58.221 --> 01:54:00.410
giant community,
which I think is inevitable.

2041
01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.560
I'm pretty sure if you just look at the way things are going,

2042
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:05.450
the exponential growth,
it's inevitable.

2043
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:09.340
It's inevitable that we will be just one big world community.
Well,

2044
01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.550
that's what we've got to do.
It's real simple.
If we want to live and enjoy life,

2045
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:17.600
which I assume everyone does,
we'd want to enjoy this life.

2046
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:22.700
The only way we can enjoy this life is if there's the smallest amount of people

2047
01:54:22.701 --> 01:54:25.510
possible that are not enjoying it.
Small,
small,

2048
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:29.180
the smallest amount of people in despair that that,
that it's manageable.

2049
01:54:29.181 --> 01:54:31.940
The smallest amount of you're always going to have a certain amount of losers.

2050
01:54:31.941 --> 01:54:34.490
He always going to have a certain amount.
As long as there's variables,

2051
01:54:34.491 --> 01:54:37.490
as long as there is you could do,
you could go left whenever you want to go,

2052
01:54:37.491 --> 01:54:39.800
right?
We're just going to be mistakes.
There's going to be chaos,

2053
01:54:39.801 --> 01:54:42.080
which were human,
human or humans are nuts.

2054
01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:45.350
But if we could drop that to the tiny,

2055
01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:50.060
minuscule number and the amount of oppressed people make it as small as

2056
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:50.840
possible,

2057
01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.960
the amount of people with no opportunity to make it as small as possible,

2058
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:56.900
then we can have a beautiful world for everybody.

2059
01:54:57.350 --> 01:55:01.670
But we're not going to get that by supporting Bahrain.

2060
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:06.560
We're not going to get that by,
by guarding poppy fields and Afghanistan.

2061
01:55:06.561 --> 01:55:09.320
We're not going to get that by multibillion dollar,

2062
01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:11.330
no bid contracts for Halliburton.

2063
01:55:11.331 --> 01:55:14.300
That is not how we're going to get there we are.

2064
01:55:14.301 --> 01:55:18.830
That's the last gasps of a dying empire of Douche bags.

2065
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:20.750
You know?
And that's what I really,

2066
01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:24.440
when I look at this country and when I look at like all these people that are

2067
01:55:24.441 --> 01:55:28.070
speaking out,
when I look at people like you,
I see real patriotism.

2068
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:31.640
When I see people like Alex,
you can tell I call Alex Jones crazy all day.

2069
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:35.270
I love that guy.
And he's a fucking patriot and he's a real patriot.

2070
01:55:35.271 --> 01:55:39.770
And what he wants isn't not to expose corruption and conspiracy everywhere he

2071
01:55:39.771 --> 01:55:42.080
goes.
What he wants is for all the stop.

2072
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:47.350
He wants to run this country with a real sense of morals.

2073
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:52.830
We should be run by true.
More or less,

2074
01:55:52.831 --> 01:55:56.940
we'd be who should be run by people who feel responsible for their actions,

2075
01:55:56.941 --> 01:55:58.540
who feel that the,

2076
01:55:58.541 --> 01:56:03.090
the repercussions of the decisions that they make should be as positive as

2077
01:56:03.091 --> 01:56:06.510
possible.
And we should be a nation of heroes.

2078
01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:11.490
We should lead the world as a nation of heroes instead of marauders.

2079
01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:12.420
Know,

2080
01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:14.570
<v 5>do people deserve better?
You know,
I,</v>

2081
01:56:14.571 --> 01:56:17.820
I've twirled deserves better world deserves better.
Yes,

2082
01:56:17.850 --> 01:56:19.590
the world deserves to know that,

2083
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.140
that people are going to be in the best interest.

2084
01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:27.570
<v 4>We need to know that we can be run by the best possible examples of humanity and</v>

2085
01:56:30.101 --> 01:56:31.360
that we,

2086
01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:36.280
we could encounter the best possible examples of humanity in every single

2087
01:56:36.281 --> 01:56:39.250
country.
If people just rise,

2088
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:41.880
if people just get their fucking shit together,
you,

2089
01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:44.530
you unanimously all across the board.

2090
01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:48.410
If we can figure out a way to truly enlightened and the way to do this,

2091
01:56:48.411 --> 01:56:51.310
as with mushrooms,
see what we're doing right now,
ladies and gentlemen,
we're,

2092
01:56:51.311 --> 01:56:54.610
we're,
we're fucking around and we're trying to do it on our own.

2093
01:56:54.611 --> 01:56:56.200
And it's too goddamn hard.

2094
01:56:56.201 --> 01:57:01.180
You only get so far with a yoga class every six months that you squeeze in after

2095
01:57:01.181 --> 01:57:04.930
Starbucks,
a fucking heart attack when you're bending over and warrior posts.

2096
01:57:05.710 --> 01:57:09.590
I think we need mushrooms and we need them now.
We need them from outerspace.

2097
01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:13.430
We need them to just drop down just well,

2098
01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:17.830
we need something.
We need an enlightenment.
We need,

2099
01:57:17.831 --> 01:57:21.040
we need the next stage of enlightenment.
We surely do.

2100
01:57:21.490 --> 01:57:22.960
And it seems inevitable.

2101
01:57:22.961 --> 01:57:25.720
And it seems like there's a battle going on and there's a lot of people that

2102
01:57:25.721 --> 01:57:27.930
believe that you can't have the,

2103
01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:32.230
the true push and momentum of enlightenment and less this resistance against it.

2104
01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:36.650
It said,
our whole,
our,
our entire nature is that we,

2105
01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:41.660
we really don't achieve what we can achieve unless there's resistance.
And so we,

2106
01:57:41.661 --> 01:57:46.661
we still have somehow in our alpha male primate DNA,

2107
01:57:47.170 --> 01:57:51.130
this desire to conquer and this desire to,
uh,
to,
uh,

2108
01:57:51.131 --> 01:57:52.300
fight against oppression,

2109
01:57:52.301 --> 01:57:56.260
this desire to rise against the enemy and compete against your,
your fellow man.

2110
01:57:56.261 --> 01:57:59.440
And it's almost like a lot of people believe that the only way for people to

2111
01:57:59.441 --> 01:58:03.550
truly achieve enlightenment is to see a Holocaust,

2112
01:58:03.551 --> 01:58:05.410
is to see an inquisition,

2113
01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:08.890
is to see like the horrific possibilities of humanity.

2114
01:58:08.891 --> 01:58:11.560
So it gives us something to not be,
you know,

2115
01:58:11.561 --> 01:58:15.610
it gives us something to rise against.
You know,
I think that's the past though.

2116
01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:20.620
I think.
I think really the future,
I think we were living in a weird world award.

2117
01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:23.800
We're living in a world that has changed a lot more than we're aware of and it's

2118
01:58:23.801 --> 01:58:25.810
slowly starting to creep up on us

2119
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:31.550
<v 5>enemy.
I mean,
who knows if,
if we've already missed this,
the warning signs.</v>

2120
01:58:31.551 --> 01:58:35.480
But that's why people need to take it so seriously when we have NDAs past and

2121
01:58:35.481 --> 01:58:39.450
when we see police dressed like judge Dredd.
Yeah.
You know,

2122
01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.520
I mean this wake up,
look what's happening

2123
01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:47.260
<v 3>on our streets of this country.
We think of 10 years ago,</v>

2124
01:58:47.261 --> 01:58:51.040
if you saw those police officers dressed like judge Dredd standing in front of a

2125
01:58:51.041 --> 01:58:52.480
protest in front of Walmart,

2126
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:57.040
intimidating a bunch of older individuals who are unarmed.
Yeah.

2127
01:58:57.090 --> 01:58:58.080
And it is scary.

2128
01:58:58.200 --> 01:58:59.790
<v 4>And it all could've been avoided.</v>

2129
01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:02.310
It all could've been avoided if the police were different.

2130
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:05.490
It all could have been avoided if that kid was not shot in front of everybody in

2131
01:59:05.491 --> 01:59:06.324
broad daylight.

2132
01:59:06.570 --> 01:59:09.840
It all could've been avoided if the police reacted to it differently.

2133
01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:13.890
Everything could have been avoided.
Instead,
it's,
fuck you.

2134
01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:18.270
You do as we say,
or we're going to bring in tanks and dogs and rubber bullets,

2135
01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:21.720
and that's not America.
Well,
it's not.
It's you're being lazy.

2136
01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.530
You're doing it the wrong way.
You're trying to just control things and you're,

2137
01:59:25.531 --> 01:59:26.370
you're,
you're,

2138
01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:31.380
you're not doing it the way that an enlightened society and culture would handle

2139
01:59:31.471 --> 01:59:35.460
it.
You're not.
And,
and that means that's the enemy,
that,

2140
01:59:35.461 --> 01:59:36.660
that type of behavior.

2141
01:59:36.690 --> 01:59:39.720
They'd marching down the streets and shooting bullets down the alley.
That's,

2142
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.560
that's the enemy.
That's the enemy at home.
And the people that are doing it,

2143
01:59:43.561 --> 01:59:45.690
they think that they're doing well.
They think they're doing good.

2144
01:59:45.691 --> 01:59:47.190
They think they're doing their,
their job.

2145
01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:50.130
And that's what's really fucked up about it.
It's like by,

2146
01:59:50.250 --> 01:59:52.650
by the fact that someone gives them the green light,

2147
01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.980
they feel like they're in the right,
you know,
well this fucker protesters,

2148
01:59:55.981 --> 01:59:59.280
you start breaking the law and I'll stop shooting rubber bullets at their face.

2149
01:59:59.281 --> 02:00:01.190
Like it's,
you know,

2150
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:05.190
just because somebody wrote something down on a piece of paper doesn't mean that

2151
02:00:05.191 --> 02:00:06.900
Shit's right.
You know?
I mean,

2152
02:00:06.930 --> 02:00:10.200
there's a lot of shit that's written down on paper that doesn't make any sense.

2153
02:00:10.201 --> 02:00:14.400
And one of the things is that you're somehow allowed to bring tanks into a city

2154
02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:18.420
and guys with machine guns because a kid got shot in the back.

2155
02:00:18.450 --> 02:00:20.520
That's not the way you're supposed to handle that situation.

2156
02:00:20.521 --> 02:00:24.360
That's not the way an enlightened being in handles their society and their

2157
02:00:24.361 --> 02:00:27.510
culture.
And that is where we are right now.
We are,

2158
02:00:27.511 --> 02:00:31.230
we're at a up a pass and human nature.

2159
02:00:31.231 --> 02:00:33.360
We were at a a bridge.

2160
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:38.390
We're at a divide where we have to change from the way we've lived for the past

2161
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:43.830
few thousand years.
We just lived like dominating creeps.

2162
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:48.920
We have to change into a compassionate side society of people who view each

2163
02:00:49.561 --> 02:00:51.240
other as a community.
You know,

2164
02:00:51.241 --> 02:00:55.980
people who view everyone all around the world as a community.
And that's,

2165
02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:58.500
that's the only hope.
It's the only hope for humanity.

2166
02:00:58.501 --> 02:01:03.140
And it seems to me that's like almost a race is a race between the,

2167
02:01:03.141 --> 02:01:06.420
the assholes of the world that are trying to start conflict everywhere they can

2168
02:01:06.421 --> 02:01:08.940
and try and extract resources and just fuck people over.

2169
02:01:09.090 --> 02:01:12.930
There's a race between them and enlightenment,
you know,

2170
02:01:12.931 --> 02:01:16.320
and one on one of the,
one of them is going to win,
you know,

2171
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:20.130
one of them is going to win and either they get to the button first and they

2172
02:01:20.131 --> 02:01:23.820
fuck flipped the whole board over and we have to start the game over again.

2173
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:29.330
Or we calm everything the fuck down and we get out of this and we realize that

2174
02:01:30.451 --> 02:01:32.700
you can't do all this corrupt bullshit anymore.

2175
02:01:32.701 --> 02:01:34.560
Everybody knows what you're doing now.

2176
02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:39.200
And now we have to have a government that actually looks out for people and we

2177
02:01:39.201 --> 02:01:43.370
have to make decisions based on what's an intelligent way to look at our

2178
02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:48.200
possibilities for the future and that's what leaders are supposed to do and

2179
02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:51.050
that's what real patriotism is supposed to be about.

2180
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:54.770
It's not supposed to be about locking people up because they expose when you

2181
02:01:54.771 --> 02:01:55.604
fuck up.

2182
02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.830
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean it's,
we're just at a time right now where I agree with you.</v>

2183
02:02:02.831 --> 02:02:06.250
That was a beautiful way to describe it,
Joe,
where we are,
we're competing.

2184
02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.630
Enlightenment is competing with corruption and you're seeing corruption slowly

2185
02:02:10.631 --> 02:02:13.510
try to crush enlightenment by with Nda,

2186
02:02:13.511 --> 02:02:17.740
with a prosecuting whistleblowers and,
and who's going to win.
And I,

2187
02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:19.210
I'm always on the side of the people.

2188
02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:23.260
I think that I think a growing number of people are realizing what's happening,

2189
02:02:23.590 --> 02:02:26.900
but it can only happen if you let it happen to yourself.
Nda,

2190
02:02:27.450 --> 02:02:30.240
<v 4>closest eggs.
The best example of that,</v>

2191
02:02:30.241 --> 02:02:32.790
that there is a battle going on because in,

2192
02:02:32.791 --> 02:02:34.920
in just in the language that they use,

2193
02:02:34.921 --> 02:02:38.910
saying that they can hold you indefinitely without recourse,

2194
02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:43.020
that alone is like saying no,
I have God mode.

2195
02:02:43.110 --> 02:02:46.470
That's like saying it's bringing someone into God.
Note.
That's your fuck the MBA.

2196
02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.380
<v 5>Yeah.
I had to create the meme.
I,
we've had to,
as journalists,</v>

2197
02:02:49.381 --> 02:02:52.990
we've had to also become activists when we seen the truth because we,

2198
02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:56.550
we are enlightened in a way that most of the public isn't.
And,
and,

2199
02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:58.050
and now it's such a critical time.

2200
02:02:58.410 --> 02:03:00.690
I just felt like I had to get that out there to let people know.

2201
02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:04.800
As journalist we say,
fuck this section of the NDA.

2202
02:03:04.801 --> 02:03:05.970
This is ridiculous.

2203
02:03:05.971 --> 02:03:10.020
It is a power to kill journalism because it will tear up our sources from coming

2204
02:03:10.021 --> 02:03:11.310
forward.
Not only that,

2205
02:03:11.311 --> 02:03:14.820
we could be accused of helping terrorist whoever our government decides are

2206
02:03:14.821 --> 02:03:17.310
terrorists and get locked up forever.

2207
02:03:17.311 --> 02:03:21.240
And Obama says he won't use it on US citizens.
He promises that.

2208
02:03:21.241 --> 02:03:24.030
But what about the next president and the president after that?

2209
02:03:24.370 --> 02:03:25.270
<v 4>You know that old expression,</v>

2210
02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:29.230
the person you say yes to today won't be the same person you say yes to 20 years

2211
02:03:29.231 --> 02:03:32.530
from now.
Yeah,
and that's the problem with law is that,
you know,

2212
02:03:32.531 --> 02:03:35.350
just because someone puts something into once it's down,

2213
02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:36.280
once it's written in the book,

2214
02:03:36.281 --> 02:03:39.430
it can be interpreted a number of different ways and use a number of different

2215
02:03:39.431 --> 02:03:39.581
ways.

2216
02:03:39.581 --> 02:03:43.060
As you're seeing in Bahrain where they're killing people with sanctioned methods

2217
02:03:43.061 --> 02:03:46.170
of crowd control.
They're using it to execute people,
you know,

2218
02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:48.460
slowly with sanction methods of crowd control,

2219
02:03:48.461 --> 02:03:50.440
their disusing the law and they using it

2220
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:52.520
<v 5>to their advantage of tear gas.
I mean they are,</v>

2221
02:03:52.521 --> 02:03:56.990
if anyone researches that they're systematically gassing these people and if

2222
02:03:56.991 --> 02:03:58.160
they continue this way,

2223
02:03:58.190 --> 02:04:02.360
doctors are terrified for the longterm health damage is going to have.

2224
02:04:02.361 --> 02:04:06.890
They're just gassing hundreds of thousands of people over and over every single

2225
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:09.680
day,
10 minutes from the U s military base.

2226
02:04:09.681 --> 02:04:11.600
Why aren't our troops complaining about this?

2227
02:04:11.630 --> 02:04:14.960
<v 4>We need,
they see this every day.
Yeah.
Why aren't they?
Well,</v>

2228
02:04:14.961 --> 02:04:17.270
I don't think they have.
What,
what can the troops do?

2229
02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:19.560
<v 5>Yeah,
well they can't,
they can't be,
oh,</v>

2230
02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:22.650
if they all came up and rebelled against what was happening on the,

2231
02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:26.040
down the street from them and spoke out against it,
it couldn't exist.

2232
02:04:26.110 --> 02:04:29.050
<v 4>Well,
one of the things that they do to keep the troops down as a Cuban poor,</v>

2233
02:04:29.310 --> 02:04:34.240
you know,
the,
the money that they make while in the military is shockingly low.

2234
02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.040
And the,
the scary thing is that when Dick was in office,

2235
02:04:38.041 --> 02:04:42.150
they passed laws that allow them to send people back.
You know,

2236
02:04:42.151 --> 02:04:45.450
even if your time is over,
they can bring you back because they need bodies.

2237
02:04:45.810 --> 02:04:49.980
And it's scary.
It's scary for those people.
I have a friend that was,
uh,

2238
02:04:50.610 --> 02:04:52.260
he was 20 days.

2239
02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:57.320
He had 20 days left on a 20 year stint in the army reserves and they sent him to

2240
02:04:58.261 --> 02:05:02.460
Iraq for a year and a half and they sent him back again and sent them there for

2241
02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:04.980
a year and a half.
And then they sent him back again later.
Uh,
you know,

2242
02:05:04.981 --> 02:05:09.630
this guy was fucked.
There was nothing to do about it.
He had 20 days left.

2243
02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:14.340
Wow.
Yeah.
When they go tough shit,
see Yah,
we can do it.
You gonna fight us.

2244
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:16.050
You're going to fight her so you going to do what we tell you to do.

2245
02:05:16.290 --> 02:05:17.021
And they have,
they,

2246
02:05:17.021 --> 02:05:21.330
they have those guys programmed to do what they tell them to do and they're

2247
02:05:21.331 --> 02:05:23.790
scared and they don't have money to fight it in court and they don't want to get

2248
02:05:23.791 --> 02:05:27.570
court marshaled and they know that the,
the law is not on their side.
The,

2249
02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:31.950
the written law is not on their side.
Even though it's morally,

2250
02:05:32.490 --> 02:05:35.160
it doesn't make sense.
It's,
it doesn't make sense.
Legally.

2251
02:05:35.190 --> 02:05:37.840
None of it makes sense that you can actually have these,
I mean,

2252
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:40.200
essentially you turn people into slaves.
He turned that day,

2253
02:05:40.201 --> 02:05:41.130
you have to do your bidding.

2254
02:05:41.170 --> 02:05:44.040
They do your bidding for a minimal amount of money and it's shit.

2255
02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:47.760
It's fucking shocking.
It's shocking.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's,

2256
02:05:48.930 --> 02:05:51.960
it's Orwellian.
It's disappointing.

2257
02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:57.080
It's when you realize that this is how the country really is run and our

2258
02:05:57.241 --> 02:06:01.290
idealistic view of it as America,
fuck yeah.
It's just,
it's not,

2259
02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:04.770
it's not what it could be.
It's like we're embarrassing.

2260
02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:09.270
If you look at the amount of goodwill that we had after nine 11,
you know,

2261
02:06:09.271 --> 02:06:12.510
and everybody was like,
fun.
Well,
we're our hearts.
Go out to America.

2262
02:06:12.511 --> 02:06:15.960
This is a horrible tragedy.
And then look at the way they look at us now.

2263
02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:18.240
Like God damn,
whatever we did,

2264
02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:23.400
whatever we did to deserve that is,
it's just a mess.

2265
02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:25.410
So it wouldn't,
we're not as good as we could be,

2266
02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:29.280
just not period would clearly we've been running and competently.

2267
02:06:29.550 --> 02:06:33.210
And I thought Obama was going to be able to do some about that.

2268
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:34.680
<v 5>Yeah.
So did I,
uh,</v>

2269
02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:39.180
I think a lot of people felt that the country would change and journalistically

2270
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:43.700
it's changed horrifically.
So,
so that only tells you,
uh,

2271
02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:45.810
I mean,
like I said earlier,
that,

2272
02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:50.640
that the presidency is no longer in control by the individual.

2273
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:55.710
Um,
you know,
I feel like there are greater forces at play here and,

2274
02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:58.800
and our country is being led in a direction that's not in the direction that

2275
02:06:58.801 --> 02:07:02.590
people want it to go.
So,
so what's going to happen here?
You know,
w

2276
02:07:03.170 --> 02:07:05.850
<v 4>the crazy thing is if they do do something when I ran the can't expect,</v>

2277
02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:07.460
they'll be no repercussions.
I mean,
what are they,

2278
02:07:07.461 --> 02:07:09.320
what do they think is going to be the blowback?

2279
02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:13.190
What do they think is going to be the,
you know,
the aftershock,
the aftermath,

2280
02:07:13.191 --> 02:07:13.790
what did,

2281
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:18.790
how much damage is something like that going to cause internationally if Russia

2282
02:07:18.861 --> 02:07:21.170
and China get involved,
it could be crazy.

2283
02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:25.290
<v 5>Yeah.
It can be worried recurring world war three and they have nukes,
you know,</v>

2284
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:29.910
and um,
and,
and I'm not,
I don't want to be sitting here fearmongering but,

2285
02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:33.390
but I see the writings on the wall,
you just have to look at all the,
the,
the,

2286
02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:36.100
the propaganda being fed and of the fact

2287
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.410
<v 3>that bufferin was so systematically censored,</v>

2288
02:07:38.411 --> 02:07:42.850
that story and all of the mainstream media,
not just CNN.
And so you look at that,

2289
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:45.040
put everything,
put the pieces of the puzzle together.

2290
02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:48.190
And to me it spells out war and,
um,

2291
02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:51.790
and the American people need to wake up and realize that we are,

2292
02:07:51.791 --> 02:07:54.430
we are close to two action being taken now.

2293
02:07:54.431 --> 02:07:57.760
Is it going to be taken with the approval of,
of the people?

2294
02:07:57.761 --> 02:07:59.290
Are we going to be given a choice?

2295
02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:02.560
And it's pretty scary that I'm even having to ask this question now.

2296
02:08:02.850 --> 02:08:07.140
<v 4>Do you remember when Obama was running for office and they were saying,</v>

2297
02:08:07.141 --> 02:08:10.710
we're gonna,
he's gonna pull out of Iraq,
is going to close down Guantanamo Bay.

2298
02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:13.080
He had all these things that he was saying that there's none of that

2299
02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:16.410
<v 3>sign,
Nda hell,
take that out.
Yeah,</v>

2300
02:08:16.690 --> 02:08:19.720
<v 4>but there's none of that talk now in this series of debates.</v>

2301
02:08:19.721 --> 02:08:23.710
It's all about the economy and it's all about business and it's all about taxes.

2302
02:08:24.370 --> 02:08:27.160
Meanwhile,
we're about to go into world war three and we're like,
okay,

2303
02:08:27.490 --> 02:08:29.140
<v 3>la,
la,
La,
I'm not listening.</v>

2304
02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:33.810
<v 4>We're like completely blocking out.
Like four years ago it was,
it was huge.</v>

2305
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:34.651
That was the,

2306
02:08:34.651 --> 02:08:37.890
the entire discussion was what are we doing with these wars that we can't win?

2307
02:08:38.070 --> 02:08:40.530
You know,
when are we going to pull out what?
How are we going to handle this?

2308
02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:43.050
You know,
Mccain had one plan,
Obama had another,

2309
02:08:43.290 --> 02:08:44.850
Obama was going to get us out of there.

2310
02:08:44.851 --> 02:08:49.050
And it seemed like we had realize as a country that we were going to have to

2311
02:08:49.051 --> 02:08:51.120
correct the mistakes of the previous administration,

2312
02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:53.190
but now that doesn't seem to be any of that talk.

2313
02:08:53.191 --> 02:08:57.360
They've just swept that under the rug.
It's almost like they're denying that a,

2314
02:08:57.361 --> 02:09:01.740
there's still a huge conflict going on in Afghanistan.
We're still,
to this day,

2315
02:09:01.741 --> 02:09:06.741
people are suicide bombing left and right is all sorts of troops that we train

2316
02:09:07.230 --> 02:09:10.740
are attacking Americans and using the guns that we give them on American

2317
02:09:10.741 --> 02:09:13.770
soldiers means fucking chaos over there.

2318
02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.850
And there's not a peep about it.
Not a peep,
not a peep,

2319
02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:22.410
not a people about the heroin on a peep about the fact that Afghanistan controls

2320
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:26.970
more than 90% of the world's heroine and that heroin use has gone up,

2321
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.650
skyrocketed in the United States since our,
since our occupation in Afghanistan.

2322
02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:36.340
<v 3>And some of that is going towards,
uh,
to make oxycontin yeah.</v>

2323
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:41.550
And painkillers that are causing a ridiculous number of addicts and Florida in

2324
02:09:41.950 --> 02:09:42.783
Appalachia

2325
02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:46.170
<v 4>in that documentary.
The oxycontin express.</v>

2326
02:09:46.290 --> 02:09:51.260
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
And I,
yeah,
it was fabulous.
I am a huge fan of,</v>

2327
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:56.190
of her,
uh,
Marianna van Zeller.
I'm Darren foster.
Did that one for current.

2328
02:09:56.191 --> 02:09:59.790
They are extremely talented film producers in general.

2329
02:09:59.970 --> 02:10:04.180
<v 4>That was scary shit when you watch that guy whose wife died of an overdose and</v>

2330
02:10:04.181 --> 02:10:09.181
he smoked oxycontin before he called the cops while his wife was dead next to

2331
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:10.343
him.

2332
02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:13.600
<v 3>It's crazy.
My cousin's in jail right now for that.
Um,</v>

2333
02:10:13.690 --> 02:10:18.690
he grew up in like a upper middle class family in the suburbs and he got hooked

2334
02:10:19.481 --> 02:10:23.140
on Oxycontin after trying it at a party,
then switched to heroin and out.

2335
02:10:23.150 --> 02:10:25.260
And now he's in the,
in the slammer.
Unfortunately

2336
02:10:25.630 --> 02:10:30.520
<v 4>I have a family member who lost it shit over it,
got injured gut,
you know,</v>

2337
02:10:30.610 --> 02:10:34.130
had a back injury,
took it and just lost it.
Gone.

2338
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:39.140
<v 6>Not the same guy anymore.
Now he's gone.
Just nuts.
And it's scary,
scary,</v>

2339
02:10:39.141 --> 02:10:42.890
scary drug and so easy to get.
Just unbelievably easy to get.

2340
02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:47.540
And what people don't realize is that there's more addicts,

2341
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:52.010
more pill addicts today than there have ever been at any time in human history.

2342
02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.600
I mean,
there's more people that are hooked on these fucking crazy pain pills.

2343
02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:00.320
I mean,
it's an epidemic,
a real epidemic.
Meanwhile,

2344
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:02.900
the DDA is fucking going after medical marijuana,

2345
02:11:03.170 --> 02:11:05.720
fucking breaking down doors and stick a machine.

2346
02:11:05.721 --> 02:11:09.790
Guns and tie dyed kid tee shirt faces.
You know,
it's,

2347
02:11:09.930 --> 02:11:11.330
it's fucking unbelievable.

2348
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:15.170
I love going to Venice beach when you can just walk there and you just see

2349
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:19.640
people just smoking a joint on the side.
And not just because I'm,
I'm,

2350
02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:22.370
I'm not saying whether I'm a marijuana fan or not,

2351
02:11:22.371 --> 02:11:26.210
but I'm saying that your marijuana fan,
I,
you know,
I don't,

2352
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:28.190
I don't see the problem with it.

2353
02:11:28.190 --> 02:11:31.640
I'm going to come out the problem because I've covered the oxycontin.

2354
02:11:31.641 --> 02:11:33.500
I did a lot of reporting from Florida.

2355
02:11:33.501 --> 02:11:36.080
I saw my family member affected by it and I said,

2356
02:11:36.081 --> 02:11:39.770
this is legal and America and marijuana is illegal.

2357
02:11:39.771 --> 02:11:44.690
If you look at the side effects will juke Dr drew on fucking CNN tried to say

2358
02:11:44.691 --> 02:11:49.310
that there was a massive withdrawal effects the coincide with quitting
marijuana,

2359
02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:53.150
which is complete physiological nonsense.
It's just not true.

2360
02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.300
There's no withdrawal.
It's not like heroin.
It's not like you can die.
You know?

2361
02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.760
You know what?
As the worst withdrawal alcohol,

2362
02:11:58.850 --> 02:12:00.920
people die because they don't drink.

2363
02:12:00.921 --> 02:12:04.130
You get so addicted to alcohol that if you go cold Turkey,

2364
02:12:04.131 --> 02:12:06.020
you're body can go into shock and you can die.

2365
02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:10.640
It's not marijuana stupid and he's on CNN talking about that.
You know,

2366
02:12:10.670 --> 02:12:14.810
talking about marijuana being something dangerous only to pussies.

2367
02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.960
Marijuana fucks up your life.
I've always said this,

2368
02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:21.230
it's just because marijuana got there first.
It could have been cheeseburgers,

2369
02:12:21.231 --> 02:12:25.540
scratch tickets.
It could have been anything.
You're,
you're,
you're an idiot.
You,

2370
02:12:25.541 --> 02:12:28.700
you let something that makes people happy.
It makes me more sensitive,

2371
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:32.360
makes people,
it makes food taste better.
You've made that ruin your life.

2372
02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:35.990
If that's,
you could ruin your life with anything if you so choose.

2373
02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:40.610
People are weird.
People get addicted to washing their hands.

2374
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:44.690
People get addicted to sitting in front of shows and not leaving when the

2375
02:12:44.691 --> 02:12:47.660
commercials on people are nuts.
Like you can't,

2376
02:12:47.661 --> 02:12:51.110
can't say cause a certain amount of people can't handle marijuana,

2377
02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:54.800
marijuana with do a lot of people that are in control of this world.

2378
02:12:54.801 --> 02:12:58.700
Some good just to be paranoid and just think about the repercussions and think

2379
02:12:58.701 --> 02:13:03.690
about the,
the actions that they've done and what,
what that's caused to the,

2380
02:13:03.691 --> 02:13:06.470
the,
the,
the,
the people that they have control over.

2381
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:09.380
Maybe you should give a Netanyahu a joint upon Kootenay,

2382
02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:14.420
Hella young who would cry if you gave that guy a pot Brownie and it just net

2383
02:13:15.230 --> 02:13:19.790
zero Yahoo.
Yeah.
He's uh,
he would change his cartoon bomb for sure.

2384
02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:23.480
He would make it like the desk squad transplant had to be stoned when they,

2385
02:13:23.530 --> 02:13:26.840
when they drew that bomb because it's so ridiculous.

2386
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:30.650
I just can't imagine someone with an under the influence of some type of drug.

2387
02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:32.100
It's,
it's during that drawing.

2388
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.850
<v 4>Well,
it makes me think that this world is not real.
You know,
I,</v>

2389
02:13:34.851 --> 02:13:36.550
I go over this so many times that my,

2390
02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:40.290
my fans are getting angry at me sometimes at Twitter.
Me and tell me,

2391
02:13:40.291 --> 02:13:43.590
stop talking about simulation theory because it really starts it.

2392
02:13:43.591 --> 02:13:46.200
When you saw Mitt Romney the other day and he was wearing black face when he's

2393
02:13:46.201 --> 02:13:50.880
talking to the Mexicans,
I was like,
Holy Shit,
this can't be real.

2394
02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:54.230
That guy put fucking sneaky tan on his face and he's,

2395
02:13:54.330 --> 02:13:57.420
he didn't even get it on his neck.
He didn't get it on the back of his neck.

2396
02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:02.400
So as his face is all like super brown and orange t his neck is white,

2397
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:04.530
his neck looks like a fucking tee shirt.

2398
02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:09.470
<v 3>Dude,
I,
I've lived in Mexico and Guatemala and he is not Hispanic.</v>

2399
02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:14.100
I don't care what he says or if he wants to try to fit in.
Well,
you know,
it's,

2400
02:14:14.101 --> 02:14:18.500
it's a shame.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's from Mexico.
I,

2401
02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:22.330
I've heard some,
I've heard different theories on that,
that,
that,
that um,

2402
02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:27.050
<v 4>that they were kind of forced down there.
His family.
Yeah,
they're polygamists.</v>

2403
02:14:27.230 --> 02:14:29.000
Yeah,
they wanted to fuck a lot of women.

2404
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:32.030
They wanted to have a bunch of wives and so they wouldn't let them do it in

2405
02:14:32.031 --> 02:14:33.890
America.
So they decided to move to Mexico.

2406
02:14:33.891 --> 02:14:36.400
But that was back when people were riding horses or ride.

2407
02:14:36.401 --> 02:14:38.840
Nobody thought there was gonna be a difference.
What's the difference?
Mexico.

2408
02:14:38.841 --> 02:14:41.780
America.
Fuck it.
Let's move there.
Yeah,
we can have 10 wives there.

2409
02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:46.960
And so they decided to move there and Mexico just didn't change and grow at the

2410
02:14:46.971 --> 02:14:47.960
same rate as America.

2411
02:14:47.961 --> 02:14:51.860
So now they're stuck in like wars and shootouts with the drug cartels.

2412
02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.290
And the guys from vice,
um,

2413
02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.080
broke the story about the Mormon compound.
Uh,

2414
02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:00.440
the Romney compound that they have down in Mexico,

2415
02:15:00.441 --> 02:15:03.770
there's the Romney family is from fucking Mexico.

2416
02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:06.140
Romney's dad wanted to run for president,

2417
02:15:06.141 --> 02:15:09.260
but he couldn't because he was born in Mexico in a cult.

2418
02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:13.940
And that's where Romney came from.
He came from there.
He lived there.
I mean,

2419
02:15:13.941 --> 02:15:17.750
it's fucking bananas.
They,
there are a crazy loony,

2420
02:15:17.751 --> 02:15:20.210
toons religious cult that wanted a bunch of wives.

2421
02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:21.830
And so they decided to go to another country.

2422
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:27.930
<v 3>And,
and I,
I hate when candidates try to act like they're so chum chum with,</v>

2423
02:15:27.931 --> 02:15:31.710
with the black community or the Latino community are,
you know,

2424
02:15:31.711 --> 02:15:34.880
they always put a show on.
It's just so disingenuous.
And,

2425
02:15:34.881 --> 02:15:36.390
and the way I see him do that with the,

2426
02:15:36.810 --> 02:15:39.590
with the Hispanic community is just ridiculous.
You know,

2427
02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:45.180
I don't see him by hanging out in,
you know,
NLA and,
and really,
you know,

2428
02:15:45.630 --> 02:15:47.220
really getting down with the community.

2429
02:15:47.221 --> 02:15:50.790
I could ever imagine him going in a bar and hanging out with,

2430
02:15:50.791 --> 02:15:53.340
with a bunch of day labor,

2431
02:15:53.341 --> 02:15:57.000
Hispanic men I could never see them getting along with,
with Romney.

2432
02:15:57.430 --> 02:16:01.900
<v 4>It's interesting though that that's where the,
uh,
the,
the debate has gone.</v>

2433
02:16:01.930 --> 02:16:04.150
That's where the focus of our country has gone.

2434
02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:08.020
It's gone into these two very different personalities and what each one

2435
02:16:08.021 --> 02:16:08.830
represents.

2436
02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:12.850
And then the dialogue is one of them represents a redistribution of wealth.

2437
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.590
He represents,
you know,
he's going to take money from these,

2438
02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:18.340
these people that have worked so hard.

2439
02:16:18.341 --> 02:16:21.610
He's going to give it to these lazy folk to try to prop them up.

2440
02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:23.170
And then the other side is that this,

2441
02:16:23.171 --> 02:16:27.460
this guy is a businessman and this guy is going to be able to figure out what's

2442
02:16:27.461 --> 02:16:29.290
wrong with the business of this economy.

2443
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:33.280
Put us back on track and he's got these steps that he's going to take right
away.

2444
02:16:33.430 --> 02:16:37.570
And then the one size like this is going to cost the middle class a lot of money

2445
02:16:37.630 --> 02:16:41.020
and all while this is going on,
tanks are moving into place.

2446
02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:45.830
<v 3>Uh,
right now that's neuron Iran,</v>

2447
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:50.560
Iran,
and,
and I,
and I,
the more I look at it,
the more I'm,

2448
02:16:50.610 --> 02:16:53.190
I'm starting to agree with people who,

2449
02:16:53.191 --> 02:16:56.870
who think that the two party system is just a distraction.
Go Hixon it passed.

2450
02:16:57.050 --> 02:16:57.300
Yeah.

2451
02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:01.980
<v 4>He said,
uh,
I liked that.
He goes,
he goes,
I locked the puppet on the left.
Well,</v>

2452
02:17:01.981 --> 02:17:04.920
the pub on the ride is more to my liking.
Hey,
wait a minute.

2453
02:17:04.921 --> 02:17:06.760
One guy was holding both puppets,
you know,

2454
02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:11.040
and that's essentially the dog and pony show that we got going on.
Gay Rights,

2455
02:17:12.420 --> 02:17:15.330
redistribution of wealth.
So what my taxes,
what are you going to do?

2456
02:17:15.370 --> 02:17:17.790
Give it to one of the lazy welfare people.
You know,

2457
02:17:17.791 --> 02:17:21.420
there's a people that believe that welfare is in place just simply to ensure

2458
02:17:21.421 --> 02:17:23.430
that there's a certain amount of democratic voters every year.

2459
02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:26.700
Now they just continue the welfare.
So people continue to be on the Dole.

2460
02:17:26.701 --> 02:17:30.090
So people continue to support.
Anybody supports that.
It's a mess.

2461
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:31.020
It's a fucking mass.

2462
02:17:31.590 --> 02:17:35.760
<v 3>So what gives you hope?
I always ask people that want marijuana.</v>

2463
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.710
Psychedelics can,
excuse

2464
02:17:36.710 --> 02:17:38.210
<v 4>me,
help.
But for real,
I'm not joking.</v>

2465
02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:41.610
It sounds ridiculous because people associate psychedelics with uh,

2466
02:17:42.050 --> 02:17:46.940
with non realistic things,
with hallucinations.
They,
they,
they,
they,

2467
02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:50.300
they don't look at it the way I look at it.

2468
02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:55.360
I think that there are certain plants here that have aided in the evolution of

2469
02:17:55.761 --> 02:17:58.940
human consciousness.
The have changed the way people look.

2470
02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:00.500
They've changed the way I look at people.

2471
02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:03.110
They've changed my relationship with human beings.
My,

2472
02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:08.140
the way I look at human beings has fundamentally changed by having psychedelic

2473
02:18:08.721 --> 02:18:13.010
experiences and change for the better.
Made me a healthier,
nicer person,

2474
02:18:13.011 --> 02:18:16.430
made me more loving and made me more aware of the consequences of my own

2475
02:18:16.431 --> 02:18:17.390
personal actions.

2476
02:18:17.690 --> 02:18:20.720
And I think that's one of the reasons why they illegal and I think it's a
really,

2477
02:18:20.721 --> 02:18:24.170
it's a shame that they've been derided to the point where it's,

2478
02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:28.670
it's a laughable topic,
you know?
If you say,
well,
you know,
yeah,

2479
02:18:28.671 --> 02:18:33.050
Rogan also thinks that mushrooms can cure mankind.
Well guess what?
They could,

2480
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:37.400
if we all had really intense mushroom trips,
first of all,

2481
02:18:37.401 --> 02:18:39.590
people would come out of that with a complete reset.

2482
02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:41.300
They come out with that you would be healthy,

2483
02:18:41.301 --> 02:18:45.770
but you would have a complete reset of the way you view eternity.

2484
02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:48.870
The way you view this situation,
that we're in the,

2485
02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:53.880
we're so caught up in our own little culture and our own little situation that

2486
02:18:54.381 --> 02:18:58.370
we have constructed and that we're fighting against and trying to control these

2487
02:18:58.371 --> 02:19:02.060
various aspects that we don't even,
we don't even think.

2488
02:19:02.061 --> 02:19:07.061
We don't take the time to think about the incredible majesty of just life itself

2489
02:19:07.911 --> 02:19:11.810
and how amazing it is and how incredible it is that you have friends and loved

2490
02:19:11.811 --> 02:19:14.840
ones and how incredible it is that you can have sex and that you could drink

2491
02:19:14.841 --> 02:19:18.800
wine,
you could eat steak and you could go to a movie and you can drive a car.

2492
02:19:18.801 --> 02:19:23.801
We'd live in a fucking fantasy world and I think that if people had some new

2493
02:19:25.581 --> 02:19:28.460
found appreciation,
whether it's a near death experiences,

2494
02:19:28.670 --> 02:19:32.060
<v 0>whether it's from a psychedelics with,
it's from meditation,
whatever it is,</v>

2495
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:36.140
I think people operate their lives primarily on momentum.

2496
02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:39.500
They get up the same way.
They've always gotten up,
they move in the same way.

2497
02:19:39.501 --> 02:19:41.810
They've moved to get there every day to work,

2498
02:19:41.811 --> 02:19:45.650
and they go through the same job every day.
And that momentum is very,

2499
02:19:45.651 --> 02:19:49.010
very difficult to break.
And even if it's not a healthy momentum,
whether it's,

2500
02:19:49.011 --> 02:19:52.400
you know,
beating off to your Dick Bleeds or gambling all your money away,

2501
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:55.460
we still get stuck in that momentum that I got to me.
I need a drink.

2502
02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:58.940
You don't even know why you need a drink.
You're stuck in some wacky momentum.

2503
02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:00.950
You could call it being addicted to porn.

2504
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:02.870
You could call it being addicted to the Internet,

2505
02:20:02.871 --> 02:20:05.540
but we're stuck in a wacky momentum.

2506
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:10.570
And the only thing in my experience that changes that is a complete

2507
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:15.110
reconstruction of how you view the world.

2508
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:19.250
And the only way to do that is to step away.
You have to have some sort of a,

2509
02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:22.660
a disconnect,
some sort of a,
uh,

2510
02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:27.500
an experience where you get an objective look at things for the first time.

2511
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:32.501
You look at things as if you were someone completely unattached to every single

2512
02:20:32.661 --> 02:20:35.330
aspect of your life and the lives of all the people around with you.

2513
02:20:35.331 --> 02:20:39.320
But you get to see it like mapped out in front of you clearly and cleanly with

2514
02:20:39.321 --> 02:20:42.380
no ego,
with no financial repercussions with no,

2515
02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:44.390
just you get to really see what it is.

2516
02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:49.570
And that's not fucking possible for most people without some form of psychedelic

2517
02:20:49.821 --> 02:20:50.654
experience.

2518
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:53.410
<v 3>And so when you do these,
because this is you,</v>

2519
02:20:53.490 --> 02:20:57.540
you saw my first reaction was to laugh cool.
And you know,
everybody's is,

2520
02:20:58.620 --> 02:21:03.210
yeah,
I know.
Even I,
it just,
I've never really heard of it.
Describe this way.

2521
02:21:03.211 --> 02:21:07.920
So tell me,
when you do the mushrooms,
what,
what does it do?
What does it like in,

2522
02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:08.910
in your mind,

2523
02:21:08.911 --> 02:21:12.510
what are you experiencing that allows you to have a greater understanding of

2524
02:21:12.511 --> 02:21:13.230
reality?

2525
02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:13.531
<v 0>Well,</v>

2526
02:21:13.531 --> 02:21:16.350
that's where it gets really tricky because some people don't experience that.

2527
02:21:16.351 --> 02:21:20.370
They just experienced terror and dancing mice and alligator people that want to

2528
02:21:20.371 --> 02:21:24.070
eat your ass.
Like you get to have bad trips too.
It's not,
yeah,

2529
02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:25.200
it's not always rosy

2530
02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:28.710
<v 3>has,
I've never done any,
any drugs like that.
So I,
I've,</v>

2531
02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:32.980
because I've always had that fear of,
of something fatal happening or,
well,

2532
02:21:33.010 --> 02:21:36.370
<v 0>Mckenna felt the term.
There's a guy named Terrence Mckenna who was,
um,</v>

2533
02:21:36.580 --> 02:21:39.790
one of my psychedelic heroes and his original,
really brilliant,

2534
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:44.780
a fascinating human being.
And he had this crazy theory,
um,

2535
02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:46.750
called the stoned ape theory.

2536
02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:51.280
And it was his belief that it's since psychedelic drugs unquestionably have

2537
02:21:51.281 --> 02:21:54.310
existed since the beginning of human civilization.

2538
02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:56.650
There have been various sacraments,

2539
02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:01.330
various things that people have taken in during rituals.

2540
02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:05.890
To the point where a guy named John Marco Allegro is one of the scholars that

2541
02:22:05.891 --> 02:22:09.970
described the Dakota,
the dead,
the Dead Sea Scrolls.
One of his translation,

2542
02:22:10.020 --> 02:22:13.090
his uh,
his one,
he wrote two books about the translations.

2543
02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:17.590
One of them is called the sacred mushroom and the cross and the,
his book,

2544
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:22.710
what was his basic life's work was explaining was that the entire Christian

2545
02:22:23.411 --> 02:22:25.390
religion was a massive misunderstanding.

2546
02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:29.970
And what it was really all about was psychedelic mushroom rituals and fertility

2547
02:22:29.971 --> 02:22:34.300
cults.
And that this was how the original co group of,
of,

2548
02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:38.960
of people like this,
they wrote down all these rituals in the form of parables,

2549
02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:41.100
in the form of stories.
And I mean it's,

2550
02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:45.690
you have to be some sort of a scholar and you know,

2551
02:22:45.691 --> 02:22:50.040
in Aramaic and in ancient languages to even understand what the fuck he's saying

2552
02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:52.260
to when you would disagree with it.

2553
02:22:52.261 --> 02:22:56.250
But no question they had psychedelic mushrooms.

2554
02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:57.300
There's no question.

2555
02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:00.870
And there's no question that they thought that those psychedelic mushrooms were

2556
02:23:00.871 --> 02:23:05.520
a direct connection to God.
And that's probably what represented God to them.

2557
02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:07.500
And that they didn't want other people to know about it.

2558
02:23:07.650 --> 02:23:10.770
And so they hid those things.
They hit those things and stories.

2559
02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:15.890
And those stories didn't represent necessarily Santa Claus or rep and various

2560
02:23:16.261 --> 02:23:17.370
people that Jesus,

2561
02:23:17.610 --> 02:23:20.880
one of the things that he translated was he believed that the word Jesus,

2562
02:23:20.970 --> 02:23:25.830
or the word Christ rather meant a mushroom covered in God's seaman and said he

2563
02:23:25.831 --> 02:23:30.220
believed that this was a Sumerian word apparently.
And he believed that we were,

2564
02:23:30.221 --> 02:23:34.830
they thought that when it rained that it was God like having intercourse with

2565
02:23:34.831 --> 02:23:38.580
the earth and that these mushrooms would grow out of the ground like overnight.

2566
02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:43.600
And you know,
we,
they didn't have microscopes so they couldn't see the,
uh,
the,

2567
02:23:43.601 --> 02:23:45.090
the spores that turned into mushrooms.

2568
02:23:45.091 --> 02:23:46.740
So they thought that this was like gifts from God,

2569
02:23:46.890 --> 02:23:49.560
then they would take them and trip.
They're fucking balls off.

2570
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:51.300
So if you really stop and think about that,

2571
02:23:51.301 --> 02:23:56.160
if you lived in a time where there was no science and virtually no understanding

2572
02:23:56.161 --> 02:23:59.730
of the world that we live in and you found mushrooms and you ate them and just

2573
02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:04.080
had this fucking mind blowing,
transcending experience,

2574
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:09.710
Mckenna believed that that was responsible for us evolving past lower hominids.

2575
02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:15.030
He believed that the the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2

2576
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:17.220
million years,
which is a huge mystery in the fossil record,

2577
02:24:17.221 --> 02:24:20.430
they don't really understand why the human brain size doubled and it was his

2578
02:24:20.431 --> 02:24:24.230
theory that they doubled because they started taking psychedelic mushrooms and

2579
02:24:24.310 --> 02:24:25.980
these monkeys came down off the trees.

2580
02:24:25.981 --> 02:24:29.540
They started eating mushrooms every day and in doing that it changed the co

2581
02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:33.370
<v 1>sure.
Your skin,
you're going to scare her away,
Joe.
It's no,
none at all.</v>

2582
02:24:33.390 --> 02:24:35.290
I'm actually,
I'm,
it's fascinating stuff,

2583
02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:37.300
<v 0>dude,
if you will.
I don't have to tell you,
you've,</v>

2584
02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.370
you've had many mushrooms trips,
but when you have them,

2585
02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:43.270
<v 1>there's,
it's such a powerful experience.
If I'm going to rob a bank,</v>

2586
02:24:43.271 --> 02:24:45.220
I'm still going to rob a bank.
If I do mushrooms or not,

2587
02:24:45.221 --> 02:24:46.680
if I'm going to rape somebody,
I'm going to,

2588
02:24:46.681 --> 02:24:48.520
I'm going to share my mushrooms to go,
you know what,

2589
02:24:48.521 --> 02:24:51.220
I'm not going to rape this girl anymore.
I'm like,

2590
02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:53.230
I don't think mushrooms fixes anything.

2591
02:24:53.231 --> 02:24:54.790
I think if everyone did mushrooms all road,

2592
02:24:54.791 --> 02:24:57.010
it's not going to fix anyone cause you look at it

2593
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:58.280
<v 0>keyless,
first of all you,</v>

2594
02:24:58.290 --> 02:25:02.670
you might be very different than a lot of people that have had transcending

2595
02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:05.940
experience mushrooms.
I Bet Brian does.
Yeah.

2596
02:25:05.941 --> 02:25:07.350
They might be fucked up to begin with,

2597
02:25:07.351 --> 02:25:10.830
but you can't discount all the positive experiences and all the transcendent

2598
02:25:10.831 --> 02:25:12.180
experiences that people have had.

2599
02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:15.810
<v 1>Yes.
You asked like two days.
No,
it lasts two days for you.</v>

2600
02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:22.160
I don't think about a mushroom trip after two days now.
Okay,

2601
02:25:22.161 --> 02:25:24.130
well that's you Brian.
Basically you

2602
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.550
<v 6>sit there and say every day we wake up,</v>

2603
02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:27.730
like thinking about how we argue about it.

2604
02:25:27.890 --> 02:25:29.590
It's just silly that you're even arguing about it.

2605
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:31.900
So what does it do to you when you take mushrooms?

2606
02:25:31.901 --> 02:25:35.590
Like I know you guys say it's like a delicate,
what do you see?
What do you,

2607
02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:39.640
what are your like profound experiences,
what he's saying?

2608
02:25:39.641 --> 02:25:44.050
I think in saying that you think about it for two days is that for two days you

2609
02:25:44.051 --> 02:25:48.130
sort of reconsider yourself and then you eventually go back into the pattern of

2610
02:25:48.131 --> 02:25:50.320
your everyday life,
right?
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

2611
02:25:50.321 --> 02:25:54.760
It doesn't do anything permanent where it's like,
okay I'm going to always,

2612
02:25:54.761 --> 02:25:56.770
I'm going to be a better person.
Okay.
But that is,

2613
02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.750
that is extremely subjective and it does to other people and it has to me.

2614
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:05.620
So when you say that it doesn't,
I say okay maybe to you,

2615
02:26:05.621 --> 02:26:09.430
but for you to say that just because you haven't had a life changing experience

2616
02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:12.760
where they've pushed you into a different direction of understanding,

2617
02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:13.990
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

2618
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:16.990
What I'm telling you that it exists for me and there's two of us,

2619
02:26:16.991 --> 02:26:21.991
so it's 50% of the people in this room that have done mushrooms when I was

2620
02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:26.890
getting at is I don't think if you had everyone do,

2621
02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:29.650
cause you say this all the time about if everyone just did mushrooms,

2622
02:26:29.651 --> 02:26:32.800
everything will fix itself.
I don't think for most people,

2623
02:26:32.801 --> 02:26:35.980
mushrooms has that big of an effect after a couple of days,
you know,

2624
02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:38.560
because because of momentum,

2625
02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:42.520
I think that's because of momentum and because of the fact that it's so easy to

2626
02:26:42.521 --> 02:26:46.210
go back and to think about your life the way you used to think about it before

2627
02:26:46.211 --> 02:26:47.140
you had that experience.

2628
02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:50.920
Your Ego will guide you right back to the patterns that you're comfortable in

2629
02:26:50.921 --> 02:26:55.000
anywhere.
You know?
Unless you've chosen,
look what makes a person decide,
you know,

2630
02:26:55.001 --> 02:26:56.950
I'm tired of being a fat fuck.
I am.

2631
02:26:56.951 --> 02:27:00.260
I am going to start eating healthy and I'm going to drink water all day and I'm

2632
02:27:00.261 --> 02:27:03.460
going to lose this fucking weight.
For some people it's bullshit.

2633
02:27:03.461 --> 02:27:07.330
They try it and then two days later they go back to eating again.
I mean,
Brian,

2634
02:27:07.350 --> 02:27:10.300
you've been on several diets where you've lost a tremendous amount of weight and

2635
02:27:10.301 --> 02:27:13.060
then you go back to your normal patterns of eating.
Right.
I'm in on one diet,

2636
02:27:13.061 --> 02:27:16.360
but yeah.
Okay.
You've been,
I thought it was more than once,
but he lost it.

2637
02:27:16.361 --> 02:27:18.750
He lost an amazing amount of weight,
like 80 80 something pounds.

2638
02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:21.400
But then that would motivation because I got out,

2639
02:27:21.401 --> 02:27:23.910
have a relationship at eight year relationship.
See,

2640
02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:25.420
you had a transcendent experience.

2641
02:27:25.450 --> 02:27:30.010
You had something that made you change your life and for some people that

2642
02:27:30.011 --> 02:27:32.620
mushroom trip that that reset,

2643
02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:34.900
they might have more questions about life than you do.

2644
02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:39.190
They might have more questions about their own consciousness than you do and

2645
02:27:39.191 --> 02:27:43.090
when they have those psychedelic experiences,
they're truly life changing.

2646
02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:47.080
And it doesn't have to be just for two days.
It can be for two days.

2647
02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:49.030
I've never starts you in a direction.
I guess.

2648
02:27:49.031 --> 02:27:52.240
I've never met anyone that did mushrooms and it changed their life forever ever.

2649
02:27:53.170 --> 02:27:57.190
Cause you know me.
Yeah,
I wouldn't think that though.
A lot of people do.

2650
02:27:57.250 --> 02:27:59.710
That's weird.
You know Greg Fitzsimmons when he was on the podcast,

2651
02:27:59.711 --> 02:28:03.180
he was talking about how much I've changed since he met with a lot of that is

2652
02:28:03.181 --> 02:28:05.830
psychedelic experiences,
man.
I mean a lot of that is meditation.

2653
02:28:06.130 --> 02:28:11.050
A lot of that is tiny isolation tech heads.
You say aids age to that too,

2654
02:28:11.770 --> 02:28:12.400
by the way,

2655
02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:17.400
that is all life experiences and psychedelic experiences are part of life

2656
02:28:17.471 --> 02:28:22.010
experiences.
They're unbelievably introspective.
They force

2657
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:26.330
<v 0>you to examine your life and,
and really almost an alien way.</v>

2658
02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.340
And again,
not for everybody.

2659
02:28:28.770 --> 02:28:32.900
Different people go into them with different baggage,
you know,
different people.

2660
02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:36.940
Some people try to fight the experience and go crazy.
And um,
there's,

2661
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:40.550
there are certain aspects to the psychedelic experience where you cannot control

2662
02:28:40.551 --> 02:28:43.070
it.
You don't have any control over it.
But what,

2663
02:28:43.071 --> 02:28:45.920
what it does do for sure is humbles people.

2664
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:49.640
And what it does do for sure is it squashes your ego,
you know,

2665
02:28:49.641 --> 02:28:53.000
and maybe Brian doesn't have ego problems.
Maybe that's why,
you know,

2666
02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.870
it doesn't change him that much.
But for some people it's incredibly humble.

2667
02:28:57.010 --> 02:28:59.620
<v 6>It's just really cool.
Like you get some cool movies and put it on,</v>

2668
02:28:59.621 --> 02:29:04.120
it's really neat.
But I think that's about the height of it.
Well,

2669
02:29:04.121 --> 02:29:08.710
I totally disagree and there's 50% of us here,
so it's like,
look,
look,

2670
02:29:08.711 --> 02:29:11.020
everybody's different.
Some people eat peanuts and it fucking kills them.

2671
02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:15.060
<v 5>I'm wearing with.
Okay.
Do I try it or do I know?
Or,
um,</v>

2672
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:16.130
<v 0>if you wanted to do something,</v>

2673
02:29:16.131 --> 02:29:20.720
what I would recommend is I'm going to Peru and doing like an Iowasca retreat to

2674
02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:21.573
one of those.

2675
02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:25.780
<v 5>I scuba dive.
I do something.
Yeah.
Jerry Garcia said he wouldn't need,</v>

2676
02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:29.560
you wouldn't need hallucinogenics if he was able to scuba dive everyday because

2677
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:30.550
to me,
that's,

2678
02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:34.510
that's when you're seeing all the coral formations and this crazy huge fish and

2679
02:29:34.511 --> 02:29:38.140
sharks coming at you.
That to me is another world experience.

2680
02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:41.490
<v 6>That's exactly the say for Jerry Garcia after he did acid a billion times</v>

2681
02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:45.900
at certain point in time.
Where you even sober after that?
I mean,

2682
02:29:45.901 --> 02:29:48.870
do you ever get sober or who allowed him to scuba dive?

2683
02:29:51.390 --> 02:29:54.840
I wouldn't want to be as scuba buddy.
He's a fucking,

2684
02:29:54.841 --> 02:29:58.860
just gonna die any second on you?
That guy's held together by tissue paper.

2685
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:01.830
Yeah.
How old was he when he was scuba diving?

2686
02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:07.180
<v 5>Uh,
I think it was,
I think it was later in his life,
but not,
not too late,
but,
uh,</v>

2687
02:30:07.540 --> 02:30:10.360
but that's just a well known phrase within scuba diving that,

2688
02:30:10.361 --> 02:30:13.090
that he would always say that,
especially when he was able to go down,

2689
02:30:13.091 --> 02:30:15.700
like in places like Hawaii where you have turtles and,

2690
02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:18.880
and that's like tripping when you see a turtle swimming right next to you and

2691
02:30:18.881 --> 02:30:22.450
you're swimming and you're at the same pace and it's this huge,
huge sea turtle.

2692
02:30:22.451 --> 02:30:26.530
It's awesome.
Yeah.
I love,
love,
love seeing sharks.

2693
02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:31.060
Uh,
because they're so rare.
It's very rare to,
it's like saying you're,

2694
02:30:31.061 --> 02:30:34.000
you go hiking out in California,
you'll see a bear.
It's,
it's almost,

2695
02:30:34.001 --> 02:30:37.300
the odds are slim to none.
So when I get to see a shark,
I'm,

2696
02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:38.710
I get excited about it.

2697
02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:42.940
At one time we were a scuba diving below the oil spill on CNN.

2698
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.570
This is really cool that they,
they let us do this.
And um,

2699
02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:50.740
and there was an area where there weren't a lot of bait fish because they'd been

2700
02:30:50.741 --> 02:30:53.110
killed by the oil.
So we're down underneath the water.

2701
02:30:53.111 --> 02:30:55.900
It was me and Felipe Cousteau.
Jacques Cousteau invented scuba diving.

2702
02:30:55.901 --> 02:31:00.520
It was his grandson and Jacques Cousteau invented scuba diving.
Uh,
he,

2703
02:31:00.521 --> 02:31:02.470
uh,
yeah,
he,
he helped.

2704
02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:07.130
<v 6>Oh really?
Yes.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.</v>

2705
02:31:08.390 --> 02:31:12.400
Thanks a lot guys who we had that show,
but I didn't know it affected it.
Wow.
Um,

2706
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:14.240
are you being serious?
Are you,
oh,

2707
02:31:14.241 --> 02:31:18.890
I thought you were really didn't know that one guy invented scuba dive.
Well,

2708
02:31:18.891 --> 02:31:20.220
he helped he,
I mean,

2709
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:23.390
<v 5>but who knows if we can trust what was written.
He helped innovate it.
Uh,</v>

2710
02:31:23.391 --> 02:31:26.390
I'd say he was really the guy who brought it to the mainstream and,

2711
02:31:26.650 --> 02:31:28.680
and so we were there alive on TV,
scuba diving,

2712
02:31:28.681 --> 02:31:32.550
and all of a sudden there's sharks swimming behind us on Erin.

2713
02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:36.540
A lot of viewers thought we were going to get eaten.
And um,
and,

2714
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:38.160
and so I was really paying attention to,

2715
02:31:38.161 --> 02:31:41.340
we were wearing hazmat suits and I was paying attention to not drowning cause my

2716
02:31:41.341 --> 02:31:43.620
suit had flooded and there was,
we're an oily water.

2717
02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:47.570
And so I barely noticed the sharks,
but I went back and watched the video and,

2718
02:31:47.650 --> 02:31:50.610
and there are a lot of them that just keeps swimming right past us.

2719
02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:53.010
And I later find out that our,
um,

2720
02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:58.400
my asshole South African photographer was throwing lunch meat off the boat that

2721
02:31:58.470 --> 02:32:03.210
was attracting all these sharks to come toward us.
I know.
Yeah.

2722
02:32:03.211 --> 02:32:06.090
He was throwing a,
we had Walmart sandwiches and he was,

2723
02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:09.060
he was throwing this alarm you and the Baloney that he didn't like off the boat

2724
02:32:09.061 --> 02:32:11.910
and it attracted one shark and he thought it was funny too to bring all these

2725
02:32:11.911 --> 02:32:16.510
other sharks on board,
but I'm bag.
But it's cool to see them underwater.

2726
02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:21.090
There are fascinating creatures the way they swim and,
and also,
um,

2727
02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:25.740
just to see something that massive that could potentially harm you.

2728
02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:28.680
It's kind of a adrenaline rush,
you know?

2729
02:32:28.990 --> 02:32:32.530
<v 0>Yeah,
for sure.
Actually.
Uh,
it's,</v>

2730
02:32:32.531 --> 02:32:37.300
it doesn't seem like they invented it.
It seems like Jacques Cousteau sort of,
um,

2731
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:42.160
made it,
uh,
made it popular,
but it seems like the first,
uh,

2732
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:45.700
inventions of it.
We're in the 17 hundreds,
17,
71,

2733
02:32:45.701 --> 02:32:50.020
a British engineer named John Smeaton invented the air pump and the hose was

2734
02:32:50.021 --> 02:32:52.210
connected between the air pump and uh,
uh,

2735
02:32:52.211 --> 02:32:55.840
a diving barrel allowing air to be pumped to the diver.

2736
02:32:56.170 --> 02:33:00.070
So in 1700,
they invented it.
People are so crafty.

2737
02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:01.930
I know I'm going amazing

2738
02:33:01.970 --> 02:33:06.640
<v 5>and it's pretty fascinating to be underwater and be able to breathe and yeah.
Uh,</v>

2739
02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:09.410
it,
it,
it's one of the most incredible feelings.

2740
02:33:09.411 --> 02:33:14.120
I highly recommend scuba diving chicken Marsala fabric.
No,
I,

2741
02:33:14.121 --> 02:33:16.280
well I'm not,
I'm not a claustrophobic person,

2742
02:33:16.310 --> 02:33:18.980
so it doesn't affect me in that way,
but um,

2743
02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:22.130
but I could see how some people would affect them because you have all this gear

2744
02:33:22.131 --> 02:33:26.420
on and you're relying on this claustrophobic thing over your mouth to be able to

2745
02:33:26.421 --> 02:33:29.570
breathe.
Yeah.
It seems like if something goes bad,
it goes bad fast.
You know,

2746
02:33:29.571 --> 02:33:32.410
like if you see like a shark or something like that you've lived in,

2747
02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:35.600
just start panicking.
That's you,
dude.
That's,
that seems like it would.
No,

2748
02:33:35.601 --> 02:33:38.190
I mean like she's got it together,
Dude.
She's in Bahrain,

2749
02:33:38.210 --> 02:33:40.910
getting machine guns put in her head.
She can handle sharks.

2750
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.170
I have an abnormal sense of fear.
I know I don't.
My whole life I,

2751
02:33:44.171 --> 02:33:47.210
I just don't have that thing in my brain that tells me,
wait,

2752
02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:52.700
stop what you're doing.
Really?
Yeah.
It's,
it's strange.
I just,

2753
02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:55.820
it doesn't,
if I do have it,
it's very,
very minimal.

2754
02:33:56.100 --> 02:34:00.690
<v 0>Have you ever thought that maybe you have like a destiny and that the reason why</v>

2755
02:34:00.691 --> 02:34:05.370
you have this bizarre abnormal sense of fear where you don't react to it?

2756
02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:09.420
It's because this is your path.
Maybe you're like a historical figure.

2757
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:14.280
Some day,
some day I'll be able to do,
they're going to be talking about you.

2758
02:34:14.281 --> 02:34:17.980
It's going to be super important and you're just like this crazy broad who just,

2759
02:34:17.981 --> 02:34:21.880
uh,
didn't have this fear of sharks
here.

2760
02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:26.110
Like machine guns.
No big deal.
Let me get back in there.
I'm trying to get a visa.

2761
02:34:26.170 --> 02:34:28.930
I'm trying to get back to your country where you tried to shoot me.
You know,

2762
02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:31.930
I mean that's a,
that's a very,

2763
02:34:31.931 --> 02:34:35.860
a weird possibility.
Have you ever thought about that?
Like your,

2764
02:34:35.861 --> 02:34:37.840
your place in this whole thing.

2765
02:34:37.930 --> 02:34:40.520
There's something that you said in the Alex Jones documentary that,

2766
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.390
or a interview rather than,
I thought it was really fascinating.
You said that,
uh,

2767
02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:49.330
CNN is on the wrong side of history,
you know,
and um,

2768
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:53.890
by,
by doing what you're doing,
you're clearly on the right side of history.

2769
02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:56.500
You're clearly the mean that's what you're supposed to do.

2770
02:34:56.501 --> 02:34:59.830
And when you see corruption,
he's supposed to talk about it.
When we see problems,

2771
02:34:59.831 --> 02:35:03.190
you're supposed to expose them.
You're on the right side of history.
Do you ever,

2772
02:35:03.210 --> 02:35:04.043
do you think about that?

2773
02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:08.860
<v 3>Yeah,
I always,
when I come out with things full force,
um,</v>

2774
02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:13.650
it's only when I,
I'm 100% know the truth.
Um,
because no matter what,

2775
02:35:13.651 --> 02:35:16.290
if you've,
if you follow the truth,
I always say it doesn't have a shelf life,

2776
02:35:16.650 --> 02:35:20.820
whatever the crops is going to get exposed.
Um,
and,

2777
02:35:20.850 --> 02:35:24.180
and I think that,
I think,
you know,
I really do.
I believe my,

2778
02:35:24.210 --> 02:35:27.060
my lack of sense of fear also,
uh,

2779
02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:30.660
it enabled me to do that because I don't have that thing over my shoulder

2780
02:35:30.661 --> 02:35:31.291
telling me,
okay,

2781
02:35:31.291 --> 02:35:36.150
well what if someone comes after you for going after Time Warner or what if,
um,

2782
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:39.810
what if you don't have a job or money?
I've lived out of my car.
I don't,
you know,

2783
02:35:39.811 --> 02:35:41.730
I don't,
I don't have those fears.

2784
02:35:41.850 --> 02:35:46.650
So that enabled me to come forward and talk about this and make and bring this

2785
02:35:46.651 --> 02:35:49.560
into the public light without having,
having fear.

2786
02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:55.120
<v 0>Wow.
Where do you see this,
uh,
this all going for you?
Do you,
do,</v>

2787
02:35:55.121 --> 02:35:57.640
you know,
do you have like a,

2788
02:35:57.650 --> 02:36:02.380
a 10 year map out where you sort of projected what,

2789
02:36:02.570 --> 02:36:05.260
what you're going to be doing or are you just sort of living in the moment and

2790
02:36:05.261 --> 02:36:07.840
trying to react to the world changing around you?

2791
02:36:08.300 --> 02:36:12.560
<v 3>I,
um,
uh,
trying to use everything in my power to,
uh,</v>

2792
02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:17.500
to enlighten Americans and let,
let them know what's happening.
Uh,
I,

2793
02:36:17.550 --> 02:36:20.300
I don't know yet where I'm going to be 10 years from now,

2794
02:36:20.330 --> 02:36:21.950
hopefully safe and sound.

2795
02:36:21.951 --> 02:36:26.951
And I'm working for a journalistic outlet that allows people to do real

2796
02:36:27.441 --> 02:36:29.010
journalism again.
Uh,

2797
02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:33.690
whether I have to create that or whether someone else will.
Um,

2798
02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:35.900
I don't know.
But,
um,

2799
02:36:35.970 --> 02:36:39.110
<v 0>do you think that your bold choices will inspire other people that are in your</v>

2800
02:36:39.111 --> 02:36:41.060
same position that we're in your same position?

2801
02:36:41.061 --> 02:36:45.290
Like in places like CNN and Fox News to do the same and to expose thanks.

2802
02:36:45.450 --> 02:36:47.690
I don't think it's,
it's really hard to do.

2803
02:36:48.210 --> 02:36:50.620
<v 3>It's,
it's hard to do because you're,</v>

2804
02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:54.340
no matter what you're going to face criticism.
And then when you look at,

2805
02:36:54.350 --> 02:36:59.200
at journalistically how much power these networks have and how few companies own

2806
02:36:59.201 --> 02:37:00.034
everything,

2807
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:03.010
people don't want to tick them off and people don't want to lose their health

2808
02:37:03.011 --> 02:37:05.710
insurance and they don't want to lose their severance and they don't want to

2809
02:37:05.711 --> 02:37:10.230
lose money.
And,
um,
and it's easier just to go along every day and,

2810
02:37:10.570 --> 02:37:12.550
and pretend nothing's happening and,

2811
02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:17.720
and continue to just have that imagination that you're just a cog in the machine

2812
02:37:18.291 --> 02:37:19.640
and you're not really the problem.

2813
02:37:19.641 --> 02:37:24.050
Will every single person that's enabling this to happen is the problem.

2814
02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:25.341
And that's what I said.

2815
02:37:25.341 --> 02:37:29.300
I feel like these journalists are going to go down in on the wrong side of

2816
02:37:29.301 --> 02:37:32.600
history and they're just as guilty as the corporations they work for because

2817
02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:35.060
they know this is going on.
And they're not saying anything.

2818
02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:36.650
Not only are they not saying anything,

2819
02:37:36.651 --> 02:37:40.490
they're continuing to go into work every day and feed lies to the American

2820
02:37:40.491 --> 02:37:41.324
public.

2821
02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:45.020
<v 0>Do you remember when they used to have all those movies about the McCarthy era</v>

2822
02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.670
and,
uh,
you know that one movie with Robert De Niro,
I forget what it was,

2823
02:37:49.671 --> 02:37:52.850
but it just showed the suppressive nature of,
you know,

2824
02:37:52.851 --> 02:37:55.820
the government back then and this,
this massive witch hunt.

2825
02:37:56.420 --> 02:37:58.250
It's so someone and what's going on today?

2826
02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:01.280
It's so weird how things go in these weird,
these cycles,

2827
02:38:01.850 --> 02:38:04.880
these incredibly bizarre cycles.

2828
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:10.790
And other witch hunt is terrorist.
The word terrorist.
Yeah.
Well,
it's,
well,

2829
02:38:10.791 --> 02:38:14.210
when that witch hunt becomes a guy like Julian Assange,
when it,
when it turns,

2830
02:38:14.211 --> 02:38:16.790
you know the word terrorism turns to a guy like Julian Assange,

2831
02:38:16.810 --> 02:38:20.090
everything makes you go,
well,
what is your definition?
Like,
what are you,

2832
02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:25.100
what are you doing?
Like this guy,
that guy has never killed anybody.
Okay.

2833
02:38:25.310 --> 02:38:28.490
He didn't kill anybody and he didn't lie.
So what did he do?

2834
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:31.460
What did he do that so terrible?
This,
that's a terrorist.

2835
02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:36.210
<v 3>He was a terrorist on corruption.
Hey,
Tara,
corrupt.
I'm terrified of him.</v>

2836
02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:37.201
You know,

2837
02:38:37.201 --> 02:38:41.910
and I'm sure there's people that would consider me a terrorist because if I know

2838
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:46.860
that they're corrupt,
I'm going to fucking expose them.
Be My language.
Yeah.
Um,

2839
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:51.150
and exactly.
And so maybe in some people's eyes I'm a terrorist,

2840
02:38:51.180 --> 02:38:54.320
but that means then I can just be taken down by the NDA.

2841
02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:56.250
And that's what's so scary about it.

2842
02:38:56.530 --> 02:38:58.420
<v 0>The cheating,
they're doing the wrong thing.</v>

2843
02:38:58.540 --> 02:39:02.470
It's not the way you're supposed to run things.
You're fuck heads.
You know that,

2844
02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:05.510
you know,
you're not supposed to run things like that.
You cheating you,

2845
02:39:05.511 --> 02:39:07.840
you've by being,
instead of doing it correctly,

2846
02:39:08.110 --> 02:39:09.860
you've decided to take away all dissent.

2847
02:39:10.010 --> 02:39:13.990
The slowly removed the rights of the people that are showing descent.

2848
02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:19.060
That's some UNAMERICAN bullshit.
It can only happen if people let it happen.

2849
02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:22.630
Do you think it's ever possible to make a new country like the way we did

2850
02:39:22.631 --> 02:39:25.900
America where everybody hopped up from Europe and the like,
fuck this let's,

2851
02:39:25.930 --> 02:39:28.720
it was only a couple hundred years ago.
Is there a spot?

2852
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:30.460
Maybe if global warming kicks in,

2853
02:39:30.461 --> 02:39:34.400
we could take over Greenland or Iceland rather or Antarctica,

2854
02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:39.790
<v 3>right?
Anywhere.
Well Iceland is in that country over over there now we could uh,</v>

2855
02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:41.600
maybe re colonize Mars.

2856
02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:43.100
<v 0>That's done.
Make sense?</v>

2857
02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:47.070
<v 3>You know?
Or what about some type of open source government on,
you know,</v>

2858
02:39:47.071 --> 02:39:47.904
on the Internet.

2859
02:39:48.190 --> 02:39:51.280
<v 0>What about those people that want to build cities in the middle of the ocean and</v>

2860
02:39:51.281 --> 02:39:55.670
international waters,
those floating city ideas?
Have you seen that?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2861
02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:58.780
Maybe that's the future.
Some fucking water world type shit.

2862
02:39:59.230 --> 02:40:00.450
<v 3>Or we could just,
yeah,</v>

2863
02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:05.050
we could just put on tanks that allow us to scuba dive to start descend into the

2864
02:40:05.051 --> 02:40:09.190
oceans.
I'd,
I'd prefer for that to be my faith.
I got to tell you,
Joe,

2865
02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:13.170
<v 0>wasn't there some recent,
there's something where they allowed a,</v>

2866
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:16.020
some sort of an injection.
They allowed people to,
uh,

2867
02:40:16.110 --> 02:40:19.920
not have to breed for certain periods of time.
Some,

2868
02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:23.940
some new invention.
I actually,
I got to,
yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Some,
uh,

2869
02:40:23.970 --> 02:40:28.470
scientists,
I don't know how I should Google this.
Scientists,
uh,

2870
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:30.990
swim without oxygen.
Okay.

2871
02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:34.130
<v 6>Was that the movie at best that they pumped something in the,</v>

2872
02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:38.100
you remember that shit?
Yeah.
That movie was ahead of its time,
man.
Yeah.

2873
02:40:38.101 --> 02:40:42.990
I don't know.
There's some new discovery.
I'm not googling it.
Aqua Fox magic.

2874
02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:47.620
<v 0>No,
there was a,
there really was something,</v>

2875
02:40:48.890 --> 02:40:52.840
a scientist suffered a way to keep people alive even when they can't breathe.

2876
02:40:54.700 --> 02:40:59.650
Uh,
yeah.
Okay.
They inject oxygen into the blood.

2877
02:41:00.890 --> 02:41:03.760
They discovered a new way of administering oxygen to the blood,

2878
02:41:03.761 --> 02:41:07.030
which could allow people to stay alive without breathing.
Amazing.

2879
02:41:07.031 --> 02:41:10.330
Breakthrough could change medical science by eliminating the need to keep

2880
02:41:10.331 --> 02:41:14.090
patients breathing during complex operations.
Okay.
So they,

2881
02:41:14.091 --> 02:41:16.300
the idea was this was for operations,

2882
02:41:16.301 --> 02:41:20.500
but it could also be used somehow or another.
You could connect to people,

2883
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:25.780
some sort of a fucking thing intravenously.
And then I'll have to breathe.

2884
02:41:26.650 --> 02:41:27.483
Whoa.

2885
02:41:29.170 --> 02:41:32.990
<v 6>And where is this taking place?
Where's this research research?
Uh,</v>

2886
02:41:33.210 --> 02:41:37.290
that's a good question.
Maybe I shouldn't say or they'll close down on them.

2887
02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:42.090
He'll then a guy,
my door today,
Joe,
I got a free cytology test on my door.

2888
02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:45.420
Just had to fill out this 10 page thing and send it in.

2889
02:41:45.421 --> 02:41:48.360
And they can tell me if I'm a Scientology ready.
It says,

2890
02:41:48.361 --> 02:41:52.740
are you curious about you?
Yeah.
Wow.
And the questions are like,

2891
02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:56.580
do you often make thoughtless remarks or accusations which he later regret?

2892
02:41:56.610 --> 02:42:00.000
Yes or no?
Definitely.
There's just tons of questions,

2893
02:42:00.001 --> 02:42:04.010
like ridiculous questions to say.
Yes,
that's my whole career on podcasts.

2894
02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:08.550
Do you spend much time on needless worries?
Do you know?

2895
02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:12.300
Not really neat of us.
Not Native us.
It's his worries are legit.

2896
02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:17.330
He's worried about the feds coming in here.
Well,
we should be worried about

2897
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.781
<v 0>mom.
Well,</v>

2898
02:42:18.781 --> 02:42:23.250
that's another thing that's been widely misreported in the news is this attack

2899
02:42:23.251 --> 02:42:28.251
on the u s embassy in Libya that they attributed to this fucking shitty movie

2900
02:42:28.621 --> 02:42:32.700
that this guy made.
And uh,
apparently that's not true at all.
And then that move,

2901
02:42:32.730 --> 02:42:37.730
that attack rather had been planned for a long time before that and purposely

2902
02:42:38.371 --> 02:42:42.240
took place on the anniversary of September 11th.
And uh,

2903
02:42:42.270 --> 02:42:43.800
that for some reason or another,

2904
02:42:43.810 --> 02:42:47.940
they decided to blame it on people reacting to this movie.

2905
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:53.030
So sort of give people an irrational idea of how Muslims would respond to a,

2906
02:42:54.510 --> 02:42:59.510
any sort of a mocking of their faith and to get us even more,

2907
02:42:59.890 --> 02:43:00.450
you know,

2908
02:43:00.450 --> 02:43:05.450
angry at the idea of Muslims and more excited about the idea of stopping this

2909
02:43:07.410 --> 02:43:10.620
Muslim threat,
this Islamic threat that the world sees.

2910
02:43:10.621 --> 02:43:11.950
And I ran as a part of that,

2911
02:43:12.030 --> 02:43:12.590
<v 6>you know?</v>

2912
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:14.330
<v 3>Exactly.
And why didn't it,</v>

2913
02:43:14.331 --> 02:43:17.870
the government come out when they knew it wasn't exactly directly a result of

2914
02:43:17.871 --> 02:43:20.180
that video?
Why didn't they come out and talk about that?
Right.
Yeah.

2915
02:43:20.370 --> 02:43:24.210
<v 6>Well they don't ever was like the Pat Tillman story or the Jessica Lynch story.</v>

2916
02:43:24.540 --> 02:43:27.360
When they get caught bullshitting,
they never make an okay.
We were bullshitting.

2917
02:43:27.390 --> 02:43:29.550
They never do that.
They never do that.
They just sort of

2918
02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:34.840
<v 3>job to come forward and say that,
that this wasn't really a result of that movie.</v>

2919
02:43:34.841 --> 02:43:37.540
And you didn't see that on the networks.
They didn't do that.

2920
02:43:37.541 --> 02:43:42.520
And instead they just continued to fill the public with this crap propaganda.

2921
02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:46.460
<v 6>So what are you doing now as far as like broadcasting where,</v>

2922
02:43:46.461 --> 02:43:50.670
where can people read your latest stuff?
Who are you working for these days?

2923
02:43:50.671 --> 02:43:52.310
Like how you rocking it?
What are you doing?

2924
02:43:52.450 --> 02:43:54.760
<v 3>I uh,
I'm,
I'm working on a book.</v>

2925
02:43:54.761 --> 02:43:58.640
I felt like the protests were undercovered so the first thing I did was I,

2926
02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:02.760
I do photography.
Um,
it's one of my loves and passions.

2927
02:44:02.761 --> 02:44:06.370
So I've been traveling to all these protests.
That's why we shot it in Anaheim.

2928
02:44:06.570 --> 02:44:06.851
And,

2929
02:44:06.851 --> 02:44:11.530
and taking photos of protests here in the u s and really showing people this is

2930
02:44:11.531 --> 02:44:15.640
happening.
And not only that people are winning,
there are,
there are people,
man,

2931
02:44:15.641 --> 02:44:19.330
these people down in Texas that are fighting the tar sands pipeline,

2932
02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:20.470
they're crazy.

2933
02:44:20.471 --> 02:44:25.471
These old farmers are putting devices on to attach themselves,

2934
02:44:25.690 --> 02:44:29.890
physically attach themselves to equipment that law enforcement has to saw off in

2935
02:44:29.891 --> 02:44:33.730
order to get them away.
And they're burying themselves in the ground.
Yeah.

2936
02:44:33.731 --> 02:44:35.560
I mean they are fighting back.
Yeah.

2937
02:44:35.561 --> 02:44:40.150
Those you don't even know about it not being covered because they're winning and

2938
02:44:40.151 --> 02:44:43.270
they're actually stopping this pipeline from going in or at least stopping the

2939
02:44:43.271 --> 02:44:48.010
construction periodically.
Um,
where is it and what is it about?
Down in Texas,

2940
02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:51.430
they're,
they're building a tar sands pipeline,
uh,
through some communities,

2941
02:44:51.431 --> 02:44:53.800
through some wineries,
some farms and,

2942
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:57.010
and the community is very upset and they've really done what's called direct

2943
02:44:57.011 --> 02:45:01.150
action protesting,
which you can assume what that means.
That's direct action.

2944
02:45:01.151 --> 02:45:02.190
I mean,
they're getting in there and,

2945
02:45:02.191 --> 02:45:05.950
and preventing this construction from taking place.
They're also building houses.

2946
02:45:06.010 --> 02:45:10.540
Tree.
They're taking over trees and forests and building tree houses and having

2947
02:45:10.541 --> 02:45:13.930
professional climbers come in to keep that car.
I know.
You don't know.

2948
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:18.010
It's fascinating.
The heart of the protest.
Um,
I,
I would say there are thousands.

2949
02:45:18.011 --> 02:45:21.970
I mean,
it's going on all across the state and,
and so I'm covering not only that,

2950
02:45:21.971 --> 02:45:25.860
I'm covering a women's right to go topless events.
There is a big event

2951
02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:30.250
<v 6>who is fighting that there are women.
Fuck is fighting that Brian.</v>

2952
02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:32.420
Not me.
Yeah.
I mean

2953
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:36.210
<v 3>some cities as a woman,
man,
you go out there a topless and you'll,</v>

2954
02:45:36.211 --> 02:45:38.180
you'll get cuffed for a disturbing

2955
02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:42.520
<v 6>Columbus,
Ohio.
It's uh,
it was legal to,
uh,</v>

2956
02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:47.380
go outside topless,
but it was illegal to go inside a strip club and be topless,

2957
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:50.500
which no existence of,
that's hilarious.

2958
02:45:50.970 --> 02:45:54.730
That's also strip clubs have to have bikinis yet to have a pastries.
Oh,

2959
02:45:54.731 --> 02:45:58.750
that's hilarious.
But you can be topless outside.
You can just walk outside.

2960
02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:03.140
And some guys have moves or man boobs that are bigger than the women and women,

2961
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:05.890
way more disgusting.
The lookout to better areola.

2962
02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:08.170
Who the fuck is stopping women from going topless?

2963
02:46:08.410 --> 02:46:10.130
What kind of a weak ass culture?

2964
02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:14.060
<v 5>So,
so they're winning these proteins.
These women are winning.
Like we always see,</v>

2965
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:16.190
oh,
occupied.
So stupid.

2966
02:46:16.191 --> 02:46:18.350
And they're not getting any change done and they're not winning.

2967
02:46:18.351 --> 02:46:22.040
Actually they are winning and there's a lot of cases where they have have one

2968
02:46:22.041 --> 02:46:25.370
and that's what this book's covering in that what else is going to Piss a lot of

2969
02:46:25.371 --> 02:46:26.204
people?

2970
02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:28.510
<v 6>Well,
you're not worried about it.
This pissing people off.</v>

2971
02:46:28.511 --> 02:46:30.160
You're worried about like their lily.
All right.

2972
02:46:30.161 --> 02:46:31.840
Now this chick is really a problem.

2973
02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:36.440
<v 5>Um,
with NDA.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I am.</v>

2974
02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:41.210
Um,
but uh,
I think a lot,
like I said,
a lot of investigative journalists are,

2975
02:46:41.211 --> 02:46:42.680
but it will,
it stop me.
Hell No.

2976
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:45.750
It just makes me put in now and putting it now I put up that Fuck Nda,

2977
02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:48.770
a poster and I'm putting that one in the book,
you know?

2978
02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:52.130
<v 6>Do you know anybody that's been put on like no fly lists or any of those things?</v>

2979
02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:55.690
<v 5>Yeah.
We had a one of,
even a CNN journalists you think,
oh,</v>

2980
02:46:55.691 --> 02:46:58.240
they don't mess with the mainstream media.
A journalist,

2981
02:46:58.241 --> 02:47:02.610
a colleague of mine investigated the TSA and was put on a no fly list.
Wow.
Yeah.

2982
02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:05.530
For quite some time to try to intimidate him.

2983
02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:08.720
<v 6>So if you investigate the Tsa,</v>

2984
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:11.540
they can put you on a list that says you can't fly.

2985
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:12.110
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2986
02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:16.530
They do that to a critical politicians and they've done it to journalists and,

2987
02:47:16.540 --> 02:47:20.550
and they did this to a CNN journalist.
Wow.
Yeah.
And,
and,

2988
02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:24.320
and as a reporter,
especially at CNN,
you need to travel.
That's your job.

2989
02:47:24.321 --> 02:47:26.720
You're traveling all the time.
So,
so it really affected,

2990
02:47:26.970 --> 02:47:31.110
<v 6>so what happens when you go to the airport,
they say you can't fly.
That's it.</v>

2991
02:47:31.170 --> 02:47:32.210
There's no,
you have no worries.

2992
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:34.870
<v 5>Of course,
I've never been on,
on the list,
but,</v>

2993
02:47:34.871 --> 02:47:39.000
but I know he wasn't able to travel within the country,
so yeah.

2994
02:47:39.090 --> 02:47:41.700
<v 6>Tell your fucking car.
So he has to go greyhound bus everywhere.</v>

2995
02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:44.770
<v 5>Yeah.
Or drive or what they do as they say,</v>

2996
02:47:44.771 --> 02:47:48.220
they're investigating it and maybe they drag on that investigation for months

2997
02:47:48.221 --> 02:47:52.440
before they take your name off that list.
I haven't been put on that list yet.
Um,

2998
02:47:52.810 --> 02:47:54.190
but yeah,

2999
02:47:54.191 --> 02:47:59.080
I mean it's just big brother or trying to intimidate a descent and not only that

3000
02:47:59.081 --> 02:48:03.150
intimidate politicians who would be against their behavior as well as,

3001
02:48:03.151 --> 02:48:06.670
as journalists.
I don't think they'd mess with me because they know I would,

3002
02:48:06.671 --> 02:48:09.740
I would race so much hell about it.
Um,

3003
02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:14.710
or maybe I haven't investigated the TSA yet.
I,
uh,
that's probably why.
Wow.

3004
02:48:15.010 --> 02:48:17.650
What a weird,
weird world we live in.
Yeah.
I mean,

3005
02:48:17.651 --> 02:48:19.210
could you imagine going to the airport,

3006
02:48:19.211 --> 02:48:21.970
you're going to visit grandma or maybe it's an emergency,

3007
02:48:21.971 --> 02:48:25.510
a funeral or something and you're told you can't fly for what?

3008
02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:28.510
Because you're a journalist and you actually are exposing corruption in the

3009
02:48:28.511 --> 02:48:32.460
government,
which is our job for,
or you're Joe Rogan and you,

3010
02:48:32.570 --> 02:48:35.740
you got the Joe Rogan experience and you spoke out against the Tsa.

3011
02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:37.330
Have you ever been on a list

3012
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:39.030
<v 6>again and to get us in trouble?</v>

3013
02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:42.930
He has too many people in here that are on the government list.

3014
02:48:42.931 --> 02:48:45.330
So we're going to get the list by association,
I think.
Well,

3015
02:48:45.331 --> 02:48:49.970
we're not doing anything.
We're just talking dude.
Yeah,
don't worry.

3016
02:48:50.250 --> 02:48:54.090
We're,
we're taking the easy route.
We're giving them eyes.
Is that what it is?

3017
02:48:54.091 --> 02:48:56.580
Or giving them the,
yeah,
the voice.
You know what I mean?

3018
02:48:56.581 --> 02:48:59.040
So it's like prom hard stop.
No,
it's a part of it though.

3019
02:48:59.041 --> 02:49:00.610
So we're probably on the list.
They're probably fine,

3020
02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:03.690
but we're not on the list because we get it.
We could still fly.
Sure.

3021
02:49:03.930 --> 02:49:07.420
Well not on that list.
We were on the Webcam.
Look at us masculine.
They like us.

3022
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:11.470
<v 1>That's the problem I've gotten.
I've gotten a the,
yeah,</v>

3023
02:49:11.471 --> 02:49:16.200
the masturbation videos.
I make weird faces posted over it.
No good.

3024
02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:19.850
It was good.
Bet You want to watch.
It's worse than that.
They're good at.
I'm good.

3025
02:49:20.090 --> 02:49:22.460
Hear us.
You know,
if they,
that's even worse.

3026
02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:25.170
Not being able to see us and just hearing an go.
Okay,

3027
02:49:25.171 --> 02:49:28.230
so what if someone came to you and said they hacked into your computer and they

3028
02:49:28.231 --> 02:49:30.600
had video of you masturbating?

3029
02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:36.240
You guys are so,
they can't mess it up.
I'm not kidding.
I'm kidding.
Oh,

3030
02:49:36.250 --> 02:49:39.540
please don't put it online.
No,
it would suck.
But I wouldn't be like,
oh,

3031
02:49:39.541 --> 02:49:42.450
here's $1 million.
But what if they said,
okay,

3032
02:49:42.451 --> 02:49:46.790
you need to not have that guest on your show.
No.
Or I'm going to leak this video.

3033
02:49:46.810 --> 02:49:48.030
Yes,
you're going to have to have a video of me

3034
02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:51.170
<v 0>beating off cause it's,
it's ridiculous.
It's not that big a deal.
You know?</v>

3035
02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:53.750
It's like if you really want to have that video and put it out there,

3036
02:49:53.930 --> 02:49:54.441
first of all,

3037
02:49:54.441 --> 02:49:57.380
everyone's going to know that you can do that and it's going to be massive

3038
02:49:57.381 --> 02:50:00.950
outrage that you turn on someone for whatever reason.
You just,

3039
02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:03.650
you've been videotaping them beating off the whole time.

3040
02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:06.610
That's some UNAMERICAN bullshit right there.
That's Riddick.

3041
02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:08.620
<v 1>It depends if there's any ass play on it,</v>

3042
02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:14.810
but there always is Brian.
So why are you playing games?
Maybe.
Fuck yeah,

3043
02:50:14.811 --> 02:50:18.230
you're going to,
you're going to come to me with a cold sweat.

3044
02:50:18.231 --> 02:50:20.600
We can't have this guy on David seemed man.
Really?

3045
02:50:20.601 --> 02:50:22.940
We're going to do it David Seaman podcasts again.
Fuck that.

3046
02:50:22.941 --> 02:50:27.520
Let's get Joey d as on all the sudden if you start saying that you don't know,

3047
02:50:27.530 --> 02:50:31.440
someone's got a videos,
he'll be sweating and shit.
Yeah.
You're so sweaty,
man.

3048
02:50:31.441 --> 02:50:36.220
What's gonna be the secret word.
So you know what I'm doing.
I'm
a second.

3049
02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:41.080
My finger out is not fucking Weirdo.
Damn son.

3050
02:50:41.090 --> 02:50:44.130
Five minutes.
You know,
I was thinking of your show and okay.

3051
02:50:44.250 --> 02:50:46.790
<v 3>Thinking on my way here of how I,</v>

3052
02:50:46.810 --> 02:50:51.410
I I think that your show will go down in history as a show that told the truth

3053
02:50:51.411 --> 02:50:56.000
and actually had,
um,
it was,
it was a strange rise out of,

3054
02:50:56.030 --> 02:50:59.240
out of the mix and to something that you know,

3055
02:50:59.630 --> 02:51:03.360
is really becoming one of the leading voices of,

3056
02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:04.950
of truth and it,

3057
02:51:05.050 --> 02:51:10.040
when it comes to podcasts and other content and you guys are really starting to

3058
02:51:10.041 --> 02:51:14.630
fill that vacuum,
uh,
that has been created by the mainstream media.

3059
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.261
<v 0>Well,</v>

3060
02:51:15.261 --> 02:51:19.040
it's just weird to me that there's not something like this in the mainstream

3061
02:51:19.041 --> 02:51:19.940
media that someone,

3062
02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:24.140
it's like I look at things that are fascinating to me and the world is filled

3063
02:51:24.141 --> 02:51:27.720
with them and some of them involve corruption and the other ones involved big

3064
02:51:27.721 --> 02:51:31.730
foot and crop circles and Ufos and aliens and all.

3065
02:51:31.731 --> 02:51:35.160
I'm interested in a lot of different things,
but it you,

3066
02:51:35.180 --> 02:51:40.180
you don't see a lot of discussion on these things,

3067
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:46.850
whether it's an odd,
crazy things like big foot or Ufo Z,
you don't,

3068
02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:50.090
you don't see much real legitimate discussion about psychedelics.

3069
02:51:50.091 --> 02:51:55.010
You don't see much real legitimate discussion about the possible repercussions

3070
02:51:55.070 --> 02:51:59.860
of the way society is progressing and what is a solution to or to really teach

3071
02:51:59.870 --> 02:52:03.710
change the whole thing.
You don't see much legitimate discussion about that.

3072
02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:05.950
And I've always found that I don't,

3073
02:52:05.951 --> 02:52:10.540
I don't know why that exists when that's always what I would get together with

3074
02:52:10.541 --> 02:52:14.740
my friends and talk about when when me and my friends would be alone,
you know,

3075
02:52:14.741 --> 02:52:18.220
at a restaurant somewhere and someone would talk about something or Eddie Bravo

3076
02:52:18.221 --> 02:52:21.730
would bring up some video we saw or Brian would talk about something that was on

3077
02:52:21.731 --> 02:52:24.130
the Internet and,
and we would all sit around and talk about it.

3078
02:52:24.130 --> 02:52:28.270
I never understood why there was nothing,
no show that had these points of view.

3079
02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:29.530
There was no show that was like,

3080
02:52:29.531 --> 02:52:32.920
what is going on here where everybody seems to be pretending that everything's

3081
02:52:32.921 --> 02:52:33.754
fine and everybody,

3082
02:52:33.940 --> 02:52:38.780
everybody seems to be pretending that everything is going along,
you know,

3083
02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:43.300
a manageable course and we're going to be fine.
And I don't,
I don't see that.

3084
02:52:43.301 --> 02:52:45.700
I see madness,
I see chaos.

3085
02:52:45.701 --> 02:52:50.701
I see people that have way more power than they have knowledge and

3086
02:52:52.871 --> 02:52:53.890
enlightenment.
They have,

3087
02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:58.910
there's this weird sort of situation where I don't understand exactly who's

3088
02:52:59.231 --> 02:53:01.990
running the show and I don't think anybody does.

3089
02:53:01.991 --> 02:53:06.991
And then there's this dog and pony presidential debate and eventual election,

3090
02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:10.330
which if anything changes at all,
it'd be social issues.
You know,

3091
02:53:10.331 --> 02:53:13.600
that's all that ever really changed as gay marriage is the beach ball that gets

3092
02:53:13.601 --> 02:53:17.350
tossed back and forth and maybe medical marijuana is going to be the next one.

3093
02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:20.040
But Obama's already lied about that.
You know,
the,
the,

3094
02:53:20.041 --> 02:53:23.140
they lied about whether or not they were going to use the DEA to go after

3095
02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:26.830
medical marijuana dispensary.
So I've been doing that like crazy lately.
It's it,

3096
02:53:27.010 --> 02:53:31.030
it's a weird thing when you realize that it doesn't matter who wins.

3097
02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:32.270
So weird thing

3098
02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:32.850
<v 5>isn't it?</v>

3099
02:53:32.850 --> 02:53:36.210
It's just a such a strange enlightenment to wake up and things are fine.

3100
02:53:36.810 --> 02:53:40.870
It doesn't matter.
I,
I've,
I've recently had that and it,
and are you going to vote

3101
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:45.970
me?
I just historically speaking,
I,
I,

3102
02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:49.110
I don't vote because I don't want a dog in the race.

3103
02:53:49.111 --> 02:53:50.880
And I know I get criticized for this all the time,

3104
02:53:50.881 --> 02:53:53.490
but I know if I do go in and take the time to vote for someone,

3105
02:53:53.491 --> 02:53:57.540
I'm going to be secretly rooting for them.
And that's a problem we're having now.

3106
02:53:57.541 --> 02:54:00.870
I think with people not criticizing Obama enough journalists,

3107
02:54:01.050 --> 02:54:04.680
because journalists tend to be more liberal and they're scared to criticize him

3108
02:54:04.681 --> 02:54:07.410
for Nda.
And that's why we're not seeing these vital issues covered.

3109
02:54:07.411 --> 02:54:10.290
So I feel like as journalists,
I feel like we shouldn't vote,

3110
02:54:10.470 --> 02:54:11.850
we should not have a dog in the race.

3111
02:54:11.851 --> 02:54:14.910
We should be able to stand back regardless of party and,

3112
02:54:15.090 --> 02:54:18.360
and just look for the truth and really criticized,
go after everyone.

3113
02:54:18.361 --> 02:54:19.250
I mean that's our job is

3114
02:54:20.290 --> 02:54:24.310
<v 6>I say it's a piss everyone off.
That's our excuse now Brian.
No voting.
Yeah,</v>

3115
02:54:24.390 --> 02:54:27.960
that's fine.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Well it keeps you on one jury duty.
Yeah.

3116
02:54:29.410 --> 02:54:33.050
No,
I encourage everyone to vote and be active.
But I as a journalist,

3117
02:54:33.051 --> 02:54:35.390
I encourage everybody to take mushrooms and be active that way.

3118
02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:38.870
Maestro and whatever way you want to.
Ryan doesn't agree with me.

3119
02:54:38.930 --> 02:54:40.250
I encourage ass play.

3120
02:54:43.850 --> 02:54:47.420
I encourage everybody to follow Amber Lyon on Twitter.
Yeah.
Amber,
l.

3121
02:54:47.421 --> 02:54:50.750
Y.
O.
N.
Look,
thank you very much for just being awesome.

3122
02:54:50.751 --> 02:54:54.650
What you've done is as very courageous and it's very rare.
It's a,

3123
02:54:54.651 --> 02:54:58.070
it's you've taken a very unique path and uh,
I think,

3124
02:54:58.430 --> 02:55:00.950
I think you're on the right side of history.
Does that make you feel good?

3125
02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.950
That means a lot.
Appreciate it.
Thank you everybody tuning in to this

3126
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:08.060
<v 0>fabulous podcast.
Uh,
we're not going anywhere.
You dirty bitches this weekend.</v>

3127
02:55:08.061 --> 02:55:11.750
We will be in Phoenix,
Arizona at standup live.

3128
02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:15.290
Many of the shows are already sold out.
There's two shows.
Friday,
two shows.

3129
02:55:15.291 --> 02:55:19.700
Saturday one show Sunday.
Brian red band will be joining.
Holla at your boy.

3130
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:23.690
Be so fun.
Yeah.
As was the ice house last night.
Thank you so much.

3131
02:55:23.691 --> 02:55:27.680
Everybody came out to the ice house last night.
What a fucking show.
So fun.

3132
02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:31.640
I mean,
the crowds that we get,
I just,
we couldn't have asked for a better,

3133
02:55:32.180 --> 02:55:36.080
a better thing happening.
We've could not,
there's no,
I'm not even saying us.

3134
02:55:36.081 --> 02:55:38.360
Right?
We couldn't have imagined that.

3135
02:55:38.361 --> 02:55:42.020
What's going on right now with these shows and with the podcast ever could have

3136
02:55:42.021 --> 02:55:46.040
happened.
It's,
it's not a call.
You guys are really nice.
The best call Deborah.

3137
02:55:46.580 --> 02:55:48.480
No one's running this call,
by the way.
I'm not.
I don't,

3138
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:49.500
I don't know what the fuck the room,

3139
02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.880
the techs running this call with his little desk squad.

Dot TV is where you could pick up your funky fresh kitty cat tee shirts.

3145
02:56:07.940 --> 02:56:12.320
There's two of them.
One of them has the hypnotic super cat on it.

3146
02:56:12.321 --> 02:56:14.390
That's what I'm calling the new one,
the hypnotic supercat.

3147
02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:18.320
I love that fucking cat who,
and the guy just got a tattoo of it very recently.

3148
02:56:18.350 --> 02:56:20.910
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Sorry.
