00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>and interestingly after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I dealt with coming out was I</v>

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>would tell someone and then I would get</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little burst of feeling better.</v>

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I would suddenly cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like constricting my heart.</v>

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And when I would tell someone it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would open up a little and I'd feel</v>

6
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>better and I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really could feel like I could breathe</v>

7
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really felt better.</v>

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And then I would wait until that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure would start building again.</v>

9
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I would wait months and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would tell someone and then I would do</v>

10
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>this over the course of like two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually I realized,</v>

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:31.471
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>every time I tell somebody this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is horrible and they're</v>

13
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>pretty much okay and I feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

14
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I got to end this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to end this now.</v>

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically when I told the</v>

16
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>remaining people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

17
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird secret because the people</v>

18
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>that do care that don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not worth knowing.</v>

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally nobody,</v>

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>nobody that I told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>my dad struggled for a little bit or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

22
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This and that.</v>

23
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>My a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that mostly people got was</v>

24
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>that nobody believed I was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like my mate.</v>

25
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Did you play basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You play basketball,</v>

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

27
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So nobody could believe like they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't seem gay.</v>

28
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ks dancing.</v>

29
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I learned my dancing from cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my move,</v>

30
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of that like,</v>

31
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>so that was the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was just sideswiped.</v>

32
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times people will say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you act straight or you're straight</v>

34
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>acting or saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in the gay community has thought</v>

35
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this great thing,</v>

36
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

37
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>if you're straight acting your</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

38
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>it's really great.</v>

39
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't take it that way because every</v>

40
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>time someone says it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel like a freak.</v>

41
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why am I,</v>

42
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I am who I am.</v>

43
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

44
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had gay sex last night after I</v>

45
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>had that grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

46
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm married to a guy there.</v>

47
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a gay person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a pretty gay married to a</v>

48
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

49
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty gay.</v>

50
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what I realized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

51
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm marrying this dude.</v>

52
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean?</v>

53
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

54
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it back now.</v>

56
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>it was a phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>this is a long face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really like,</v>

59
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dragging out this phase thing.</v>

60
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>But I realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if I felt better when I told people</v>

61
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there had to be some value in that</v>

62
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>in a way that I couldn't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

63
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to the,</v>

64
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>to the straight acting like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means nothing to me when I meet guys</v>

65
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>that are completely flaming or if I meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that are that you'd have no idea.</v>

66
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Like I like people based on their values</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their sense of humor and like shit</v>

67
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never asked to wall people that matter</v>

68
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>as as yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>

69
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>that sort of a great way to bring this</v>
<v Speaker 1>all around because that gets away from</v>

70
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>judging people on what you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about them and all that social</v>

71
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior and regressive bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus judging people on the content of</v>

72
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>their character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the highlight of my,</v>

73
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training as a person.</v>

74
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>training George for those two weeks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first three days that I was with</v>

76
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so mind blowing that how famous</v>

77
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were coming up,</v>

78
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>morning taken photos we were eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after the third day,</v>

79
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>fourth day fee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you realize this thing,</v>

80
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machine doesn't turn off.</v>

81
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>he can't go to the chemist to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shampoo.</v>

83
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>He can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>let's call</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the cameras.</v>

85
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck are you getting your</v>

86
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:26.074
<v Speaker 1>champion?</v>

87
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>He might go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might go into the toilets to pass</v>

88
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>stool and you got people waiting at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the cubicle to wait to get a</v>

89
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>photo with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

90
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>and then we've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time we went somewhere,</v>

91
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I'd always have to be through the VIP</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrance.</v>

92
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't walked through the front</v>
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>

93
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Montreal.</v>

94
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>So one time we went to a nightclub and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we've got an in through the VIP and</v>

95
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>then we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll walk into our,</v>

96
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our table and then we're about maybe 15</v>

97
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 1>feet from their table and someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews Birger as p.</v>

98

<v Speaker 1>The whole dance floor stopped dancing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everyone's looked at us turn and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole club's walk towards that table.</v>

100
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>without losing a beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've turned straight back around and</v>

102
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:10.600

128
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always looks way smalls and then</v>

129
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>certainly just juice for just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction,</v>

130
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.400
<v Speaker 1>just so he's had our eyesight of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

131
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>of the fans.</v>

132
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's everyone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>back gate because it from walking a</v>

135
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>hundred feet would be a half an hour.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And</v>

138
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 2>this film project thing in Alaska and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracked down this guy that killed the</v>

140
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Kodiak bear with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buck knife.</v>

141
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

142
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old older guy too.</v>

143
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.090
<v Speaker 2>His name was Jeanne Moe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a ton of articles written</v>

144
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.130
<v Speaker 2>about it and like outdoor life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this was back,</v>

145
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.090
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't really put the knife in a</v>

146
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 2>musket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're these bear stories and I</v>

147
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 2>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tracking down some of these</v>

148
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 2>barriers during this bears darker and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on Kodiak island.</v>

149
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Kodiak Brown bears are the biggest bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>

150
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 2>but they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not that many attacks,</v>

151
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 2>surprisingly for the size of the bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the many there are.</v>

152
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 2>But there's probably also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also not,</v>

153
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Kodiak island isn't like yellowstone</v>
<v Speaker 2>park.</v>

154
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't have that many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really,</v>

155
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 2>so he's getting out of deer turns around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Baird's just on him,</v>

156
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 2>all he has is the knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's like trying to fight it off,</v>

157
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:32.171
<v Speaker 2>stabbing the thing and the bear like</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory piece out of his arm,</v>

158
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:33.420
<v Speaker 2>out of his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picks him up,</v>

159
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 2>is shaking them around.</v>

160
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Then the bear goes off and it one point</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just like thought he was done.</v>

161
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 2>He's like yelling at the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear comes back mauls him another time</v>

162
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:47.951
<v Speaker 2>you stab it and fighting it off and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he stabbed it enough times.</v>

163
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 2>He kept like trying to feed his arm</v>
<v Speaker 2>whilst just like he said he was out of</v>

164
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the bear when officer like laid</v>

165
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>down was bleeding out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've crawled to his rifle at that</v>

166
00:06:58.401 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

167
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember if the bear was dead or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

168
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 2>but he shot it after the bear was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like laying there and then hikes,</v>

169
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

170
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:08.460
<v Speaker 2>four miles back to the beach and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

171
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember how old he was.</v>

172
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 2>He had [inaudible] 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

173
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I remember this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

174
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 2>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he says,</v>

175
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 2>so then his son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they me to son,</v>

176
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 2>they take them to this.</v>

177
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 2>There's one cab in there where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>year round residents and uh,</v>

178
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 2>it was actually on I think raspberry</v>
<v Speaker 2>island there and they bring them into</v>

179
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:32.500
<v Speaker 2>this cabin and there was a German couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lives there and like he said,</v>

180
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brought him in the cabin and for</v>

181
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 2>some reason I cannot remember exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

182
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 2>but the dude that owned the cabin ended</v>
<v Speaker 2>up taking a chainsaw and cutting out the</v>

183
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:44.420
<v Speaker 2>wall so the rescuers could come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a stretcher in like stabilize him</v>

184
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>cause he's just dying on the table and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take him to Kodiak hospital,</v>

185
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 2>do all the surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin grafts,</v>

186
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.210
<v Speaker 2>everything's saved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His life ended up getting,</v>

187
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 2>keeping like you end up buying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bareback at an auction and uh,</v>

188
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 2>they may like a rug thing.</v>

189
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why the the Romans,</v>

190
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean when they were feeding the lions</v>
<v Speaker 3>are Christians.</v>

191
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that was all bout.</v>

192
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:10.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like to see how long that guy can</v>
<v Speaker 3>last in there just to get her Saudi or</v>

193
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 3>release at ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check this out.</v>

194
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the story that I did not know</v>

195
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what though it up,</v>

196
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 3>it was after day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would the have the beastie their fight</v>

197
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 3>each other or they'll dive the lie on</v>
<v Speaker 3>seat Cristianos or something than a</v>

198
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 3>typical thing is that after the end of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day when a whole bunch of these</v>

199
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 3>animals have been killed in one fight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

200
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 3>the Roman emperors to kind of look cool</v>
<v Speaker 3>and popular with the crowds who then</v>

201
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 3>distribute the meat to all the poor</v>
<v Speaker 3>people of Rome.</v>

202
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 3>So all the animals killed India in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would then be eaten by all the poorest</v>

203
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 3>people in Rome as a Freebie because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are a poor person and you're more likely</v>

204
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 3>than not.</v>

205
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.240
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty close to starving a lot of</v>

206
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>the times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

207
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Get them be thrown away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You eat scene,</v>

208
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You eat the whole,</v>

209
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 3>whatever they give you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat it.</v>

210
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means that among other things,</v>

211
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:05.751
<v Speaker 3>they would end up as weird exotic dish</v>
<v Speaker 3>in on the on Arrow one table.</v>

212
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Sometime you get also the interiors of</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that have just been eating</v>

213
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So through via second hand,</v>

214
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you're also eating people cc or eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach contents of a lie on that just</v>

215
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:20.050
<v Speaker 3>got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>

216
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 3>INA and ally on just finish feeding on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christie and so you're having a Lion</v>

217
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.753
<v Speaker 3>Christiane Burger for yourself.</v>

218
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.500
