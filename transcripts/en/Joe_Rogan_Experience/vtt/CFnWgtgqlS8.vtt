2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the important thing is that like seeing</v>

4
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those images on those shows where</v>

5
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>they're repeating over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

6
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>They have all these graphic images of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies and pulling things out of bodies</v>

7
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty intense that you're,</v>

8
00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you're taking that stuff into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

9
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>You're taking that stuff into your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bank of experiences.</v>

10
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't like sexual stuff on television</v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

11
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 1>He believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean like girls making out or like</v>

12
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>let's say I'm watching Diane Sawyer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a condom commercial.</v>

13
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll lose my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A condom commercial will bother you.</v>

14
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to choke myself and my wife was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room.</v>

17
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.520

<v Speaker 1>some older woman since I was a kid.</v>

18
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>KOTEX commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sit down and look straight</v>

19
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

20
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I never get so embarrassed in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to ask me if I know</v>

21
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to fucking know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood comes out of this match</v>

22
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>what you put up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to do it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The sight of blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>commercial comes up.</v>

42
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Even when I'm by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel creepy.</v>

43

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play to walk the fuck is that</v>

49
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Zombie?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's broken.</v>

51
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>That one's broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just.</v>

52
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>That means I didn't get that one fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this day,</v>

53
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>anything back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little sprays,</v>

54
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>anything bad and television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 o'clock drives me up the fucking</v>

55
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:11.844
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

56
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 2>The reason I know this and I want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shameless plug.</v>

57
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 2>My Buddy Ben Wallace has this great</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

58
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 2>the billionaire's vinegar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's about the most expensive bottle</v>

59
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 2>of wine ever sold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like what is good wine?</v>

60
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Do we know good wine when we taste?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

61
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get really old shit,</v>

62
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>most likely it's not good anymore.</v>

63
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as his book explains is the problem is</v>

64
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bottle.</v>

65
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 2>The most expensive bottle of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every soul wound up being fraudulent,</v>

66
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was purported to be owned by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Jefferson.</v>

67
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for like Steve Forbes zoned for</v>

68
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 2>awhile and all these different guys on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bottle line,</v>

69
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 2>one of the Koch brothers don't want it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a while and in the end there's no</v>

70
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 2>one around who can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of wine from that year.</v>

71
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Spray down the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't crazy though that</v>

72
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 2>these different rich guys had the wine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sold it to each other,</v>

73
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.740
<v Speaker 2>like they passed it on Forbes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stored in a,</v>

74
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>put it in a in their corporate</v>
<v Speaker 2>headquarters and they had an a box,</v>

75
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 2>like a glass lift boxes of decoration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they hadn't standing upright with a</v>

76
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:20.131
<v Speaker 2>heat lamp in there or dried that cork</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and the felt in the bottle.</v>

77
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 2>So later when people were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze what was in it,</v>

78
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>there can never rule out the intrusion</v>
<v Speaker 2>of foreign substances which will not</v>

79
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 2>allow them to find out what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy they eventually like is why the</v>

80
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 2>guy who created the hoax would take</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good wine and do weird stuff to</v>

81
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd put a little bit of vanilla</v>

82
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 2>extract in here or he'd put some dirt</v>
<v Speaker 2>from his gutter in.</v>

83
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:49.541
<v Speaker 2>They're just weird things he could do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of throw people and then guys that</v>

84
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 2>are like big swinging dicks about wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're tasting.</v>

85
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:53.210
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

86
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a brilliant book,</v>

87
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:58.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

88
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a serious question.</v>

89
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Is there a guy that has ever existed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a full suit of armor in his</v>

90
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:05.670
<v Speaker 1>house that isn't a douchebag?</v>

91
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
