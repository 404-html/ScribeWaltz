78
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:51.961

79
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they live in America.</v>

80
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's really disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels strange.</v>

81
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:04.561
<v Speaker 1>Not there's anything wrong with talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people from India and most certainly </v>

82
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>is nothing wrong with talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from India,</v>

83
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:06.390
<v Speaker 1>but when you're on the phone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

84
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you know they're not even in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a head trip.</v>

85
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like what Dell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you do?</v>

86
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever companies do it.</v>

87
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

88
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Why is he these people on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world in a sweat factory phone </v>

89
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.551
<v Speaker 1>answering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel like the company </v>

90
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.351
<v Speaker 1>doesn't care about any of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end it feels like you're being </v>

91
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:33.361
<v Speaker 1>put off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta think like how many </v>

92
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>knucklehead fucking phone calls if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are running a computer company,</v>

93
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.400
<v Speaker 1>say if you're selling windows computers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got a customer service line,</v>

94
00:04:40.401 --> 00:04:45.401
<v Speaker 1>just stop and think about the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>numb skull questions your friends have </v>

95
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>asked you about their computers.</v>

96
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Like you know that one friend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get a laptop until he was 30.</v>

97
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>

98
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting in and starts asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.180
<v Speaker 1>She had something wrong with my video </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

102
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes a lot of sense.</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>How fucking what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where were you living when you live in </v>

104
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.340

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

108
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:12.030

<v Speaker 1>So what I'm,</v>

109
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>what I was thinking is that that job is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>that's like nobody wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why they pawn it off </v>

111
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>after a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd probably fuck it.</v>

112

<v Speaker 1>we can't do this.</v>

113

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to be interested in learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

119
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>that's the tough part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're starting from scratch now,</v>

120
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking too much,</v>

122
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>searching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clicking and pasting and control,</v>

123
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:47.570
<v Speaker 1>seeing and control all the leading and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

125
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>we've been fucking hitting keyboards for</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long when someone's never done it and</v>

126
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>they're like looking for the why and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

127
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back tomorrow.</v>

128
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a new pop</v>

129
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 3>machines that they have where you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose all the different flavors.</v>

130
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Like coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coke,</v>

131
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 3>orange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was behind an old couple of last night</v>

132
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 3>at Boston market and it took them like </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes.</v>

133
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:11.441
<v Speaker 3>Just a poor cocacola.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there used to places where they </v>

134
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 3>actually are the options.</v>

135
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.070
<v Speaker 1>They're from a generation where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered a coke and then someone brought </v>

136
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.070
<v Speaker 1>it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.110
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have to work at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant</v>

138
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.270
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made the coke at the place.</v>

139
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>We'll just get through these sponsors </v>
<v Speaker 1>real quick.</v>

140
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also brought to you by ting.</v>

141
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>If you go to [inaudible] dot ting.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you never heard of ting.</v>

142
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Ting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.730
<v Speaker 1>one of our favorite sponsors because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only one that we have other </v>

144
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 1>than squarespace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I've never heard anybody say</v>

145
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>a single negative thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who's used it loves it.</v>

146
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Guys that are on the podcast regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Chris Ryan,</v>

147
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>he used it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says it saved them money.</v>

148
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.110
<v Speaker 1>They say that 98 percent of people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>save money with Ting and that's what it </v>

149
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 1>says on their website because they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile differently and what they mean by</v>

150
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

151
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>they don't have contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be connected with them</v>

152
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>in a way that it makes it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable to get out of it.</v>

153
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.760
<v Speaker 1>What they have is real straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense cellular service.</v>

154
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>It's available on the sprint network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They buy time on the sprint backbone.</v>

155
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So you're dealing with a really high end</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone signal.</v>

156
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.710
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with four G,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with the top Nokia </v>

157
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.671
<v Speaker 1>devices that top Samsung devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the bad ass android devices on the </v>

158
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:32.351
<v Speaker 1>big screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once that's what they sell and you can </v>

159
00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:32.351
<v Speaker 1>bring them over from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 1>from a sprint as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

161
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have phones for sprints,</v>

162
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>particularly even iphones for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forecast,</v>

163
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>you can bring them over from sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

164
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.530
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do is give you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>no bullshit cell phone service where </v>

165
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.240
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to rip you off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They charge you a decent rate for an </v>

166
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>excellent service and everybody's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an ethical way to do business.</v>

167
00:07:55.011 --> 00:08:00.011
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting approach and we've </v>

168
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>had nothing but positive feedback from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that have used it.</v>

169
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian saved $100 or something when he </v>

170
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

171
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I save $100 every month using my team,</v>

<v Speaker 3>got this galaxy note three,</v>

173

<v Speaker 3>I've been using it like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And My bill last month was 27 bucks.</v>

174
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.790
<v Speaker 3>You can buy six dozen roses with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking sell it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which was the Samsung Galaxy note three.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so into this phone.</v>

180
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a better phone for doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that.</v>

181
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so big that it just makes me,</v>

182
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me like,</v>

183
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.550

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're moving it</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like the build quality.</v>

201
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 4>It's all aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty sleek.</v>

202
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.620
<v Speaker 4>That's that one on the far right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bad ass.</v>

203
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably the right side.</v>

204
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:43.311
<v Speaker 4>I always say that people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my phone's probably too big like three </v>

205
00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:43.311
<v Speaker 4>months from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like what am I doing?</v>

206
00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 4>This big fucking stupid thing on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>ipad.</v>

207
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting to not like this flap as </v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

208
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.530
<v Speaker 4>Like the slabs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Annoying.</v>

209
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't like the book.</v>

210
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to go back to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular case.</v>

211
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>

212
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Because it seems like you have to hold </v>
<v Speaker 4>it weird.</v>

213
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel like it can grip it or </v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you got?</v>

214
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 4>You've got a mirror in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the flap.</v>

215
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 4>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Handsome.</v>

216
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 4>I keep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep my powder.</v>

217
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Open it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine there's like a little lip balm.</v>

218
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.900
<v Speaker 4>Their little thing you unscrew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

219
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 4>at first I thought it was really cool </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now it's annoying.</v>

220
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't feel good on the hand.</v>

221
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

222
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 4>it's goofy for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to.</v>

223
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.220
<v Speaker 4>If you're trying to do anything with one</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand,</v>

224
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you have to spin it around </v>
<v Speaker 4>and hold it in place and I guess it's </v>

225
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:25.460
<v Speaker 4>not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not too bad.</v>

226
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.351
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'll miss it when it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for now get all depressed.</v>

227
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.540

<v Speaker 4>And you can save 25 bucks off of any of </v>

228

<v Speaker 4>their new phones that they sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as we said,</v>

229
00:10:38.551 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 4>they're all the top of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Android phones,</v>

230
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.770
<v Speaker 4>the ones that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually using right now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Get yourself some fucking roses.</v>

232

242
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.890
<v Speaker 4>We're also brought to you by [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 4>dot com on it is o n n I t,</v>

243
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.040
<v Speaker 4>and if you've paid attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

244
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.650
<v Speaker 4>some of the more recent things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamins a,</v>

245
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.720
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fascinating blog that aubrey put up </v>

246
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 4>over it on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vitamins.</v>

247
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:36.070
<v Speaker 4>There's all this debate about whether or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not these new studies showed vitamins to</v>

248
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:38.180
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

249
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 4>to be dangerous or have to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>ineffective.</v>

250
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 4>And the study is actually a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty limited.</v>

251
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.700
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of shocked that they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>make the conclusions from this study </v>

252
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 4>that they made because what the study </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed was first of all,</v>

253
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 4>people who had already had heart disease</v>

254
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>and these are very minimal doses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>synthetic vitamins too.</v>

255
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And they showed people with a heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart that had already had heart </v>

256
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.930
<v Speaker 1>attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like recovery from heart attacks.</v>

257
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.410
<v Speaker 1>People showing a cognitive decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I forget there was one other one,</v>

258
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.980
<v Speaker 1>but the idea behind it was that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were showing that vitamins we're just </v>

259
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.780
<v Speaker 1>not effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that because in these three cases </v>

260
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.961
<v Speaker 1>that they're stating that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>show in a positive impact using what are</v>

261
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 1>essentially synthetic vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to get vitamins for sure is</v>

262
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:35.491
<v Speaker 1>from food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to get high level </v>

263
00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:39.511
<v Speaker 1>nutrients like really high levels in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body to the point where it's </v>

264
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:43.351
<v Speaker 1>affecting you in positive ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with a nootropic or with a vitamin </v>

265
00:12:43.351 --> 00:12:43.351
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

266
00:12:43.351 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>when you're exercising to actually get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all from food.</v>

267
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of weird shit.</v>

268
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that these vitamins don't work </v>

270
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.111
<v Speaker 1>is silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why everyone knows by </v>

271
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 1>vitamin 12 gives you energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's universally accepted.</v>

272
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 1>If you take a shot of vitamin B 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they give it to you inter muscularly,</v>

273
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>it has an impact on your energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

274
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 1>When you work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you have more,</v>

275
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more Gusto.</v>

276
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You have more vibrance to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking make it mean.</v>

277
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty important discovery that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vitamin gives your body more energy to</v>

278
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:18.730
<v Speaker 1>push hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does.</v>

279
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>It really does work like B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve is about as rock.</v>

280
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:27.421
<v Speaker 1>Solid science is against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the reason why these things </v>

281
00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:27.421
<v Speaker 1>have all been isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they know what the effects of these</v>

282
00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:32.221
<v Speaker 1>things are and there's a gang of studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that showed a different improvements and</v>

283
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 1>people that had taken vitamins for </v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious illness,</v>

284
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:41.620
<v Speaker 1>for mood and stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition,</v>

285
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>

286
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.850
<v Speaker 1>They even did a study on juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 1>delinquency and they showed an </v>

287
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:47.960
<v Speaker 1>improvement in juvenile delinquency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

288
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and the lack of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give the kids healthy vitamins,</v>

289
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:56.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read something in that that most of </v>

290
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.171
<v Speaker 1>the people that commit suicide are </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin deficient and I don't know if </v>

291
00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 1>vitamins can help you with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while it says something right there,</v>

292
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes you really unhappy if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have all your vitamins.</v>

293
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people with the average</v>

294
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:07.870
<v Speaker 1>American diet are vitamin deficient and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way better,</v>

295
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>way better to get your diet in order and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then slept.</v>

296
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>It's way better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there's ever any wrong</v>

297
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:22.381
<v Speaker 1>reason to supplement as long as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting good vitamins and nutrients and </v>

298
00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets weird because all </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins are not created equal.</v>

299
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>So when he makes like an irresponsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement where you like case closed,</v>

300
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:32.761
<v Speaker 1>vitamins don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really silly because you're your </v>

301
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:32.761
<v Speaker 1>actual studies.</v>

302
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:34.840
<v Speaker 1>They didn't prove that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

303
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:36.600
<v Speaker 1>it does work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why they know that,</v>

304
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.260
<v Speaker 1>that scurvy is cured by vitamin C.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a vitamin C deficiency.</v>

305
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.980
<v Speaker 1>We have isolated all of these compounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are crucial to human health.</v>

306
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>They know what the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't.</v>

307
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.530
<v Speaker 1>If the FDA loved to say vitamins don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

308
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just these doctors that </v>

309
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:57.070
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

310
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that put together a case,</v>

311
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these,</v>

312
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multivitamin researchers.</v>

313
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

314
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they've got us talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:04.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly something to be discussed</v>

316
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:09.941
<v Speaker 1>because I think they're right writing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways and what they're right in a </v>

317
00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:12.911
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways is that if you take like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard multivitamin and you don't know</v>

318
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 1>the source of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if it's food base.</v>

319
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't know if it's plant based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where they are.</v>

320
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Extracting their nutrients from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very likely to get.</v>

321
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't absorb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

322
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>it it most certainly doesn't absorb as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as the food,</v>

324
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.180
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

325
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what levels you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>

326
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where,</v>

327
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:38.020
<v Speaker 1>where they're extracting it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much bile availability is in these </v>

328
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 1>vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All vitamins are not created equally and</v>

329
00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 1>the way you break them down is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>created equal either.</v>

330
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Like those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those one a day things will have blue </v>

331
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 1>tablets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They famously find those fucking things </v>

332
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.121
<v Speaker 1>in the bottom of those Porta potties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people shut them out and they see this </v>

333
00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 1>little blue bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read it online,</v>

334
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 1>so it must be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done no research,</v>

335
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>no research port-a-potty research on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

336
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:02.000
<v Speaker 1>That might be a snitch thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what these people are saying?</v>

337
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Are there or are they saying that normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>multivitamin,</v>

338
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't absorb any enough to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>

339
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:12.911
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're claiming they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming is that they've shown that </v>

340
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 1>vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

341
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:16.310
<v Speaker 1>they're basically saying that vitamins </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not worth your time,</v>

342
00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:21.311
<v Speaker 1>that vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vitamins don't work enough is </v>

343
00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:24.131
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop wasting your money on vitamin and </v>

344
00:16:24.131 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 1>mineral supplements is the actual title </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the piece.</v>

345
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>They found that most people that use </v>
<v Speaker 1>Porta potties have diarrhea.</v>

346
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Well that that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's say it's out of there quick little </v>

347
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.090
<v Speaker 1>raft ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also don't use it unless it's an </v>

348
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:37.090
<v Speaker 1>emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a log roll down a raft.</v>

349
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Everything out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything out of raging river.</v>

350
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I take [inaudible] every morning under </v>
<v Speaker 1>my tongue and I immediately feel it will</v>

351
00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:50.201
<v Speaker 1>be 12 is also proven effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke to say the vitamins and </v>

352
00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 1>minerals don't do anything for your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a silly statement,</v>

353
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.550
<v Speaker 1>so when you see this enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop wasting money on vitamin and </v>

354
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 1>mineral supplements and then you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>their actual findings.</v>

355
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.970
<v Speaker 1>The findings were like there was a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited test done on a.</v>

356
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:09.911
<v Speaker 1>They were male physicians over 65 showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>no improvement in cognitive decline </v>

357
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 1>using generic multivitamins </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementation.</v>

358
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

359
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 1>It's male physicians over age 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

360
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.050
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still went nutty.</v>

361
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 1>They had a cognitive decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

362
00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:32.411
<v Speaker 1>and they showed no improvement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive decline using generic </v>

363
00:17:32.411 --> 00:17:32.411
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supplements.</v>

364
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.750
<v Speaker 1>So fucking what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean anything like generic </v>

365
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.750
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>

366
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.191
<v Speaker 1>and you're talking about guys who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>over age 65 that are already sliding </v>

367
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:42.560
<v Speaker 1>into the abyss.</v>

368
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.400
<v Speaker 1>You saying vitamins didn't haul them </v>
<v Speaker 1>from what nature?</v>

369
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Vitamins didn't hold them from the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>process because that's what you're </v>

370
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 1>talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one part of this study.</v>

371
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Another study showed that high dose </v>
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins had no effect on the </v>

372
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 1>progression of heart disease and heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks of virus.</v>

373
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're talking about people who had </v>

374
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking heart attack and then you give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them multivitamins and you're.</v>

375
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:11.901
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that vitamins didn't hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do you know that it didn't </v>

376
00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 1>have an effect on progression of heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease?</v>

377
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:18.110
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck do you know that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have already gotten even </v>

378
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.101
<v Speaker 1>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relapse of a heart attack if they </v>

379
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.831
<v Speaker 1>weren't taking vitamins like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's dying already had a heart </v>

380
00:18:24.831 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have one heart attack,</v>

381
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very likely to have another.</v>

382
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So saying that multivitamins don't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it didn't stop that.</v>

383
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.260
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about people that are </v>

384
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:36.260
<v Speaker 1>already dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems very irresponsible.</v>

385
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>It's very irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's irresponsible and very suspect.</v>

386
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense and I should </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out that it on it.</v>

387
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.070
<v Speaker 1>We don't sell multivitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't sell any of that shit.</v>

388
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 1>We sell only food based stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the closer it is to food,</v>

389
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 1>the easier it is for your body to digest</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

390
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just really simple stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With synthetic stuff can work,</v>

391
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't work as good for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

392
00:18:57.391 --> 00:19:02.391
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not as bioavailable as what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can extract from food and that's why</v>

393
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 1>when we sell vitamins we try to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>like like supplements.</v>

394
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 1>If it's green stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like spirulina and chlorella.</v>

395
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.240
<v Speaker 1>That's how you say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know one ever say it.</v>

396
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I just read it and then green </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements.</v>

397
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.490
<v Speaker 1>There's way better to get it in food </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

398
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like dehydrated food or what?</v>

399
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they extracted the </v>

400
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Speaker 1>extract is probably probably says it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the website somewhere,</v>

401
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially they're extracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients from from Greens and grass and</v>

402
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:36.051
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>mix this shit in water and you get a </v>

403
00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:39.570
<v Speaker 1>better nutritional response than just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger.</v>

404
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And fries that ain't doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

405
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It'll be better for you than a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

406
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It's just a supplement and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>

407
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it allows us in our busy everyday life </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

408
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

409
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can boost your body's performance,</v>

410
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you can give yourself a little bit of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>edge and a lot of different areas.</v>

411
00:19:57.271 --> 00:20:02.271
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's workouts to taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like shroom tech sport which </v>

412
00:20:02.271 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 1>is based out of the quarter steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom.</v>

413
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven that the quarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom has a really positive effect on</v>

414
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 1>your body's ability to process oxygen.</v>

415
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's really interesting stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they first learned about it from</v>

416
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:20.091
<v Speaker 1>high altitude hurting populations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently what had happened was their </v>

417
00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:22.400
<v Speaker 1>cows would eat these mushrooms is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter eps mushrooms and they,</v>

418
00:20:22.401 --> 00:20:26.090
<v Speaker 1>they became more active and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticing that they're more mobile.</v>

419
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're living,</v>

420
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.820
<v Speaker 1>they're more active than moving around </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and they,</v>

421
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>they pieced it together and figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a mushroom that they were </v>

422
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 1>eating and when they were eating this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom,</v>

423
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 1>that's when they started having this </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

424
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So that also is mixed with a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioavailable form of vitamin B 12 and </v>

425
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.590
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome supplement to take about</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour before you work out all these </v>

426
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.261
<v Speaker 1>things work and we're so confident that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they work that we have a 90 day 30 pill </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan had a very legitimate reason.</v>

453
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.080
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent legitimate reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he couldn't podcast today.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's all good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>People used to mistake us for one </v>

458
00:22:15.031 --> 00:22:15.970
<v Speaker 1>another back in the day because I never </v>

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>standup and really a fascinating story </v>

550
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.770
<v Speaker 1>like he put a stand up together in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of like a one man show and it </v>

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.460
<v Speaker 1>became very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

552
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Rob Becker is his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he started like selling it to </v>

553
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>people that they could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like actors,</v>

554
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>so they could all do it all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All over the country.</v>

555
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Chiklis did it.</v>

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.190
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

558
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.510

<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive.</v>

559
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me pull this up real soon because </v>

<v Speaker 1>they're definitely doing that show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas every time I'm there.</v>

561
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.020
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Chiklis,</v>

562
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 1>if you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan.</v>

563
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.100
<v Speaker 1>He's the shield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

564
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

565
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 1>The commish yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not goofing on.</v>

566
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Your men did one episode of Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we talking about the same guy?</v>

567
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Chiklis.</v>

568
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 1>He was also a the thing in the fantastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

569
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

570
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did his Broadway debut in the one man</v>

571
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 1>show defending the caveman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was correct.</v>

572
00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 1>We don't even need the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of remember it because I was</v>

573
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

574
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess I guess it makes sense,</v>

575
00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but to a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

576
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

577
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:08.580
<v Speaker 1>like you were going to buy an act like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>

578
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>like he like few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

579
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>let's say when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year did you start out?</v>

580
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.970
<v Speaker 1>A 98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 eight.</v>

581
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.240
<v Speaker 1>What if instead of you doing your act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if Dave attell just sold you his </v>

582
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

583
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:27.411
<v Speaker 1>I would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you would go on stage and you would </v>

584
00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 1>do like say like a classic albums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the memories,</v>

585
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 1>which is my favorite hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you went onstage and his and just did</v>

586
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:37.671
<v Speaker 1>it as Dave attell and it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be called the skanks for the </v>

587
00:27:37.671 --> 00:27:37.890
<v Speaker 1>memory show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

588
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And you would hire an actor to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

589
00:27:40.061 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God damn it.</v>

590
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I wish that was available.</v>

591
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:51.630
<v Speaker 1>You want you to think though that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two totally different things </v>

592
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.630
<v Speaker 1>is why it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

593
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 1>when you turn stand up into a one man </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

594
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:59.870
<v Speaker 1>then you can get away with anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a clearly defined one man </v>

595
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.890
<v Speaker 1>show and it's just defending the caveman</v>
<v Speaker 1>one man show.</v>

596
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a comic you never do that?</v>

597
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

598
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:06.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

599
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

600
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:12.171
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it because every year you </v>

601
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:12.171
<v Speaker 1>have to have a new act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

602
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:12.930
<v Speaker 1>So this what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

603
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Is it that this guy figured out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take stand up but transport it into a </v>

604
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 1>safe zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

605
00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And then just drop it off where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in perpetuity,</v>

606
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more rules.</v>

607
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And now this can be done at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in all 50 states and you get you in</v>

608
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.280
<v Speaker 1>a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get all the money from it so you </v>

609
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:34.280
<v Speaker 1>don't have to tour as much.</v>

610
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:34.280
<v Speaker 1>You stay in Vegas and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

611
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 1>all your minions do it around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

612
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you started charging show,</v>

613
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 1>making the full charge show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

614
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:45.531
<v Speaker 1>You were showing the full charge show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would show it in Los Angeles and </v>

615
00:28:45.531 --> 00:28:49.491
<v Speaker 1>select markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you would give people licenses to </v>

616
00:28:49.491 --> 00:28:49.491
<v Speaker 1>do it in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

617
00:28:49.491 --> 00:28:54.040
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my minions will have to be called </v>

618
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.410
<v Speaker 1>the half charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what do you do for a living?</v>

619
00:28:55.411 --> 00:28:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a half charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do the full charges jokes.</v>

620
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you write your own jokes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of my own stuff,</v>

621
00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>but mostly today people want to hear the</v>
<v Speaker 1>full charge,</v>

622
00:29:03.781 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I do for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

623
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not my dream.</v>

624
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically a cover band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

625
00:29:08.271 --> 00:29:13.271
<v Speaker 1>This is what pays the bills and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do my own stuff at open mics around </v>

626
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:16.161
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is fascinating that in our art </v>

627
00:29:16.161 --> 00:29:18.441
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pretentious title that you give to </v>

628
00:29:18.441 --> 00:29:18.870
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy that we all give it.</v>

629
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.930
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in almost every other kind of music </v>

630
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies or music or any other kind of </v>

631
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:28.360
<v Speaker 1>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

632
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Terentino's straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Like copies other movies and it's known </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an Oma.</v>

634
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like with standup,</v>

635
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.820
<v Speaker 1>it's very sacred to us because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just because you don't get paid as </v>

636
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.610
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably exactly what it is.</v>

637
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.560
<v Speaker 1>We're just fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's my piece?</v>

638
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:45.960
<v Speaker 1>We got our rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

639
00:29:45.961 --> 00:29:47.650
<v Speaker 1>we certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not.</v>

640
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we do our stuff,</v>

641
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily will you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to have.</v>

642
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.210
<v Speaker 1>You not only have to have rules for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

643
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to have rules for yourself too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

644
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has to keep everybody honest </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the idea of creativity and the </v>

645
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 1>idea of originality and unique thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the origin of thoughts.</v>

646
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty important to us because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all we have.</v>

647
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:15.390
<v Speaker 1>All comic has essentially is what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>created in his own mind and then put to </v>

648
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 1>paper our keyboard and then transfers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage.</v>

649
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.680
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have as a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have.</v>

650
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:23.830
<v Speaker 1>You can jazz it up and dance with it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do all kinds of shit,</v>

651
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have the raw material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything.</v>

652
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why for us that that honesty </v>

653
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.210
<v Speaker 1>process is super important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's one of the cool things</v>

654
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:39.211
<v Speaker 1>about what we do that we have so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic friends that were constantly </v>

655
00:30:39.211 --> 00:30:44.191
<v Speaker 1>interacting with on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always joey and Ari and Duncan and </v>

656
00:30:44.191 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you and score and fucking Christ and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>super cool,</v>

657
00:30:48.731 --> 00:30:52.450
<v Speaker 1>super honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super above board people.</v>

658
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>

659
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.830
<v Speaker 1>don't even want to do something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to somebody else.</v>

660
00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.290
<v Speaker 1>To have known desire and drop shit in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartbeat.</v>

661
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.060
<v Speaker 1>When you find out that it's too close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that.</v>

662
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go fuck it.</v>

663
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:08.190
<v Speaker 1>It's over the last you want to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's comparing you to someone else </v>

664
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 1>now also you get to hang with and joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with the funniest dudes on the </v>

665
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.330
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

666
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 1>because we all trust each other to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck around.</v>

667
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Like we all trust each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

668
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.630
<v Speaker 1>like Ari was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the subject was.</v>

669
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 1>We were joking around about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day and I'm like,</v>

670
00:31:21.911 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do that onstage.</v>

671
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And we started working on how he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it onstage.</v>

672
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you feel like this or like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

673
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that camaraderie.</v>

674
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:36.970
<v Speaker 1>When you do that for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you both have an idea or one of you</v>

675
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 1>has an idea and the other one tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance it and help each other.</v>

676
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>That boost boost a saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll get off stage to grow,</v>

677
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.590
<v Speaker 1>have a tagline for me after he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

678
00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:52.591
<v Speaker 1>like maybe that you're calling so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to write for someone else </v>

679
00:31:52.591 --> 00:31:56.521
<v Speaker 1>sometimes because like there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on what you wrote and you just </v>

680
00:31:56.521 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 1>get to sit back and watch the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person do it.</v>

681
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Then something pops into your head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just give it like you don't.</v>

682
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just all inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried to write for someone</v>

683
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 1>specifically though for their staff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sat down and tried to write for someone?</v>

684
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of guys have done that </v>

685
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know,</v>

686
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

687
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.090
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of guys that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping Chris,</v>

688
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Chris rock when he was putting together </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his hbo specials and I think the </v>

689
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Pollo might've been one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe Rich Vos,</v>

690
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck definitely wrote for Chris Rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because it will also.</v>

691
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Chris was doing so many different things</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time and probably doing </v>

692
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.180
<v Speaker 1>movies and shit and I think he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked to have all those minds to help </v>

693
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.310
<v Speaker 1>him go over his stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

694
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a ballsy move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

695
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 1>have all these bad motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

696
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jokes for you.</v>

697
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll also work with you creating the</v>

698
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 1>jokes so you get like the opinions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these expert comedians.</v>

699
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a real ballsy move because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of comedians don't want to be </v>

700
00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.290
<v Speaker 1>judged on their performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're bringing in guys like,</v>

701
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 1>like Louis C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k to write for you,</v>

702
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're going to get the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

703
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.680
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to be the most honest </v>

704
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.661
<v Speaker 1>assessment ever of the material and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of masterminds like gearing </v>

705
00:33:07.661 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 1>together and putting together this </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect masterpiece comedy.</v>

706
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you personally think that's good </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

707
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

708
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

709
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not what I do,</v>

710
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

711
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.441
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Chris Rock has one of the </v>

712
00:33:23.441 --> 00:33:25.001
<v Speaker 1>greatest comedians of all time and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how he did it brilliantly and </v>

713
00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:25.001
<v Speaker 1>it's right there on the credits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

714
00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 1>100 percent by such and such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such and such.</v>

715
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I know Eddie Murphy did it on raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>keenan.</v>

716
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Ivory Wayans wrote on raw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely nothing wrong with that.</v>

717
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it's,</v>

718
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:40.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because of the way they did </v>

719
00:33:40.991 --> 00:33:40.991
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so above board.</v>

720
00:33:40.991 --> 00:33:41.300
<v Speaker 1>They let everybody know they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

721
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one hit that.</v>

722
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.280
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what's wrong with bringing in </v>

723
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:48.280
<v Speaker 1>writers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>

724
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not uncreative.</v>

725
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Just because you're creating with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

726
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:55.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you're not still </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating and actually be very inspiring.</v>

727
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

728
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.600
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could get rid of a lot of doubt.</v>

729
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like,</v>

730
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.270
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're doing.</v>

731
00:34:02.271 --> 00:34:03.190
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

732
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:04.490
<v Speaker 1>you can use this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

733
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:04.850
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

734
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:07.640
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plagiarism is the problem.</v>

735
00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:11.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to operation cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and paid cooperation,</v>

736
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what writing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writing for content is great.</v>

737
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it that way,</v>

738
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 1>but I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really common.</v>

739
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:25.511
<v Speaker 1>It's just really personal for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like when you're involving </v>

740
00:34:25.511 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 1>somebody else's idea of what they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>she should sound like.</v>

741
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:32.501
<v Speaker 1>To me that's just gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a badge and Chris rock went up </v>

742
00:34:32.501 --> 00:34:35.741
<v Speaker 1>at the seller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did what he had and then the other guys </v>

743
00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:35.741
<v Speaker 1>contributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm imagining.</v>

744
00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sure of that and then spice </v>
<v Speaker 1>things up or added or had an idea.</v>

745
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Chris could run it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be this.</v>

746
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Getting all of his jokes and his guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was getting a little juice,</v>

747
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 1>little here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little spark and you're getting it from </v>

748
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 1>like hungry guys who are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

749
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out there.</v>

750
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not like,</v>

751
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c k,</v>

752
00:34:52.311 --> 00:34:54.950
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about your divorce in my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear what you're saying too though.</v>

753
00:34:54.951 --> 00:34:58.760
<v Speaker 1>What I agree with you in a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like it's very personal,</v>

754
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but even though it's very personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes another eye on what </v>

755
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll open you up to like,</v>

756
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think of that.</v>

757
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.860
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

758
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was I doing it that way?</v>

759
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Because if I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't say that,</v>

760
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.260
<v Speaker 1>it would like open up the whole back end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

761
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times like some things </v>

762
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:20.530
<v Speaker 1>that your friends can see that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

763
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of comics that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have writers and that to me always felt </v>

764
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.691
<v Speaker 1>really weird because it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just actors or the boyfriends </v>

765
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend to call a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if felt like I came up with this </v>

766
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.970
<v Speaker 1>black peoples and this Nigga I got this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea when</v>

767
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 4>it started to get bigger and blacker a </v>
<v Speaker 4>white guy starts doing the bigger and </v>

768
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 4>blacker tour and just does all the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

769
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 4>there was a guy doing that for Hicks </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

770
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

771
00:35:48.391 --> 00:35:53.391
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy that was doing like Hicks </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a one man show here are,</v>

772
00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.700

773
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks as a one man show.</v>

774
00:36:00.051 --> 00:36:02.240
<v Speaker 1>God impersonating Bill Hicks is a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

775
00:36:02.241 --> 00:36:07.241
<v Speaker 1>Show me Google this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird because Bill Hicks still </v>

776
00:36:07.241 --> 00:36:07.250
<v Speaker 1>isn't famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

777
00:36:07.251 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I think he's pretty famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Larry still around?</v>

778
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Is he on a show or something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they want to craig gas to do a,</v>

779

<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

783
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.100
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy,</v>

784
00:36:28.101 --> 00:36:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm very positive that there was a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was trying to put together a one man</v>

785
00:36:32.061 --> 00:36:35.170
<v Speaker 1>show and he was just going to do bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hicks like,</v>

786
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.100
<v Speaker 1>like Mark Twain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a thing.</v>

787
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.140
<v Speaker 1>She could go up and do mark Twain today </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Mark Twain has been dead for a </v>

788
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:42.140
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

789
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Fucking people are happy to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to know what he really </v>

790
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.310
<v Speaker 4>was like and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pitch.</v>

791
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 4>That is not how mark twain talks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We focused.</v>

792
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.130
<v Speaker 4>This is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fucking terrible.</v>

793
00:36:51.131 --> 00:36:54.190
<v Speaker 4>At the pipe down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're holding the pipe or the left.</v>

794
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.350
<v Speaker 4>He helped with the right.</v>

795
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a guy like Hicks,</v>

796
00:36:59.591 --> 00:37:00.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

797
00:37:00.401 --> 00:37:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I saw him in the flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't die that long ago.</v>

798
00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.750
<v Speaker 1>When did you see him and where did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see him?</v>

799
00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I saw him a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him.</v>

800
00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I saw him at least at least three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly four occasions meeting.</v>

801
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I saw him for an entire weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

802
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like touring pro coming off of the </v>

<v Speaker 1>Rodney dangerfield special was like just</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to catch heat right as I got </v>

805
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:35.101
<v Speaker 1>into comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was lucky enough to be at a point </v>

806
00:37:35.101 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 1>where the clubs of let me come by like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an open mic or.</v>

807
00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.670
<v Speaker 1>But the clubs would let me in on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday night and I could watch God.</v>

808
00:37:39.671 --> 00:37:42.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I was working with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was terrible,</v>

809
00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but they would let me come in and watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>them at the comedy connection.</v>

810
00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.670
<v Speaker 1>The way they ran it and nick's and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those places in Boston.</v>

811
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It was so cool because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had great comics.</v>

812
00:37:52.751 --> 00:37:57.751
<v Speaker 1>Would come in every weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have guys that would come in like </v>

813
00:37:57.751 --> 00:37:57.751
<v Speaker 1>dom irrera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him there.</v>

814
00:37:57.751 --> 00:37:59.920
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would all come like and have like a</v>

815
00:37:59.921 --> 00:38:04.090
<v Speaker 1>big name headliner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they also had this insane community,</v>

816
00:38:04.091 --> 00:38:06.220
<v Speaker 1>have really great comedy around there as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

817
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 1>And the way they did it is because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>super supported open milkers super </v>

818
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:16.531
<v Speaker 1>supported the new talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew that new talent is what </v>

819
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:17.020
<v Speaker 1>becomes headliners one day and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to nurture it.</v>

820
00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And they were like big about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when a guy like Hicks was in town,</v>

821
00:38:19.841 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 1>they would tell me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to see Hicks.</v>

822
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm Paul Barkley told me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

823
00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you gotta see this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking tremendous.</v>

824
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy from the HBO special.</v>

825
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just like,</v>

826
00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:28.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to see him.</v>

827
00:38:28.241 --> 00:38:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on another level.</v>

828
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember seeing him for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time and going,</v>

829
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like guys say they don't a fuck.</v>

830
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gives a fuck man.</v>

831
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I always give a fuck if I give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

832
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck what I'm stumbling through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>squarespace commercial.</v>

833
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't get my fat tongue to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give a fuck at the supermarket.</v>

834
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks did not give a fuck man.</v>

835
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the first guy in my life that </v>

836
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.571
<v Speaker 1>didn't honestly didn't give a fuck on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage when I saw him because the first </v>

837
00:38:57.571 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 1>time I saw him we saw him twice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time period.</v>

838
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 1>He came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was at the comedy connection and then</v>

839
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 1>he came to nick so shortly thereafter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got to see them in both places.</v>

840
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.650
<v Speaker 1>The comedy connection was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was pretty fucking fascinating.</v>

841
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:16.830
<v Speaker 1>But when he came to nick's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went on after a guy that was doing </v>

842
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:17.590
<v Speaker 1>like impressions of different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different cartoon animals,</v>

843
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:22.591
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like literally had copped donut </v>

844
00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:22.591
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

845
00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was the guy who we went on </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

846
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:27.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

847
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:32.370
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the same style of comedy by </v>

848
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.911
<v Speaker 1>any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible setup for Bill Hicks </v>

849
00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>because it was all like really dopey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.460
<v Speaker 1>base shitty comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

851
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hooks goes on after him and just eats </v>

852
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 1>fat piles of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just giant plates and plates of Shit and</v>

853
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:53.281
<v Speaker 1>it's by the end of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's maybe 300 people in this </v>

854
00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:53.440
<v Speaker 1>displacement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say to 50.</v>

855
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.600
<v Speaker 1>There's maybe 50 left at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

856
00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Walk the entire crowd except for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and me,</v>

857
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Greg Fitzsimmons and like three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>other local Boston comics.</v>

858
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were fucking crying.</v>

859
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.840
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing his bits as if he was </v>

860
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.620
<v Speaker 1>killing and they were all dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

861
00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Everything was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowd just did not bite except for </v>

862
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.371
<v Speaker 1>this small core people that were in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back that were howling and the comics </v>

863
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just worked with somebody recently in </v>

864
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis who has been around for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and he said,</v>

865
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks had a lot more dick jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

866
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.800
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he used to joke around about it.</v>

867
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Spice up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

868
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:41.070
<v Speaker 1>any other topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just throw Dick Jokes in between </v>

869
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.861
<v Speaker 1>them to keep people interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would joke around about having to do </v>

870
00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 1>that right where he joked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but folks,</v>

871
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Dick Jokes are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that big fat via.</v>

872
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

873
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a fascinating comic to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he represents me.</v>

874
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I've had arguments with Ari about him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't think he was funny.</v>

875
00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's honest about it.</v>

876
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.610
<v Speaker 1>He tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

877
00:41:02.611 --> 00:41:03.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

878
00:41:03.791 --> 00:41:05.710
<v Speaker 1>he's giving makes really good points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not funny.</v>

879
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I.</v>

880
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always laugh at him.</v>

881
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I laughed at him when I saw him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 88.</v>

882
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I laugh at it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I think he represents is the </v>

883
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.311
<v Speaker 1>first guy that started looking at what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about on stage completely </v>

884
00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:22.900
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he started to a young man on acid.</v>

885
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Like that whole bit about what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About a positive.</v>

886
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:31.020
<v Speaker 1>It was really powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the non.</v>

887
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.460
<v Speaker 1>What was non bullshit talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

888
00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Was it a way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like when he was doing like </v>

889
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 1>certain bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't just doing a bit.</v>

890
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:45.250
<v Speaker 1>He was doing a bit that plants a seed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gets you thinking about a subject </v>

891
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:49.091
<v Speaker 1>differently because he's mocked it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well that it whenever you try to </v>

892
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 1>seriously bring up the war on drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>after you've heard Bill Hicks talk about</v>

893
00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem like an asshole.</v>

894
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

895
00:41:55.661 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

896
00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Did he just had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fascinating way of mixing ideas</v>

897
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:06.461
<v Speaker 1>into comedy in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most powerful way since </v>

898
00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:09.941
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally think he's the most </v>

899
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:12.011
<v Speaker 1>powerful at it because his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his impact is felt by I think a </v>

900
00:42:12.011 --> 00:42:13.510
<v Speaker 1>different era because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

901
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.580
<v Speaker 1>because of Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of the videos and the audio </v>

902
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:18.580
<v Speaker 1>that's available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

903
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 1>the Lenny Bruce Stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've tried to go back and listen to</v>

904
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 1>it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really hold up anymore.</v>

905
00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.560
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell why it was </v>

906
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:28.560
<v Speaker 1>groundbreaking at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's just like,</v>

907
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very like beat poet.</v>

908
00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Very like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

909
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.940
<v Speaker 1>rambling Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a totally different lens did in</v>

910
00:42:34.941 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 1>the eighties too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

911
00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 1>like where there wasn't really a need </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

912
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the Reagan administration and the</v>

913
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:47.831
<v Speaker 1>Bush one administration and people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting by on who's squeezes the bottom </v>

914
00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:48.360
<v Speaker 1>of the toothpaste.</v>

915
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm no disrespect to Seinfeld,</v>

916
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is that song?</v>

917
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.560
<v Speaker 1>What's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe whenever I think about </v>

918
00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.831
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't believe he was dead and </v>

<v Speaker 1>he was 17 because he was funny.</v>

925
00:43:16.661 --> 00:43:21.661
<v Speaker 1>He was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going up at the fucking Houston </v>

<v Speaker 1>was clean.</v>

928
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.800
<v Speaker 1>It was really good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the embarrassing shit that </v>

929
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.040
<v Speaker 1>would represent you or I know he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>get lost in just.</v>

930
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.690
<v Speaker 1>This is based on the documentary that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just came out.</v>

931
00:43:35.691 --> 00:43:40.691
<v Speaker 1>I saw a couple of years ago he would get</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost and characters of his family and </v>

<v Speaker 1>were twice as age fucking pancreatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

934
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy fucking disease.</v>

935
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad one to allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

936
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people believe that there's a </v>

937
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 1>correlation between cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pancreas is a thing you can remove,</v>

938
00:44:01.161 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

939
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:06.790
<v Speaker 1>does nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No extra parts.</v>

940
00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it out and I'll be a lighter.</v>

941
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Brian's education is based on operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The board game,</v>

942
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.480
<v Speaker 1>appendix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

943
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take your tonsils,</v>

944
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.190
<v Speaker 1>your appendix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

945
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take in your wisdom 10 decks.</v>

946
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.140
<v Speaker 1>You definitely take out your appendix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What causes pancreatic cancer?</v>

947
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from advanced age,</v>

948
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:24.620
<v Speaker 1>smoking is the main risk factor.</v>

949
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

950
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.120
<v Speaker 1>A smoker's three to four times more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely than a nonsmoker to a acquire </v>

951
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.380
<v Speaker 1>pancreatic cancer is your pancreas at </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows inside that that body thing.</v>

952
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the main part,</v>

953
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the main part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bulletproof vest.</v>

954
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Cover it under the flip cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

955
00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:48.921
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes or so senior arm and Hicks </v>

956
00:44:48.921 --> 00:44:49.770
<v Speaker 1>smoked a lot of cigarettes and did jokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>about smoking,</v>

957
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.350
<v Speaker 1>argued for cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pancreatic cancer.</v>

958
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Got Them motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

959
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.990
<v Speaker 1>so many really talented artists have </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke cigarettes.</v>

960
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sad.</v>

961
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It's sad a lot of ways because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see a cigarette smoker,</v>

962
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a person exercising their </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

963
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I know that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they want to smoke,</v>

964
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 1>they should be able to smoke for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I see.</v>

965
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I see a person who's enslaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

966
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:17.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see enslavement to a habit and also to</v>

967
00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 1>a drug at the same time.</v>

968
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just another addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just another thing to do but it </v>

969
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 1>kills you to kills a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't get you high,</v>

970
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:31.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a weird thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get addicted to taking something </v>

971
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.061
<v Speaker 1>lighting on fire and then putting it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your mouth and then breathing it in </v>

972
00:45:35.061 --> 00:45:36.300
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the ritual of doing that can become</v>

973
00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:39.660
<v Speaker 1>so ingrained in your life that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents something like after sex,</v>

974
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:44.661
<v Speaker 1>like people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like to smoke a cigarette </v>

975
00:45:44.661 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 1>after sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a classic movie scene,</v>

976
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:50.571
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people have sex and then they </v>

977
00:45:50.571 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 1>smoke a cigarette you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you really like,</v>

978
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.940
<v Speaker 1>what are you watching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're watching someone poisoning </v>

979
00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.701
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a weird thing to find </v>

980
00:45:58.701 --> 00:45:58.701
<v Speaker 1>romantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing they snuck in on us</v>

981
00:45:58.701 --> 00:46:02.880
<v Speaker 1>and how it becomes habit study finds no </v>
<v Speaker 1>link between secondhand smoke and cancer</v>

982
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>funded by the tobacco lobbyists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America in Florida.</v>

983
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.860
<v Speaker 1>It's in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a case that goes through in </v>

984
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might as well go through on the moon.</v>

985
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.410
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans are tired of people saying the</v>

986
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Florida's America to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to cut it out.</v>

987
00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Even flip live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents live in Florida.</v>

988
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Florida,</v>

989
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but that shit is not America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is some crazy spot where you can't.</v>

990
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Any studies that come out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

991
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what kind of coke they were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they made that study?</v>

992
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.240
<v Speaker 1>They can't even trust him to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

993
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked up.</v>

994
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.900
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicotine and tobacco linked to heart </v>

995
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:39.900
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

996
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.600
<v Speaker 1>nicotine speeds up your heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

997
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 1>It makes it work harder than it has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

998
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of nicotine being given as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement before,</v>

999
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.730
<v Speaker 1>which is really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or as medicine before,</v>

1000
00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it was for a heart issue.</v>

1001
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I find just like anything else in small </v>
<v Speaker 1>doses,</v>

1002
00:46:55.321 --> 00:47:00.321
<v Speaker 1>every once in a while I that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a pack a day delivered through </v>

1003
00:47:00.321 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 1>fucking cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smoke and it's so hot.</v>

1004
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of stuff is like that,</v>

1005
00:47:03.481 --> 00:47:08.481
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking yesterday with Shane </v>

1006
00:47:08.481 --> 00:47:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Smith from vice about that devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbian Devil's breath.</v>

1007
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 1>It's called [inaudible] or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1008
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.770
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most dangerous drug.</v>

1009
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:18.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the same shit that's in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>little seasickness tabs that they put on</v>

1010
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1011
00:47:19.471 --> 00:47:24.471
<v Speaker 1>those things that you get stick they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick on you and the seasickness is </v>

1012
00:47:24.471 --> 00:47:28.341
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be mitigated by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same shit at the Columbian </v>

1013
00:47:28.341 --> 00:47:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Devil's breath stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like way more way more</v>

1014
00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.930
<v Speaker 4>patches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like barely giving you a hit.</v>

1015
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 4>They're giving you just a taste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you take this dangerous stuff?</v>

1016
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Do you smoke it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You swallow it,</v>

1017
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 4>you shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

1018
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they can blow it in your face </v>

1019
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 4>and you just have it in your face and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you breathe,</v>

1020
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:47.641
<v Speaker 4>just breathing it in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like having it blown in your mouth and </v>

1021
00:47:47.641 --> 00:47:47.641
<v Speaker 4>your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got it,</v>

1022
00:47:47.641 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 4>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you become like,</v>

1023
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:51.370
<v Speaker 4>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little Zombie.</v>

1024
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.470
<v Speaker 4>They tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you,</v>

1025
00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:55.510
<v Speaker 4>go to your bank account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take out money for me.</v>

1026
00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 4>And people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like they have video of people doing</v>

1027
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>can get from these patches,</v>

1030
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 4>these dermal patches for sisense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then people go,</v>

1031
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:11.140
<v Speaker 4>don't be seasick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I concentrate on the horizon.</v>

1032
00:48:11.141 --> 00:48:13.360
<v Speaker 4>Don't take anything else,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1040
00:48:29.451 --> 00:48:29.990

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1041
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.220
<v Speaker 4>apparently it alleviates nausea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1042
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 4>but for me it was like a tranquilizer </v>
<v Speaker 4>dart.</v>

1043
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 4>It alleviated everything else to include</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your sight.</v>

1044
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:41.530
<v Speaker 4>And your hearing even was seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my body was like this,</v>

1045
00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.180
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was me and my buddy Jimmy,</v>

1046
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:46.120
<v Speaker 4>and luckily he didn't take the drama </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean and uh,</v>

1047
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.940
<v Speaker 4>we were at the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the diner on the way home and I was just</v>

1048
00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:52.720
<v Speaker 4>sitting in front of him nodding out like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a heroin addict and he's like,</v>

1049
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 4>you all right over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1050
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:55.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might have actually taken a drama,</v>

1051
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 4>mean to.</v>

1052
00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.440
<v Speaker 4>He was a lot bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy was like 200 plus pounds and that </v>

1053
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 4>was probably at the time I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>competing.</v>

1054
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:06.991
<v Speaker 4>So it was probably about 155 pounds and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I took this one drama main or to drama </v>

1055
00:49:06.991 --> 00:49:07.870
<v Speaker 4>names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many they gave me,</v>

1056
00:49:07.871 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 4>but I was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I wake up,</v>

1057
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.950
<v Speaker 4>I woke up the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1058
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Did you enjoy it on you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Joe was terrible.</v>

1059
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Speaker 4>I took too much probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably tried to take as much as he </v>

1060
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.560
<v Speaker 4>was taken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm going to ask you </v>

1061
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:28.560
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take two,</v>

1062
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll take two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two guys doing guys.</v>

1063
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:31.050
<v Speaker 4>Especially that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1064
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 4>we were both teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1065
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:39.030
<v Speaker 4>That uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it fucking knocked my dick right in </v>

1066
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.030
<v Speaker 4>the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a prescription drug?</v>

1067
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.960
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be an over the counter.</v>

1068
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the laws might've changed since,</v>

1069
00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a long ass time ago.</v>

1070
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.380
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her formula might have changed too.</v>

1071
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:52.790
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But apparently I'm too much of a pussy </v>

1072
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:53.110
<v Speaker 4>to even take a drama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drama,</v>

1073
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.750
<v Speaker 4>drama me knowledge time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't do anything to them,</v>

<v Speaker 4>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm literally,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you fucking work while you're there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get up and everybody works again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No insomnia and production life.</v>

1175
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to,</v>

1176
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:21.710

<v Speaker 1>in about two and a half day in the </v>

1177
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 1>adderall flows like hail falls from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

1180
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just guessing.</v>

1181
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I would say that if you were working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of like a show that was working </v>

1182
00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.381
<v Speaker 1>like crazy hours all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably need at least a strong </v>

1183
00:54:39.381 --> 00:54:39.750
<v Speaker 1>energy drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Habit,</v>

1184
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.700
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't cut it at that point.</v>

1185
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't cut it.</v>

1186
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're not working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for you.</v>

1187
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:47.460
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're working on the mat,</v>

1188
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:49.020
<v Speaker 1>fold tron experience,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1190
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a chart and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're plotting your future.</v>

1191
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Take over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 1>set up these one man shows around the </v>

1194
00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:06.081
<v Speaker 1>country who keep your comedy in a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>capsule and they have all these people </v>

<v Speaker 1>become the half charges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be fine,</v>

1196
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're working on like that 70 </v>

1197
00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.230
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] show or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how sad example,</v>

1198
00:55:14.231 --> 00:55:17.850
<v Speaker 1>but you know something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ridiculous show,</v>

1199
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 1>some show where you don't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the outcome,</v>

1200
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:26.290
<v Speaker 1>not just a job and you're there all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're there all day and you get to </v>

1201
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:31.011
<v Speaker 1>see whiny actors throw hissy fits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw fucking scripts around to see the </v>

1202
00:55:31.011 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 1>weirdness between the crew and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors and Oh,</v>

1203
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking shit.</v>

1204
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.460
<v Speaker 1>The amount of time invested put in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1205
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I know it's crazy because a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>person has a regular job.</v>

1206
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Like you work nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done five.</v>

1207
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have some extra things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to tie up before you leave the </v>

1208
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:56.570
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1209
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.590
<v Speaker 1>The office by six and like that's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of time.</v>

1210
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 1>And let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some youtube and in there </v>

1211
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:06.350
<v Speaker 1>there's some office gods has been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all your fucking employee really </v>

1212
00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:10.161
<v Speaker 1>deserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your employer rather employer doesn't </v>

1213
00:56:10.161 --> 00:56:11.670
<v Speaker 1>deserve your 100 percent of your time </v>
<v Speaker 1>here because it's your life.</v>

1214
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:15.240
<v Speaker 1>That shit's ridiculous to have a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sucks.</v>

1215
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 1>You drive for 16 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>

1216
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.630
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously,</v>

1217
00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I believe that people should have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>free to do whatever the fuck they want.</v>

1218
00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.360
<v Speaker 1>They want to pursue that sort of alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

1219
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:32.400
<v Speaker 1>if it's not something you enjoy doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really dangerous place to put </v>

1220
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.060
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1221
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 1>The fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1222
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:39.361
<v Speaker 1>this is what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do stuff that sucks for 16 hours a </v>

1223
00:56:39.361 --> 00:56:40.330
<v Speaker 1>day where you hate it and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be free.</v>

1224
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't want a life or don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want their own thoughts though.</v>

1225
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like to keep themselves busy</v>

1226
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 1>and there's a little bit of that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy.</v>

1227
00:56:49.481 --> 00:56:51.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do Valentine's Day.</v>

1228
00:56:51.611 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I got to work that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey.</v>

1229
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

1230
00:56:53.561 --> 00:56:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I understand what it is as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the production budgets and um,</v>

1231
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting things done.</v>

1232
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 1>And if days take longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes more time,</v>

1233
00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:06.391
<v Speaker 1>cost more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in order to fit things under </v>

1234
00:57:06.391 --> 00:57:07.240
<v Speaker 1>budget or in their budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to work these long hours,</v>

1235
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what they do and that </v>

1236
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:12.300
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't get a 12 hour turnaround,</v>

1237
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.961
<v Speaker 1>like they have to pay penalties and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay meal penalties and all these union </v>

1238
00:57:15.961 --> 00:57:16.570
<v Speaker 1>penalties that they have to pay if they.</v>

1239
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.720
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is everybody choosing to work so </v>

1240
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.200
<v Speaker 1>crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know.</v>

1241
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day I understand you </v>
<v Speaker 1>save a little money this way.</v>

1242
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there another way?</v>

1243
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:31.120
<v Speaker 1>There is another way it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shorter hours.</v>

1244
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Woody Allen does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he?</v>

1245
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Television does it a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

1246

<v Speaker 1>but I don't think I would really enjoy </v>

1257
00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:03.400
<v Speaker 1>doing another show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

1258
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1259
00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:10.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that was a really weird show </v>

1260
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.540
<v Speaker 1>because that show was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it is on most sitcoms </v>

1261
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:16.561
<v Speaker 1>because I've only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only other one I've done is just </v>

1262
00:58:16.561 --> 00:58:16.561
<v Speaker 1>shoot me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did one episode of that.</v>

1263
00:58:16.561 --> 00:58:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I did one episode of Mad TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1264
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really do much other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was on news radio and they </v>

1265
00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 1>let us ad Lib like almost every scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

1266
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Like almost every scene there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was changed,</v>

1267
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:33.120
<v Speaker 1>something that was altered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was someone,</v>

1268
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:38.170
<v Speaker 1>one of us came up with on the fly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time orchestrated by Dave </v>

1269
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Foley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Day Foley would take the script and</v>

1270
00:58:41.381 --> 00:58:43.330
<v Speaker 1>then he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sort of,</v>

1271
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.850
<v Speaker 1>it was an ensemble show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if anybody was the lead,</v>

1272
00:58:45.851 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 1>it was day four and it was Phil Hartman </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the big star and then,</v>

1273
00:58:50.471 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Foley was,</v>

1274
00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>

1275
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like he was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an uncredited producer really.</v>

1276
00:58:55.750 --> 00:59:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would orchestrate like a lot of </v>

1277
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.750
<v Speaker 1>the scenes and come up with fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines for them to.</v>

1278
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:05.470
<v Speaker 1>He's a really fucking talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all the guys that I think don't</v>

1279
00:59:05.471 --> 00:59:09.400
<v Speaker 1>get appreciated enough for being fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably hilarious.</v>

1280
00:59:09.401 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 1>One of them is Dave Foley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a sweetheart of a guy,</v>

1281
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:16.030
<v Speaker 1>like always has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always been like the nicest,</v>

1282
00:59:16.031 --> 00:59:18.820
<v Speaker 1>kindest guy and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1283
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:23.821
<v Speaker 1>really fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really fucking smart and really fucking </v>

00:59:23.821 --> 00:59:27.461
<v Speaker 1>funny to such a cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always was now.</v>

1285
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:32.530

<v Speaker 1>and I think he's doing standup now to </v>

1286
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:32.530
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:33.500

<v Speaker 1>but the way it was done was so wild and </v>

1311
01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost after every filming everybody was</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1318
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>my late twenties,</v>

01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:45.641
<v Speaker 1>just gotten into stand up and then moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to la and I didn't know what the </v>

1321
01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:48.881
<v Speaker 1>fuck I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe I was on TV two years </v>

1322
01:00:48.881 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was broke as fuck,</v>

1323
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barely getting by as a comic and then </v>

1324
01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.561
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I'm sitting here with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave fucking Foley and Phil Hartman and </v>

1325
01:00:56.561 --> 01:00:57.110
<v Speaker 1>we're going over the lines of the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on.</v>

1326
01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make any sense.</v>

1327
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>So you had trouble accepting that or it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just like weird.</v>

1328
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

1329
01:01:05.801 --> 01:01:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we had these wild drunken fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties after the,</v>

1331
01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>after the shows for time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were crazy.</v>

1332
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:17.590
<v Speaker 1>They were very punk rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Foley like really embraced some </v>

1333
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>sort of a punk ideology for the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1334
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And the producers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1335
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>especially Paul Simms who was the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who created it,</v>

1336
01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head writer,</v>

1337
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>and he would just let the funniest stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through.</v>

1338
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Like he just wanted it to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>funniest.</v>

1339
01:01:31.761 --> 01:01:36.761
<v Speaker 1>So he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote really funny shit and really </v>

1340
01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>creative shit and they would let you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1341
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Phil Hartman ad Lib or Andy Dick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy Dick ad libbed a lot of shit.</v>

1342
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1344
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>figure out a better way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was always tweaking their </v>

1345
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:53.291
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always trying to figure out </v>

1346
01:01:53.291 --> 01:01:53.291
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

1347

1350
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know,</v>

1351
01:01:57.711 --> 01:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>but I kinda think that's a huge vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>

1352
01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You respect the writers.</v>

1353
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Is this flubs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1354
01:02:04.451 --> 01:02:08.740

<v Speaker 1>I made to take a piss.</v>

1355
01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that.</v>

1356
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this.</v>

1357
01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so great.</v>

1358
01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:27.610
<v Speaker 5>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it will be called free.</v>

1359
01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:32.611
<v Speaker 5>Willie's billy free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Billy's Willie Bell.</v>

1360
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.880
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember that flub count for freaks.</v>

1361
01:02:58.590 --> 01:02:59.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1362
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.970
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun Times,</v>

1363
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1364
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 1>But what he was talking about was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what are the.</v>

1365
01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 1>The question was whether I would do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that again,</v>

1366
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.780
<v Speaker 1>like you'd never find a show like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably never going to make one</v>

1367
01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>like that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That show went under the radar.</v>

1368
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It was like while it was on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

1369
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.520
<v Speaker 1>it was so like ignored that it was sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of allowed to be what it became because </v>

1370
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>they fucked with it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know they brought in like a </v>

1371
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.140
<v Speaker 1>couple of romantic characters and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought a woman into the office once.</v>

1372
01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:39.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not Lauren Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman from the Gilmore girls </v>

1373
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lauren Graham?</v>

1374
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll find.</v>

1375
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Is that her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so hot.</v>

1376
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>She's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was on news radio for a season.</v>

1377
01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was um,</v>

1378
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Patrick Warburton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy when you go to a soaring over </v>

1379
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.430
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it?</v>

1380
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Lauren Green Long Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's really fucking funny and really </v>

1381
01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:57.110
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1382
01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of actresses.</v>

1383
01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to them,</v>

1384
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to your representative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever try?</v>

1385
01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.580
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we worked together.</v>

1386
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:08.580
<v Speaker 1>She's a very cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very nice person.</v>

1387
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>She was fun to hang with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1388
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1389
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>she could joke around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was lively,</v>

1390
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 1>they brought her in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that they didn't really,</v>

1391
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really fuck with it,</v>

1392
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of let Paul to his thing and </v>

1393
01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>that's why it was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1394
01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>unless he get a show like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1395
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.850
<v Speaker 1>because once you do a show like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>

1396
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.880
<v Speaker 1>that's like I went from a show before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we did a show on Fox called </v>

1397
01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 1>hardball and hardball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was this like really bad show baseball?</v>

1398
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:37.080
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking terrible.</v>

1399
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And there was a mascot that was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball.</v>

1400
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the show was awesome and got </v>

1401
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:44.120
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1402
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Guys who wrote it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Martin and Kevin currently believe </v>

1403
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:49.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1404
01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.720
<v Speaker 1>they were for writers from married with </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

1405
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.300
<v Speaker 1>There were writings from the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny guys.</v>

1406
01:04:54.301 --> 01:04:59.301
<v Speaker 1>They were really good and they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together this fucking bad ass script and</v>

1407
01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:02.850
<v Speaker 1>the pilot was like really well written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really good stuff.</v>

1408
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.500
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as the show got picked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1409
01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>these guys were kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were a soft spoken to really </v>

1410
01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:10.740
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice guys.</v>

1411
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:15.741
<v Speaker 1>And just kind of soft spoken and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>network didn't think that they were </v>

1412
01:05:15.741 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>strong enough to run a show like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought you needed to be strong.</v>

1413
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>So they booted these guys out and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought in this super duper hacker,</v>

1414
01:05:21.401 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 1>richest dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1415
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.850
<v Speaker 1>he was a hacker [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

1416
01:05:25.851 --> 01:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Like every terrible cliche in a scene.</v>

1417
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>This guy would insert in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His writing was just insanely bad.</v>

1418
01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>He was from that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach member I've ever coached.</v>

1419
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Well he had come from the air somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another and he had gotten on this show </v>

1420
01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.510
<v Speaker 1>and I watched the show get destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so going from that to seeing the </v>

1421
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>news radio way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a weird thing where no one ever</v>

1422
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:52.651
<v Speaker 1>got famous from the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show was always almost going to get </v>

1423
01:05:52.651 --> 01:05:55.381
<v Speaker 1>canceled and limped into five years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even get to 100 episodes.</v>

1424
01:05:56.321 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 1>We were two episodes shy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like almost for the show,</v>

1425
01:06:00.401 --> 01:06:02.350
<v Speaker 1>like prophetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1426
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we are,</v>

1427
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.130
<v Speaker 1>which is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of that,</v>

1428
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.370
<v Speaker 1>because the no pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no start,</v>

1429
01:06:08.371 --> 01:06:09.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no craziness.</v>

1430
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too much.</v>

1431
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Network interference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1432
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:17.791
<v Speaker 1>Producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became this weird environment where </v>

1433
01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:17.791
<v Speaker 1>there's all this ad libbing and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1434
01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rechanging of things in very dynamic and</v>

1435
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 1>really funny stuff that you're proud to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell someone that you worked on.</v>

1436
01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you've done that,</v>

1437
01:06:24.851 --> 01:06:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to do a shitty one like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardball when again.</v>

1438
01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most likely that's where you're </v>

1439
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:33.400
<v Speaker 1>going to run into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>

1440
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking silent movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1441
01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:40.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta fake laughs and </v>

1442
01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:41.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a silent movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to keep that art form alive,</v>

1443
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you guys were riffing in front of</v>

1444
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:45.100
<v Speaker 1>the audience while the cameras are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling.</v>

1445
01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

1446
01:06:45.871 --> 01:06:47.560
<v Speaker 1>It's so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd written in front of the cameras.</v>

1447
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Dave would oftentimes change a line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on the fly,</v>

1448
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:57.120
<v Speaker 1>like come up with something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>funnier because his background had been </v>

1449
01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:57.120
<v Speaker 1>live performing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1450
01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So he knew how to come up with stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fly.</v>

1451
01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Is that hardball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1452
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I remember when this is on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was only on for like six episodes.</v>

1453
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I think we did seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only six of them ever made it to the</v>

1454
01:07:09.161 --> 01:07:11.050
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just they just.</v>

1455
01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>It just got butchered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happens a lot of the </v>

1456
01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.390
<v Speaker 1>time because in the business of TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people were trying to do is make a </v>

1457
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 1>shitload of money and these producer </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

1458
01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:22.180
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to control everything and they</v>

1459
01:07:22.181 --> 01:07:24.490
<v Speaker 1>want to make a shitload of money and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are allowed to,</v>

1460
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 1>if they get into a situation where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

1461
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you can't be surprised that they do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that their ideas suck.</v>

1462
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.440
<v Speaker 1>They think they're awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they have the job.</v>

1463
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:37.530
<v Speaker 1>So they push forward thinking that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome ideas that aren't so awesome </v>

1464
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>actually are going to change this show </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the better.</v>

1465
01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not trying to fuck it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he fucked it up.</v>

1466
01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>When you see stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1467
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1468
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 1>There's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do podcasts.</v>

1469
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how many people you've got to </v>

1470
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.430
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1471
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard Seinfeld talking about how like </v>

1472
01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:55.310
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the only shows where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1473
01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:56.260
<v Speaker 1>no we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Larry.</v>

1474
01:07:56.261 --> 01:08:01.261
<v Speaker 1>David was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no outside influences and he was always </v>

1475
01:08:01.261 --> 01:08:04.291
<v Speaker 1>willing to walk before he was even </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody before he even had any money in </v>

1476
01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:04.291
<v Speaker 1>the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1477
01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how true that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet it's true.</v>

1478
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Then they initially like shows always </v>
<v Speaker 1>get fucked with in the beginning.</v>

1479
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean unless you bring in like unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Martin Scorsese and speed Steven </v>

1480
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg team up together for some new </v>
<v Speaker 1>miniseries.</v>

1481
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that network is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up on that.</v>

1482
01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But until that happens,</v>

1483
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>they have some say and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to,</v>

1484
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>they want to throw their own special </v>
<v Speaker 1>spice into the zoo.</v>

1485
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I like coriander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we put coriander in this suit?</v>

1486
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck with your coriander?</v>

1487
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd throw it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're watching your soup get ruined.</v>

1488
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1489
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:38.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a business.</v>

1490
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like anything else.</v>

1491
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:44.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the design of a car or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the box that the corn flakes come in.</v>

1492
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:49.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have their say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have opinions and </v>

1493
01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:49.900
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1494
01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:50.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of weird desk going on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't,</v>

1495
01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as I do that when you're trying </v>

1496
01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:58.301
<v Speaker 1>to create something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you try and create </v>

1497
01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.480
<v Speaker 1>something funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less shit you have coming in,</v>

1498
01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:04.481
<v Speaker 1>the better when it comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like outside of the creative sphere,</v>

1499
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less people.</v>

1500
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Once you get down to a core group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>very competent individuals like writers </v>

1501
01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.731
<v Speaker 1>and artists are sitting together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to compile the correct way to do </v>

1502
01:09:15.731 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 1>something and they're working on it very</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard if they're a functional group,</v>

1503
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.920
<v Speaker 1>that should be where that ends.</v>

1504
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1505
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:23.210
<v Speaker 1>When producers come in and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they have line reads and</v>

1506
01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1507
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1508
01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you hire writers?</v>

1509
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:34.121
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just do everything right </v>

1510
01:09:34.121 --> 01:09:34.850
<v Speaker 1>when she's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you write a script that happens all</v>

1511
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the time to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell a producer once you write a</v>

1512
01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:42.191
<v Speaker 1>script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of producers think that Ken </v>

1513
01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:42.191
<v Speaker 1>writes scripts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1514
01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:42.191
<v Speaker 1>So they'll go and they'll write scripts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then those writers,</v>

1515
01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:44.660
<v Speaker 1>we'll pass it around amongst their </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and fucking giggle.</v>

1516
01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>

1517
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that on a really small level when </v>

1518
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.461
<v Speaker 1>I first started doing stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this management group and they're </v>

1519
01:09:54.461 --> 01:09:56.800
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna try to base a sitcom around </v>

1520
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 1>the fucking five minutes that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have and every month.</v>

1521
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't just me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a bunch of guys that they managed</v>

1522
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:06.250
<v Speaker 1>every month they would have these shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they would go to and then they </v>

1523
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 1>would give us suggestions on how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write sets that would inspire sitcoms.</v>

1524
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually got pretty far down the </v>

1525
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:17.951
<v Speaker 1>pike with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like castle rock and we were </v>

1526
01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:17.951
<v Speaker 1>pitching and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this,</v>

1527
01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:19.610
<v Speaker 1>this was 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2002.</v>

1528
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1529
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:23.780
<v Speaker 1>There was still doing a lot of sitcoms </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

1530
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:28.810
<v Speaker 1>There's still the development deal game </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then because that was the first </v>

1531
01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:29.900
<v Speaker 1>year of fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was when reality shows were just</v>

1532
01:10:29.901 --> 01:10:34.901
<v Speaker 1>starting to take off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A survivor was first and then was a </v>

1533
01:10:34.901 --> 01:10:35.150
<v Speaker 1>couple of other ones and then there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1534
01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NBC had fear factor and a couple of </v>

1535
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.040
<v Speaker 1>other ones and then it was just reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows like Jon and Kate plus eight and </v>

1536
01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Speaker 1>all these other motherfuckers just </v>
<v Speaker 1>spewed onto the scene.</v>

1537
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the influx of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows over the last decade.</v>

1538
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.760
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

1539
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand two that wasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on as much as a lot of sitcoms.</v>

1540
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's that sweet,</v>

1541
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:59.541

<v Speaker 1>It's not really game.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No complaining and whining.</v>

1600
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.670
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1601
01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slick.</v>

1602
01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:36.350
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere I go,</v>

1603
01:13:36.351 --> 01:13:41.351
<v Speaker 4>I worried someone's gonna hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He barely gave a fuck that this guy hit </v>

1604
01:13:41.351 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 4>him in the face of the pipe and not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have his teeth.</v>

1605
01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.780
<v Speaker 4>His teeth look better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm telling you,</v>

1606
01:13:44.781 --> 01:13:46.860
<v Speaker 4>this dude barely gave a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>

1607
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:49.790
<v Speaker 4>it was a tough dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he ever went on to do,</v>

1608
01:13:49.791 --> 01:13:54.170
<v Speaker 4>but I do know is a really strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw he got something,</v>

1609
01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:58.220
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a new show or something like that.</v>

1610
01:13:58.221 --> 01:13:59.130
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got like a,</v>

1611
01:13:59.131 --> 01:14:01.400
<v Speaker 4>a part in something that he was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>excited about.</v>

1612
01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.630
<v Speaker 4>And his girlfriend at the time who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>also an actress,</v>

1613
01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 4>started openly crying when he received </v>
<v Speaker 4>the good news and</v>

1614
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:17.190
<v Speaker 1>she kept saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is something going to happen for </v>

1615
01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:17.190
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1616
01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:18.370
<v Speaker 1>when is something going to happen for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

1617
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And she's crying men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1618
01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:22.310
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this port I've,</v>

1619
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad for her brain works that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1620
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:26.510
<v Speaker 1>this poor kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1621
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:31.830
<v Speaker 1>look at this crazy brain pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's on weird self-absorbed brain </v>

1622
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:34.660
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the Hollywood way,</v>

1623
01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely the acting way.</v>

1624
01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

1625
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.180
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of lottery plan.</v>

1626
01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of them aren't that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the,</v>

1627
01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.320
<v Speaker 1>even the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that much better than some guy </v>

1628
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:48.320
<v Speaker 1>that's doing community theater in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oakland,</v>

1629
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably some bad motherfucker that</v>

1630
01:14:51.541 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 1>can't keep his shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smokes a little bit too much.</v>

1631
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:59.821
<v Speaker 1>Drinks a little bit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when he gets his shit together and </v>

1632
01:14:59.821 --> 01:14:59.821
<v Speaker 1>gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1633
01:14:59.821 --> 01:15:00.700
<v Speaker 1>gets a hold of a script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could probably fuck it up.</v>

1634
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's just never been gotten the </v>

1635
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:07.951
<v Speaker 1>right acting fucking agent or agency or </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts or they always a part of it goes </v>

1636
01:15:08.541 --> 01:15:10.990
<v Speaker 1>to and Pharaoh when he gets close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

1637
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:14.740
<v Speaker 1>But the difference between a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good and the difference between a</v>

1638
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:18.790
<v Speaker 1>guy who's really famous as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's valuable in a lot of ways,</v>

1639
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:21.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like how much better is the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy?</v>

1640
01:15:21.191 --> 01:15:26.191
<v Speaker 1>Then the famous guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've got to be a lot better </v>

1641
01:15:26.191 --> 01:15:28.860
<v Speaker 1>because if you're not a lot better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with a famous guy </v>

1642
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:28.860
<v Speaker 1>because people go to see if God Damn Tom</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruise movie,</v>

1643
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like they,</v>

1644
01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 1>they have a hard road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1645
01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see his picture?</v>

1646
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's like all the guys sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like,</v>

1647
01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:44.220
<v Speaker 1>had a fucking baseball bat that a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Rosemarie.</v>

1648
01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.190
<v Speaker 1>She's from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the Dick van dyke show or</v>

1649
01:15:48.191 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1650
01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the Dick Van Dyke show,</v>

1651
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but I remember I was embarrassed that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know.</v>

1652
01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1653
01:15:57.971 --> 01:15:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I think I never seen the Dick van dyke </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1654
01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:05.190
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen the Mary Tyler Moore </v>

1655
01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:05.190
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not as weird.</v>

1656
01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:07.210
<v Speaker 1>The Dick Van Dyke show is weird because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary Tyler Moore is really young.</v>

1657
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 1>They're A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1658
01:16:09.101 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 1>she was on the Dick Van Dyke show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never watched it.</v>

1659
01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 1>So when everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Rosemarie,</v>

1660
01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:14.500
<v Speaker 1>like people on the set with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosemary.</v>

1661
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1662
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:19.900
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is before wikipedia folks.</v>

1663
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.110
<v Speaker 1>No one knew anything back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

1664
01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:26.900
<v Speaker 1>We were stupid in 1993.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings were monkeys.</v>

1665
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.770
<v Speaker 1>We were monkeys with a o railroad </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1666
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Had a language and cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you can do,</v>

1667
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.930
<v Speaker 1>go to the encyclopedia and look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1668
01:16:34.931 --> 01:16:38.470
<v Speaker 1>we're so much fucking smarter now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was interesting because after I'd</v>

1669
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.420
<v Speaker 1>met her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>

1670
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:44.580
<v Speaker 1>She was getting on in age and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still alive.</v>

1671
01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:46.960
<v Speaker 1>She's born in Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>26,</v>

1672
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:50.650
<v Speaker 1>so to to be able to look back and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1673
01:16:50.651 --> 01:16:54.310
<v Speaker 1>After I met her then I watched the Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>Van Dyke show and I got to look back and</v>

1674
01:16:54.311 --> 01:16:58.510
<v Speaker 1>see her on what was like for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were alive at the time.</v>

1675
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:01.420
<v Speaker 1>That was an iconic program and so I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1676
01:17:01.421 --> 01:17:06.421
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I know why these older people that </v>

1677
01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:07.180
<v Speaker 1>were on the set were like freaked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was like,</v>

1678
01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ would be weird to be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television if you were born and lived </v>

1679
01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.800
<v Speaker 1>before television was even invented </v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

1680
01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know you looked it up before </v>

1681
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>and it was invented way back before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was common.</v>

1682
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still it wasn't common until the </v>

1683
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:26.921
<v Speaker 1>And people that they barely had enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to buy one of those gigantic </v>

1685
01:17:26.921 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 1>furniture things you would roll into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your living room and occupy a good solid</v>

1686
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>10 square feet of space.</v>

1687
01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you could brian see if you could </v>

1688
01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:38.321

<v Speaker 1>like a highlight or clip of a show on,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She still does.</v>

1693
01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1694
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.460
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.060
<v Speaker 1>it ain't easy for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shares a lot.</v>

1696
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:58.090
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that don't get a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about acting that's kind of </v>

1697
01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:02.140
<v Speaker 1>fucked is a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>awesome at it if they apply themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of friends that we have </v>

1699
01:18:05.531 --> 01:18:06.830

1714
01:18:46.281 --> 01:18:51.281

<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to make a deal work </v>

1715
01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:51.320
<v Speaker 1>smoothly and sometimes you got to knock </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little and you've got to be able to do</v>

1716
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:53.240
<v Speaker 1>both and that's what the full charges </v>

1721
01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:07.760
<v Speaker 1>of 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we are our cards correctly,</v>

1722
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:11.030
<v Speaker 1>we gave them a little taste by talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it here on the podcast.</v>

1723
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.400
<v Speaker 8>Let the pitch meetings begin.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's watch this.</v>

1724
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:21.790
<v Speaker 8>God Damn Mary Tyler Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mary Tyler Moore.</v>

1725
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.840

<v Speaker 4>Death of the party.</v>

1726
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:36.240
<v Speaker 4>Just the way people pretended that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were back then is weird.</v>

1727
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Sleep in the same bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least look at this.</v>

1728
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is pretty sexy.</v>

1729
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:46.620

<v Speaker 4>they don't man.</v>

1730
01:19:46.621 --> 01:19:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Look at the separation between the two </v>
<v Speaker 4>beds.</v>

1731
01:19:48.670 --> 01:19:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1733
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:56.870
<v Speaker 4>he has to sleep in the next bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is bullshit,</v>

1734
01:19:56.910 --> 01:20:01.910
<v Speaker 4>but doing it from behind was with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>more popular back then because you had </v>

1735
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:03.450
<v Speaker 4>that extra gap so yours is always </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably just leaned over the bed.</v>

1736
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:05.760

1741
01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:14.460

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:21.230
<v Speaker 4>like a Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen?</v>

1830
01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.570
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm gonna find it on Google,</v>

1831
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:28.630
<v Speaker 4>the flying saucer house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>James [inaudible] fired or Brian Flying</v>

1832
01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:30.690
<v Speaker 4>saucer house.</v>

1833
01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in Holland when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1834
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 1>it's so wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a house though that once you lived </v>

1835
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 1>in it for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

1836
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:42.770
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

1837
01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dope is that?</v>

1838
01:24:44.631 --> 01:24:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1839
01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:47.510
<v Speaker 4>The encounter at lax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that restaurant.</v>

1840
01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.140
<v Speaker 4>But this is someone's fucking house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1841
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:51.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no kidding.</v>

1842
01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Someone's chilling in that house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1843
01:24:53.841 --> 01:24:54.710
<v Speaker 4>I take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1844
01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:56.940
<v Speaker 4>that's Uber Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to learn that.</v>

1845
01:24:56.970 --> 01:24:59.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like living in this space needle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this photo.</v>

1846
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's try it to see if he can pull that </v>

1847
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.630
<v Speaker 4>one up so that you stream people can see</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1848
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:09.380
<v Speaker 4>This fucking house is radical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might even survive an earthquake or </v>

1849
01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:12.831
<v Speaker 4>an avalanche or something in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would be worshiped by Star Trek and </v>

1850
01:25:12.901 --> 01:25:17.901
<v Speaker 4>star wars geeks and where's this at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood hills or somewhere in </v>

1851
01:25:17.901 --> 01:25:17.901
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood.</v>

1852
01:25:17.901 --> 01:25:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm John Lottner by John Lautner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who created it.</v>

1853
01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering when this was built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1854
01:25:25.951 --> 01:25:28.530
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a construction back in 1960,</v>

1855
01:25:28.531 --> 01:25:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was recently renovated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1856
01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:37.040
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're so cocky though,</v>

1858
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:42.950
<v Speaker 1>like local people do in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take a hill in a place where the </v>

1859
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:47.090
<v Speaker 1>ground moves all the fucking time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just stick a big spike right down </v>

1860
01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:51.090
<v Speaker 1>the middle and put a circle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says they'll stay here.</v>

1861
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.910
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe no one lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>death star or whatever.</v>

1862
01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:58.940
<v Speaker 4>No one's recreated that they'll live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just put out a fucking awesome </v>

1863
01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.120
<v Speaker 4>message into someone's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Run with that.</v>

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Make sure you finish it guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to leave any weak spots.</v>

1865
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Now should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't make it full size,</v>

1866
01:26:04.941 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 4>full charge where they would have to to </v>
<v Speaker 4>satisfy me starting in space.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1868
01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:14.750
<v Speaker 4>That's for the nerds to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get on at boys.</v>

1869
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.310
<v Speaker 4>Seriously though.</v>

<v Speaker 4>really crazy view.</v>

01:26:42.681 --> 01:26:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen that view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian?</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that is an incredible picture.</v>

1885
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:58.510
<v Speaker 4>This house is so weird because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounded by glass because of is a Ufo </v>

1886
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:59.450
<v Speaker 4>theme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:05.320

<v Speaker 4>more of these like really weird freaky </v>

1888
01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:10.061
<v Speaker 4>houses in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would think there would be a lot of </v>

1889
01:27:10.061 --> 01:27:10.061
<v Speaker 4>like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unusual.</v>

1890
01:27:10.061 --> 01:27:15.010
<v Speaker 4>I guess by the time you can afford a </v>
<v Speaker 4>house you've kind like got rid of all </v>

1891
01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:16.700
<v Speaker 4>those crazy ideas about living in a </v>

<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

1893
01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 4>And like if you do come up with a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>plan for it.</v>

1894
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:26.470
<v Speaker 4>If you're an architect and you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>find somebody who's crazy enough to do </v>

1895
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:30.341
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he also wants to find like the </v>

1896
01:27:30.341 --> 01:27:31.160
<v Speaker 4>homeowner's association has to agree.</v>

01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:32.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say no to a lot of stuff,</v>

1943
01:29:20.181 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 4>things on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1944
01:29:20.851 --> 01:29:23.340
<v Speaker 4>so they probably appreciated that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were being recognized.</v>

1945
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of an interesting,</v>

1946
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:25.860
<v Speaker 4>like what shows</v>

1947
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.830
<v Speaker 1>take off with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like star trek went on forever.</v>

1948
01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It went on for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was five.</v>

1949
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Was it five years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was that many.</v>

1950
01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it was more like three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say Star Trek was a great fucking </v>

1951
01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Cheryl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that,</v>

1952
01:29:38.071 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1953
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:41.940
<v Speaker 1>here's another perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1954
01:29:41.941 --> 01:29:45.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking rocky hard midnight show,</v>

1955
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.780
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do the rocky horror picture </v>

1956
01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:53.211
<v Speaker 1>show at midnight ones and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people get up and they sing along </v>

1957
01:29:53.211 --> 01:29:54.300
<v Speaker 1>to the music they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw rice,</v>

1958
01:29:54.301 --> 01:29:59.301
<v Speaker 1>they wear the clothes that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing and in the music and the </v>

1959
01:29:59.301 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 1>musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still do it at the new art,</v>

1960
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.990
<v Speaker 1>like once a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once a week.</v>

1961
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:04.140
<v Speaker 1>How's that one take off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why that would is,</v>

1962
01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:07.350
<v Speaker 1>what is it about the rocky horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture show that makes everyone want to</v>

1963
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:12.351
<v Speaker 1>get together and watch it over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over and over and over and </v>

1964
01:30:12.351 --> 01:30:15.981
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have these midnight screenings and </v>

1965
01:30:15.981 --> 01:30:15.981
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves it and they dress up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1966
01:30:15.981 --> 01:30:16.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:19.020
<v Speaker 1>But if forms over this one fucking weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

1968
01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:23.320
<v Speaker 4>it's all such a fucking perfect storm of</v>
<v Speaker 4>events that comes out at the right time,</v>

1969
01:30:23.321 --> 01:30:27.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people notice it doesn't hurt.</v>

1970
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:33.030
<v Speaker 1>The movie is fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time viewing is a bad ass movie.</v>

1971
01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocky horror picture show is a very good</v>

1972
01:30:35.651 --> 01:30:36.760
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that movie.</v>

1973
01:30:36.850 --> 01:30:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Especially at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it holds up to get </v>

1974
01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:44.581
<v Speaker 1>today might be a little absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing all the rocky horror picture </v>

1975
01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:48.031
<v Speaker 1>show shit behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I'm very aware of but </v>

1976
01:30:48.031 --> 01:30:49.320
<v Speaker 1>don't know anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've never seen it and I don't.</v>

1977
01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's,</v>

1978
01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:53.230
<v Speaker 1>it's also a time capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably see it again to four.</v>

1979
01:30:53.231 --> 01:30:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I recommend it because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1980
01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched um,</v>

1981
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:58.420
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>altered states moving that uh,</v>

1982
01:30:58.421 --> 01:31:00.820
<v Speaker 1>William hurt movie about isolation </v>
<v Speaker 1>tanks.</v>

1983
01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I watched it and I thought it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most amazing movie ever got me into </v>

1984
01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanks got me researching and eventually </v>

1985
01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:11.791
<v Speaker 1>got me to own one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like a pivotal moment in my </v>

1986
01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:12.100
<v Speaker 1>life seeing that movie and I remember it</v>
<v Speaker 1>being very good.</v>

1987
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.950
<v Speaker 1>High wants to</v>

1988
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:18.480
<v Speaker 4>dog shit is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've barely gotten.</v>

1989
01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to talk Mrs Rogan into </v>

1990
01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.861
<v Speaker 4>Washington with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch this shit with me for five </v>

1991
01:31:26.861 --> 01:31:26.861
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

1992
01:31:26.861 --> 01:31:29.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you so bad man,</v>

1993
01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:32.420
<v Speaker 4>it's missing so much that makes a movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1994
01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.540
<v Speaker 4>And then you don't get to pick the movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>again for another three or four choices.</v>

1995
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about full trust me.</v>

1996
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how movies don't fucking hold</v>

1997
01:31:47.461 --> 01:31:49.020
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of them don't,</v>

1998
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:51.720
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so strange.</v>

1999
01:31:51.721 --> 01:31:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Like watch the Godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

2000
01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It's God damn perfect gem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2001
01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.980
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is great about it.</v>

2002
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine goodfellas ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2003
01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:02.890
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

2004
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:06.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's movies that are just so good.</v>

2005
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:10.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved great heights as well.</v>

2006
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie's still gonna stand no matter</v>

2007
01:32:13.001 --> 01:32:16.300
<v Speaker 1>what era it's shown in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in consideration between like</v>

2008
01:32:16.301 --> 01:32:21.301
<v Speaker 1>what technology was available to shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie like that then as it was when it </v>

2009
01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:21.301
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's available today.</v>

2010
01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:26.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good when not even Martin Scorsese </v>

2011
01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:26.250
<v Speaker 1>can top it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the one that did it.</v>

2012
01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:30.450
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One flew over the cuckoo's nest holds </v>

<v Speaker 1>He looks like he weighs maybe 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2104
01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.950

<v Speaker 1>and weird and shiny.</v>

01:36:14.041 --> 01:36:15.830
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of spark.</v>

2107
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:17.610
<v Speaker 1>He's got no life.</v>

01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 1>how funny he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go watch smokey and the bandit,</v>

2110
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:26.330
<v Speaker 1>it's another time capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to see.</v>

2111
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:28.370
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even look like that now.</v>

2112
01:36:28.371 --> 01:36:33.371

<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't do that movies anymore.</v>

2116
01:36:36.381 --> 01:36:39.070

<v Speaker 1>the band.</v>

2117
01:36:39.071 --> 01:36:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>If you look through a million hours of </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2170
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:20.060
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see in me in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the computer and then 10 percent of </v>

2171
01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:20.780
<v Speaker 4>those times I'll be beating off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's you going to say.</v>

2172
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 4>So if you need to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still not a crime through that thing,</v>

2173
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 4>but like why would anybody want to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through that data?</v>

2174
01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:31.080
<v Speaker 4>What are you trying to prove?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just tell you,</v>

2175
01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.590
<v Speaker 4>this has been documented for some people</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2176
01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600
<v Speaker 4>It's dangerous as I find out that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>beat off.</v>

2177
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Like if you found out the Colin Powell </v>
<v Speaker 4>was an obsessive like foot fetish.</v>

2178
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:42.240
<v Speaker 4>It would change the way I thought about </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2179
01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:45.600
<v Speaker 4>That's his move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He loved like watching a video.</v>

2180
01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:50.610
<v Speaker 4>Very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One girl's licking your balls while the </v>

2181
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:50.610
<v Speaker 4>other one you're coming on our feet </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2182
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:55.371
<v Speaker 4>That would change the way I thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>about him and I would question his </v>

2183
01:39:55.371 --> 01:39:57.411
<v Speaker 4>ability to lead the military style even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though it's irrational for me to think </v>

2184
01:39:57.411 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:39:57.421 --> 01:40:00.630
<v Speaker 4>If you found out that he was really into</v>
<v Speaker 4>transgender porn,</v>

2186
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.080
<v Speaker 4>that was his big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would.</v>

2187
01:40:02.150 --> 01:40:04.740
<v Speaker 4>You would not trust them when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to decision making.</v>

2188
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I mean meanwhile there's no </v>

2189
01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:11.811
<v Speaker 4>other indications.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's exactly the same person as when he </v>

2190
01:40:11.811 --> 01:40:11.811
<v Speaker 4>was like the most awesome general ever.</v>

2191
01:40:11.811 --> 01:40:13.410
<v Speaker 4>His resumes the exact same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just find all this training.</v>

2192
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Porn shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if it gets out to the news?</v>

2193
01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:17.370
<v Speaker 4>People find out how we enjoy this </v>
<v Speaker 4>pleasure.</v>

2194
01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Was that slice of pain trans transgender</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a girl.</v>

2195
01:40:22.201 --> 01:40:24.220
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2196
01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:29.540
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean girl to a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning like a girl that has like boobs </v>

2197
01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:33.150
<v Speaker 4>and hectic but it dick and it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>a normal girl that's hot you that,</v>

2198
01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:38.320
<v Speaker 4>you watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch that because it's like you take </v>

2199
01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 4>the guy who you don't really want to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways and you give them boobs and make</v>

2200
01:40:40.141 --> 01:40:45.141
<v Speaker 4>them look like a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't affect Brian's reputation </v>

2201
01:40:45.141 --> 01:40:45.141
<v Speaker 4>when he says something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have a reputation.</v>

2202
01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:51.170
<v Speaker 4>Reputation is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the best aspect of his </v>

2203
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:54.111
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his curiosity and his willingness to </v>

2204
01:40:54.111 --> 01:40:54.150
<v Speaker 4>hang his neck out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't want them leaving</v>

2205
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.180
<v Speaker 1>the military at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like instead of having to look at a</v>

2206
01:40:58.181 --> 01:41:00.330
<v Speaker 1>hairy dude or some ugly dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2207
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I see your logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried it?</v>

2208
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work with me.</v>

2209
01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I limit myself to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2210
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

2211
01:41:08.411 --> 01:41:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll like it because then it'll be all I</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch and now I'm Colin Powell.</v>

2212
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I think personally when you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into weird freaky shit,</v>

2213
01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.860
<v Speaker 1>like if you're only into like someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming on feet or something like that,</v>

2214
01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you need to stop beating off for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple months.</v>

2215
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you've talked yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird box where every girl has to </v>

2216
01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:31.250
<v Speaker 1>have a dick and you know everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed up to have red nails,</v>

2217
01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:37.720
<v Speaker 1>just no fucking red nail Polish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll fight your search message boards </v>

2218
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.380
<v Speaker 1>for the Red Nail Polish fetish jerking </v>
<v Speaker 1>off forum and everyone agrees with these</v>

2219
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:41.050
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

2220
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Black Goth toads who wants to see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you find the red nail Polish,</v>

2221
01:41:45.011 --> 01:41:47.560
<v Speaker 1>but still not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to find the perfect.</v>

2222
01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:49.600
<v Speaker 1>There's always gonna be people to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2223
01:41:49.601 --> 01:41:54.601
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a relationship or whether </v>

2224
01:41:54.601 --> 01:41:55.870
<v Speaker 1>it's star trek and take things to a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

2225
01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 1>They take a good thing and they put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bad place.</v>

2226
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:02.500
<v Speaker 1>That's why porn gets such a God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible reputation is because.</v>

2227
01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:07.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a few dudes who beat off a wee </v>

2228
01:42:07.501 --> 01:42:07.501
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2229
01:42:07.501 --> 01:42:07.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2230
01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too much,</v>

2231
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's also people that use it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have to date people.</v>

2232
01:42:13.541 --> 01:42:15.880
<v Speaker 1>They don't really want to date just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some sex.</v>

2233
01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:17.830
<v Speaker 1>They just see it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2234
01:42:17.831 --> 01:42:22.831
<v Speaker 1>they didn't create it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel totally responsible for </v>

2235
01:42:22.831 --> 01:42:26.090
<v Speaker 1>just watching it and downloading it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they beat off and then they go </v>

2236
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:28.540
<v Speaker 1>about their day full charge being </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped like poor Dick Van Dyke,</v>

2237
01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Dick Van Dyke who had to sleep in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different bed,</v>

2238
01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.500
<v Speaker 1>wasn't allowed to beat off them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even go fishing back then.</v>

2239
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:38.650
<v Speaker 1>They thought Satan would come and steal </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your sleep if you beat off.</v>

2240
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

2241
01:42:39.431 --> 01:42:43.120
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know how it got labeled a </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexual thing.</v>

2242
01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Beat off and be masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beat off and be gay.</v>

2243
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be.</v>

2244
01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a man fucking a man.</v>

2245
01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:51.220
<v Speaker 1>You have a dick in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

2246
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:53.990
<v Speaker 1>You're doing gay shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking a man's hand up there.</v>

2247
01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:54.940
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Weirdo.</v>

2249
01:42:57.551 --> 01:43:01.510

<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in gay sex except my own</v>

2250
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:04.480
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My both my hands are gay as fuck.</v>

2251
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I right to way more guy left hands gay </v>

2252
01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.061
<v Speaker 1>and my right hand's getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately they're only gay from my </v>

2253
01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monogamous lucked out on that one.</v>

2254
01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Not there's anything wrong with being </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>

2255
01:43:16.571 --> 01:43:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like you guys carried more </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight than we do.</v>

2256
01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:21.340
<v Speaker 1>We carry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry a greater societal burden.</v>

2257
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't not from people like me but </v>
<v Speaker 1>from people who judge.</v>

2258
01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that case,</v>

2259
01:43:27.011 --> 01:43:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad my Dick is the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>my hands are attracted to.</v>

2260
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:33.850
<v Speaker 1>You have less to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gay Hands are called Jazz hands,</v>

2261
01:43:33.851 --> 01:43:35.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No jazz hands.</v>

2262
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Trying to put a little extra energy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that really sucks.</v>

2263
01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:44.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's really not that good or</v>

2264
01:43:44.951 --> 01:43:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to downplay something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is unbelievably super awesome data.</v>

2265
01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're standing there in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a movie waiting for three years and </v>

2266
01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.510
<v Speaker 1>you have the opening night tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are legit jazz hands.</v>

2267
01:43:56.650 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're waiting for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hobbit.</v>

2268
01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Desolation of smoke to come out waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in line.</v>

2269
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when the fucking Harry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter novels were coming out and people</v>

2270
01:44:05.541 --> 01:44:09.560
<v Speaker 1>were making videos of them running by </v>
<v Speaker 1>and giving away the ending?</v>

2271
01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2272
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2273
01:44:11.811 --> 01:44:13.060
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2274
01:44:13.110 --> 01:44:14.330
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys were cons.</v>

2275
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.600
<v Speaker 1>It would have been great if the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended with somebody just full line </v>

2276
01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.010
<v Speaker 1>citing the guy on the bike just knocking</v>
<v Speaker 1>them down,</v>

2277
01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:24.080
<v Speaker 1>kicking his ass and all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter dorks join in.</v>

2278
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beaten with brooms.</v>

2279
01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Imagine man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wanting to steal joy is one,</v>

2280
01:44:34.251 --> 01:44:39.251
<v Speaker 1>a steel mystery from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always somebody and that was </v>

2281
01:44:39.251 --> 01:44:39.251
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2284
01:44:45.161 --> 01:44:45.380

<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a crew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:33.730
<v Speaker 4>These weren't ready yet to get to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>some other venue that also work so </v>

2397
01:49:33.730 --> 01:49:34.360
<v Speaker 4>everybody doesn't give a fuck together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2398
01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.440
<v Speaker 4>because it's just you on your own out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there in the wilderness of life,</v>

2399
01:49:37.441 --> 01:49:40.920
<v Speaker 4>being judged by your fashion choices </v>
<v Speaker 4>where to fucking tracksuit.</v>

2400
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.440
<v Speaker 4>And you see a girl outside of a place </v>
<v Speaker 4>where a girl,</v>

2401
01:49:43.441 --> 01:49:44.820
<v Speaker 4>if you were dressed like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

2402
01:49:44.850 --> 01:49:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2403
01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:46.570
<v Speaker 4>your mat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>full tron,</v>

2404
01:49:46.590 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 4>stand up comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she sees</v>

2405
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you and while you're wearing a track </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit,</v>

2406
01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:55.920
<v Speaker 1>just like being casual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I like dressing like a moron is that</v>

2407
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:57.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't buy that anymore or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't buy it.</v>

2408
01:49:57.610 --> 01:49:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Is it a moral thing or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable thing?</v>

2409
01:49:59.351 --> 01:50:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Are we the morons full charge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm the moron with our zippers to</v>

2410
01:50:03.761 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 1>get our dicks trapped in our belts when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we could just have a simple drawstring,</v>

2411
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>easy access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to start smoking cigars to to </v>

2412
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So little,</v>

2413
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:14.920
<v Speaker 1>little back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of organized crime.</v>

2414
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee owned that type of track suit.</v>

2415
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:23.101
<v Speaker 1>The same way Hitler on the mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't wear that without people </v>

2416
01:50:23.101 --> 01:50:24.790
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said Bruce,</v>

2417
01:50:25.210 --> 01:50:27.580
<v Speaker 1>many more people than I see like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2418
01:50:27.610 --> 01:50:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could wear that no problem.</v>

2419
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:32.140
<v Speaker 1>But that game of death one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Bruce Lee owns that.</v>

2420
01:50:32.170 --> 01:50:33.070
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his.</v>

2421
01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't wear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't wear a yellow jumpsuit.</v>

2422
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:40.140
<v Speaker 1>It'd be embarrassing to wear a jumpsuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like a break dance competition </v>

2423
01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 1>breaks out and then you got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get nothing.</v>

2424
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:44.740
<v Speaker 1>You're just kind of inching away </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly.</v>

2425
01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2426
01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.810
<v Speaker 1>that yellow track suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wear that,</v>

2427
01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:50.380
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

2428
01:50:50.381 --> 01:50:53.250
<v Speaker 1>what's up bruce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll immediately go to that.</v>

2429
01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:55.500
<v Speaker 1>That tracks who is off limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a track suit,</v>

2430
01:50:55.501 --> 01:50:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you better learn a skill and that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>better be karate,</v>

2431
01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:02.680
<v Speaker 1>breakdancing or account numbers and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm thinking about it,</v>

2432
01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:06.590
<v Speaker 1>is there one actor more synonymous with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very specific type of jumpsuit?</v>

2433
01:51:06.591 --> 01:51:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Then Bruce Lee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2434
01:51:09.221 --> 01:51:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean unless you count ll cool j,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can't,</v>

2435
01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:17.340
<v Speaker 1>but they can't because he owned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow jumpsuit and the game of their </v>

2436
01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:20.381
<v Speaker 1>eyes so hard that to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only time you see people wearing </v>

2437
01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:21.640
<v Speaker 1>them is when they're wearing it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce Lee costume.</v>

2438
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A key owns that fucking yellow jumpsuit.</v>

2439
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a time like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>where someone has just a really standard</v>

2440
01:51:29.171 --> 01:51:34.030
<v Speaker 1>type of athletic apparel that is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>common to them that when you see it,</v>

2441
01:51:34.031 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 1>all you think about is them fanny pack.</v>

2442
01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fanny pack,</v>

2443
01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:47.850
<v Speaker 1>when you have an ass like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one sees anything other than your </v>

2444
01:51:47.850 --> 01:51:50.191
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fanny pack is only examined by </v>

2445
01:51:50.191 --> 01:51:50.191
<v Speaker 1>people online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were there in front of her,</v>

2446
01:51:50.191 --> 01:51:55.081
<v Speaker 1>it would be like a mirage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to sit and you'd </v>

2447
01:51:55.081 --> 01:51:55.630
<v Speaker 1>see her hips to asset ratio is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

2448
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's ridiculous.</v>

2449
01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculously hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what we're talking about now.</v>

2450
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Jack Nicholson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burt reynolds was burt rental truck.</v>

2451
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:14.120

<v Speaker 1>When you see a guy like burt reynolds </v>

<v Speaker 1>and really hurting right now.</v>

2453
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:19.060
<v Speaker 1>No one's won the plastic surgery game </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He said he's an actor the most.</v>

2464
01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.270
<v Speaker 1>By the time they get to be like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

2465
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:52.750
<v Speaker 1>especially with superstar blockbuster </v>
<v Speaker 1>type dudes that keep the hair the same </v>

2466
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:53.240

<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

2482
01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:33.040
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin just kept being George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlin through being a young guy to be </v>

2483
01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.450
<v Speaker 1>in an old curmudgeon and old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like scholarly curmudgeon,</v>

2484
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.130
<v Speaker 1>breaking down the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2485
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:42.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funny shit about the world became </v>

2486
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:42.990
<v Speaker 1>stayed the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2487
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Something happened to some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2488
01:53:44.131 --> 01:53:45.410
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they just can't do that.</v>

2489
01:53:46.690 --> 01:53:50.330
<v Speaker 1>If something happens to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't accept it.</v>

2490
01:53:50.331 --> 01:53:52.280
<v Speaker 1>They got to cut their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of comics doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The surgery.</v>

2492
01:53:56.331 --> 01:54:01.331
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it became like shown on paper </v>

2493
01:54:01.331 --> 01:54:02.980
<v Speaker 1>that duck lips like every punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten percent,</v>

2494
01:54:03.090 --> 01:54:07.120
<v Speaker 3>but it probably does</v>

2495
01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:10.170
<v Speaker 1>slips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Does Punch Lips.</v>

2496
01:54:10.230 --> 01:54:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I say a punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lips.</v>

2497
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It does it like on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like tell joking</v>

2498
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:16.400
<v Speaker 3>and he's got his face cut too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got that scar.</v>

2499
01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that scar is an accident.</v>

2500
01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And you're right though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's car king from a laser </v>

2501
01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:26.331
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to get as hair removed </v>

2502
01:54:26.331 --> 01:54:28.761
<v Speaker 1>from his face and they burned his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bronies fucking every fucking Harry.</v>

2503
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:35.770
<v Speaker 1>And He shaves his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets stubble like an hour later and </v>

2504
01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:35.970
<v Speaker 1>it's all the way up to his cheeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you had it.</v>

2505
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.820
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to get it lasered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They boxed them.</v>

2506
01:54:38.821 --> 01:54:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he got paid for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get paid for that?</v>

2507
01:54:40.770 --> 01:54:43.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you might have just done it again on</v>
