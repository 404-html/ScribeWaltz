00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>you guys have been through such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating change in music too,</v>

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>because I mean obviously lars was a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure in the controversy surrounding</v>

4
00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>mp3s and that was during the napster</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

5
00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>That was the time where everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>

6
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something just happened,</v>

7
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think we realized it back</v>

8
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think lars in a lot of ways was one of</v>

9
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>the first people sounding the horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first people going,</v>

10
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this selling records,</v>

11
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>shit is gonna go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>do you understand what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just taking things and putting</v>

13
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>them online and this was a totally new</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that poor guy still,</v>

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taking bullets,</v>

16
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>he's taking hits for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still tell really where,</v>

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 2>oh everyone who's got a beef with any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other thing than uh,</v>

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>napster,</v>

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just gravitates towards that all the</v>

20
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That poor guy.</v>

21
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got beat up by that and we all stood</v>

22
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 2>behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

23
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 2>He was the spokesman for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

24
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he chose,</v>

25
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 2>he chose to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Management said,</v>

26
00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.000
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is coming,</v>

27
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 2>this is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be the ones that stand up for</v>

28
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he took that,</v>

29
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.030
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he grabbed the flag and said,</v>

30
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:27.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were lots of other musicians</v>

31
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:32.221
<v Speaker 2>and people that were on board as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't as vocal or taking the</v>

32
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>hits like he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something about,</v>

33
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like a doctor Dre,</v>

34
00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 2>he was on board with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for some reason in the rap world</v>

35
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

36
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.030
<v Speaker 2>it's all about money anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

37
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 2>for heavy metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some kind of stigma around,</v>

39
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

40
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an asshole if you're rich or if</v>

41
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Speaker 2>you've been successful or something.</v>

42
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like we got to pull you down into</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell with us.</v>

43
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

44
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 2>don't be getting good now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

45
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was that stigma.</v>

46
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 2>But there were other artists that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>show up at shows saying,</v>

47
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad you're doing what you're</v>

48
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:11.740
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

49
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:12.770
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 2>join us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

51
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

52
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 2>my career would be over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

53
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 2>you fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 2>it's so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

55
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:23.890
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in it?</v>

56
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then stand up like,</v>

57
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

58
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 2>it will fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something will happen.</v>

59
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:30.161
<v Speaker 2>My fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

60
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

61
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.390
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were concerned about their own</v>

62
00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 2>careers and not the big picture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>

63
00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And obviously these days you can see</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no copyright laws.</v>

64
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 2>There's no nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

65
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 2>you can rip this and that and whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do whatever you want with it.</v>

66
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 2>There's a beauty to that and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity comes out of it,</v>

67
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 2>but it gets watered down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets,</v>

68
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

69
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we acknowledge that.</v>

70
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's inspiration somewhere for</v>

71
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But blatantly taking that and using it</v>

72
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty frustrating to me.</v>

73
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're,</v>

74
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were at that point where we were,</v>

75
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.040
<v Speaker 2>we had a such a following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had such a strength in Metallica that</v>

76
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>we survived all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

77
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lot of bands that</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

78
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't sustain themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't feed their families because of</v>

80
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the frustrating part was no</v>

81
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 2>one really understood that music is our</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

82
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take that,</v>

83
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>if you take hours like the way we wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to present our music is part of the art.</v>

84
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an album,</v>

85
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:52.250
<v Speaker 1>meaning like one song leads to the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>song weaning,</v>

86
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.260
<v Speaker 2>well like releasing an album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how we'd like to release it.</v>

87
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.290
<v Speaker 2>We don't want it leaked over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want this happening.</v>

88
00:03:58.291 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>present a presentation is part of the</v>

90
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Speaker 2>yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you walk into an art studio,</v>

91
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.200
<v Speaker 2>the artist has been in there putting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

92
00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

93
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I want you to see this first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that,</v>

94
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and then you go here and you get Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that there's a passion behind</v>

95
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:18.240
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when someone just throws it out</v>

96
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:23.100
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it kind of loses a leaves as an</v>

97
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:24.840
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

98
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punched me in the face,</v>

99
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.020
<v Speaker 2>but we have survived and we feel good</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and we've adapted.</v>

100
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.210
<v Speaker 2>But the record companies certainly did</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

101
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took it</v>

102
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 1>a hard hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

103
00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:40.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the record deals,</v>

104
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>the deals that record companies make</v>
<v Speaker 1>with artists,</v>

105
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.190
<v Speaker 1>and you see like what a record company</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling.</v>

106
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only selling your work without</v>

107
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Speaker 1>your work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without your creativity,</v>

108
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:53.210
<v Speaker 1>without your creations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to sell.</v>

109
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.590
<v Speaker 1>That's all they sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you look at these insane</v>

110
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.700
<v Speaker 1>insanely one side and deals that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut with artists,</v>

111
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.100
<v Speaker 1>especially emerging artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be a little bit more</v>

112
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.530
<v Speaker 1>desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't realize the potential,</v>

113
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 1>especially the potential for income that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have in the future.</v>

114
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some of those,</v>

115
00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was that one that somebody said</v>

116
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:12.530
<v Speaker 1>that courtney love didn't really write</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

117
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:15.020
<v Speaker 1>that it was ghost written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno who the fuck wrote it,</v>

118
00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:17.030
<v Speaker 1>but Courtney love put it out saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wrote it.</v>

119
00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:22.031
<v Speaker 1>But it was a breakdown of how artists</v>
<v Speaker 1>make money from the creation of an art</v>

120
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.690
<v Speaker 1>creation of an album to having it sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>in record stores to where the money gets</v>

121
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.800
<v Speaker 1>extracted and how much is left for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual artists.</v>

122
00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:31.970
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking disturbing.</v>

123
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even,</v>

124
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah.</v>

125
00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:36.830
<v Speaker 2>A couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

126
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.550
<v Speaker 2>we got the rights to our catalog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

127
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 2>our music from kill 'em all up till now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We own it finally,</v>

128
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 2>which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell my kids,</v>

129
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 2>let's go celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got,</v>

131
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.390
<v Speaker 2>we got the master recordings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we own it finally.</v>

132
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 2>And they were just looking at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you talking?</v>

133
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>You wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it yours?</v>

134
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

135
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Well I had a little talk about how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was back then.</v>

136
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would somewhat sell a little bit of</v>

137
00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 2>your soul to get a bigger something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

138
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>it was basically the record company was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bank and a marketing tool to get you</v>

139
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>where you want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

140
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.201
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 2>it was a necessary thing at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's great to have our stuff back</v>

142
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 2>and be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 2>we own our own record press.</v>

144
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>How cool is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

145
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 2>In Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:35.021
<v Speaker 2>one of our management people found a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place that had some machines that were</v>

147
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 2>for sale and we bought one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we press our own vinyl man.</v>

148
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we could kind of do whatever we</v>

149
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What color vinyl today,</v>

150
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what crazy things you can do.</v>

151
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

152
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 2>you guys can kind of do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you want now,</v>

153
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much.</v>

154
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a record company do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

155
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

156
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a record company.</v>

157
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 2>We own our own in America or North</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

158
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the world's a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>tougher.</v>

159
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of countries out there,</v>

160
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 2>especially in Europe and there's no way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can deal with the distribution in</v>

161
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 2>each different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've cut really good deals with,</v>

162
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 2>with other record companies that have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision and a,</v>

163
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:23.861
<v Speaker 2>have a love for Metallica and understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is powerful stuff and people</v>

164
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 2>love it and we want to be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

165
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having your own record press is a</v>

166
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 2>pretty darn cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was really inspired by Jack White,</v>

167
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

168
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 2>white stripes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fame,</v>

170
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rec on tears.</v>

171
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 2>He's done a lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

172
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 2>he loves that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's pressing his own stuff.</v>

173
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 2>He's coming up with different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing vinyls and colors and hidden</v>

174
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 2>tracks and cool stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

175
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just another way to get creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

176
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 2>in your career is vinyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's selling more than anything now</v>

177
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to actual physical hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>copies of things,</v>

178
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the numbers and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably very all over the place,</v>

179
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.720
<v Speaker 2>but vinyl has never gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

180
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if it's coming back,</v>

181
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's more popular than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just something tactile</v>

182
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something great that people are</v>

183
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 2>finally understanding that you can look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at artwork,</v>

184
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

185
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ritualization of opening up the</v>

186
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 2>player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it out and blowing on it,</v>

187
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 2>clean and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it down,</v>

188
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.960
<v Speaker 2>setting the needle down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

189
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 2>that's something really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

190
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I came down to La a few months ago and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hung out with some high school buddies.</v>

191
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.351
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

192
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to some songs and he</v>

<v Speaker 2>And</v>

195

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

198
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.960
<v Speaker 2>And we were actually listening to music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting down and listening to it.</v>

199
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.210
<v Speaker 2>My kids got into vinyl,</v>

00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:36.110
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

238
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole presentation.</v>

239
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:40.400
<v Speaker 1>The album cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open it up,</v>

240
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:41.990
<v Speaker 1>the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artwork,</v>

241
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.590
<v Speaker 1>all that represents your vision of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are trying to put out.</v>

242
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the things that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of went away with digital.</v>

243
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden there were no album</v>
<v Speaker 1>covers or the CD,</v>

244
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.850
<v Speaker 1>he was that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you couldn't really,</v>

245
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:53.491
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tiny little piece of art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're downloading it,</v>

247
00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:58.460
<v Speaker 1>you're not even getting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

248
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you're just getting the music itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

249
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

250
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.743
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

251
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:02.763
<v Speaker 2>you would get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.070
<v Speaker 2>downloadable artwork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not really looking at the</v>

253
00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:09.430
<v Speaker 2>artwork while you're listening to it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mobile device.</v>

254
00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:10.264
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

255
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.171
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:15.730
<v Speaker 2>the event of sitting down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and disappearing into the music,</v>

257
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a real music listener,</v>

258
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:18.700
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

259
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.080
<v Speaker 2>while you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

260
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's keeping you from killing people on</v>

261
00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:25.390
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you go home and you sit and you</v>

262
00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:28.630
<v Speaker 2>just get lost in stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

263
00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:32.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those cheap frigging headphones,</v>

264
00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:33.760
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little ear buds,</v>

265
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.100
<v Speaker 2>my kids were listening to stuff on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

266
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you guys haven't experienced music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

267
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 2>good sound here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try these headphones on.</v>

268
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

269
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I hear stuff I didn't hear before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

270
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.280
<v Speaker 2>but just seeing my kids get excited</v>
<v Speaker 2>about going to a live concert,</v>

271
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they there and they absorb it in like</v>

272
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 2>every sense.</v>

273
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not just having your ears hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and that will never be,</v>

274
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the frigging goggles or some kind</v>

275
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 2>of a audio visual stuff will reproduce</v>
<v Speaker 2>live shows,</v>

276
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.140
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about being next</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a sweaty fucker at a Gig and you</v>

277
00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>them pushing you or uh,</v>

278
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing someone headbang wildly are</v>

279
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 2>getting thrown over the top of you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just so much smells,</v>

280
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just can't be recreated.</v>

281
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 2>So live music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My daughter,</v>

282
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that guy just pressed a</v>

283
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 2>button on his computer and he's singing</v>
<v Speaker 2>over his own music that's not</v>

284
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 2>performing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

285
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.970
<v Speaker 2>she discovered that on her own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

286
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 2>these guys are actually playing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments and they fucked up.</v>

287
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up a song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so cool.</v>

288
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw something that I wouldn't have,</v>

289
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool like that.</v>

290
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lip sinking thing,</v>

291
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you go to see a concert and</v>

292
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 2>you find out that people are lip</v>
<v Speaker 2>sanking,</v>

293
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.580
<v Speaker 2>that's so disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just what,</v>

294
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 2>what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

295
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 2>what is the point of this that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointing.</v>

296
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 2>What does live performance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Live performance is supposed to be your</v>

297
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.150
<v Speaker 2>experiences thing actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're watching this person expressed</v>

298
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're not,</v>

299
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 2>they're not pretending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to be pretending.</v>

300
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you pretending you're you your money</v>

301
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're not.</v>

302
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

303
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 2>that's pretending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not singing.</v>

304
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I've gone to see plenty of shows with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and you can tell it's like,</v>

305
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the Mike's way over here and</v>

306
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 2>they're still sing in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

307
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:43.150
<v Speaker 2>well they have to have the backing</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks cut.</v>

308
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dancing and they're out of</v>

309
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:45.671
<v Speaker 2>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

310
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 2>well fucking stop dancing and this song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

311
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.160
<v Speaker 2>are you a dancer or you're a musician or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a singer or whatever.</v>

312
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Can Cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start running hills?</v>

313
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.810
<v Speaker 2>It can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to Vail and run up the 14 are</v>

314
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 2>exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be done,</v>

315
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen shows where there's that</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and then he'll get real,</v>

316
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sit down on a couch,</v>

317
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 2>plug it in acoustic and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sing out of key and like really try</v>

318
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 2>and struggle with the song or sing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

319
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's natural.</v>

320
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 2>That feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would not gravitate towards that</v>

321
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 2>than listening to the album?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to listen to yell at my home.</v>

322
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's cool to just see an</v>

323
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 2>acoustic set sometimes from people you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

324
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 2>just like it's as minimal as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're breaking it down to the bare</v>

325
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 2>bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a guitar and two people singing or</v>

326
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.534
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

327
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is pretty intimidating.</v>

328
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we do like that Neil young benefit</v>

329
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:39.881

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330

<v Speaker 2>and every fuck up on the vocal,</v>

334
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

335
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when,</v>

336
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:55.011

<v Speaker 2>thing and they put makeup on you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sometimes</v>

355
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you got to do it or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a band like I am and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>three guys get the stuff put on and then</v>

357
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:33.194
<v Speaker 2>I show up,</v>

358
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.920
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

359
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you're a shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

360
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like people gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bye.</v>

361
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this band I do sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

362
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.860
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

363
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.190
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to the napster thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what happened with Lars,</v>

364
00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's two different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

365
00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:53.230
<v Speaker 1>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's what's really happening and this</v>

366
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 1>is how people look at it and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really happening was like all of a</v>

367
00:15:57.141 --> 00:16:00.130
<v Speaker 1>sudden this door got opened up or this</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pandora's box got open.</v>

368
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys were looking at it going,</v>

369
00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

370
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.170
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lose our record sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

371
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.560
<v Speaker 1>do you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people have been consuming music in</v>

372
00:16:08.561 --> 00:16:11.140
<v Speaker 1>a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been paying for music and that</v>

373
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.310
<v Speaker 1>paying for music is supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these people that are a part of this</v>

374
00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:19.030
<v Speaker 1>industry that makes albums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this gigantic thing behind it.</v>

375
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.450
<v Speaker 1>This is all going to go away because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put a hole in the bottom of it and</v>

376
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:23.980
<v Speaker 1>all the money's going to get dropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

377
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:29.500
<v Speaker 1>But then the way it looks is Luca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this rich motherfucker,</v>

378
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:30.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>

379
00:16:30.341 --> 00:16:32.170
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't appreciate his fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

380
00:16:32.171 --> 00:16:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford your album right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay if I just download it for</v>

381
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:38.380
<v Speaker 1>free?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people thought,</v>

382
00:16:38.381 --> 00:16:39.214
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

383
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.170
<v Speaker 1>people who can afford it will still be</v>
<v Speaker 1>downloading it and then they'll buy it</v>

384
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:46.930
<v Speaker 1>when they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't really the case was it?</v>

385
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

386
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.273
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for convenience in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology moving forward.</v>

388
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Getting music out to people is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>important part,</v>

389
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:03.470
<v Speaker 2>but just make sure the artist gets what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they deserve from it because without</v>

390
00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:06.900
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to become a hobby.</v>

391
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.250
<v Speaker 2>No one wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see the paramedics show</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at my house and it's like a hobby for</v>

393
00:17:13.261 --> 00:17:14.094
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

394
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really getting paid for what I</v>

395
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.200
<v Speaker 2>think I should get paid for my creation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I'll save your life.</v>

396
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

397
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people didn't relate that to their,</v>

398
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.870
<v Speaker 2>their career or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

399
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.903
<v Speaker 2>equivalent.</v>

400
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because the money wasn't</v>

401
00:17:33.551 --> 00:17:34.900
<v Speaker 1>equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked at you guys like,</v>

402
00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:36.820
<v Speaker 1>you guys are already so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you give a shit?</v>

403
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.870
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're going to be broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys made millions and millions and</v>

404
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:41.860
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars a tour all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

405
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And it became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the touring thing was way artists made</v>

406
00:17:45.671 --> 00:17:46.504
<v Speaker 1>money then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

407
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Touring and merchandise and that's now</v>
<v Speaker 2>record companies are stressed.</v>

408
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Structuring their deals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

409
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:53.240
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a piece of it.</v>

410
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Merch and touring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's bizarre though.</v>

411
00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.370
<v Speaker 1>The record companies getting a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your touring to me is very strange and</v>

412
00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I've seen not just a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an exorbitant amount and that</v>

413
00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.520
<v Speaker 1>disturbs me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the only way they can</v>

414
00:18:06.521 --> 00:18:07.190
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

415
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.120
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be around them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you become a parasite because you</v>

416
00:18:10.121 --> 00:18:11.680
<v Speaker 1>don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

417
00:18:11.681 --> 00:18:16.090
<v Speaker 1>especially now where bands can literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>become gigantic because at Youtube we</v>

418
00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:18.250
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin bieber become huge just entirely</v>

419
00:18:18.251 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 1>because of youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie knows,</v>

420
00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.490
<v Speaker 1>look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking Justin Bieber fan.</v>

421
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.530
<v Speaker 1>He hides it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

422
00:18:23.531 --> 00:18:26.830
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First I heard him saying,</v>

423
00:18:26.831 --> 00:18:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know it was a,</v>

424
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:29.703
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

425
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you the,</v>

426
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.200
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

427
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>

428
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.750
<v Speaker 2>would you go up to the artist and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>that out of his pocket?</v>

429
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you go into a record store and</v>

430
00:18:40.761 --> 00:18:44.480
<v Speaker 2>just lift that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steal it right out the door with it,</v>

431
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you do that with?</v>

432
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.321
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

433
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.760
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.980
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's big corporations that are rich</v>

435
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.830
<v Speaker 2>and would you go walk in and just steal</v>
<v Speaker 2>their stuff?</v>

436
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's software companies that are</v>

437
00:18:56.721 --> 00:18:58.970
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you go in there and just rip their</v>

438
00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:02.360
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that mentality.</v>

439
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't call me old school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need to earn what you get and if</v>

440
00:19:08.631 --> 00:19:10.630
<v Speaker 2>it gets stolen from you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

441
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.620
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to fathom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it seems like to me,</v>

442
00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:17.450
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be talking about my ass,</v>

443
00:19:17.451 --> 00:19:22.451
<v Speaker 2>but the record companies dropped the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball and the new record companies became</v>

444
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.120
<v Speaker 2>itunes control at all.</v>

445
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Here's how much we're charging for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>music and here's how much you're going</v>

446
00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:31.400
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's even,</v>

447
00:19:31.401 --> 00:19:33.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like some communist approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.170
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

449
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're an artist and we make a lot of</v>

450
00:19:38.871 --> 00:19:40.130
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's up to us.</v>

451
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.510
<v Speaker 2>If we give all our money away to charity</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we throw it back into a movie,</v>

452
00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:46.430
<v Speaker 2>that bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happened,</v>

453
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our choice.</v>

454
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.860
<v Speaker 2>We're the fucking artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get to do what we want.</v>

455
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.790
<v Speaker 2>It's our party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're invited and we can destroy this</v>

456
00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:58.280
<v Speaker 2>thing if we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to destroy it.</v>

457
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The itunes distribution models a very</v>

458
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 1>bizarre one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange how they've,</v>

459
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.600
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows what they're doing.</v>

460
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.870
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a system that worked and I'm</v>

461
00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:11.120
<v Speaker 2>up for bucking the system and making it</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

462
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.340
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't get better.</v>

463
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

464
00:20:14.871 --> 00:20:16.970
<v Speaker 2>the cat got out of the bag and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it back in,</v>

465
00:20:16.971 --> 00:20:17.870
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't.</v>

466
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do?</v>

467
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got spotify or you got something</v>

468
00:20:22.401 --> 00:20:25.370
<v Speaker 2>else where streaming's going to help get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artists their money.</v>

469
00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:27.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

470
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

471
00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:32.210
<v Speaker 2>companies like that are losing money a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

472
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

473
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact workings and I'm</v>

474
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:41.270
<v Speaker 2>not going to speak for them at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hasn't been figured out yet,</v>

475
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Speaker 2>is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't been figured out how to make a</v>

476
00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:47.210
<v Speaker 2>music model work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no one way,</v>

477
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 2>maybe there will never be one way again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's fine,</v>

478
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's still unbalanced.</v>

479
00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
