<v Speaker 3>Last time I saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I introduced you to the wonderful world </v>

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 3>of head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indeed,</v>

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Dr Rhonda got her first experience of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>live UFC event and just to preface it,</v>

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you really didn't know much about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC at all before you went to this thing</v>

9
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 3>with your husband and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

10
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll put you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were pretty shocked.</v>

11
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to be honest,</v>

12
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:49.011
<v Speaker 1>I had no clue until the morning of or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day before and that was like the </v>

13
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:55.551
<v Speaker 1>morning of the day before it's blank </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I looked it up and it was like I </v>

14
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>saw people were like in a cage fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 1>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was,</v>

16
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

17
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know even know what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting.</v>

18
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It was just some kind of wrestling thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

19
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was confusing it with the w.</v>

20
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>w e e is that what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrestling the ww something wrestling.</v>

21
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So Ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just these little three letter </v>

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>acronyms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acronyms.</v>

23
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So you had really never been exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of mixed martial arts.</v>

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Mixed martial arts.</v>

25
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>aware of things like taekwondo and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

27
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>but I just know that they exist and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of cool.</v>

28
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about it.</v>

29
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Had you ever been to a boxing match </v>
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>

30
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never been to a boxing match and </v>

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I've really never really watched when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen probably clips or pieces of </v>

32
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like throughout my life at some point,</v>

33
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:53.811
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just no exposure in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a sports gene in my body </v>

34
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>while I love to like work out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise and you know,</v>

35
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:06.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm very addicted to the brain benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other benefits I have never really </v>

36
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>like watched sports or been interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it like in general.</v>

37
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>And I try really hard because my dad is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge sports fan.</v>

38
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays baseball.</v>

39
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's 65 and he still plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball on like a men's league.</v>

40
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So anyone watches football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

41
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>any sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any like manly sport,</v>

42
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

43
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>he watches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows everything about.</v>

44
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And he's not a big science guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I try really hard to bond with him </v>

45
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>when I'm with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like trying really hard to be </v>

46
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>interested or like he'll take me to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>padres game,</v>

47
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in San Diego and I'm like,</v>

48
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I try to like understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's happening.</v>

50
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>But it takes a little work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole,</v>

52
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>that mma experience was very unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been to a baseball game.</v>

53
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I've been to a football game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball game.</v>

54
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>So those are the sports that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually spectated live at some point in</v>

55
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:03.801
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the MMA was a very different </v>

56
00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:03.801
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt very like there was kind of a </v>

58
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.311
<v Speaker 1>tribal component to it where you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>people cheering when the fighters are </v>

59
00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>coming down the aisle and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the music,</v>

60
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>like drums and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going,</v>

61
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I something beating and then this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole people fighting in a cage made</v>

62
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>me feel like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.780
<v Speaker 1>times back in the Roman colosseum where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd go and watch people fight.</v>

64
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of that in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a lot of tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tribal element of the music.</v>

66
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different people from different cultures</v>

67
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:42.091
<v Speaker 1>have different music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the country music guys or </v>

68
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>country guys will come out to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>country songs and guys who were like a </v>

69
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>more urban will come out to the rap </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs.</v>

70
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of white guys come up with a rap </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs too,</v>

71
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>some guys would come out to like classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock and everyone's like,</v>

73
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that song.</v>

74
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to root for this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely an element of that in</v>

76
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music was cool and that,</v>

77
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that I think that also gave that tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling,</v>

78
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 1>but then the cheering and how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

79
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:12.301
<v Speaker 1>I had it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something moving inside of me </v>

80
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:12.301
<v Speaker 1>that I was not expecting.</v>

81
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And then so it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that regard where it was like,</v>

82
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feels like some unique experience </v>

83
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't get at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>they haven't ever experienced any sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of other sport event that I've attended.</v>

85
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>So when you said something was moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of you,</v>

86
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you mean like you were emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved,</v>

87
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>like you got excited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart raced.</v>

88
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It was part of the community that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

89
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

90
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>this is some kind of community that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to experience for a day.</v>

91
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

92
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it was some sort of unique event where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like I was just,</v>

93
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting with these people that are </v>

94
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very addictive community too.</v>

95
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of fun.</v>

96
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of fun.</v>

97
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Aside from the me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>looking at the effects on the brain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff a lot of these fighters are </v>

99
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>experiencing.</v>

100
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Aside from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

101
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

102
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing.</v>

103
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:11.851
<v Speaker 1>We all went out afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A giant group of US afterwards went out </v>

104
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:12.810
<v Speaker 1>to eat and you just were wide eyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had like,</v>

105
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 1>like saucer eyes and you were like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of damage that you just couldn't.</v>

106
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stop calculating the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of damage that was going on to these </v>

107
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.590
<v Speaker 1>people's brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irreversible damage.</v>

108
00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:29.591
<v Speaker 1>Like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that and coupled with our </v>

109
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>conversation the night before where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>denny was talking about friends that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were fighters that,</v>

111
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having memory problems and immediately </v>

112
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>when he started describing some of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics,</v>

113
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds just like an Alzheimer's </v>

114
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>patient and just because I wasn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of any of the MMA,</v>

115
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

116
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 1>what it involves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of,</v>

117
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's a lot of,</v>

118
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of rules.</v>

119
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

120
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>you can punch someone in the head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kick,</v>

121
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>you can choke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

122
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing,</v>

123
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it seems like there was a lot of </v>

124
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>other stuff going on that was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic.</v>

125
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.460
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to you describe it because </v>

126
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so educated in science and the </v>

127
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>human body and the effects of vitamins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and various nutrients in the human body.</v>

128
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 1>So to see you get your first exposure to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's like a normal part of my life.</v>

129
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like a daily part of my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially is being exposed to this </v>

130
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.280
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

131
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating to watch you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

132
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can kick in boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so removed now.</v>

133
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:45.631
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're an alien from another </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and landed in the world of MMA </v>

134
00:06:45.631 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

135
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

136
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>that is kind of how I felt.</v>

137
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm right.</v>

138
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

139
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

140
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a thing called kickboxing A.</v>

141
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a company called glory and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold these events on Spike TV,</v>

142
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a American cable channel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to kick that kick and </v>

143
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.180
<v Speaker 1>they can need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't elbow though.</v>

144
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a modified version of what's </v>

145
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible] Thai and Moitai is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thai boxing and in Thailand,</v>

146
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the experts in this very </v>

147
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>particular type of kickboxing where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a lot of clenching.</v>

148
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.170
<v Speaker 1>They grab a hold of each other and need </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other in the body and the head and </v>

149
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 1>the elbow from the clench and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw a lot of leg kicks.</v>

150
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>They're known for their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kicking ability.</v>

151
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I've seen Muy Thai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on twitter and like,</v>

152
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting at me and stuff.</v>

153
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>But I really didn't know exactly what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was and monetize pretty wild.</v>

154
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even realize people used </v>

155
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.261
<v Speaker 1>kickbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought kickboxing was like a way to </v>

156
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:47.261
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't realize there was actually</v>

157
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>people fighting seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I really,</v>

158
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>really thought that it was just a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out until just now,</v>

159
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so crazy.</v>

160
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm in another world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of.</v>

161
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I was telling my husband the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

162
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on weekends,</v>

163
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:07.091
<v Speaker 1>they go out and they think they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>camping and they hike and they go and </v>

164
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>they go to the woods and a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>see all these new things in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love to do by the way.</v>

166
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:17.021
<v Speaker 1>But every day what I did was I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking and foraging through the human </v>

167
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:21.791
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like everyday I'm doing this </v>

168
00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 1>constantly and I do get a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

169
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

170
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of sheltered from a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things because I'm just like,</v>

171
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's reading about science and health </v>

172
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.711
<v Speaker 1>and mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at times I am with other things </v>

173
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.861
<v Speaker 1>that are so common knowledge to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll kind of like blow people's minds </v>

174
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>around like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

175
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Like what other things are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely cultural norms that you're </v>

176
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.370
<v Speaker 1>completely unaware of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot of sports things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely at television stuff.</v>

178
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>just any of that television world</v>

180
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.280
<v Speaker 4>and people always relate to commercials </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like I nothing,</v>

181
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 4>it's like yours without a TV's</v>

182
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 3>CV and I still don't relate to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone just explained to me that the </v>

183
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.841
<v Speaker 3>show bones on Fox has been on for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>six years or something like that was on </v>

184
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:17.440
<v Speaker 3>the other day in a hospital waiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

185
00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I was watching it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this show is,</v>

186
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.990
<v Speaker 3>how long it's been on and like spend on </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

187
00:09:22.991 --> 00:09:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

188
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's so many shows.</v>

189
00:09:26.321 --> 00:09:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pass by US weekly.</v>

190
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.530
<v Speaker 3>And with someone on the cover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

191
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.960
<v Speaker 3>she's leaving him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She started like,</v>

192
00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:33.760
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is she?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's he?</v>

193
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Who apparently they're huge celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea who they are.</v>

194
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

195
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.950
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm,</v>

196
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm in that sort of a mindset mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

197
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

198
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.260
<v Speaker 4>back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the UFC event,</v>

199
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

200
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:51.850
<v Speaker 4>So the watching the event was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>exciting,</v>

201
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:54.880
<v Speaker 4>but I'm starting to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

202
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.930
<v Speaker 4>these blows that people were taken to </v>
<v Speaker 4>their head and the choking,</v>

203
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 4>there seems to be a lot of choking going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and you know,</v>

204
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 4>some of those sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just from what little I knew at </v>

205
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.390
<v Speaker 4>the time it was already like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

206
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.920
<v Speaker 4>this seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

207
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.790
<v Speaker 4>some stuff's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically smoking</v>

208
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.000
<v Speaker 3>though is not as dangerous as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

209
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.720
<v Speaker 3>the issue with choking is annie </v>
<v Speaker 3>grappling.</v>

210
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.080
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna develop microtrauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have disc issues.</v>

211
00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:28.510
<v Speaker 3>As you get older you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the just a lot,</v>

212
00:10:28.511 --> 00:10:30.410
<v Speaker 3>a lot going on with the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.270
<v Speaker 3>and so there's some trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part the choking is not</v>

214
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 3>too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one repeated issue that's been </v>

215
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.600
<v Speaker 3>happening a lot lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never happened in the UFC,</v>

216
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's been happening in smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations and it's a very particular</v>

217
00:10:45.401 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Speaker 3>move where someone will go for a take </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

218
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.030
<v Speaker 3>which is to the guy there standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try to take the guy down and then </v>

219
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.731
<v Speaker 3>the person who they're trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>down gets the guy in what's called a </v>

220
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:03.400
<v Speaker 3>guillotine choke and a good team choke </v>
<v Speaker 3>is your head is trapped under the armpit</v>

221
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.580
<v Speaker 3>and you have your forum or anything neck</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're pulling up on the neck and </v>

222
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.971
<v Speaker 3>then the person who's caught in the good</v>
<v Speaker 3>team tries to take the person down by </v>

223
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.830
<v Speaker 3>like picking them up and trying to throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they land on the guys head and </v>

224
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.820
<v Speaker 3>that people are becoming paralyzed from </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

225
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.710
<v Speaker 3>It's happened several times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened in training a couple of </v>

226
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.420
<v Speaker 3>times and tapping a couple times in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>

227
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's enough of an issue where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to scare the shit out of me.</v>

228
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.990
<v Speaker 3>You know that guys who get caught and </v>
<v Speaker 3>good teams try to slam their way out of </v>

229
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.551
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to pick a guy up and slammed </v>

230
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:39.520
<v Speaker 3>their way out of it instead of trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be technical and grab a hold of the hand</v>

231
00:11:39.521 --> 00:11:44.521
<v Speaker 3>and try to work your way out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just [inaudible] that choke is so </v>

232
00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:47.840
<v Speaker 3>sudden when you get caught in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a nasty joke that the,</v>

233
00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:52.841
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like one or two seconds where </v>

234
00:11:52.841 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 3>you had with a guy who's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have to breathe,</v>

235
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 4>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you're,</v>

236
00:11:56.231 --> 00:12:01.231
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pretty much going to go </v>

237
00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:01.231
<v Speaker 4>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's one thing I was wondering with</v>

238
00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:02.640
<v Speaker 4>the choking specifically was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

239
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 4>because choking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

240
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.770
<v Speaker 4>you can to some degree cause some </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypoxia in the brain so you know,</v>

241
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.140
<v Speaker 4>you're not causing ischemic damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like no oxygen getting into the</v>

242
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:19.141
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you may have reduced oxygen in the </v>

243
00:12:19.141 --> 00:12:22.141
<v Speaker 4>body compensates for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know the body will because it </v>

244
00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 4>senses that less oxygen is getting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

245
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 4>It increases blood flow as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>compensation.</v>

246
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 4>But if that can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it can't compensate what happens,</v>

247
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll start to,</v>

248
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:34.711
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually like your motor control will </v>

249
00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:37.231
<v Speaker 4>get affected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was wondering if they use that as </v>

250
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:39.391
<v Speaker 4>a technique like because then that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're choking their opponent,</v>

251
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:42.740
<v Speaker 4>now their opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motor control gets effected.</v>

252
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 4>No goals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just put the guy of sleep,</v>

253
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 4>which is even worse because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next step,</v>

254
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 4>which then you become the top.</v>

255
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

256
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 4>and there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hypoxic damage,</v>

257
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is damage occurring,</v>

258
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.690
<v Speaker 4>what kind of damage has occurred and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the going gets choked out,</v>

259
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 4>completely asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely asleep.</v>

260
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 4>So you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

261
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 4>not enough oxygen getting the brain for </v>
<v Speaker 4>just a couple of seconds,</v>

262
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.300
<v Speaker 4>a few seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of the thing that can happen is </v>

263
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 4>that you can have a lactate buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

264
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

265
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.150
<v Speaker 4>so your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have a neurons and you have </v>

266
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 4>supporting cells in your brain called </v>
<v Speaker 4>astrocytes and glial cells.</v>

267
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 4>But astrocytes are a specific type of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Glial cells are really important.</v>

268
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:32.941
<v Speaker 4>They do a lot of things for the brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they make up like 50 percent of the </v>

269
00:13:32.941 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 4>human brain volume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually,</v>

270
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they use glucose and they use glucose in</v>

271
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 4>a way where they don't need their </v>
<v Speaker 4>mitochondria.</v>

272
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:45.421
<v Speaker 4>So they use glucose through something </v>
<v Speaker 4>called glycolysis and the byproduct is </v>

273
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 4>they make lactate.</v>

274
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.900
<v Speaker 4>And the reason they do this is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lactate then goes into the neuron </v>

275
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 4>and it goes right into the Mitochondria </v>
<v Speaker 4>and is used to produce energy,</v>

276
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't needs to be coupled to </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen.</v>

277
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:01.810
<v Speaker 4>So lactate is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

278
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 4>a really great source of energy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurons because it's,</v>

279
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 4>it's not for the Neuron to convert </v>
<v Speaker 4>glucose into Piru,</v>

280
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which then gets used as energy costs </v>

281
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.390
<v Speaker 4>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for lactate to get converted into </v>

282
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 4>Piru Bait to then be used as energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's thermodynamic dynamically favorable</v>

283
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 4>because it doesn't cost any energy to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

284
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.070
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

285
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.460
<v Speaker 4>but this requires oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is this oxidative phosphorylation </v>

286
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.930
<v Speaker 4>mechanism that I've talked about before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

287
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
<v Speaker 4>but when you don't have oxygen there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the lactate can't be used by the </v>

288
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 4>neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

289
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Speaker 4>so lactate will then build up and can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause,</v>

290
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can cause cell death when you have </v>

291
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:45.430
<v Speaker 4>too much lactic acidosis building up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their brain.</v>

292
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 4>Now that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

293
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:52.051
<v Speaker 4>with the amount of choking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's much of an issue </v>

294
00:14:52.051 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 4>because this is more for like a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like real trauma,</v>

295
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 4>like intense trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more like a head trauma blow to the head</v>

296
00:14:58.431 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 4>or um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

297
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:04.691
<v Speaker 4>even like the rapid acceleration and </v>
<v Speaker 4>deceleration that occurs like car </v>

298
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 4>accidents mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

299
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

300
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 4>the blows to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

301
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 4>people's heads are moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as,</v>

302
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a car hitting you where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like really,</v>

303
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 4>really rapid acceleration deceleration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem.</v>

304
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think,</v>

305
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once I started to dive into this,</v>

306
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 4>I start to read about traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>injury.</v>

307
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and specifically I became interested in </v>

308
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.361
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it because of the Alzheimer's </v>

309
00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:31.361
<v Speaker 4>connection and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

310
00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:35.081
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are these young people coming down </v>

311
00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:35.081
<v Speaker 4>with symptoms of Alzheimer's?</v>

312
00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Like in like early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early age like that,</v>

313
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.560
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>

314
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 4>some connection between the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal brain ages and something that's </v>

315
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 4>happening with traumatic brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I became really interested in,</v>

316
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:46.590
<v Speaker 4>started reading about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

317
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.640
<v Speaker 4>since I went to that a UFC event and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>really a fascinating,</v>

318
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been reading a lot about it and you</v>

319
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:56.860
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

320
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 4>these fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>

321
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.390
<v Speaker 4>nfl players,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

322
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.150
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boxer boxing,</v>

323
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 4>anyone that's taking blows to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

324
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 4>whatever sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

325
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 4>that that's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

326
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 4>in some regard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think even rugby,</v>

327
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.570
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

328
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

329
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:17.470
<v Speaker 4>these people have a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>increased incident of Alzheimer's in </v>

330
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.470
<v Speaker 4>some cases just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

331
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 4>two to three fold increased case if </v>
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's.</v>

332
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

333
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.370
<v Speaker 4>and it's an earlier onset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

334
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.390
<v Speaker 4>and it's very like indistinguishable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable in terms of like some </v>

335
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 4>of the pathology that occurs in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain compared to like someone who's,</v>

336
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>75,</v>

337
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 4>80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>85 years old and getting Alzheimer's.</v>

338
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.120
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

339
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 4>I started reading about this like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

340
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what happens is like even just a </v>

341
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 4>single blow to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

342
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 4>can cause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

343
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:51.701
<v Speaker 4>it can increase the risk for Alzheimer's</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you're having multiple </v>

344
00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:51.701
<v Speaker 4>repetitive injuries that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

345
00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:53.410
<v Speaker 4>increases the risk even more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

346
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.380
<v Speaker 4>and so initially like there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>changes that happened,</v>

347
00:16:57.381 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 4>but when you have a blow to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

348
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 4>you've got the acute damage that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

349
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

350
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tissue damage you can get,</v>

351
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 4>like diffuse axonal injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

352
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 4>And that's from like a real trauma to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the head.</v>

353
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.420
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even just like re mild repetitive trauma</v>

354
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:18.421
<v Speaker 4>is what happens is you get tissue damage</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you release a lot of reactive oxygen</v>

355
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 4>species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I've talked about before which are</v>

356
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 4>released every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

357
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:28.331
<v Speaker 4>We're releasing that in our brains and </v>
<v Speaker 4>our other cells through just normal </v>

358
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 4>metabolism.</v>

359
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like a byproduct of normal </v>

360
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.681
<v Speaker 4>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people that are not getting brain </v>

361
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:35.681
<v Speaker 4>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening in a little bit each day.</v>

362
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 4>But with a brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

363
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 4>when you're getting a blow to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it induces a massive,</v>

364
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 4>massive amount of release of it and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to damage the manichees.</v>

365
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 4>So which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

366
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>form of protective membrane,</v>

367
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.470
<v Speaker 4>the brain and those cells start to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A reactive oxygen species as a </v>

368
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 4>protective mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It causes cells to die.</v>

369
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:03.471
<v Speaker 4>And the reason it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about reactive oxygen </v>

370
00:18:03.471 --> 00:18:05.931
<v Speaker 4>species before in the context of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get a little bit of reactive </v>

371
00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:08.530
<v Speaker 4>oxygen species such as like normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolism you can do,</v>

372
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 4>you can cause damage to DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you damage the DNA,</v>

373
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 4>you can either repair that damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't,</v>

374
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 4>you can get a mutation eventually that </v>
<v Speaker 4>builds up and leads to cancer.</v>

375
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 4>But if you have a huge burst of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the case where you're getting an</v>

376
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:25.671
<v Speaker 4>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're talking about a protective </v>

377
00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:25.671
<v Speaker 4>mechanism that kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

378
00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:30.140
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to kill the cell and the </v>

379
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 4>reasoning to kill cells because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to get all that damage that's going</v>

380
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 4>to cause me cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>

381
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 4>So it's a protective mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's killing cells to protect itself.</v>

382
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

383
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.900
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

384
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.930
<v Speaker 4>biological mechanism as to why this huge</v>
<v Speaker 4>burst of reactive oxygen species does </v>

385
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 4>kill cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

386
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:51.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a conserved and evolutionary </v>

387
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.230
<v Speaker 4>conserved mechanism and it really is </v>
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>

388
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 4>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you stand,</v>

389
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:54.080
<v Speaker 4>that's why part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

390
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.120
<v Speaker 4>underlying mechanism for radiation in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like treating cancer radiation </v>

391
00:18:59.161 --> 00:18:59.800
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

392
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

393
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 4>you're causing double stranded breaks in</v>
<v Speaker 4>DNA.</v>

394
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 4>It's just like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

395
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.930
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're damaging the DNA and it's a huge </v>

396
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:08.930
<v Speaker 4>amount of damage.</v>

397
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.570
<v Speaker 4>So it causes cells to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

398
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.860
<v Speaker 4>so this is happening in the brain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really not a good thing because in </v>

399
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:16.990
<v Speaker 4>the sense for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

400
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 4>on the acute injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got these energy cells that start</v>

401
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 4>to die and then astrocytes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which like,</v>

402
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:28.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are part of them like help form </v>

403
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.711
<v Speaker 4>some of the blood brain barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They start to die and when those </v>

404
00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 4>astrocytes start dying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that form the blood brain barrier,</v>

405
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 4>what happens is the blood brain barrier </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets leaky.</v>

406
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.740
<v Speaker 4>And now you have things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

407
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>potassium chloride,</v>

408
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 4>sodium leaking into the brain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>causing astrocytes to swell,</v>

409
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:46.050
<v Speaker 4>causing water to flow in and you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

410
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:49.760
<v Speaker 4>a Dema and the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I looked at this guy mark comic,</v>

411
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I think if you could go and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a picture of his swollen Dema like </v>

412
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 4>head and it's just like unbelievable.</v>

413
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 4>So that's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cause of this edema.</v>

414
00:20:00.091 --> 00:20:03.420
<v Speaker 4>So you've now what happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>reactive oxygen species,</v>

415
00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:06.060
<v Speaker 4>those dead cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blood brain barrier gets compromised</v>

416
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:11.300
<v Speaker 4>immediately when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these immune system and the brain gets </v>

417
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.781
<v Speaker 4>activated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have another part of glial cells </v>

418
00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:18.111
<v Speaker 4>called Microglia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are like the immune cells in the </v>

419
00:20:18.111 --> 00:20:20.451
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get activated when the blood brain </v>

420
00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:22.380
<v Speaker 4>barrier gets damaged and they migrate up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're trying to plug up the hole.</v>

421
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.980
<v Speaker 4>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

422
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blood brain barrier has been </v>

423
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 4>compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they might get up and start trying to</v>

424
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 4>plug up the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is now you've activated,</v>

425
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.080
<v Speaker 4>activated this whole immune response </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it starts to.</v>

426
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

427
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 4>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

428
00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:45.771
<v Speaker 4>that's just so awful when you see a lump</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that fight should be stopped </v>

429
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

430
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say was,</v>

431
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:55.111
<v Speaker 1>did he keep fighting after that fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another round and one won the final </v>

432
00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:59.470
<v Speaker 1>round with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a big injury like that.</v>

433
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.930
<v Speaker 1>That's just unbelievable honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

434
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:07.330
<v Speaker 1>so in your opinion as a medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional,</v>

435
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>when you see that kind of swelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

436
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.870
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a guy who should be hitting </v>

437
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the head again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

438
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I would say definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of consequences that can </v>

439
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.301
<v Speaker 1>occur when you're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you already have this type of </v>

440
00:21:24.301 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 1>damage where your immune system has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>activated.</v>

441
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting.</v>

442
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's not just A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

443
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 1>but that's not just a wound that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeding under the skin.</v>

444
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

445
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 1>But in addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

446
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you've got all sorts of cellular changes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are occurring.</v>

447
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 1>You're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

448
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:43.960
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage to the damage.</v>

449
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.960
<v Speaker 1>These astrocytes that are forming the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood brain barrier and then you start </v>

450
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:54.871
<v Speaker 1>getting those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start dying and when they start </v>

451
00:21:54.871 --> 00:21:54.871
<v Speaker 1>dying at dead cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:21:54.871 --> 00:21:56.690
<v Speaker 1>in addition to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Microglia,</v>

453
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.620
<v Speaker 1>the immune system in the brain getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>activated to try to plug up the damage.</v>

454
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you have cells dying,</v>

455
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 1>which in a case like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're.</v>

456
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 1>We've got massive damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening on a huge scale.</v>

457
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.810
<v Speaker 1>These microglia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to like eat up and get rid of </v>

458
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.810
<v Speaker 1>all the cellular debris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of what they do their</v>

459
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 1>program to do these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get activated when you have a bunch</v>

460
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 1>of dead cells and they try to go eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>away this damage.</v>

461
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when that starts to happen,</v>

462
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a starting a cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroinflammation in the brain,</v>

463
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 1>which is very bad.</v>

464
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens even within like hours of </v>

465
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.530
<v Speaker 1>an injury like that is you start to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulation of something called amyloid</v>

466
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Beta plaques in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

467
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's,</v>

468
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot in common in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

469
00:22:47.861 --> 00:22:52.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury is a massive </v>

470
00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:55.231
<v Speaker 1>amount of damage and it's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one instance or even just mild </v>

471
00:22:55.231 --> 00:23:00.030
<v Speaker 1>repetitive injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not get someone that has a </v>

472
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.030
<v Speaker 1>swollen head like mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

473
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.720
<v Speaker 1>just taking repetitive blows to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

474
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're causing your activating,</v>

475
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive oxygen species are causing </v>

476
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 1>cells to die and you are activating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system even with a mild injury.</v>

477
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

478
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to start activating this </v>

479
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.271
<v Speaker 1>immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this also causes the accumulation </v>

480
00:23:21.271 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 1>of these amyloid Beta plaques accumulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the brain.</v>

481
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.810
<v Speaker 1>So amyloid Beta plaques is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>major pathologies associated with </v>

482
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is as we age,</v>

483
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.800
<v Speaker 1>we have a little bit of inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in our brain.</v>

484
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Know we have cells dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

485
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

486
00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 1>this is a little bit by bit scale every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

487
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.670
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight decades go by,</v>

489
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've accumulated enough damage,</v>

490
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 4>stuff starts getting messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So amyloid Beta plaques,</v>

491
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:54.911
<v Speaker 4>they form outside of neurons in between </v>
<v Speaker 4>glial cells and neurons and what they </v>

492
00:23:54.911 --> 00:23:59.411
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can even Google amyloid Beta </v>

493
00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:02.831
<v Speaker 4>plaques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see they form these little </v>

494
00:24:02.831 --> 00:24:04.631
<v Speaker 4>plaques outside of the neurons and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>disrupts like glucose metabolism and </v>

495
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:10.611
<v Speaker 4>neurons and astrocytes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It causes even more reactive oxygen </v>

496
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:13.811
<v Speaker 4>species to be generated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you're generating even more and </v>

497
00:24:13.811 --> 00:24:15.560
<v Speaker 4>more on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the microglia cells,</v>

498
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:20.561
<v Speaker 4>the immune cells of the brain get </v>
<v Speaker 4>activated when there's a plaque just </v>

499
00:24:20.561 --> 00:24:20.561
<v Speaker 4>like they do when there's a dead cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

500
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

501
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I need to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they get activated.</v>

502
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 4>They secrete proinflammatory cytokines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing all this firing,</v>

503
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:33.041
<v Speaker 4>firing and the trying to eat the plaques</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you know that it causes this </v>

504
00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:37.901
<v Speaker 4>vicious cycle of neuroinflammation where</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that causes more plugs to be </v>

505
00:24:37.901 --> 00:24:37.901
<v Speaker 4>formed.</v>

506
00:24:37.901 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 4>So you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible,</v>

507
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:44.081
<v Speaker 4>terrible cycle of neuroinflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This amyloid Beta plaques form in in </v>

508
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.870
<v Speaker 4>fighters and also in like NFL player </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they've looked at these plaques </v>

509
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:54.551
<v Speaker 4>that are in the brains and they've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've even shown by like pet scans </v>

510
00:24:54.551 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 4>that they form immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like within hours,</v>

511
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 4>and this even happens in children that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have undergone trauma,</v>

512
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's something,</v>

513
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like the traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>injury is like accelerated aging,</v>

514
00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:07.220
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's just instead of seven decades,</v>

515
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:08.960
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's happening,</v>

516
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in an instant,</v>

517
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:15.011
<v Speaker 4>in like in the course of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you keep it and then it causes </v>

518
00:25:15.351 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 4>this huge cycle of neuroinflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in addition to that,</v>

519
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Tau tangles start to form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is another thing that happens in </v>

520
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.780
<v Speaker 4>response to the activation of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>microglia cells in the brain.</v>

521
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 4>We're now you've got something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside your neuron,</v>

522
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a protein called tau and it's</v>

523
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:39.011
<v Speaker 4>really an important protein because </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically what it does is it's like it's</v>

524
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:44.441
<v Speaker 4>transporting cargo all like a down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>long Axon to the snapchat cleft where </v>

525
00:25:44.661 --> 00:25:49.661
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmission occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where do you form synopsis to learn </v>

526
00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:49.661
<v Speaker 4>memory?</v>

527
00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Those things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's taking,</v>

528
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:52.730
<v Speaker 4>it's transporting lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's transporting glucose,</v>

529
00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 4>it's transporting mitochondria that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

530
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:58.220
<v Speaker 4>need to get to that synaptic cleft to </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce energy.</v>

531
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like,</v>

532
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

533
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:05.111
<v Speaker 4>it's transporting all this cargo to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>there to do all this really important </v>

534
00:26:05.111 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 4>stuff for your brain to function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what happens is,</v>

535
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:11.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury and also just </v>

536
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.791
<v Speaker 4>normal brain aging when you have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>activation of the immune system and </v>

537
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:16.871
<v Speaker 4>reactive oxygen species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it causes this thing aggregate and it </v>

538
00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:19.560
<v Speaker 4>screws up its function and now it can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>transport any of that cargo.</v>

539
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like the train became derailed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't get there.</v>

540
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.430
<v Speaker 4>So now you can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

541
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.140
<v Speaker 4>nutrients to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the part of the neuron where it needs</v>

542
00:26:27.141 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 4>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't get Mitochondria there,</v>

543
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are making energy.</v>

544
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.020
<v Speaker 4>And so you start to have things breaking</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

545
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.280
<v Speaker 4>You start to have synopses dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

546
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the reason.</v>

547
00:26:36.691 --> 00:26:38.190
<v Speaker 4>So to neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

548
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:43.390
<v Speaker 4>when you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you form a synaptic connections between </v>

549
00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 4>the neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the whole purpose of neurons.</v>

550
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to form connections with other</v>

551
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:46.250
<v Speaker 4>neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

552
00:26:46.251 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're there for.</v>

553
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
<v Speaker 4>And when you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's not enough energy and it </v>

554
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 4>starts breaking down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neurons have no purpose,</v>

555
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't,</v>

556
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:58.220
<v Speaker 4>so they die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this,</v>

557
00:26:58.221 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 4>this causes brain atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it happens,</v>

558
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:03.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in normal brain aging over the course of</v>

559
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:08.241
<v Speaker 4>several decades where you can look at an</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's brain and it's just gotten </v>

560
00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 4>massive atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

561
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 4>the same thing happens with traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain injury.</v>

562
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are,</v>

563
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.260
<v Speaker 4>are losing a lot of cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glial cells and neurons in their brain </v>

564
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.680
<v Speaker 4>and it's causing brain atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

565
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:20.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

566
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:25.310
<v Speaker 4>the accumulation of amyloid Beta and tau</v>
<v Speaker 4>tangles are two prominent features of </v>

567
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's that are disrupting all </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of,</v>

568
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:28.400
<v Speaker 4>there causing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

569
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 4>Immuno Neuro inflammation.</v>

570
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.810
<v Speaker 4>They're causing a reactive oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 4>species to be generated and does it.</v>

571
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 4>It causes a cycle where it just won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop because whenever there's an amyloid</v>

572
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 4>plaque,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you activate more microglia,</v>

573
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.630
<v Speaker 4>the Microglia get activated and makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>more plaques.</v>

574
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.110
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

575
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 4>it's just this horrible cycle that </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get broken and not something </v>

576
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really,</v>

577
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they found both of these things very </v>

578
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 4>prominently in brains of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have undergone Tbi.</v>

579
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.850
<v Speaker 4>I have a question about repeated trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you are in a fight and you get hit</v>

580
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.570
<v Speaker 4>and hurt and you get in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you survive and then you make it to </v>

581
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.500
<v Speaker 4>the next round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the,</v>

582
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:15.530
<v Speaker 4>the impacts that you take after that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they even more devastating because </v>

583
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:17.610
<v Speaker 4>of the initial impact?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

584
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.500
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the initial,</v>

585
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.900
<v Speaker 4>the initial injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your cells and because of the,</v>

586
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.920
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the production of reactive oxygen </v>

587
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:30.920
<v Speaker 4>species and inflammatory response and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things that are happening,</v>

588
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.450
<v Speaker 4>that is all a stress to the cell.</v>

589
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:38.130
<v Speaker 4>So the cell is already stressed and when</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cell is stressed,</v>

590
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.450
<v Speaker 4>it is more susceptible to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

591
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.830
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of part of the mechanism by</v>

592
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:51.831
<v Speaker 4>which cancer cells are primed to die in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a sense where cancer cells are stressed </v>

593
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:58.011
<v Speaker 4>because all sorts of stuff is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong in them and they are primed to </v>

594
00:28:58.591 --> 00:28:59.700
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>

595
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:05.090
<v Speaker 4>the cell is expressing what's called pro</v>
<v Speaker 4>apoptotic proteins in cells that are </v>

596
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.130
<v Speaker 4>proteins that are going to make the cell</v>
<v Speaker 4>die,</v>

597
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.700
<v Speaker 4>but the cancer cells found a way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>overcome that by expressing these </v>

598
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.130
<v Speaker 4>antiapoptotic proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's a good balance between,</v>

599
00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:19.131
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much do I have that's gonna make me </v>

600
00:29:19.131 --> 00:29:21.381
<v Speaker 4>die or not make me die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's happening when you have a </v>

601
00:29:21.381 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 4>stressed cell from injury and then like </v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

602
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 4>brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're also,</v>

603
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:24.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

604
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:29.650
<v Speaker 4>the reactive oxygen species causes those</v>
<v Speaker 4>cells to make more of those proteins </v>

605
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:29.650
<v Speaker 4>that are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

606
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 4>di Di di,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're already primed to die.</v>

607
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Even if they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them die immediately,</v>

608
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.630
<v Speaker 4>but even the ones that haven't died </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately,</v>

609
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.140
<v Speaker 4>they may not be dead because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough of those ones that are saying,</v>

610
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:40.830
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't die,</v>

611
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 4>don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet.</v>

612
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 4>There's enough of that protein there to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of balance it out.</v>

613
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.660
<v Speaker 4>But then when you take another stress </v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

614
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 4>it just tips it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tips it towards death.</v>

615
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:54.300
<v Speaker 4>So stress plus stress is additive in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that stress can sensitize you to death.</v>

616
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 4>Stress Plus stress will definitely cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

617
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.160
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something that,</v>

618
00:30:00.161 --> 00:30:00.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking,</v>

619
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having repetitive injuries specimen,</v>

620
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 4>especially in a short timeframe like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

621
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

622
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 4>sensitizes them to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So plus it's also,</v>

623
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:10.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

624
00:30:10.911 --> 00:30:14.480
<v Speaker 4>you're making more of these amyloid Beta</v>
<v Speaker 4>plaques in your brain,</v>

625
00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:14.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

626
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

627
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:20.881
<v Speaker 4>it's happening within our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like the more injury that's </v>

628
00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:20.881
<v Speaker 4>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more this is occurring.</v>

629
00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:25.620
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really a nasty thing and I'm with </v>

630
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 4>fighters just from watching the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>event that I went to.</v>

631
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:34.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was clear that Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty much all of them were taking </v>

632
00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:35.080
<v Speaker 4>injuries to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

633
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 4>and so something that people may not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of.</v>

634
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.580
<v Speaker 4>When I say people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people in the mma community is </v>

635
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:49.861
<v Speaker 4>that there's something else that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>predisposes these fighters to nerve </v>

636
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:52.110
<v Speaker 4>degenerative diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

637
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:57.180
<v Speaker 4>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they categorize them as there's </v>

638
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.581
<v Speaker 4>different ones like pugilistic dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's chronic traumatic </v>

639
00:30:59.581 --> 00:31:01.630
<v Speaker 4>encephalopathy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these are all,</v>

640
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 4>if you look pathologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all have,</v>

641
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 4>they all share characteristics with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's disease.</v>

642
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:10.810
<v Speaker 4>They all have these amyloid Beta plaques</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have accumulated in the brain.</v>

643
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 4>They have Taupe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>protein aggregating,</v>

644
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.210
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

645
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.700
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive atrophy happening because these </v>

646
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.091
<v Speaker 4>things caused cell death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are all very common in their </v>

647
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 4>shared pathological features and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these neurogenic diseases.</v>

648
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what exactly if they see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can't call it Alzheimer's </v>

649
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.040
<v Speaker 4>because Alzheimer's is an age related </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>

650
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:38.041
<v Speaker 4>so it's like calling someone who's 45 </v>
<v Speaker 4>and has massive amyloid plaques in their</v>

651
00:31:40.001 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 4>brain and it's affecting their memory </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's affecting their behavior.</v>

652
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Calling that Alzheimer's is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird because Alzheimer's,</v>

653
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 4>just a limiting word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you're winning because when</v>

654
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:53.941
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation but brought on by trauma?</v>

655
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

656
00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for me to definitively say </v>

657
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.090
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a speculation.</v>

658
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.900
<v Speaker 4>I think that looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

659
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:06.490
<v Speaker 4>I think these pugilistic dementia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these chronic traumatic encephalopathy,</v>

660
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:12.150
<v Speaker 4>it's like Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on an accelerated rate and it </v>

661
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 4>happened specifically as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 4>to traumatic injury to the head.</v>

662
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.890
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it happen in a fight like I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>seen a guy be one way and then have a </v>

663
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:25.981
<v Speaker 4>fight and see noticeably diminished </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to communicate.</v>

664
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

665
00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:32.210
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the features of lack of </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen to the brain because now you </v>

666
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:36.150
<v Speaker 4>can't have energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

667
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 4>be energy's not being made to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

668
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:44.801
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to facilitate neurotransmission and </v>

669
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:47.861
<v Speaker 4>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like learning and things and </v>

670
00:32:47.861 --> 00:32:49.511
<v Speaker 4>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what happens when you have inner </v>

671
00:32:49.511 --> 00:32:51.460
<v Speaker 4>injury is that everything gets diverted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to repair its energy.</v>

672
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.730
<v Speaker 4>You only make so much energy and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

673
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:59.770
<v Speaker 4>so it's a constant battle and this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same for people that are obese type </v>

674
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:04.241
<v Speaker 4>two diabetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever type of chronic injury that's </v>

675
00:33:04.241 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 4>happening in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gut inflammation,</v>

676
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:06.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

677
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of energy that need that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>required to repair that injury.</v>

678
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.570
<v Speaker 4>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

679
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 4>it's energy gets diverted to repairing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that injury.</v>

680
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:21.641
<v Speaker 4>And what happens when you have all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy that the cells are making go to </v>

681
00:33:21.641 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 4>repair well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are,</v>

682
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal function,</v>

683
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:28.810
<v Speaker 4>don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your metabolism is kind of screwed </v>

684
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:28.810
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're thinking,</v>

685
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things are,</v>

686
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:33.100
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a triage almost where you're triaging </v>

687
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:33.560
<v Speaker 4>this to the essential like I need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>repair this damage.</v>

688
00:33:33.561 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 4>If I don't repair this damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might die.</v>

689
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you're shutting the energy </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that repair process.</v>

690
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:43.970
<v Speaker 4>So things like short term memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>communication,</v>

691
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.300
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of gets screwed up in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

692
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 4>So that makes perfect sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would happen.</v>

693
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've literally seen guys in,</v>

694
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

695
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.200
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so nonscientific to judge them by </v>

696
00:33:59.200 --> 00:33:59.200
<v Speaker 3>the standard because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

697
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.630
<v Speaker 3>just my perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen a guy be one way and then </v>

698
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 3>have a couple of really brutal fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a noticeable dimness to</v>

699
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 3>the way they look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they talk.</v>

700
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.370
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there seems to be like a,</v>

701
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:18.490
<v Speaker 3>like a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What timeframe are we talking about </v>

702
00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:18.490
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple months.</v>

703
00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:19.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

704
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.400
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've,</v>

705
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:25.460
<v Speaker 4>they've been shown that this injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the acute effects that I was describing </v>

706
00:34:26.641 --> 00:34:27.780
<v Speaker 4>in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

707
00:34:27.781 --> 00:34:30.720
<v Speaker 4>the immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the immune cells in the brain,</v>

708
00:34:30.721 --> 00:34:35.721
<v Speaker 4>the microglia getting aggravated and </v>
<v Speaker 4>amyloid Beta plaques forming and all </v>

709
00:34:35.721 --> 00:34:36.930
<v Speaker 4>that stuff happens and they showed that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this continues to happen for months,</v>

710
00:34:36.931 --> 00:34:39.840
<v Speaker 4>even years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even with just a single,</v>

711
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.470
<v Speaker 4>like traumatic brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

712
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.470
<v Speaker 3>one rough fight can potentially effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a person other than negative impacts.</v>

713
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Compounds</v>

714
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.680
<v Speaker 4>four years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

715
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:53.740
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have shown a dose dependent effect </v>

716
00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.891
<v Speaker 4>in terms of even multiple mild traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries they compound over years and </v>

717
00:34:58.041 --> 00:35:01.250
<v Speaker 4>they cause pugilistic dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They cause,</v>

718
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:06.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these types of neurodegenerative </v>

719
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:06.300
<v Speaker 4>diseases that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very similar to Alzheimer's.</v>

720
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.500
<v Speaker 4>And something that I want to point out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that may predispose people to them more </v>

721
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.400
<v Speaker 4>is genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is something that's very,</v>

722
00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:22.120
<v Speaker 4>very similar to Alzheimer's as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

723
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.210
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we have different variations of genes</v>

724
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.590
<v Speaker 4>and these are called polymorphisms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really all a polymorphism is it's,</v>

725
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 4>it's a gene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like it's,</v>

726
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 4>there's a slight variation in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sequence of DNA and that slight </v>

727
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.701
<v Speaker 4>variation in the sequence of DNA can </v>
<v Speaker 4>change the function of that gene </v>

728
00:35:43.701 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 4>somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

729
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 4>I think if we were to really look deeply</v>
<v Speaker 4>at polymorphisms,</v>

730
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.960
<v Speaker 4>we'd find there's gotta be a selective </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why we've acquired these sort of </v>

731
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:54.630
<v Speaker 4>changes.</v>

732
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Like there's gotta be an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The polymorphisms aren't mutations in </v>

733
00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 4>the sense where like a mutation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>random,</v>

734
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just happens.</v>

735
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:05.560
<v Speaker 4>Polymorphisms are selected for and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>occur in a,</v>

736
00:36:05.561 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 4>in a decent percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

737
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.420
<v Speaker 4>there seems to be like you can always </v>
<v Speaker 4>find,</v>

738
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:16.950
<v Speaker 4>even if the gene changes the gene in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense where it seems like it's not doing</v>

739
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:20.400
<v Speaker 4>something as well as it should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we look hard enough,</v>

740
00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 4>we might find there's actually a reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>why there's sort of like a trade off,</v>

741
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

742
00:36:24.951 --> 00:36:27.080
<v Speaker 4>so gene polymorphisms or we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

743
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.720
<v Speaker 4>these are very common ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are always looking at things like</v>

744
00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:34.350
<v Speaker 4>the breast cancer related genes like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brca one,</v>

745
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Brca two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's like,</v>

746
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:40.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a certain variation of this </v>

747
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.400
<v Speaker 4>gene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a dramatic increase in possibly</v>

748
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 4>getting breast cancer.</v>

749
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Well we've got a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>variations in genes and one of them is </v>

750
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 4>associated with a dramatic increased </v>
<v Speaker 4>risk for Alzheimer's disease.</v>

751
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 4>It's an engine called [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

752
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:59.630
<v Speaker 4>this gene is polymorphic in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's actually multiple bearing </v>

753
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:04.291
<v Speaker 4>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's three different isoforms of </v>

754
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:04.291
<v Speaker 4>it that are common in the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>

755
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:07.950
<v Speaker 4>It's called [inaudible] two [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>three and April before.</v>

756
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:13.450
<v Speaker 4>And essentially what it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a light bulb protein and it's,</v>

757
00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.650
<v Speaker 4>it's made in the liver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also in the brain and the liver,</v>

758
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 4>what it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what its main function is.</v>

759
00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:23.241
<v Speaker 4>It's actually transporting cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 4>like dietary cholesterol and it's making</v>

760
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:26.880
<v Speaker 4>sure it gets to your cells that need it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and bringing it back to the liver to get</v>

761
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:31.881
<v Speaker 4>recycled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So plays a very important role in </v>

762
00:37:31.881 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Transport turns out in the brain,</v>

763
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.910
<v Speaker 4>in our astrocytes are astrocytes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make cholesterol.</v>

764
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.600
<v Speaker 4>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we produce apo e in the brain and it </v>

765
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.721
<v Speaker 4>plays a very important role in </v>
<v Speaker 4>transporting this cholesterol made from </v>

766
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 4>astrocytes to neurons.</v>

767
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's doing other things also involved </v>

768
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.670
<v Speaker 4>with amyloid Beta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the point is is that there are,</v>

769
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.140
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are three variations.</v>

770
00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:58.950
<v Speaker 4>The main one is apo e three and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the majority of population has.</v>

771
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:04.370
<v Speaker 4>So you get one every gene you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get one copy from your mom and you </v>

772
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.780
<v Speaker 4>get one copy from your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have two copies of every gene.</v>

773
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:12.290
<v Speaker 4>And so that's when an illegal is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So most people have two copies of April,</v>

774
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:17.961
<v Speaker 4>we three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is good because it's considered </v>

775
00:38:17.961 --> 00:38:21.621
<v Speaker 4>the normal one like but 25 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the population has one illegal of April.</v>

776
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:27.900
<v Speaker 4>We four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so April we four,</v>

777
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:29.520
<v Speaker 4>so 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one in four.</v>

778
00:38:29.521 --> 00:38:34.521
<v Speaker 4>People just have the general population </v>
<v Speaker 4>has one of these illegals that they </v>

779
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:37.690
<v Speaker 4>either got from their and their dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that have to.</v>

780
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 4>So they got one from this.</v>

781
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:44.130
<v Speaker 4>It's much more rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like two percent of the population </v>

782
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:44.130
<v Speaker 4>actually have two copies of the apoe e </v>
<v Speaker 4>four.</v>

783
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Speaker 4>So 25 percent of population has one copy</v>
<v Speaker 4>of April before.</v>

784
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is April we for </v>
<v Speaker 4>increases the risk of Alzheimer's by two</v>

785
00:38:51.941 --> 00:38:53.050
<v Speaker 4>to three fold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

786
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:58.740
<v Speaker 4>So people that have April before have an</v>
<v Speaker 4>increased risk of just two to three </v>

787
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.431
<v Speaker 4>fold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is recognizable in the DNA </v>

788
00:39:02.431 --> 00:39:02.740
<v Speaker 4>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you could potentially scan athletes.</v>

789
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm getting to that.</v>

790
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So exactly.</v>

791
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 4>So people that are fighters that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or nfl players,</v>

792
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Speaker 4>people that are any sort of trauma to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>

793
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.800
<v Speaker 4>if they're getting this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

794
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 4>as a part of their sports curriculum or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

795
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:24.090
<v Speaker 4>those people that have won a but we for </v>
<v Speaker 4>so traumatic brain injury itself </v>

796
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 4>increases the risk of Alzheimer's by two</v>
<v Speaker 4>to three fold,</v>

797
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:32.130
<v Speaker 4>just like people that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury but have this </v>

798
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:32.130
<v Speaker 4>April.</v>

799
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.490
<v Speaker 4>We for people that have Tbi and April </v>
<v Speaker 4>before increase their risk by like </v>

800
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:39.280
<v Speaker 4>tenfold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So having just one Leo,</v>

801
00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:44.281
<v Speaker 4>you'd have something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a guy who's getting blows to </v>

802
00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:46.501
<v Speaker 4>the head and he has an April before he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>had taken his risks from two to three </v>

803
00:39:46.501 --> 00:39:49.690
<v Speaker 4>fold to tenfold to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

804
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:52.360
<v Speaker 4>And we're talking 25 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population has this.</v>

805
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.840
<v Speaker 4>So they've shown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've shown they've done studies and </v>

806
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:57.840
<v Speaker 4>they've shown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

807
00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.290
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 4>increases the risk of neurodegenerative </v>

808
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.050
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also stroke people with a stroke,</v>

809
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.200
<v Speaker 4>stroke and have April before you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about a tenfold increase risk of</v>

810
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.090
<v Speaker 4>having a neurodegenerative disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the problem is,</v>

811
00:40:12.091 --> 00:40:17.091
<v Speaker 4>is that you're having before is you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't repair damage as well.</v>

812
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

813
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have damage that occurs,</v>

814
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of repair mechanisms that </v>

815
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 4>can happen so you can have what's called</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you lose,</v>

816
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 4>like the synapses that are formed </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the two neurons,</v>

817
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 4>amyloid Beta screws that up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can repair that damage by having</v>

818
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Speaker 4>what's called neurite outgrowth.</v>

819
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.290
<v Speaker 4>So you grow new projections to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuron.</v>

820
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:43.860
<v Speaker 4>That's one way to repair the damage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Aicpa we plays a very important role in </v>

821
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 4>that because it brings cholesterol and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fatty acids to the neuron,</v>

822
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.950
<v Speaker 4>the membrane and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really important to be able to </v>

823
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.891
<v Speaker 4>grow new synopsis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need that April before doesn't do </v>

824
00:40:55.891 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 4>that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also not only does April,</v>

825
00:40:56.861 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 4>we've worn out do that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also bad effects.</v>

826
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:01.460
<v Speaker 4>April we for itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

827
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.320
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the polymorphism that happens,</v>

828
00:41:05.321 --> 00:41:10.321
<v Speaker 4>it changes the structure of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like getting degraded a lot </v>

829
00:41:10.321 --> 00:41:13.651
<v Speaker 4>so you don't have enough of a around and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it chops it up and starts aggregating </v>

830
00:41:13.651 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 4>and doing bad stuff itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

831
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.850
<v Speaker 4>it's just terrible because what happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have Tbi,</v>

832
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:24.270
<v Speaker 4>when you have an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain actually increases a bowie </v>

833
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.270
<v Speaker 4>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

834
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:26.630
<v Speaker 4>I got to repair some damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have that April week four,</v>

835
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 4>it's increasing the bad part.</v>

836
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.290
<v Speaker 4>It's increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

837
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 4>the bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can actually test for this,</v>

838
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 4>this variant using 23 and me for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

839
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 4>So I actually recently did a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did a 23 and me test.</v>

840
00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:45.371
<v Speaker 4>It's $99 and you spit and like a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>tube and you send it off to the,</v>

841
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.990
<v Speaker 4>to the 23 and me and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

842
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 4>isolate Dna from your saliva and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they look for very common polymorphisms.</v>

843
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:54.060
<v Speaker 4>So they look for April,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

844
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 4>they look for Parkinson's related ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in cancer and all that.</v>

845
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:58.340
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

846
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately the FDA shut down part of </v>

847
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.990
<v Speaker 4>their ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to inform you whether or not you have.</v>

848
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that happened recently.</v>

849
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:13.241
<v Speaker 4>I think it was sort of a consequence to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Angelina Jolie getting her boobs cut off</v>

850
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.170
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

851
00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:19.540
<v Speaker 4>So was that misinformed what she did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

852
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:25.060
<v Speaker 4>so I'm unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't really read exactly how </v>

853
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:25.060
<v Speaker 4>everything went down.</v>

854
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.990
<v Speaker 4>I just know that she did 23 and me and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

855
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:33.210
<v Speaker 4>found out she had some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had a polymorphism and one of the </v>

856
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:33.210
<v Speaker 4>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she didn't have cancer.</v>

857
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:33.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

858
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's a pro.</v>

859
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 4>I think that sort of precipitated the </v>
<v Speaker 4>FDA.</v>

860
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 4>So the way they test for these genes is </v>
<v Speaker 4>by something called PCR and it's,</v>

861
00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not infallible,</v>

862
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.740
<v Speaker 4>so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

863
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 4>they can give you back your results and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say oh look,</v>

864
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 4>you've got this polymorphism is </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with x disease,</v>

865
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:57.131
<v Speaker 4>which increases your risk for cancer by </v>
<v Speaker 4>tenfold and it could have just spend a </v>

866
00:42:57.131 --> 00:42:58.430
<v Speaker 4>little air in the methods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

867
00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:03.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a full proof proof </v>

868
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.771
<v Speaker 4>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's also part of the </v>

869
00:43:05.771 --> 00:43:08.141
<v Speaker 4>problem where it's like you're giving </v>
<v Speaker 4>people back this genetic data and it's </v>

870
00:43:08.141 --> 00:43:09.050
<v Speaker 4>like they're taking it very seriously </v>
<v Speaker 4>and obviously taking,</v>

871
00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:11.430
<v Speaker 4>going to extreme measures to do things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

872
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.180
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like getting their boobs removed.</v>

873
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you still can 23 enemies not shut </v>

874
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.491
<v Speaker 4>down like you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I did it when they were already </v>

875
00:43:21.491 --> 00:43:25.120
<v Speaker 4>unable to give you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tell you exactly what polymorphisms </v>

876
00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 4>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

877
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm a scientist so I didn't really care </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they'd give you the raw data and</v>

878
00:43:29.331 --> 00:43:34.331
<v Speaker 4>I can actually go through the raw data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I did and see what polymorphisms I</v>

879
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 4>have and I found out that I actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>have one illegal of April before.</v>

880
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so funny because it's really the only,</v>

881
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.130
<v Speaker 4>the only gene I cared about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the other stuff.</v>

882
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did 23 in me because I was terrified </v>

883
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.480
<v Speaker 4>of having April before and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have it and if it turns out my dad </v>

884
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:57.650
<v Speaker 4>gave it to me and my dad has it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

885
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:58.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

886
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.070
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a.</v>

887
00:44:00.071 --> 00:44:05.071
<v Speaker 4>But we for just one to Lille of it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>already you have a two to three fold </v>

888
00:44:05.071 --> 00:44:05.690
<v Speaker 4>increase risk for Alzheimer's.</v>

889
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.960
<v Speaker 4>If you look at people with Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between 65 and 80 percent of them have </v>

890
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.660
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll have eight.</v>

891
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:16.710
<v Speaker 4>But we've for a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So basically any person walking around </v>

892
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:20.450
<v Speaker 4>with one Leo has about a 30 percent risk</v>
<v Speaker 4>of getting Alzheimer's.</v>

893
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.230
<v Speaker 4>And it really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really has to do with your,</v>

894
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 4>your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way you interact with,</v>

895
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:31.330
<v Speaker 4>with your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's going to shift you either </v>

896
00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 4>into getting it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In what way?</v>

897
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Multiple ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

898
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

899
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.610
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

900
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 4>the April before is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

901
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 4>it's not working well and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

902
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.970
<v Speaker 4>So amyloid Beta plaques building up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>

903
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:48.180
<v Speaker 4>whether you're talking about at an </v>
<v Speaker 4>exponential rate because of injury,</v>

904
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:53.181
<v Speaker 4>traumatic injury to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about just normal brain </v>

905
00:44:53.181 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 4>aging decades and decades and decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's April,</v>

906
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:59.421
<v Speaker 4>we plays an important role in taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that amyloid Beta that's built up and </v>

907
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 4>bringing it to get degraded.</v>

908
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 4>It gets rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you have ap,</v>

909
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:09.081
<v Speaker 4>we for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just for some reason can't bind to </v>

910
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:09.081
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Beta plaque as well.</v>

911
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:11.240
<v Speaker 4>And so it can't remove it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>

912
00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:15.780
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about people that are not</v>
<v Speaker 4>only accumulating more of it because,</v>

913
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

914
00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 4>of other things that we for is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can't remove it as well.</v>

915
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have to April,</v>

916
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:28.431
<v Speaker 4>we three's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got a better mechanism of </v>

917
00:45:28.431 --> 00:45:28.860
<v Speaker 4>removing that amyloid Beta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

918
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:34.190
<v Speaker 4>there's another way you can remove </v>
<v Speaker 4>amyloid Beta from the brain and that's </v>

919
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.400
<v Speaker 4>from getting sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm literally so sleep when you sleep,</v>

920
00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens is your brain actually </v>

921
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.801
<v Speaker 4>swells because cerebral spinal fluid </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets pushed up into the brain.</v>

922
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have this whole glymphatic system,</v>

923
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:54.660
<v Speaker 4>you lymph vessels and things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounding neurons and astrocytes and </v>

924
00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:00.350
<v Speaker 4>cerebral spinal fluid gets pushed into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain when you sleep and it </v>

925
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 4>literally physically pushes out amyloid </v>
<v Speaker 4>Beta plaques.</v>

926
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.070
<v Speaker 4>It removes amyloid Beta plaques and </v>
<v Speaker 4>other dead debris.</v>

927
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Things like that just trashed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's building up in the brain.</v>

928
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is happening when you sleep.</v>

929
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.670
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not getting enough sleep,</v>

930
00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have this April we three,</v>

931
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 4>that's another way they can clear it out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the brain.</v>

932
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:27.021
<v Speaker 4>But me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really need to make sure I get enough </v>

933
00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:27.021
<v Speaker 4>sleep because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

934
00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that other repair mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get rid of the amyloid Beta plaques.</v>

935
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Has there been anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it meditation or anything along </v>

936
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.290
<v Speaker 4>those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

937
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.820
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the glymphatic system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that,</v>

938
00:46:38.821 --> 00:46:43.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems to be a unique feature to </v>

939
00:46:43.821 --> 00:46:43.821
<v Speaker 4>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

940
00:46:43.821 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 4>something that's happening when your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

941
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:47.790
<v Speaker 4>especially particularly in when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>in rem sleep.</v>

942
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know why it's,</v>

943
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.530
<v Speaker 4>it's rem sleep is triggering it.</v>

944
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:54.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

945
00:46:55.290 --> 00:47:00.180
<v Speaker 4>this is a new relatively new finding and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to in this decade.</v>

946
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:05.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like new as in just a couple of years </v>

947
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:06.530
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it sounds so fascinating.</v>

948
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.930
<v Speaker 4>There's something so significant and </v>
<v Speaker 4>important is 2012,</v>

949
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

950
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:17.260
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human brain is very complicated and </v>

951
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:17.260
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

952
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:22.300
<v Speaker 4>people that are doing research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're looking at just little tiny </v>

953
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:22.300
<v Speaker 4>aspect of this and this little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

954
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.570
<v Speaker 4>because there's so many little details </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to sort of interrogate to </v>

955
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:27.140
<v Speaker 4>figure things out and how they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>working.</v>

956
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.840
<v Speaker 4>But the glymphatic system is something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really cool because it gives a </v>

957
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:38.050
<v Speaker 4>mechanistic explanation as to why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another reason why sleep is so</v>

958
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.380
<v Speaker 3>important now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does nutrition play any part in your </v>

959
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:47.660
<v Speaker 3>brain's ability to do this or to do to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitigate this issue?</v>

960
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's.</v>

961
00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:54.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean nutrition plays a huge factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you look at people that are </v>

962
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 4>obese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

963
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.270
<v Speaker 4>and slash or insulin resistance type two</v>
<v Speaker 4>diabetic,</v>

964
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 4>these people also have an increased risk</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Alzheimer's disease and they have an</v>

965
00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:07.880
<v Speaker 4>increased risk for a lot of age related </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

966
00:48:07.881 --> 00:48:12.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they're accelerating their </v>

967
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:15.461
<v Speaker 4>aging process in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that they also have an </v>

968
00:48:16.251 --> 00:48:19.670
<v Speaker 4>increased risk for Alzheimer's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parkinson's is very,</v>

969
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because it suggests </v>

970
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.530
<v Speaker 4>something about not having the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet is also involved.</v>

971
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 4>And there's multiple things going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>here and you know,</v>

972
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.860
<v Speaker 4>I can't figure all of them out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

973
00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.920
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the reason is they've shown that</v>

974
00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.560
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so obesity,</v>

975
00:48:39.561 --> 00:48:44.561
<v Speaker 4>you've got chronic inflammation going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>also with type two diabetics and that </v>

976
00:48:44.561 --> 00:48:49.541
<v Speaker 4>inflammation actually causes a secretion</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like proinflammatory cytokines,</v>

977
00:48:50.331 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Speaker 4>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

978
00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 4>the activate the immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

979
00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.520
<v Speaker 4>because that's what happens when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>body is like,</v>

980
00:48:55.521 --> 00:48:56.420
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's here.</v>

981
00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.510
<v Speaker 4>That's not supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get rid of it and this is the same thing</v>

982
00:48:59.511 --> 00:49:04.511
<v Speaker 4>that happens in the brain that causes </v>
<v Speaker 4>the amyloid Beta plaques to start </v>

983
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:04.511
<v Speaker 4>getting built up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

984
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:06.920
<v Speaker 4>those things cross over at the blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain barrier,</v>

985
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory cytokines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crossover,</v>

986
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.410
<v Speaker 4>get into the brain and start causing </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuroinflammation.</v>

987
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:16.790
<v Speaker 4>So it's really like they've even shown </v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you inject,</v>

988
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 4>you can inject people with endotoxin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Endotoxin is what's like a part of the </v>

989
00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.270
<v Speaker 4>bacterial cell wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's released,</v>

990
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when bacteria are dying and it happens </v>

991
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.211
<v Speaker 4>in the gut a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it causes massive inflammation and </v>

992
00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:37.900
<v Speaker 4>you can inject people with endotoxin and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it causes learning and memory deficits </v>

993
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.450
<v Speaker 4>and it causes depressive symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

994
00:49:41.451 --> 00:49:44.930
<v Speaker 4>also you can inject them with a pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory cytokines,</v>

995
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 4>interferon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that interferon also causes </v>

996
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.801
<v Speaker 4>depressive symptoms because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammation is being more and more </v>

997
00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:58.031
<v Speaker 4>linked to depression as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also inflammation in the brain is </v>

998
00:49:58.031 --> 00:50:02.610
<v Speaker 4>actually causing the aggregation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these amyloid Beta plaques to occur.</v>

999
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:07.730
<v Speaker 4>So that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How literally inflammation in your body,</v>

1000
00:50:07.731 --> 00:50:08.960
<v Speaker 4>in your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1001
00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.370
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the peripheral part of your body,</v>

1002
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.550
<v Speaker 4>your body can affect your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your will.</v>

1003
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:14.770
<v Speaker 4>There's</v>

1004
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I there been sorted in revenue again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it haven't.</v>

1005
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:22.390
<v Speaker 3>There been some recent studies that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>shown that the gut bacteria have kids </v>

1006
00:50:22.911 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 3>that have Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is,</v>

1007
00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.780
<v Speaker 3>is usually an issue that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>children that have Alzheimer's also have</v>

1008
00:50:29.781 --> 00:50:34.100
<v Speaker 3>issues with gut bacteria like autism or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did I say?</v>

1009
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1010
00:50:35.021 --> 00:50:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>autism.</v>

1011
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 3>We really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1012
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Literally where's it coming out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I've been hitting the head too </v>

1013
00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:42.820
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1014
00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.300
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>autism spectrum disorders and even </v>

1015
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:46.910
<v Speaker 3>asperger's that there's been some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a connection to gut bacteria.</v>

1016
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1017
00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:52.790
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean these people with autism do have </v>

1018
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 4>a lot of inflammation in their gut and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1019
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:56.810
<v Speaker 4>having inflammation in your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen?</v>

1020
00:50:56.811 --> 00:51:01.811
<v Speaker 4>It's going to get into your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to cause neuro inflammation </v>

1021
00:51:01.811 --> 00:51:04.181
<v Speaker 4>in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And another thing that inflammation in </v>

1022
00:51:04.181 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 4>the brain does is it activates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1023
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got prostoglandins that are being</v>

1024
00:51:10.521 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 4>generated specifically eat two series </v>
<v Speaker 4>prostoglandins.</v>

1025
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:18.790
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why that's bad in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain is because generating [inaudible] </v>

1026
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:22.570
<v Speaker 4>series prostoglandins inhibits the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain's ability to release serotonin.</v>

1027
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:28.940
<v Speaker 4>So you basically can't release serotonin</v>
<v Speaker 4>from like a presynaptic neuron,</v>

1028
00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:31.310
<v Speaker 4>which is important and you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to release Serotonin,</v>

1029
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 4>serotonin during a lot of things in </v>
<v Speaker 4>addition to regulating mood,</v>

1030
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.050
<v Speaker 4>regulating behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regulating impulsive behavior,</v>

1031
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.370
<v Speaker 4>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social behavior,</v>

1032
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:45.610
<v Speaker 4>but you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this inflammation that gets into the </v>

1033
00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.060
<v Speaker 4>brain literally stop Serotonin from </v>
<v Speaker 4>being released from the brain by,</v>

1034
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:49.490
<v Speaker 4>by inhibiting this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1035
00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.920
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by activating the two series and they've</v>

1036
00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:56.921
<v Speaker 4>even shown like that study I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about people where they injected a pro </v>

1037
00:51:56.921 --> 00:52:00.461
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory cytokine and they bake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had came down with depressive </v>

1038
00:52:00.461 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Speaker 4>symptoms if they gave those people epa </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a very high dose of EPA.</v>

1039
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:09.050
<v Speaker 4>So I cone up Penta eicosapentaenoic </v>
<v Speaker 4>acid,</v>

1040
00:52:09.051 --> 00:52:14.051
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the Omega Threes that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that mitigated the depressive symptoms </v>

1041
00:52:14.051 --> 00:52:18.821
<v Speaker 4>like they didn't get the depressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>symptoms because I think that what's </v>

1042
00:52:18.821 --> 00:52:20.360
<v Speaker 4>happening is that inflammation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>causing.</v>

1043
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 4>One thing that EPA does very potent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>potently inhibits the generation of</v>

1044
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:27.920
<v Speaker 3>approximate sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that way,</v>

1045
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:33.430
<v Speaker 3>gut bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially taking in in the form of </v>

1046
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:37.991
<v Speaker 3>probiotics is probably a very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the human diet that is widely </v>

1047
00:52:37.991 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 3>ignored by a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1048
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acidophilus.</v>

1049
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.180
<v Speaker 3>You're drinking Kombucha here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

1050
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:49.270
<v Speaker 3>I love my Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I said to you that this is the </v>

1051
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 3>computer that's watered down so that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>meets the whole food standards.</v>

1052
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that this.</v>

1053
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Did you get this at whole foods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one up the street.</v>

1054
00:52:56.901 --> 00:53:01.901
<v Speaker 3>They have the regular stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta know what bottle to get and </v>

1055
00:53:01.901 --> 00:53:03.720
<v Speaker 3>you need to have a license,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a driver's license.</v>

1056
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:07.790
<v Speaker 3>It shows you're over 21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's only one half of one percent.</v>

1057
00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:12.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the cutoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's more than one half of one </v>

1058
00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:12.920
<v Speaker 3>percent alcohol by volume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to have.</v>

1059
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.490
<v Speaker 3>It has to have to have a liquor license </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sell it,</v>

1060
00:53:15.491 --> 00:53:17.450
<v Speaker 3>which is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get drunk off of it.</v>

1061
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:22.580
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea that this was watered </v>

1062
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:22.580
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yes,</v>

1063
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probiotics are very important.</v>

1064
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1065
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:28.230
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want.</v>

1066
00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.590
<v Speaker 4>So probiotics are doing things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>generating lactic acid,</v>

1067
00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:36.591
<v Speaker 4>which are does a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is it's killing off these pathogenic</v>

1068
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 4>bacteria that can't live in an acidic </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment in the gut,</v>

1069
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 4>but also like I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lactate,</v>

1070
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:49.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lactates also can be used by </v>

1071
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Mitochondria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1072
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:52.320
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about giving a source of </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy for your Mitochondria,</v>

1073
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that you can,</v>

1074
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.300
<v Speaker 4>it an important component of not having </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of gut inflammation is,</v>

1075
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.050
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the balance between pro biotics and,</v>

1076
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:10.100
<v Speaker 4>and the pathogenic bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also maintaining that gut </v>

1077
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 4>barrier because you've got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>immune cells in your gut,</v>

1078
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:18.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're there because you don't want to </v>

1079
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.290
<v Speaker 4>eat something bad and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill you.</v>

1080
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 4>So they're there and they're ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1081
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.000
<v Speaker 4>fight off anything that's potentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathogenic.</v>

1082
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.630
<v Speaker 4>So they have a purpose of being there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way they don't continually,</v>

1083
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.450
<v Speaker 4>continually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1084
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:36.710
<v Speaker 4>start fighting off things is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a barrier which is basically a </v>

1085
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:37.020
<v Speaker 4>mucous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1086
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.750
<v Speaker 4>it's called mucin and your gut cells </v>
<v Speaker 4>secrete it.</v>

1087
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:44.990
<v Speaker 4>And this mucin is important for </v>
<v Speaker 4>separating the immune cells in your gut </v>

1088
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:49.221
<v Speaker 4>from the bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when that mucin gets broken </v>

1089
00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:51.861
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your immune cells are exposed to </v>

1090
00:54:51.861 --> 00:54:51.861
<v Speaker 4>bacteria which are supposed to be in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your gut,</v>

1091
00:54:51.861 --> 00:54:52.200
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1092
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:57.201
<v Speaker 4>bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they start firing all these </v>

1093
00:54:57.201 --> 00:54:57.201
<v Speaker 4>cytokines and you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start to get inflammation,</v>

1094
00:54:57.201 --> 00:55:01.611
<v Speaker 4>which then breaks down the gut barrier </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and it causes the same sort of </v>

1095
00:55:01.611 --> 00:55:01.890
<v Speaker 4>cycle that I was talking about in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

1096
00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:06.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of cycles going on can happen </v>

1097
00:55:06.891 --> 00:55:06.891
<v Speaker 4>in the gut as well.</v>

1098
00:55:06.891 --> 00:55:08.560
<v Speaker 4>So things like eating a lot of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1099
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 4>like can literally break down the Mucin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1100
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:17.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like that's having that chronic </v>

1101
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 4>inflammation is I'm doing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1102
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 4>So having the right balance of bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 4>is one thing that's good,</v>

1103
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:26.240
<v Speaker 4>but also making sure that you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right diet to make sure that you're,</v>

1104
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:31.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're giving yourself the right energy </v>

1105
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.471
<v Speaker 4>they need to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do things that they're supposed to </v>

1106
00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:33.471
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if it's,</v>

1107
00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:37.040
<v Speaker 4>if we're talking about the gut making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mucin and sugar actually fuels bad </v>

1108
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.400
<v Speaker 4>bacteria in the gut as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1109
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:43.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A sugar does feel bad bacteria in the </v>

1110
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.581
<v Speaker 4>gut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of the bad bacteria in the gut </v>

1111
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:48.441
<v Speaker 4>like to get them some sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you're talking about having </v>

1112
00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:50.550
<v Speaker 4>overgrowth of the bad bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1113
00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:55.551
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot weakens your immune </v>

1114
00:55:55.551 --> 00:55:55.551
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

1115
00:55:55.551 --> 00:55:55.551
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sugar is significant.</v>

1116
00:55:55.551 --> 00:55:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Immune system weakening inflammation in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

1117
00:55:58.351 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that also has a lot to do with,</v>

1118
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 4>if you think about having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1119
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:09.441
<v Speaker 4>a breakdown of the gut barrier and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this pathogenic bacteria which also </v>

1120
00:56:09.441 --> 00:56:11.940
<v Speaker 4>break down the gut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's what they do also.</v>

1121
00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:17.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of energy gets spent towards </v>

1122
00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.120
<v Speaker 4>fixing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fixing that,</v>

1123
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.500
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to fix that.</v>

1124
00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I got to repair this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that takes away from brain phone.</v>

1125
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.630
<v Speaker 4>That takes away from Brent Stage Immune </v>
<v Speaker 4>function because now you know,</v>

1126
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:31.650
<v Speaker 4>you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the energy's going towards the gut to </v>

1127
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.200
<v Speaker 4>repair this chronic damage that's also </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1128
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 4>And now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your immune systems.</v>

1129
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:37.270
<v Speaker 4>Don't you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're fighting off a disease,</v>

1130
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:39.540
<v Speaker 4>when you're fighting off a pathogenic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1131
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:42.280
<v Speaker 4>whether it's viral or bacterial or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1132
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 4>like that requires a massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy,</v>

1133
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 4>massive amount of energy.</v>

1134
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.660
<v Speaker 4>That's an energy consuming process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a matter of triaging this energy</v>

1135
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 4>to the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1136
00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1137
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

1138
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:59.260
<v Speaker 4>if my guts really healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not inflamed,</v>

1139
00:56:59.261 --> 00:57:01.630
<v Speaker 4>I have a good diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting my micronutrients,</v>

1140
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:03.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm not eating a bunch of sugary crap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1141
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 4>the refined carbohydrates and things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1142
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1143
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 4>you don't have all this chronic damage </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening that you,</v>

1144
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:13.690
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your energy is constantly.</v>

1145
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like a drain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an energy drain.</v>

1146
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:18.340
<v Speaker 4>It just keeps getting sucked into it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1147
00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:23.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that affects all sorts of other </v>

1148
00:57:23.341 --> 00:57:23.341
<v Speaker 4>functions in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1149
00:57:23.341 --> 00:57:23.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's other explanations,</v>

1150
00:57:23.951 --> 00:57:28.951
<v Speaker 4>but I like to think about it that way in</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like a triaging of energy </v>

1151
00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:31.720
<v Speaker 4>because it really just makes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense from an energetic standpoint.</v>

1152
00:57:31.721 --> 00:57:36.721
<v Speaker 4>Looking at how energetically consuming </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fighting off diseases and how </v>

1153
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:39.730
<v Speaker 4>energetically consuming repair is.</v>

1154
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 4>And people that are obese or type two </v>
<v Speaker 4>diabetic,</v>

1155
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:45.760
<v Speaker 4>they're in a constant repair state </v>
<v Speaker 4>constant.</v>

1156
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:50.820
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is poor energy management </v>

1157
00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.791
<v Speaker 4>because of your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because your energy is being taken away </v>

1158
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:59.101
<v Speaker 4>to a bunch of functions that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't order ordinarily needed for if </v>

1159
00:57:59.101 --> 00:57:59.770
<v Speaker 4>your diet was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

1160
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:00.610
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1161
00:58:00.611 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting the lab that I,</v>

1162
00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I work in.</v>

1163
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:10.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm at Children's Hospital in Oakland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We work with a lot of insulin resistant,</v>

1164
00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:13.350
<v Speaker 4>obese children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1165
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 4>but we're also doing research on </v>
<v Speaker 4>adolescents and even some of the parents</v>

1166
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:20.920
<v Speaker 4>of these children which are also obese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insulin resistant.</v>

1167
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1168
00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:25.900
<v Speaker 4>some of my colleagues in my lab have </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed a,</v>

1169
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:30.930
<v Speaker 4>like a nutrient bar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they call it the core rebar and the </v>

1170
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:34.771
<v Speaker 4>nutrient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a micronutrient dense bar </v>

1171
00:58:34.771 --> 00:58:34.771
<v Speaker 4>where it has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1172
00:58:34.771 --> 00:58:38.120
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of vitamins and minerals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin D and fiber has some </v>

1173
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:38.120
<v Speaker 4>polyphenols.</v>

1174
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:43.110
<v Speaker 4>It has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dha has just a bunch of good stuff </v>

1175
00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 4>instead of taking a bunch of vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all in like a matrix with fiber and</v>

1176
00:58:45.881 --> 00:58:48.340
<v Speaker 4>stuff so that things are absorbed better</v>
<v Speaker 4>and digested.</v>

1177
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:49.910
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1178
00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1179
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.590
<v Speaker 4>my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been directly involved in this</v>

1180
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:55.960
<v Speaker 4>research because I look more at things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like dna damage,</v>

1181
00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:01.290
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what my colleagues have found is that </v>

1182
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:04.021
<v Speaker 4>giving these obese people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether we're talking about children or </v>

1183
00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:09.000
<v Speaker 4>adolescents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adults giving them this micronutrient </v>

1184
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:09.000
<v Speaker 4>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1185
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.661
<v Speaker 4>if you compare like giving it to a lean </v>
<v Speaker 4>person and you don't have them change </v>

1186
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:13.661
<v Speaker 4>their diet at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1187
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do what you're going to do,</v>

1188
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 4>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat what you're going to eat.</v>

1189
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:17.620
<v Speaker 4>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take this twice a day on top of that.</v>

1190
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:23.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we find is that one publication </v>

1191
00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.250
<v Speaker 4>that was done on lean people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lean people like immediately it,</v>

1192
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.930
<v Speaker 4>their hdl goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1193
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 4>things start happening.</v>

1194
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 4>They make more glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all these positive changes occur,</v>

1195
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 4>but obese people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a lot longer to happen.</v>

1196
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:41.490
<v Speaker 4>Like it takes a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas I actually takes even more than </v>

1197
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:41.490
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1198
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the exact amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1199
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.460
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1200
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes longer to happen.</v>

1201
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 4>We think it takes longer because these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people first,</v>

1202
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:51.020
<v Speaker 4>all that energy that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1203
00:59:51.021 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 4>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the micronutrients,</v>

1204
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:53.290
<v Speaker 4>all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1205
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 4>it's being shunted towards fixing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fixing,</v>

1206
00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.080
<v Speaker 4>and eventually as they start to fix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you start to see little changes </v>

1207
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't happen right away.</v>

1208
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:06.851
<v Speaker 4>Like it happens in people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy and I use lean as a marker for </v>

1209
01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:06.851
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1210
01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:08.240
<v Speaker 4>it's not entirely accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>accurate,</v>

1211
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:12.770
<v Speaker 4>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when exactly relatively speaking,</v>

1212
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.710
<v Speaker 4>glutosiome do you take glutathione </v>
<v Speaker 4>supplement?</v>

1213
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1214
01:00:17.961 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 4>so that actually I wanted to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the possible,</v>

1215
01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tbi,</v>

1216
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.800
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>injury and I talked about all this </v>

1217
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 4>terrible stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are things that can be done to</v>

1218
01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>

1219
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and glutathione is interesting because,</v>

1220
01:00:35.401 --> 01:00:40.010
<v Speaker 4>so glutathione is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the major antioxidant in the</v>

1221
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:42.830
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why it's very important,</v>

1222
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1223
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as for for brain aging in general,</v>

1224
01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:52.181
<v Speaker 4>and it's all been associated with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of studies in terms of the more </v>

1225
01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:52.620
<v Speaker 4>glutathione in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1226
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 4>decreased Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decreased damage in the brain going on.</v>

1227
01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1228
01:00:57.381 --> 01:01:02.381
<v Speaker 4>glutathione is just basically three </v>
<v Speaker 4>amino acids that are together and it's </v>

1229
01:01:02.381 --> 01:01:04.460
<v Speaker 4>glutamic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glycine,</v>

1230
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:09.490
<v Speaker 4>and I think assisting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so our body makes this inside of </v>

1231
01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 4>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We make it,</v>

1232
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.280
<v Speaker 4>we have an enzyme called Glutathione </v>
<v Speaker 4>synthase and that enzyme takes those </v>

1233
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.560
<v Speaker 4>amino acids and puts it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then once we have glutathione,</v>

1234
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:22.570
<v Speaker 4>we have other enzymes that are able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>use glutathione as a potent antioxidant.</v>

1235
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Glutathione Peroxidase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1236
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:31.001
<v Speaker 4>this is another enzyme that uses that </v>
<v Speaker 4>glutathione to prevent that reactive </v>

1237
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:34.220
<v Speaker 4>oxygen species damage I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that happens like one of the early</v>

1238
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:39.221
<v Speaker 4>events with traumatic brain injury and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also one of the early damaging </v>

1239
01:01:39.221 --> 01:01:40.460
<v Speaker 4>events that happens just with normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain aging,</v>

1240
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 4>which is happening all the time.</v>

1241
01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:44.460
<v Speaker 4>We're making it right now in our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1242
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.910
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1243
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:51.130
<v Speaker 4>having gludethyon in the brain is really</v>
<v Speaker 4>good and there's different enzymes that </v>

1244
01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:51.130
<v Speaker 4>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Glutathione Peroxidase,</v>

1245
01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:53.650
<v Speaker 4>we'll use glutathione to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1246
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:59.050
<v Speaker 4>to basically reduce that oxidative </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage so it can't damage the neuron or </v>

1247
01:01:59.050 --> 01:01:59.930
<v Speaker 4>astrocyte or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1248
01:01:59.931 --> 01:02:02.490
<v Speaker 4>cell type that it comes in contact with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1249
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:07.510
<v Speaker 4>the problem is that with age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we decrease the expression of </v>

1250
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:09.620
<v Speaker 4>glutathione related genes and what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>means is,</v>

1251
01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:14.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have genes in your body and </v>

1252
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:15.740
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they can be expression just </v>
<v Speaker 4>means you make more of it.</v>

1253
01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:17.450
<v Speaker 4>So when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's being expressed,</v>

1254
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.380
<v Speaker 4>you're making more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a thing.</v>

1255
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.800
<v Speaker 4>As we age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we decrease the expression,</v>

1256
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:27.801
<v Speaker 4>so like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things fall apart and we don't make as </v>

1257
01:02:27.801 --> 01:02:28.630
<v Speaker 4>much of these glutathione related genes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1258
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:32.400
<v Speaker 4>the thing with glutathione is you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's made in ourselves.</v>

1259
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.440
<v Speaker 4>There's no transport mechanism to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>glutathione into the cell,</v>

1260
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.890
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1261
01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.900
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can transport it in immuno acids and</v>

1262
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.960
<v Speaker 4>the amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then this glutathione synthase uses </v>

1263
01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.691
<v Speaker 4>those to make it in the cell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no transport mechanism for </v>

1264
01:02:50.691 --> 01:02:54.500
<v Speaker 4>glutamic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glycine and sustained together to get </v>

1265
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:54.500
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1266
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't just,</v>

1267
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 4>cells have a transport mechanism to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff inside.</v>

1268
01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a regulated process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1269
01:02:59.851 --> 01:03:04.851
<v Speaker 4>so taking glutathione orally a is sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of pointless.</v>

1270
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention the fact that the guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't going to absorb it,</v>

1271
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.710
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets broken apart.</v>

1272
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is lyposomal glutathione.</v>

1273
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Lyposomal,</v>

1274
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:19.420
<v Speaker 4>Glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1275
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:24.650
<v Speaker 4>anything that's Lyposomal can bypass a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of these transport mechanisms just </v>

1276
01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 4>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1277
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So first of all,</v>

1278
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:32.571
<v Speaker 4>liposomes can be absorbed by the gut but</v>
<v Speaker 4>also they can get into cells because a </v>

1279
01:03:33.051 --> 01:03:35.430
<v Speaker 4>lyposomal is basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1280
01:03:35.431 --> 01:03:40.431
<v Speaker 4>it's like a little liquid that has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascial liquid by layer and it has </v>

1281
01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 4>whatever it has inside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this case,</v>

1282
01:03:40.621 --> 01:03:45.621
<v Speaker 4>glutathione which is soluble and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuses with the Lipid biolayer of the </v>

1283
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:48.090
<v Speaker 4>cell membrane and basically just gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken up.</v>

1284
01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.340
<v Speaker 4>And so then whatever's inside of it goes</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the cell.</v>

1285
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 4>They've shown in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've looked for studies to see,</v>

1286
01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:00.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lyposomal supplemental Lyposomal </v>

1287
01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how I like is it getting into </v>

1288
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:02.990
<v Speaker 4>tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it getting into the brain,</v>

1289
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:06.081
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's important and I haven't </v>

1290
01:04:06.081 --> 01:04:07.050
<v Speaker 4>found a lot of studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found one study that showed in rabbits</v>

1291
01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:12.051
<v Speaker 4>that were given oral glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oral liposomal glutathione were able to </v>

1292
01:04:12.051 --> 01:04:15.480
<v Speaker 4>increase the glutathione levels in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

1293
01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:16.860
<v Speaker 4>in their heart and also in the liver.</v>

1294
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.570
<v Speaker 4>But they were given a massive dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they were given 400 milligrams.</v>

1295
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:26.630
<v Speaker 4>And there are about 11 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's like six grams for like 180 </v>

1296
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:31.820
<v Speaker 4>pound man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Four hundred milligrams in the physical </v>

1297
01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.300
<v Speaker 4>form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what would you see?</v>

1298
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would it be,</v>

1299
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:37.390
<v Speaker 4>how many teaspoons would that be for </v>
<v Speaker 4>row?</v>

1300
01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:38.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1301
01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you'd have to look at.</v>

1302
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:45.590
<v Speaker 4>I think if it's in a teaspoon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tells you the like milligram content </v>

1303
01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:49.371
<v Speaker 4>per teaspoon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did look up online to see because I </v>

1304
01:04:49.371 --> 01:04:49.371
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to gave me some of this.</v>

1305
01:04:49.371 --> 01:04:53.720
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is that most of the </v>

1306
01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.010
<v Speaker 4>liposomal glutathione is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive and it's like between 100 </v>

1307
01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.990
<v Speaker 4>milligrams and 400 milligrams per dose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>per teaspoon or per capsule,</v>

1308
01:05:00.991 --> 01:05:04.130
<v Speaker 4>whatever they do to a rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave write a law.</v>

1309
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.850
<v Speaker 4>But a rabbit weighs 11 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Swallows it too.</v>

1310
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Aren't you supposed to hold it in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth?</v>

1311
01:05:09.301 --> 01:05:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Under your tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're,</v>

1312
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:11.420
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1313
01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:13.260
<v Speaker 4>they enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give it to the,</v>

1314
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 4>to the rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they inject it in their mouth.</v>

1315
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way I've been told to take the </v>

1316
01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.181
<v Speaker 4>lyposomal glutathione is to Tuck it </v>
<v Speaker 4>under your tongue or shorter under your </v>

1317
01:05:24.181 --> 01:05:27.751
<v Speaker 4>tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holding your mouth for 30 seconds and </v>

1318
01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:27.751
<v Speaker 4>then swallow it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make any sense at all?</v>

1319
01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 4>And now I have no idea how that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that would do,</v>

1320
01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:31.540
<v Speaker 4>but the idea of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

1321
01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:32.130
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1322
01:05:32.131 --> 01:05:37.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you supplement like Lyposomal </v>

1323
01:05:37.131 --> 01:05:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe actually you may be getting it </v>

1324
01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.231
<v Speaker 4>into your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of how much is it </v>

1325
01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:47.220
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do a dose response in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>study and if it wasn't so darn </v>

1326
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.851
<v Speaker 4>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's other ways to increase </v>

1327
01:05:50.851 --> 01:05:50.851
<v Speaker 4>glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>

1328
01:05:50.851 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 4>So taking supplemental glutathione in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the form of Lyposomal Glutathione,</v>

1329
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:57.470
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any other supplemental glutathione is </v>

1330
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.470
<v Speaker 4>just useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1331
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.970
<v Speaker 4>it's useless pill form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

1332
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:03.240
<v Speaker 4>I think they have liposome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have it in pill form with </v>

1333
01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:03.240
<v Speaker 4>letrozole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1334
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.680
<v Speaker 4>But it just has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Light is almost the point,</v>

1335
01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1336
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 4>If it's not lyposomal then you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even getting it passed the gut let alone</v>

1337
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:12.380
<v Speaker 4>into the cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1338
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other thing is,</v>

1339
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:15.940
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1340
01:06:15.941 --> 01:06:18.440
<v Speaker 4>so here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your suppliers,</v>

1341
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:21.730
<v Speaker 4>your yourselves with this lyposomal </v>
<v Speaker 4>glutathione,</v>

1342
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.940
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the enzyme that uses </v>

1343
01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.401
<v Speaker 4>glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glutathione peroxidase and these other </v>

1344
01:06:29.401 --> 01:06:29.401
<v Speaker 4>enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they decreased with age.</v>

1345
01:06:29.401 --> 01:06:31.400
<v Speaker 4>So while you're bypassing the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1346
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.660
<v Speaker 4>the decrease in the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Glutathione synthase,</v>

1347
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:40.110
<v Speaker 4>which is what makes glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not bypassing the decrease in </v>

1348
01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:43.960
<v Speaker 4>expression of this enzyme that uses it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's using gludethyon to do its thing.</v>

1349
01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:49.410
<v Speaker 4>So that's also important and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>other ways that you can actually </v>

1350
01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:52.180
<v Speaker 4>increase glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But just interestingly,</v>

1351
01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 4>I came across a study recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 2014,</v>

1352
01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:58.330
<v Speaker 4>very late,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was even just a couple months</v>

1353
01:06:58.330 --> 01:06:59.290
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1354
01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:04.291
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a traumatic brain injury study where </v>

1355
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.971
<v Speaker 4>they basically took mice and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>induced traumatic brain injury by like </v>

1356
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:11.310
<v Speaker 4>putting pressure on their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is they noticed that </v>

1357
01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:16.070
<v Speaker 4>the blood brain barrier is compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those things that I was talking </v>

1358
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:18.451
<v Speaker 4>about happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Water's flowing into the brain and saw </v>

1359
01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:20.140
<v Speaker 4>you and all that and activation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>immune function.</v>

1360
01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:25.141
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they found was that if they put </v>

1361
01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:25.141
<v Speaker 4>glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually,</v>

1362
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:30.180
<v Speaker 4>because I did a pressure now schools are</v>
<v Speaker 4>much thinner than a human's goals are </v>

1363
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 4>and if they did a pressure room to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouse school,</v>

1364
01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:35.020
<v Speaker 4>there was like a little tiny crack in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the skull and they could put glutathione</v>

1365
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:40.170
<v Speaker 4>on top topically where the crack is and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it would get through into the brain and </v>

1366
01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 4>what they found was that if they did it </v>
<v Speaker 4>within three hours of the injury,</v>

1367
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:49.590
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they abrogated like 70 percent of the </v>

1368
01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:49.590
<v Speaker 4>cell death.</v>

1369
01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 4>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing,</v>

1370
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.120
<v Speaker 4>but it was a three hour time window </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there will be done the humans.</v>

1371
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:56.650
<v Speaker 4>So I was wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1372
01:07:56.651 --> 01:07:59.650
<v Speaker 4>so the thing that's what got me on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole episomal trail,</v>

1373
01:07:59.651 --> 01:08:00.970
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we can't.</v>

1374
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't even know anything about the </v>

1375
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 4>human skull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we know about it,</v>

1376
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:11.041
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know whether or not you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>put something topically after a </v>

1377
01:08:11.041 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 4>traumatic injury and if it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get in there doing those studies.</v>

1378
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:13.210
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this was.</v>

1379
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.230
<v Speaker 4>This was actually a new discovery where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1380
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can</v>

1381
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>actually get through the skull and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

1382
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 1>at least under an injury's type </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1383
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So the idea would be that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>inject something into the skin on the </v>

1384
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>scalp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1385
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they injected it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1386
01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.530
<v Speaker 1>that go under the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the needle.</v>

1387
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>But whether or not that can be done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

1388
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1389
01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1390
01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:41.820
<v Speaker 1>humans have a much thicker skull then </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

1391
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.670
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1392
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1393
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to be testing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is,</v>

1394
01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1395
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:52.601
<v Speaker 1>well can you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key part of this study and my mind </v>

1396
01:08:52.601 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>was they inhibited that reactive oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>

1397
01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.140
<v Speaker 1>which is the instigator of this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>cascade,</v>

1398
01:09:00.141 --> 01:09:05.141
<v Speaker 1>this neuroinflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they went downstream and try to </v>

1399
01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:05.141
<v Speaker 1>inhibit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibit inflammation,</v>

1400
01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:07.100
<v Speaker 1>it didn't have the effect because those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were already activated.</v>

1401
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:12.310
<v Speaker 1>You already had sell dead cells because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the reactive oxygen species </v>

1402
01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:12.380
<v Speaker 1>starting it and causing the cell death.</v>

1403
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And that was how they were able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent like 70 percent of the cell </v>

1404
01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:17.510
<v Speaker 1>death by giving that topical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Glutathione.</v>

1405
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1406
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1407
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:25.361
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we've got to figure out how to do </v>

1408
01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:25.361
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1409
01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:25.361
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1410
01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1411
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.610
<v Speaker 1>there's other ways you can increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione.</v>

1412
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.330
<v Speaker 1>The light is almost one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how robust,</v>

1413
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:34.340
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that one study in rabbits,</v>

1414
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.640
<v Speaker 1>massive amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about like for 180 pound </v>

1415
01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.851
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't even know how much some of </v>

1416
01:09:42.851 --> 01:09:42.851
<v Speaker 1>these MMA fighters were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably weighed more than that.</v>

1417
01:09:42.851 --> 01:09:43.940
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>180 pound man,</v>

1418
01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:46.580
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about six grams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Liposomal Glutathione,</v>

1419
01:09:46.581 --> 01:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot significant amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1420
01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.690
<v Speaker 1>considering how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how costly is,</v>

1421
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it's just not economically feasible in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind on these.</v>

1422
01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 1>The holding it under the tongue I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen will be 12 of.</v>

1423
01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:00.360
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1424
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be 12 people.</v>

1425
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>It's sublingual that people do that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bypass the whole stomach acid thing.</v>

1426
01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:09.320
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1427
01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:14.321
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something I just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about with the Liposomal </v>

1428
01:10:14.321 --> 01:10:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sublingual means what,</v>

1429
01:10:14.861 --> 01:10:19.861
<v Speaker 1>what does that actually mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means holding it in under the </v>

1430
01:10:19.861 --> 01:10:19.861
<v Speaker 1>tongue is just the distribution method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1431
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>So to use lyposomal and use it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sublingual way to Tuck in under.</v>

1432
01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Does that make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it go into your blood that way?</v>

1433
01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1434
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it would be any </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than swallowing it,</v>

1435
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:40.390
<v Speaker 1>but don't waste my time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just be not thinking about </v>

1436
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>something that's obvious to me or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's just always time.</v>

1437
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:48.680
<v Speaker 1>There've been studies on that light bulb</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be 12 taken sublingually.</v>

1438
01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really read any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may have been studies on that,</v>

1439
01:10:52.821 --> 01:10:57.821
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked in the literature of </v>

1440
01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:57.821
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1441
01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:57.821
<v Speaker 1>I'll look it up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:10:57.821 --> 01:11:00.830
<v Speaker 1>So the other ways to increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I mentioned,</v>

1443
01:11:00.831 --> 01:11:05.831
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's genes that are glutathione </v>

1444
01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:07.810
<v Speaker 1>related genes and you can increase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of those genes were right </v>

1445
01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:11.141
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sublingual lyposomal glutathione shows </v>

1446
01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:11.420
<v Speaker 1>up in the first thing that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1447
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you Google sublingual lyposomal </v>

1448
01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>glutathione is the first thing that pops</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in Google.</v>

1449
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1450
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something I can certainly read </v>

1451
01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:27.620
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just off the top of my head,</v>

1452
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>can't think of why that would be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective at getting into yourself </v>

1453
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.440
<v Speaker 1>saying right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way to get significant amounts </v>

1454
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.760
<v Speaker 1>into your body is with lyposomal </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione supplements.</v>

1455
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either ivy or injection is the other </v>

1456
01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:44.410
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1457
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Injections another way.</v>

1458
01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And that all obviously bypasses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole intestinal absorption thing.</v>

1459
01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's interesting is they've done so</v>

1460
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:57.780
<v Speaker 1>other ways to increase glutathione would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1461
01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a turmeric.</v>

1462
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Turmeric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turmeric,</v>

1463
01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use that stuff.</v>

1464
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1465
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 1>they've shown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1466
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:10.190
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two different bioactive </v>

1467
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.141
<v Speaker 1>components in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the curcumin and that has.</v>

1468
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:14.040
<v Speaker 1>What that does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curcumin is,</v>

1469
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.300
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

1470
01:12:15.301 --> 01:12:20.301
<v Speaker 1>It gets into the brain and it's an anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has antioxidant activity itself aside </v>

1471
01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:25.911
<v Speaker 1>from Gludethyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also increases the expression of </v>

1472
01:12:25.911 --> 01:12:30.471
<v Speaker 1>all the good design related genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it turns on Glutathione Peroxidase,</v>

1473
01:12:30.991 --> 01:12:35.991
<v Speaker 1>glutathione synthase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another gene called Glutathione </v>

1474
01:12:35.991 --> 01:12:39.560
<v Speaker 1>reductase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually recycles glutathione </v>

1475
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.271
<v Speaker 1>that's already been used or oxidized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really cool because now you're </v>

1476
01:12:41.271 --> 01:12:43.620
<v Speaker 1>talking about ramping up the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione system.</v>

1477
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Like all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1478
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:47.810
<v Speaker 1>and this curcumin does this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1479
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.240
<v Speaker 1>and so there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done studies in mice where </v>

1480
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:56.691
<v Speaker 1>they've done know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tbi related studies for traumatic brain </v>

1481
01:12:56.691 --> 01:12:56.691
<v Speaker 1>injury where they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've given them,</v>

1482
01:12:56.691 --> 01:13:01.470
<v Speaker 1>they did intravenous and because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects of,</v>

1483
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:02.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1484
01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.710
<v Speaker 1>you basically metabolize curcumin </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

1485
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 40 minutes to an hour to say </v>

1486
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:10.470
<v Speaker 1>curcumin or cirque human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always Kirk Hubert human.</v>

1487
01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've said it wrong.</v>

1488
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.560
<v Speaker 1>What do you usually say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human.</v>

1489
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I think it's curcumin.</v>

1490
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just read it and try to understand.</v>

1491
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1492
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:30.100
<v Speaker 1>So America have heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual turmeric to Merck termer </v>

1493
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 1>tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an art.</v>

1494
01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:32.190
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are turmeric.</v>

1495
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Turmeric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1496
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 1>But whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not important to get good stuff.</v>

1497
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like curries,</v>

1498
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:41.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people using the curries,</v>

1499
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of antiinflammatories not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only anti-inflammatory,</v>

1500
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 1>it inhibits the activation of nf kappa </v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

1501
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:52.461
<v Speaker 1>which is like this gene that turns on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole variety of different genes </v>

1502
01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:57.021
<v Speaker 1>involved in inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like blunting the whole </v>

1503
01:13:57.021 --> 01:13:59.140
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory cascade and it activates </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the glutathione genes.</v>

1504
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.570
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has antioxidant activity itself,</v>

1505
01:14:03.571 --> 01:14:04.360
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1506
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a triple whammy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really cool.</v>

1507
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:11.060
<v Speaker 1>So curcumin is probably way better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking lyposomal glutathione,</v>

1508
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1509
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.150
<v Speaker 4>because maybe in synergistic for </v>
<v Speaker 4>synergistic.</v>

1510
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:21.151
<v Speaker 4>But the thing with Kirk curcumin is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is also rapidly metabolized because </v>

1511
01:14:21.151 --> 01:14:22.350
<v Speaker 4>it's a form it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1512
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.360
<v Speaker 4>biotic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means it's not a vitamin or a </v>

1513
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:27.360
<v Speaker 4>mineral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something foreign to the body,</v>

1514
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>polyphenols,</v>

1515
01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 4>EGC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gds from green tea,</v>

1516
01:14:29.501 --> 01:14:32.150
<v Speaker 4>all these things were the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of herbal academia,</v>

1517
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:37.500
<v Speaker 4>these are what are called xenobiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happens when you take a </v>

1518
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.310
<v Speaker 4>xenobiotic is it activates this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathway in the liver,</v>

1519
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 4>which is like the liver is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1520
01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:44.350
<v Speaker 4>there's this foreign thing in my body </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not supposed to be here.</v>

1521
01:14:44.351 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not a vitamin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a mineral.</v>

1522
01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to get rid of it.</v>

1523
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:49.810
<v Speaker 4>So it metabolize it's detoxifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1524
01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:50.910
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1525
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:56.130
<v Speaker 4>it gets metabolized rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's something in black pepper </v>

1526
01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 4>called piperine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Piperine.</v>

1527
01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:03.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That inhibits the nobody xenobiotic </v>

1528
01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:03.031
<v Speaker 4>metabolism.</v>

1529
01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:06.690
<v Speaker 4>So it's been shown in humans that if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>give a coworker curcumin and piperine </v>

1530
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:13.530
<v Speaker 4>that you can increase the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bioavailability of curcumin by 2000 </v>

1531
01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:15.820
<v Speaker 4>percent in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty significant.</v>

1532
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.100
<v Speaker 4>And so that's kind of cool because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1533
01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:23.130
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well of course I ordered some curcumin </v>

1534
01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:26.011
<v Speaker 4>with piperine and a tick for myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've got April before and it's </v>

1535
01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.960
<v Speaker 4>just a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1536
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:30.730
<v Speaker 4>but with traumatic brain injury they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>shown that,</v>

1537
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they gave it to a,</v>

1538
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 4>to mice to do it intravenously and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>give them like a really high dose,</v>

1539
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.670
<v Speaker 4>it prevents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1540
01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.000
<v Speaker 4>the whole inflammatory response to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>edema.</v>

1541
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.240
<v Speaker 4>Intercranial pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all that stuff is dramatically </v>

1542
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.120
<v Speaker 4>improved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is again,</v>

1543
01:15:46.121 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like a time window where it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1544
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few hours after the trauma,</v>

1545
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.050
<v Speaker 4>after the trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1546
01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think maybe even before,</v>

1547
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:57.490
<v Speaker 4>if you're already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you already have it in your system,</v>

1548
01:15:57.491 --> 01:16:00.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question is how much is it,</v>

1549
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.180
<v Speaker 4>is it going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1550
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.770
<v Speaker 4>prevent the acute immediate thing.</v>

1551
01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:09.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know to what degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least at the very least taking it</v>

1552
01:16:09.341 --> 01:16:14.341
<v Speaker 4>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about inhibiting some of </v>

1553
01:16:14.341 --> 01:16:15.310
<v Speaker 4>that neuroinflammatory cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that cycle.</v>

1554
01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:16.470
<v Speaker 4>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1555
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.850
<v Speaker 4>vicious because once you have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plaques forum,</v>

1556
01:16:18.851 --> 01:16:22.360
<v Speaker 4>which happens within hours after injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're talking about,</v>

1557
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it activating the whole cycle where it </v>

1558
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:27.680
<v Speaker 4>causes more and more years and years and</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1559
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.060
<v Speaker 4>So there's no negative repercussions to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take my other stuffing their.</v>

1560
01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in that study where they increased </v>

1561
01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:35.980
<v Speaker 4>the bioavailability by 2000 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no adverse side effects.</v>

1562
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:41.250
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since piperine inhibits xenobiotic </v>

1563
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:42.190
<v Speaker 4>metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>full force,</v>

1564
01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:43.470
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1565
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:48.500
<v Speaker 4>it's inhibiting this very generalized </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathway that's used to detoxify and get </v>

1566
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.270
<v Speaker 4>rid of all sorts of foreign things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even drugs like antibiotics,</v>

1567
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:53.230
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1568
01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:54.640
<v Speaker 4>your stands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you take.</v>

1569
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a concern like in my mind,</v>

1570
01:16:59.051 --> 01:17:01.300
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done a lot of reading on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1571
01:17:01.301 --> 01:17:06.301
<v Speaker 4>to see what's out there in literature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just from my understanding of the </v>

1572
01:17:06.301 --> 01:17:10.171
<v Speaker 4>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's you don't want to go crazy </v>

1573
01:17:10.171 --> 01:17:12.661
<v Speaker 4>because it's like if you're taking a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch other stuff because it's going to </v>

1574
01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 4>increase the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the half life of all sorts of,</v>

1575
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:19.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other xenobiotics which are just like I </v>

1576
01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:22.031
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of different herbal things or you </v>

1577
01:17:22.031 --> 01:17:22.031
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like curcumin and UGC,</v>

1578
01:17:22.031 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

1579
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 4>So there's always that potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1580
01:17:24.861 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 4>well what else are you taking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you increasing the half life of that</v>

1581
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:32.120
<v Speaker 4>too by taking this piperine with it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that doing?</v>

1582
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:37.540
<v Speaker 4>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should definitely be cautious in </v>

1583
01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:37.540
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that respect.</v>

1584
01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.680
<v Speaker 4>But don't take too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yet I haven't seen too much of it.</v>

1585
01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:43.220
<v Speaker 4>Like I know when I did some searching </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like the Tumeric,</v>

1586
01:17:43.221 --> 01:17:48.221
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is is that I like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tumeric and not just the curcumin </v>

1587
01:17:48.221 --> 01:17:51.701
<v Speaker 4>because there's another compound in </v>
<v Speaker 4>turmeric called tomorrow and aromatic </v>

1588
01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:58.780
<v Speaker 4>turnaround and a study just came out </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a couple of months ago on this </v>

1589
01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.650
<v Speaker 4>where it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

1590
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.800
<v Speaker 4>It does a lot of the same things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the curcumin does and that it inhibits </v>

1591
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.821
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does something in addition to </v>

1592
01:18:09.821 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually repairs brain damage because</v>

1593
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:15.970
<v Speaker 4>it causes the proliferation of neural </v>
<v Speaker 4>stem cells in your brain.</v>

1594
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 4>So I know it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was very robust.</v>

1595
01:18:18.891 --> 01:18:23.891
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two regions of the brain that </v>

1596
01:18:23.891 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 4>you can actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have neuro stem cells,</v>

1597
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.790
<v Speaker 4>which means you can make new neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've damaged neurons,</v>

1598
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 4>neurons have died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1599
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:35.291
<v Speaker 4>you want to replace those neurons and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two regions of the brain that </v>

1600
01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:38.621
<v Speaker 4>can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sub brand tricolor zone and the </v>

1601
01:18:38.621 --> 01:18:40.931
<v Speaker 4>dentate gyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so tomorrow actually causes the </v>

1602
01:18:40.931 --> 01:18:43.820
<v Speaker 4>polyphony ration of neural stem cells in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sub ventricular zone.</v>

1603
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 4>And to some degree when they're giving </v>
<v Speaker 4>these mice.</v>

1604
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:48.830
<v Speaker 4>I can't recall off the top of my head </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dose,</v>

1605
01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:53.831
<v Speaker 4>but they were giving him a pretty high </v>
<v Speaker 4>dose and what they found was that it </v>

1606
01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 4>increased the proliferation of them by </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1607
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60 percent,</v>

1608
01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.460
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty significant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A part of the problem with age is that,</v>

1609
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:03.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these neuro stem cells,</v>

1610
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:09.130
<v Speaker 4>they start to proliferate less and as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they start to proliferate less than you </v>

1611
01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:13.670
<v Speaker 4>have less of them being made and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>also have less a new neurons being made.</v>

1612
01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:18.670
<v Speaker 4>So net less neurogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you think about in the context of </v>

1613
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:19.160
<v Speaker 4>someone who's undergone a traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain injury,</v>

1614
01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 4>they have undergone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've had massive amounts of cell </v>

1615
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:24.950
<v Speaker 4>death occurring from that reactive </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen species from that inflammation.</v>

1616
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've lost neurons.</v>

1617
01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:27.290
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1618
01:19:27.370 --> 01:19:32.370
<v Speaker 4>that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you can have something that's </v>

1619
01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 4>boosting the proliferation of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuro stem cells,</v>

1620
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:38.410
<v Speaker 4>that's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just a great thing for people </v>

1621
01:19:38.410 --> 01:19:38.870
<v Speaker 4>that have had an injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great thing for just normal brain</v>

1622
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:40.020
<v Speaker 4>aging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1623
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.160
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also a great thing for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are susceptible to </v>

1624
01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.720
<v Speaker 4>neurogenic diseases like myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I have one of these April,</v>

1625
01:19:47.721 --> 01:19:48.910
<v Speaker 4>we four wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1626
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.310
<v Speaker 4>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1627
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:54.230
<v Speaker 4>I've got to be really careful because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't repair damage as well.</v>

1628
01:19:54.231 --> 01:19:57.590
<v Speaker 4>If I can make sure I grow new neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>

1629
01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.150
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good thing.</v>

1630
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.610
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know there was anything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could eat.</v>

1631
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.100
<v Speaker 4>The could help grow new neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd never heard of it.</v>

1632
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tomorrow is,</v>

1633
01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.980
<v Speaker 4>stimulates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulates the,</v>

1634
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 4>of</v>

1635
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:11.580
<v Speaker 1>the neuro stem cells in the suburban </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tricolor zone.</v>

1636
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1637
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:15.990
<v Speaker 1>this study was really came out like less</v>
<v Speaker 1>than two months ago.</v>

1638
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.970
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty incredible.</v>

1639
01:20:17.971 --> 01:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so you could get smarter for meeting</v>

1640
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.270
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did get smarter.</v>

1641
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.880
<v Speaker 1>They had improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1642
01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean take this with a grain of salt in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense where it's like the whole </v>

1643
01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.790
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability thing and humans and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much are we.</v>

1644
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>That's always the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1645
01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:33.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're giving mount mice,</v>

1646
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much higher dose and you know,</v>

1647
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.960
<v Speaker 1>so that it's like bypassing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all they're injecting it in </v>

1648
01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.930
<v Speaker 1>some cases so it's bypassing the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting absorbed.</v>

1649
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that it occurs is hopeful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>

1650
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:51.801
<v Speaker 1>well eventually we'll find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome some of the bioavailability </v>

1651
01:20:51.801 --> 01:20:51.801
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1652
01:20:51.801 --> 01:20:52.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of are.</v>

1653
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:57.820
<v Speaker 1>So is the Bio availability issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigated it all by a large dose is </v>

1654
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.750
<v Speaker 1>taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you recommend as a dose?</v>

1655
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Like a thousand milligram pills or what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have of turmeric?</v>

1656
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Well in the case of the Mouse Studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mitigated by a large dose that's </v>

1657
01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.500
<v Speaker 1>given intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need to start shooting.</v>

1658
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.370
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you shoot up turmeric?</v>

1659
01:21:14.410 --> 01:21:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1660
01:21:14.941 --> 01:21:17.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1661
01:21:17.191 --> 01:21:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1662
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:19.380
<v Speaker 1>and the question is they bought up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

1663
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:23.730
<v Speaker 1>the suppository.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have clinical trials that are,</v>

1664
01:21:23.731 --> 01:21:28.620
<v Speaker 1>they're doing now with people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's or people that have dementia</v>

1665
01:21:28.621 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1666
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:34.280
<v Speaker 1>early dementia science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing this with a tumeric and I </v>

1667
01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 1>hope they use piperine also are using </v>
<v Speaker 1>depositories or there might just,</v>

1668
01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're using because </v>

1669
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of studies have come out recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a different,</v>

1670
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:46.101
<v Speaker 1>in different model organisms where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've looked at worms and flies and </v>

1671
01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.060
<v Speaker 1>mice and they're and they have all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different neurodegenerative,</v>

1672
01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of models where they look and study</v>

1673
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and they find hands down this</v>
<v Speaker 1>tumeric is doing some cool shit.</v>

1674
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

1675
01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:01.550
<v Speaker 1>And these studies are the administering </v>
<v Speaker 1>it orally or the using injectables if </v>

1676
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:07.910
<v Speaker 1>talking about mice then there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them have been injectable and this is </v>

1677
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:09.060
<v Speaker 1>where the studies are coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these aren't on humans yet,</v>

1678
01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.660
<v Speaker 1>but they did get smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that they did it to,</v>

1679
01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.280
<v Speaker 1>that got smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

1680
01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:17.370
<v Speaker 1>So the people and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were mice.</v>

1681
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>The mice get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouse performed better on learning </v>

1682
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>and memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1683
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1684
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:23.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's see,</v>

1685
01:22:23.731 --> 01:22:28.731
<v Speaker 1>what was the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another interesting thing </v>

1686
01:22:28.731 --> 01:22:28.731
<v Speaker 1>about the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1687
01:22:28.731 --> 01:22:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I know what I wanted to bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1688
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I got sort of sidetracked when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the neural stem cells that</v>

1689
01:22:34.351 --> 01:22:39.351
<v Speaker 1>are in the brand tricolor zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really interesting about this is </v>

1690
01:22:39.351 --> 01:22:39.351
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1691
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:44.090
<v Speaker 1>they readily go to the olfactory bulb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no smell,</v>

1692
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.100
<v Speaker 1>so their sense of smell is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of Alzheimer's disease and </v>

1693
01:22:49.651 --> 01:22:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's disease and even just all </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused mortality.</v>

1694
01:22:52.381 --> 01:22:57.381
<v Speaker 1>Like literally you can have decreased </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of smell and you know,</v>

1695
01:22:57.690 --> 01:22:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it can be a good predictor of your next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1696
01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.630
<v Speaker 1>five year mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1697
01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this sense of smell such</v>

1698
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.460
<v Speaker 4>a good predictor of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1699
01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.060
<v Speaker 4>people that are going to get Alzheimer's</v>
<v Speaker 4>soon.</v>

1700
01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:14.560
<v Speaker 4>Also people that may just die soon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>re we're finding out again,</v>

1701
01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:19.561
<v Speaker 4>just recently within the past couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>months that the olfactory bulb requires </v>

1702
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:25.231
<v Speaker 4>a constant supply of neural stem cells </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the olfactory neurons which are </v>

1703
01:23:25.231 --> 01:23:30.001
<v Speaker 4>in your factory bulb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just right in front of your </v>

1704
01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:31.801
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those neurons which are responsible for </v>

1705
01:23:31.801 --> 01:23:31.801
<v Speaker 4>smelling things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1706
01:23:31.801 --> 01:23:32.410
<v Speaker 4>and they send signals to the brain so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can,</v>

1707
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience it,</v>

1708
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:36.970
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They require a constant supply of neural</v>

1709
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:39.280
<v Speaker 4>stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is coming from the sub ventricular</v>

1710
01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 4>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1711
01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you start to,</v>

1712
01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:47.930
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have that process diminish where you </v>

1713
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:49.330
<v Speaker 4>can't supply those new stem cells to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>olfactory bulb,</v>

1714
01:23:49.331 --> 01:23:54.331
<v Speaker 4>your sense of smell goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why also it's a predictor </v>

1715
01:23:54.331 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 4>of Alzheimer's because you're literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>losing the ability to know,</v>

1716
01:23:56.770 --> 01:24:00.610
<v Speaker 4>don't people are born with people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>born with a terrible sense of smell.</v>

1717
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.640
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're not making neural stem </v>

1718
01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.130
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So please don't freak out.</v>

1719
01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:08.860
<v Speaker 4>Like there's other reasons why you </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot have a good sense of smell.</v>

1720
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.580
<v Speaker 4>The reason this was impacting me right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now is because I know people who've been</v>

1721
01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 4>knocked out and lost their sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>smell.</v>

1722
01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1723
01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.520
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

1724
01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1725
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1726
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:22.360
<v Speaker 4>the tomorrow and that was given to these</v>
<v Speaker 4>mindset,</v>

1727
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:24.220
<v Speaker 4>improve their sense of smell and </v>
<v Speaker 4>improved.</v>

1728
01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1729
01:24:24.821 --> 01:24:26.190
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1730
01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 4>there's another thing also with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuro stem cell.</v>

1731
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:32.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've known for some time that this sense</v>

1732
01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:36.160
<v Speaker 4>of smell is a good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's.</v>

1733
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:41.580
<v Speaker 4>But in just until I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't understand why and this </v>

1734
01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.061
<v Speaker 4>whole understanding the neuro stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 4>being having to replace it like </v>

1735
01:24:45.061 --> 01:24:47.020
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's literally like marker.</v>

1736
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:50.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like a marker for brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain's ability to repair damage in</v>

1737
01:24:50.831 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 4>your brain.</v>

1738
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:56.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember last time I was on the </v>

1739
01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:58.360
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned that study where they gave</v>

1740
01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:02.170
<v Speaker 4>young blood to old mice and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially made them again,</v>

1741
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.110
<v Speaker 4>well I'm going to bring this back to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nose.</v>

1742
01:25:04.111 --> 01:25:07.570
<v Speaker 4>So I became very interested in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>study.</v>

1743
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:12.630
<v Speaker 4>And so essentially what they found is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is something in the blood </v>

1744
01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 4>that secreted in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's in the plasma actually,</v>

1745
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:20.230
<v Speaker 4>and it's called a growth differentiation</v>
<v Speaker 4>factor 11.</v>

1746
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 4>And it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's made.</v>

1747
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:27.850
<v Speaker 4>It's made more readily in young blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it decreases with age,</v>

1748
01:25:27.851 --> 01:25:32.851
<v Speaker 4>like everything does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is this growth </v>

1749
01:25:32.851 --> 01:25:33.790
<v Speaker 4>differentiation factor 11 goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

1750
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:38.820
<v Speaker 4>goes to the muscle and it stimulates </v>
<v Speaker 4>stem cell proliferation and it does it </v>

1751
01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 4>in the separate ventricular zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when they gave it,</v>

1752
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:43.900
<v Speaker 4>like they did this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they did it in mice,</v>

1753
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.240
<v Speaker 4>what they found was that the mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mice,</v>

1754
01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are tissues were less age,</v>

1755
01:25:47.681 --> 01:25:52.681
<v Speaker 4>the only way you can reverse tissue </v>
<v Speaker 4>aging in that to that degree has got to </v>

1756
01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:56.530
<v Speaker 4>be related to stem cells because when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you already have all this damage,</v>

1757
01:25:56.531 --> 01:26:01.531
<v Speaker 4>like the only way you're going to repair</v>
<v Speaker 4>that damage is by replacing and </v>

1758
01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:02.560
<v Speaker 4>replenishing that population with new </v>
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>

1759
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.240
<v Speaker 4>And because as we age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to do that,</v>

1760
01:26:05.241 --> 01:26:10.241
<v Speaker 4>our stem cell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability proliferation decreases and </v>

1761
01:26:10.241 --> 01:26:10.241
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff decreases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't do it as well.</v>

1762
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:11.570
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1763
01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 4>the more reactive oxygen species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get them more.</v>

1764
01:26:13.641 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Those cells start dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fact that you know,</v>

1765
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:23.110
<v Speaker 4>these tissues were able to reverse the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aging was really,</v>

1766
01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:28.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously indicative of stem cells when </v>

1767
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:28.220
<v Speaker 4>they found was indeed this growth </v>
<v Speaker 4>differentiation factor is in the plasma.</v>

1768
01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:31.910
<v Speaker 4>More bits and young people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>causing the proliferation of neural stem</v>

1769
01:26:31.911 --> 01:26:34.130
<v Speaker 4>cells and the stubborn tricolor zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also in muscle.</v>

1770
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:37.550
<v Speaker 4>What they found was they could even </v>
<v Speaker 4>isolate that growth differentiation,</v>

1771
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:40.570
<v Speaker 4>differentiation factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1772
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.040
<v Speaker 4>inject it into old mice and you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the same effect,</v>

1773
01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:47.000
<v Speaker 4>which is really cool because that gives </v>
<v Speaker 4>hope for isolating it in for,</v>

1774
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically people using it as a source to</v>

1775
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.910
<v Speaker 4>stimulate proliferation of stem cells.</v>

1776
01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.960
<v Speaker 4>And there's actually a clinical trial </v>
<v Speaker 4>that started this month at Stanford </v>

1777
01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.200
<v Speaker 4>where they are injecting plasma from </v>
<v Speaker 4>young individuals that are younger than </v>

1778
01:27:02.391 --> 01:27:06.860
<v Speaker 4>30 and they're giving them to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>with mild Alzheimer's,</v>

1779
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:08.990
<v Speaker 4>older people with mild Alzheimer's and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to check the,</v>

1780
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:11.300
<v Speaker 4>the cognitive effects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1781
01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:14.180
<v Speaker 4>immediately after and also longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1782
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:16.040
<v Speaker 4>but the whole stem cell thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nose.</v>

1783
01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:21.110
<v Speaker 4>And it's very interesting how it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the nose that stem cells,</v>

1784
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:27.610
<v Speaker 4>neural stem cell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more capacity to make more of them can </v>

1785
01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:27.610
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1786
01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:33.100
<v Speaker 4>you can see the status of that by your </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of smell and the fact that you've </v>

1787
01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:39.940
<v Speaker 4>observed fighters that have had </v>
<v Speaker 4>decreased sense of smell that is </v>

1788
01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:39.940
<v Speaker 4>alarming.</v>

1789
01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one guy named Gary,</v>

1790
01:27:39.971 --> 01:27:44.971
<v Speaker 3>good rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a real veteran mixed martial arts </v>

1791
01:27:44.971 --> 01:27:47.020
<v Speaker 3>fighter who was around during the early </v>
<v Speaker 3>days of the UFC and he fought in k,</v>

1792
01:27:47.021 --> 01:27:49.000
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought in pride.</v>

1793
01:27:49.001 --> 01:27:54.001
<v Speaker 3>He's like kind of a legendary mixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts character and he's dealing </v>

1794
01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:57.360
<v Speaker 3>with some pretty significant traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain injury now from,</v>

1795
01:27:57.390 --> 01:28:01.330
<v Speaker 3>from years and years of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the issues that he had</v>

1796
01:28:01.331 --> 01:28:05.410
<v Speaker 3>and he lost his sense of smell and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes total sense what you're saying.</v>

1797
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1798
01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1799
01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.390
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1800
01:28:09.391 --> 01:28:10.440
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1801
01:28:11.290 --> 01:28:16.290
<v Speaker 4>the April we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fourth thing is something I think is </v>

1802
01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:18.441
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really significant and I think that </v>

1803
01:28:18.441 --> 01:28:21.180
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've shown it with traumatic brain </v>

1804
01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:21.630
<v Speaker 4>injury from car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've shown it with stroke,</v>

1805
01:28:21.631 --> 01:28:25.770
<v Speaker 4>they shown it in boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that having one of those deals,</v>

1806
01:28:25.771 --> 01:28:30.090
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about a tenfold increased</v>
<v Speaker 4>risk of screwing up your brain.</v>

1807
01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:35.230
<v Speaker 3>You think that that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they should screen for when they give </v>

1808
01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 3>someone a license to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if I were a fighter,</v>

1809
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I would want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd want to know my risk and you're,</v>

1810
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:46.100
<v Speaker 3>you're completely missing the psychology</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a fighter.</v>

1811
01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Fighters feel invulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea of a fighter is that </v>

1812
01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:51.220
<v Speaker 3>everybody else is going to get fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1813
01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:52.970
<v Speaker 3>but not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be different.</v>

1814
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to rise above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a championships,</v>

1815
01:28:55.491 --> 01:28:57.680
<v Speaker 3>heart champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>champion's heart,</v>

1816
01:28:57.681 --> 01:29:02.681
<v Speaker 3>champion's mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get through things that </v>

1817
01:29:02.681 --> 01:29:02.681
<v Speaker 3>other people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not</v>

1818
01:29:02.681 --> 01:29:03.120
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to.</v>

1819
01:29:03.121 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 1>If you have an April,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we for a little weird.</v>

1820
01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing science into the world </v>

1822
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:11.410
<v Speaker 1>of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1823
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I would love for that to happen because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about possibly changing </v>

1824
01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>the lives of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1825
01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:21.710
<v Speaker 1>25 percent of fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighters would still want to fight a </v>

1826
01:29:21.710 --> 01:29:23.830
<v Speaker 1>guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You a good majority of them.</v>

1827
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I still want to fight and they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>just say,</v>

1828
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:27.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>across our bridge when I come to it,</v>

1829
01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:29.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I start feeling the difference,</v>

1830
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.880
<v Speaker 3>but the real issue is once you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling the issues,</v>

1831
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:37.910
<v Speaker 3>you've only touched the tip of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>iceberg of the amount of damage that </v>

1832
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.910
<v Speaker 3>you've actually</v>

1833
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:38.320
<v Speaker 1>correct actually acquired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1834
01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:43.150
<v Speaker 1>And once you start becoming symptomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense where your memory,</v>

1835
01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:48.210
<v Speaker 1>short term memory becomes affected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what we were talking about with </v>

1836
01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:51.031
<v Speaker 1>denny and our friend that is typical of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1837
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:57.270
<v Speaker 1>a 80 year old human being that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquired 80 years of inflammatory </v>

1838
01:29:59.471 --> 01:30:01.540
<v Speaker 1>reactive oxygen species damage in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

1839
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start to see those symptoms.</v>

1840
01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember there was a story a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>years back of a football player.</v>

1841
01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the football player?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fell off the truck,</v>

1842
01:30:10.751 --> 01:30:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He jumped Henry,</v>

1843
01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Chris Henry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1844
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.370
<v Speaker 3>He was involved in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispute with his girlfriend or his wife,</v>

1845
01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:23.980
<v Speaker 3>forget which one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she took off with his truck and he </v>

1846
01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.730
<v Speaker 3>chased her and jumped on the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>truck and fell and fell off the truck </v>

1847
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:28.900
<v Speaker 3>while she speeding down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cracked his head open,</v>

1848
01:30:28.901 --> 01:30:33.901
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a autopsy on him and found out </v>

1849
01:30:33.901 --> 01:30:38.341
<v Speaker 3>that he had the brain of a 70 something </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old Alzheimer's Alzheimer's </v>

1850
01:30:38.341 --> 01:30:40.270
<v Speaker 3>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was in his twenties,</v>

1851
01:30:41.230 --> 01:30:42.450
<v Speaker 3>wasn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Find out how old he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1853
01:30:43.641 --> 01:30:43.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1854
01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:48.951
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he was 28 years old and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had me.</v>

1855
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:54.390
<v Speaker 3>This is a guy who had not expressed any </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues as far as like there's a bunch of</v>

1856
01:30:55.871 --> 01:31:00.871
<v Speaker 3>different athletes now that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and there has been an hbo real </v>

1857
01:31:00.871 --> 01:31:04.321
<v Speaker 3>sports piece that they just did this </v>
<v Speaker 3>past weekend that I watched about </v>

1858
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:08.970
<v Speaker 3>football players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent expression that they're directly</v>

1859
01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.820
<v Speaker 3>relating to this traumatic brain injury </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're suffering from football.</v>

1860
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:14.800
<v Speaker 3>But this young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>26,</v>

1861
01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:19.801
<v Speaker 3>26,</v>
<v Speaker 3>26 and he had see if you can find the </v>

1862
01:31:19.801 --> 01:31:20.290
<v Speaker 3>article about him having.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it,</v>

1863
01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.230
<v Speaker 3>does it say he had about his brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

1864
01:31:23.530 --> 01:31:28.530
<v Speaker 3>There was an article where they did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>autopsy on her research is find brain </v>

1865
01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:29.350
<v Speaker 3>trauma and Henry Twenty six years old.</v>

1866
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Chronic and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that.</v>

1867
01:31:34.131 --> 01:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Encephalopathic encephalopathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1868
01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Well there's multiple things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up that is to say we could </v>

1869
01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:50.230
<v Speaker 1>discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one is definitely the </v>

1870
01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:53.351
<v Speaker 1>accelerated brain aging that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the repeated traumatic events where</v>

1871
01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:55.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's doing that</v>

1872
01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:58.240
<v Speaker 3>school football,</v>
<v Speaker 3>college football and the pros.</v>

1873
01:31:58.510 --> 01:32:00.370
<v Speaker 3>You're just into things</v>

1874
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.200
<v Speaker 1>like a good chunk of your life and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1875
01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:08.480
<v Speaker 1>and I did see one press release or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>article that was like 74 at a 76 or </v>

1876
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:15.210
<v Speaker 1>something like nfl players or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat,</v>

1877
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.920
<v Speaker 1>don't quote me on those statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something that was very,</v>

1878
01:32:17.921 --> 01:32:22.921
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like 90 percent of them had a </v>

1879
01:32:22.921 --> 01:32:26.551
<v Speaker 1>Beta amyloid Beta plaques in their brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Tau tangles in the brain that were </v>

1880
01:32:26.551 --> 01:32:28.360
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy six out of 79.</v>

1881
01:32:28.361 --> 01:32:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is post post death postmortem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1882
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:33.010
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1883
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:35.290
<v Speaker 1>That's depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's after birth.</v>

1884
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 1>She gave birth because they asked me if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was mad.</v>

1885
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how they got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1886
01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.910
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1887
01:32:44.911 --> 01:32:45.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1888
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:50.870
<v Speaker 1>the other really interesting thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this traumatic brain injury is the </v>

1889
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:53.290
<v Speaker 1>effects on behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned you ran over there,</v>

1890
01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.970
<v Speaker 1>he ran chase chase car and jumped on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck and go off of it.</v>

1891
01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That's impulsive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1892
01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:02.830
<v Speaker 1>that's like not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a normal thing.</v>

1893
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:07.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't just chase after a truck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to jump on it while it's moving </v>

1894
01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:11.760
<v Speaker 1>athletes and fighters and like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really common,</v>

1895
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:17.130
<v Speaker 1>like the sort of impulsive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super common for fighters so.</v>

1896
01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are definitely.</v>

1897
01:33:18.371 --> 01:33:20.890
<v Speaker 1>There's one aspect of the fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1898
01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1899
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:22.560
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:33:22.650 --> 01:33:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of.</v>

1901
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 1>It's also what leads you to do that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place is you have this ability</v>

1902
01:33:27.671 --> 01:33:31.020
<v Speaker 1>to do like a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1903
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I think before they ever got any brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage whatsoever.</v>

1904
01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:38.940
<v Speaker 1>They're impulsive people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what led them to do fighting in </v>

1905
01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1906
01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:40.670
<v Speaker 1>You think that was part of the civil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1907
01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm guessing she certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1908
01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on my own life,</v>

1909
01:33:44.730 --> 01:33:45.490
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know.</v>

1910
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1911
01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:52.020
<v Speaker 1>people so impulsive behavior that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to impulsive aggression,</v>

1912
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:57.520
<v Speaker 1>that can be self directed like suicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>or self harming.</v>

1913
01:33:57.521 --> 01:33:59.680
<v Speaker 1>It can also be like aggressive towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

1914
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Impulsive behavior can be like not </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm planning where you're just not.</v>

1915
01:34:04.721 --> 01:34:07.100
<v Speaker 1>You're not weighing out all the possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1916
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:09.640
<v Speaker 1>events that can occur and what's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to happen or not.</v>

1917
01:34:09.641 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just impulsively do something.</v>

1918
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:17.340
<v Speaker 1>There are polymorphisms that are related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to serotonin related genes that are </v>

1919
01:34:17.891 --> 01:34:22.891
<v Speaker 1>associated with that because Saratonin </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays a very important role in </v>

1920
01:34:22.891 --> 01:34:27.421
<v Speaker 1>regulating impulsivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people that are already genetically </v>

1921
01:34:27.521 --> 01:34:30.280
<v Speaker 1>predisposed because they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>polymorphism.</v>

1922
01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gene variant that I was describing </v>

1923
01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:37.291
<v Speaker 1>earlier when I talked about a pui,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a gene variant in serotonin </v>

1924
01:34:37.291 --> 01:34:41.731
<v Speaker 1>synthesis gene or in the release </v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin release or on the transporter </v>

1925
01:34:41.731 --> 01:34:42.070
<v Speaker 1>on the receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1926
01:34:42.071 --> 01:34:46.840
<v Speaker 1>they've shown that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associations with these and impulsivity.</v>

1927
01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:52.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saratonin is one of the things that </v>

1928
01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:55.351
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this before on the </v>

1929
01:34:55.351 --> 01:34:55.351
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1930
01:34:55.351 --> 01:34:58.230
<v Speaker 1>you can deplete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have Saratonin by taking away </v>

1931
01:34:58.230 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 1>their trip to fan and become impulsive</v>

1932
01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 4>and they become impulsive in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>impulsive,</v>

1933
01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:03.270
<v Speaker 4>aggressive things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1934
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:08.290
<v Speaker 4>when they do sorts of tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly because what's </v>

1935
01:35:08.290 --> 01:35:10.880
<v Speaker 4>happening is behavioral disinhibition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Behavioral disinhibition is,</v>

1936
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're signaling that's happening.</v>

1937
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:16.790
<v Speaker 4>That's going on from the orbital frontal</v>
<v Speaker 4>cortex part of the brain,</v>

1938
01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:21.791
<v Speaker 4>and it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's signaling to other regions of the </v>

1939
01:35:21.791 --> 01:35:21.791
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the Amygdala,</v>

1940
01:35:21.791 --> 01:35:25.421
<v Speaker 4>and I don't understand exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 4>serotonin does this or what his specific</v>

1941
01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:31.421
<v Speaker 4>role is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to really dig into two more </v>

1942
01:35:31.421 --> 01:35:34.781
<v Speaker 4>neuroscience for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that it does play a very </v>

1943
01:35:34.781 --> 01:35:36.680
<v Speaker 4>important role in that when you take </v>
<v Speaker 4>away the Serotonin disinhibition occurs,</v>

1944
01:35:36.681 --> 01:35:40.640
<v Speaker 4>which means disinhibition means now </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually you're having inhibitory signals</v>

1945
01:35:40.641 --> 01:35:41.480
<v Speaker 4>happen that say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1946
01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't just go out and do something </v>

1947
01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:46.920
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1948
01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it and your brain knows </v>

1949
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 4>that and there's certain signals that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1950
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 4>When you take away Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those signals go away.</v>

1951
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:57.290
<v Speaker 4>And so now that inhibitory signal isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1952
01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something that I,</v>

1953
01:36:00.411 --> 01:36:02.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was doing some reading on some of</v>

1954
01:36:02.391 --> 01:36:07.391
<v Speaker 4>these nfl players that have gone crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and committed suicide.</v>

1955
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:13.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>junior sale I think is one who shot </v>

1956
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.770
<v Speaker 4>himself in the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1957
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:16.850
<v Speaker 4>because he specifically wanted his brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be examined,</v>

1958
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:20.030
<v Speaker 4>examined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was another football player,</v>

1959
01:36:20.031 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't recall his name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he also committed suicide.</v>

1960
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:25.970
<v Speaker 4>I think he shot himself in his heart as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1961
01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.200
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a pro wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1962
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:32.930
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he liked it,</v>

1963
01:36:32.931 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 4>a murder suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these are all,</v>

1964
01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:41.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's probably multiple things going </v>

1965
01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:41.170
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1966
01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:41.540
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the orbital frontal cortex.</v>

1967
01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.120
<v Speaker 4>So that plays a very important role in </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibitory actions.</v>

1968
01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.450
<v Speaker 4>But when things start to get messed up </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that region of the brain,</v>

1969
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:50.180
<v Speaker 4>including the Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think,</v>

1970
01:36:50.181 --> 01:36:53.240
<v Speaker 4>like I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the inflammation in the brain.</v>

1971
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.580
<v Speaker 4>When you generate a two series </v>
<v Speaker 4>prostoglandins,</v>

1972
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 4>which happens when there's inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the brain,</v>

1973
01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.260
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've shown,</v>

1974
01:37:00.261 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 4>they've shown this in many different </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies in mice.</v>

1975
01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:05.930
<v Speaker 4>You inhibit the release of Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you take that,</v>

1976
01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:06.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1977
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:11.890
<v Speaker 4>in of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're talking about not having as </v>

1978
01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:13.580
<v Speaker 4>much of that Serotonin plus the damage </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the orbital frontal cortex.</v>

1979
01:37:13.581 --> 01:37:18.581
<v Speaker 4>And all these things are compounding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about like just massive </v>

1980
01:37:18.581 --> 01:37:22.031
<v Speaker 4>changes in behavior that are occurring </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then on top of that you may have </v>

1981
01:37:22.101 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 4>someone that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

1982
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:28.130
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go into these sorts of sports for a</v>

1983
01:37:28.131 --> 01:37:29.390
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're already impulsive,</v>

1984
01:37:29.391 --> 01:37:34.391
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking to people that may </v>

1985
01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:35.651
<v Speaker 4>already be genetically predisposed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they may already have some sort of </v>

1986
01:37:35.651 --> 01:37:40.630
<v Speaker 4>alteration in their serotonin function </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now they're depleting their </v>

1987
01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:45.281
<v Speaker 4>serotonin release on top of that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got damage to their orbital </v>

1988
01:37:45.281 --> 01:37:48.281
<v Speaker 4>frontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like these things are compounding </v>

1989
01:37:48.281 --> 01:37:50.741
<v Speaker 4>to cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just total impulsive behavior and you </v>

1990
01:37:50.741 --> 01:37:50.810
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they become aggressive and they do</v>

1991
01:37:50.811 --> 01:37:55.811
<v Speaker 4>crazy things that they normally </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise wouldn't do because they'd </v>

1992
01:37:55.811 --> 01:37:55.811
<v Speaker 4>have that impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1993
01:37:55.811 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd</v>

1994
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 1>have an inhibitory signal saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1995
01:37:58.021 --> 01:37:59.160
<v Speaker 1>don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do this.</v>

1996
01:37:59.930 --> 01:38:01.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1997
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very damaging in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>respects of changing the behavior of </v>

1998
01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:10.311
<v Speaker 1>these people to where they just become </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more impulsive and aggressive and </v>

1999
01:38:10.771 --> 01:38:11.460
<v Speaker 1>they're already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2000
01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.750
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the case of fighters,</v>

2001
01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:15.060
<v Speaker 1>they're already fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already a culture thing,</v>

2002
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2003
01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2004
01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>it's something very interesting with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin system also in the interaction</v>

2005
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:26.850
<v Speaker 1>between inflammation and Serotonin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've even shown the opposite,</v>

2006
01:38:26.851 --> 01:38:31.851
<v Speaker 1>like when you take people and you give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them an acute dose of like an Ssri and </v>

2007
01:38:33.181 --> 01:38:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you flood the brain with Serotonin just </v>
<v Speaker 1>acutely just for like,</v>

2008
01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:41.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of hours people become more </v>

2009
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:43.380
<v Speaker 1>adverse to harming others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you do give them a,</v>

2010
01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

2011
01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:49.130
<v Speaker 1>one of those questionnaire things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become more adverse to harming </v>

2012
01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:52.390
<v Speaker 1>others even at the expense of saving </v>
<v Speaker 1>other more people.</v>

2013
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so serotonin is somehow regulating these</v>

2014
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:58.980
<v Speaker 1>types of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2015
01:38:58.981 --> 01:39:03.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's neuroscientists and </v>

2016
01:39:03.981 --> 01:39:06.501
<v Speaker 1>philosophers and all this that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this research and trying to understand </v>

2017
01:39:06.501 --> 01:39:10.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense so that happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would be more kind and less </v>

2018
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.401
<v Speaker 1>likely to harm others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've found personally that people </v>

2019
01:39:13.401 --> 01:39:15.510
<v Speaker 1>that are most oppressed or the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to fucking slash and burn those,</v>

2020
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 1>those are the people that want to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody down with them.</v>

2021
01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:21.330
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the people that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed that are looking to make other</v>

2022
01:39:21.331 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 1>people feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2023
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I think happiness is a is a component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think the impulsivity is </v>

2024
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 1>another component that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that Serotonin,</v>

2025
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:35.270
<v Speaker 1>if that really is what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that giving someone a large dose of </v>

2026
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:39.471
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin would actually make them less </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to want to harm other people.</v>

2027
01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty significant thing.</v>

2028
01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

2029
01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.260
<v Speaker 1>that study was published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2030
01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:51.000
<v Speaker 1>like 2010 or so I think and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking into,</v>

2031
01:39:51.001 --> 01:39:52.740
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a lot of follow up studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>

2032
01:39:52.741 --> 01:39:57.741
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between giving </v>

2033
01:39:57.741 --> 01:39:59.871
<v Speaker 1>someone an acute dose of Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flooding their brain and doing it </v>

2034
01:39:59.871 --> 01:39:59.970
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2035
01:39:59.971 --> 01:40:04.971
<v Speaker 1>because when you're constantly doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's feedback loops and you </v>

2036
01:40:04.971 --> 01:40:06.750
<v Speaker 1>start to decrease the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin receptors and the Bra.</v>

2037
01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's so,</v>

2038
01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

2039
01:40:09.091 --> 01:40:14.091
<v Speaker 1>it's just the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to understand is </v>

2040
01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:16.220
<v Speaker 1>what is serotonin doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it that by giving someone a </v>

2041
01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:20.391
<v Speaker 1>huge dose of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become more adverse to harming </v>

2042
01:40:20.391 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 1>others and I don't know the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2043
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like there'd be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2044
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2045
01:40:24.571 --> 01:40:29.571
<v Speaker 1>if your Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of its function is to promote </v>

2046
01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:29.620
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2047
01:40:29.621 --> 01:40:34.621
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of the reasons why Ssri or</v>
<v Speaker 1>termed antidepressants because people </v>

2048
01:40:34.621 --> 01:40:37.600
<v Speaker 1>who are on depressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take these regulators are serotonin</v>

2049
01:40:37.601 --> 01:40:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and gives them a big uptake in it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then Ooh,</v>

2050
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:43.770
<v Speaker 1>they feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's as clear cut,</v>

2051
01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 1>but it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2052
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm simplifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does affect mood.</v>

2053
01:40:48.631 --> 01:40:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

2054
01:40:49.051 --> 01:40:50.450
<v Speaker 1>You do feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2055
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've shown also the Serotonin,</v>

2056
01:40:52.690 --> 01:40:54.350
<v Speaker 1>a Ssri</v>

2057
01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.170
<v Speaker 4>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain like you pain,</v>

2058
01:40:56.171 --> 01:41:01.171
<v Speaker 4>so you actually feel less pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not just a matter of feeling </v>

2059
01:41:01.171 --> 01:41:04.621
<v Speaker 4>happier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also a matter of not feeling as </v>

2060
01:41:04.621 --> 01:41:07.351
<v Speaker 4>much pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's similar pathways between </v>

2061
01:41:07.351 --> 01:41:07.351
<v Speaker 4>physical pain and social pain.</v>

2062
01:41:07.351 --> 01:41:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who had depression </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues and before being on Ssri,</v>

2063
01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 3>he was like really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck everybody,</v>

2064
01:41:15.491 --> 01:41:20.491
<v Speaker 3>fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like he would say horrible things </v>

2065
01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:20.980
<v Speaker 3>about people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once he got on the antidepressants,</v>

2066
01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:24.580
<v Speaker 3>all that went away now couldn't care </v>
<v Speaker 3>less what other people do.</v>

2067
01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't care less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who cares?</v>

2068
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Like someone's doing something bad or </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone saying something bad or </v>

2069
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:31.680
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2070
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just doesn't bother me.</v>

2071
01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to harm that person.</v>

2072
01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:38.050
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a complete shift in his mindset.</v>

2073
01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin does affect that,</v>

2074
01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:41.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that aggressiveness,</v>

2075
01:41:42.210 --> 01:41:42.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

2076
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2077
01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.620
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely playing a role.</v>

2078
01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more of a lash out sort of a thing,</v>

2079
01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:52.300
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the issues with depression is </v>

2080
01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:55.070
<v Speaker 3>that people that are depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that do have depression issues,</v>

2081
01:41:55.071 --> 01:42:00.071
<v Speaker 3>they kind of want to bring other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>into their world almost like they feel </v>

2082
01:42:00.071 --> 01:42:02.660
<v Speaker 3>like that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people being happy is some somehow</v>

2083
01:42:02.661 --> 01:42:04.700
<v Speaker 3>taking something away from them,</v>

2084
01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:07.370
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2085
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:08.210
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2086
01:42:08.211 --> 01:42:08.970
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2087
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.020
<v Speaker 4>they want to surround that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want other people to be miserable,</v>

2088
01:42:12.110 --> 01:42:17.110
<v Speaker 4>miserable with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in this sense also where it's </v>

2089
01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:17.110
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's justification,</v>

2090
01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:18.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it must be okay and you know,</v>

2091
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:20.900
<v Speaker 4>if everyone here is also here with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then yeah,</v>

2092
01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.460
<v Speaker 4>then I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2093
01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm not abnormal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not something wrong.</v>

2094
01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:30.060
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered how much of that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on psychologically,</v>

2095
01:42:30.610 --> 01:42:35.610
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is what's in their life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how much of the psychology and how </v>

2096
01:42:35.610 --> 01:42:39.751
<v Speaker 3>much of what's going on in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of feedback they're </v>

2097
01:42:39.751 --> 01:42:42.181
<v Speaker 3>getting on daily day to day basis in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their life is actually regulating their </v>

2098
01:42:42.181 --> 01:42:42.181
<v Speaker 3>human neurochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2099
01:42:42.181 --> 01:42:42.181
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2100
01:42:42.181 --> 01:42:47.080
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a very complex interaction </v>

2101
01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:50.081
<v Speaker 4>going on between the environment and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurochemistry and this has been </v>

2102
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:50.081
<v Speaker 4>demonstrated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2103
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:53.420
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of different animal studies </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's like,</v>

2104
01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:58.690
<v Speaker 4>so you can actually alter someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>serotonin system by having an early </v>

2105
01:42:59.931 --> 01:43:00.970
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2106
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:04.490
<v Speaker 4>stressful event happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2107
01:43:04.491 --> 01:43:09.140
<v Speaker 4>like in the case of mice and early life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stressful event is when the pups,</v>

2108
01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:13.150
<v Speaker 4>when you're born you're a pup and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not nurtured as a pop.</v>

2109
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:18.430
<v Speaker 4>So when you're nurtured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the parent mice will lick the </v>

2110
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 4>pops and when that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they get licked you will.</v>

2111
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:22.670
<v Speaker 4>They release Serotonin in their brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're really,</v>

2112
01:43:22.671 --> 01:43:24.740
<v Speaker 4>really young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when happens,</v>

2113
01:43:24.741 --> 01:43:25.980
<v Speaker 4>when they released her tone into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brown,</v>

2114
01:43:26.010 --> 01:43:27.890
<v Speaker 4>they're really young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all sorts of feedback,</v>

2115
01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:32.920
<v Speaker 4>epigenetic feedback loops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So epigenetics is changing the </v>

2116
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:36.341
<v Speaker 4>expression of their genes without </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually altering the DNA nucleotide </v>

2117
01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:40.061
<v Speaker 4>sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a polymorphism is different </v>

2118
01:43:40.061 --> 01:43:42.041
<v Speaker 4>sequence of DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but epigenetically they'll change the </v>

2119
01:43:42.041 --> 01:43:44.810
<v Speaker 4>receptors in their brain that respond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that respond to like Glucocorticoids,</v>

2120
01:43:44.811 --> 01:43:47.240
<v Speaker 4>like stress hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they incur.</v>

2121
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:51.800
<v Speaker 4>So when they have serotonin there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they increased the amount of receptors,</v>

2122
01:43:51.801 --> 01:43:54.860
<v Speaker 4>which means when they have more </v>
<v Speaker 4>receptors to glucocorticoids,</v>

2123
01:43:56.330 --> 01:44:01.330
<v Speaker 4>your body doesn't make us shoot as much </v>
<v Speaker 4>cortisol and much much for the </v>

2124
01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 4>glucocorticoids out because it has a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of receptors.</v>

2125
01:44:02.721 --> 01:44:05.810
<v Speaker 4>There's a feedback so they're calmer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're happier,</v>

2126
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:10.811
<v Speaker 4>they're not as anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you take that away and those </v>

2127
01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:14.771
<v Speaker 4>pumps don't get licked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't make Serotonin in early </v>

2128
01:44:14.771 --> 01:44:14.771
<v Speaker 4>development and those glucocorticoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>receptors,</v>

2129
01:44:14.771 --> 01:44:17.450
<v Speaker 4>you don't have as many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the body is constantly.</v>

2130
01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:21.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like in a stress state and these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these mice grew up very,</v>

2131
01:44:21.081 --> 01:44:22.940
<v Speaker 4>very anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fearful.</v>

2132
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:24.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2133
01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:25.660
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

2134
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:29.510
<v Speaker 4>their brains develop differently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the same with children that grow</v>

2135
01:44:29.511 --> 01:44:31.680
<v Speaker 4>up in orphanages where they don't get </v>
<v Speaker 4>cuddled and.</v>

2136
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what I would be.</v>

2137
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:38.890
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems likely that you take that in </v>

2138
01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:38.890
<v Speaker 4>combination.</v>

2139
01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:42.800
<v Speaker 4>So you've got someone who's already </v>
<v Speaker 4>genetically predisposed.</v>

2140
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.730
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2141
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:45.830
<v Speaker 4>the serotonin system because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2142
01:44:45.831 --> 01:44:47.570
<v Speaker 4>we're talking a lot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're already,</v>

2143
01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:49.460
<v Speaker 4>they already have a polymorph and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

2144
01:44:49.730 --> 01:44:54.730
<v Speaker 4>polymorphisms are common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got people with polymorphisms in </v>

2145
01:44:54.730 --> 01:44:58.420
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin transporters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>serotonin synthesis genes or their </v>

2146
01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:02.471
<v Speaker 4>receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so they're already kind of </v>

2147
01:45:02.471 --> 01:45:02.471
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're already,</v>

2148
01:45:02.471 --> 01:45:06.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not making as much serotonin or </v>

2149
01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:06.740
<v Speaker 4>they're not responding it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like normal,</v>

2150
01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:09.320
<v Speaker 4>so they're already genetically </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable to that.</v>

2151
01:45:09.321 --> 01:45:14.321
<v Speaker 4>And then you couple that with an early </v>
<v Speaker 4>stressful event and then it just screws </v>

2152
01:45:14.321 --> 01:45:15.940
<v Speaker 4>things up even more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2153
01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.960
<v Speaker 4>and also diet is coupled to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have talked about vitamin </v>

2154
01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.830
<v Speaker 4>deregulating serotonin synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>EPA regulates the release of it.</v>

2155
01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:26.680
<v Speaker 4>They've shown that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned the two series.</v>

2156
01:45:26.690 --> 01:45:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Prostoglandins inhibits the release when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2157
01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.970
<v Speaker 4>when you put EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it mitigates that.</v>

2158
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 4>So having an anti inflammatory Omega </v>
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

2159
01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is very important for people that are </v>

2160
01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.090
<v Speaker 4>genetically predisposed to have their </v>
<v Speaker 4>serotonin system screwed up.</v>

2161
01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:46.460
<v Speaker 4>You take that person anything about </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's already on the fringe </v>

2162
01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:51.101
<v Speaker 4>who's already waiting to be tipped over </v>
<v Speaker 4>into mental illness or behavioral types </v>

2163
01:45:52.311 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 4>of behaviors that are non productive and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and you take their nutrition,</v>

2164
01:45:56.451 --> 01:45:58.640
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have poor nutrition there,</v>

2165
01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:03.880
<v Speaker 4>inflammation going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all the energy is going sucked into </v>

2166
01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:03.880
<v Speaker 4>the wrong place and not up here where it</v>
<v Speaker 4>needs to be.</v>

2167
01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:07.400
<v Speaker 4>And then you add stressful environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're talking about dynamite for</v>

2168
01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.070
<v Speaker 4>mental illness and not just stressful </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

2169
01:46:10.071 --> 01:46:13.270
<v Speaker 4>but negative feedback or negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2170
01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:16.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Poor a poor relationships,</v>

2171
01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:19.730
<v Speaker 4>poor friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real hardcore negativity.</v>

2172
01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've even shown actually in terms of </v>

2173
01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:25.120
<v Speaker 4>the relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2174
01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.790
<v Speaker 4>this whole behavioral epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

2175
01:46:28.791 --> 01:46:33.791
<v Speaker 4>is kind of what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very interesting because it's </v>

2176
01:46:33.791 --> 01:46:37.061
<v Speaker 4>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the relationship between </v>

2177
01:46:37.061 --> 01:46:37.520
<v Speaker 4>what's happening in your environment and</v>
<v Speaker 4>how that's changing,</v>

2178
01:46:37.610 --> 01:46:42.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that the neurochemistry in your </v>

2179
01:46:42.610 --> 01:46:45.101
<v Speaker 4>brain either at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitters or receptors or </v>

2180
01:46:45.101 --> 01:46:45.950
<v Speaker 4>whatever they've shown that another.</v>

2181
01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:49.130
<v Speaker 4>So another thing that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a cuddled,</v>

2182
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 4>you're young and they do a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies in mice,</v>

2183
01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

2184
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 4>but you release like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for example,</v>

2185
01:46:57.151 --> 01:46:59.730
<v Speaker 4>when your mother licks you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you also,</v>

2186
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:04.790
<v Speaker 4>there's also oxytocin being released and</v>
<v Speaker 4>oxytocin sort of that bonding hormone </v>

2187
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:06.840
<v Speaker 4>that's made where the mother bonds with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the trial.</v>

2188
01:47:06.841 --> 01:47:07.610
<v Speaker 4>But also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2189
01:47:07.810 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 4>it's pair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2190
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 4>mate bond bonding as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you take that away,</v>

2191
01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:13.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2192
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:14.740
<v Speaker 4>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2193
01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 4>like if you're not coddled or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get that attention early,</v>

2194
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:21.390
<v Speaker 4>like that early attention from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother in early life,</v>

2195
01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:26.660
<v Speaker 4>then what happens is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the offspring grow up and they make less</v>

2196
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
<v Speaker 4>oxytocin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some epigenetic changes are </v>

2197
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:32.000
<v Speaker 4>happening where now they're not making </v>
<v Speaker 4>as much.</v>

2198
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.700
<v Speaker 4>So now they grow up and they don't bond </v>
<v Speaker 4>to their children and it perpetuates and</v>

2199
01:47:35.701 --> 01:47:36.940
<v Speaker 4>they don't bond to their relations.</v>

2200
01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:41.940
<v Speaker 4>So they have poor relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Similar thing happens with Vasopressin,</v>

2201
01:47:42.031 --> 01:47:47.031
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very a vasopressor and regulates a </v>

2202
01:47:47.031 --> 01:47:47.250
<v Speaker 4>lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also an antidiuretic,</v>

2203
01:47:47.251 --> 01:47:51.090
<v Speaker 4>but interestingly it's also made in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain and it's important for male,</v>

2204
01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:56.120
<v Speaker 4>like males respond to it in the context </v>
<v Speaker 4>of meeting.</v>

2205
01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:58.240
<v Speaker 4>So like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2206
01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:01.980
<v Speaker 4>they've shown in like prairie voles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are rodents that are monogamous.</v>

2207
01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.250
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2208
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:08.270
<v Speaker 4>they have higher level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a higher level of receptors </v>

2209
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:11.301
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vas are present in their brain compared </v>

2210
01:48:11.301 --> 01:48:11.400
<v Speaker 4>to other species that are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>monogamous.</v>

2211
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:16.790
<v Speaker 4>And when they take away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when researchers take away the ability </v>

2212
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:19.770
<v Speaker 4>to take away those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they basically antagonize the receptors </v>

2213
01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:21.780
<v Speaker 4>so it can't bind Vasopressin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those prairie voles which are monogamous</v>

2214
01:48:21.781 --> 01:48:22.460
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2215
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.880
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they mate for life.</v>

2216
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:26.620
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden that goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's take it.</v>

2217
01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.370
<v Speaker 4>They become freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2218
01:48:29.490 --> 01:48:30.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>polygamist and stuff.</v>

2219
01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.840
<v Speaker 4>And they've shown this in like nonhuman </v>
<v Speaker 4>primates to where I think it was like </v>

2220
01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Alma Alma keys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're monogamous and you look at it </v>

2221
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:39.840
<v Speaker 4>and you compare them to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2222
01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:44.040
<v Speaker 4>reduce monkeys that are non non </v>
<v Speaker 4>monogamous.</v>

2223
01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:49.240
<v Speaker 4>There the difference is also at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>receptors for bas or precedent that </v>

2224
01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.670
<v Speaker 4>monogamist ones have a high density of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in their brain.</v>

2225
01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.550
<v Speaker 4>And then another study came out looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at humans.</v>

2226
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm in a Swedish cohort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They looked at males that were in </v>

2227
01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:00.150
<v Speaker 4>monogamous relationships that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>married,</v>

2228
01:49:00.151 --> 01:49:02.840
<v Speaker 4>had successful relationships versus ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were divorced.</v>

2229
01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm also ones that were just single and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they found that there was an association</v>

2230
01:49:06.931 --> 01:49:11.610
<v Speaker 4>again with these vasopressin receptors </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the brain where the men that were,</v>

2231
01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had failed marriages,</v>

2232
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:16.110
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or we're not likely to even get married.</v>

2233
01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.310
<v Speaker 4>They had less of these vasopressin </v>
<v Speaker 4>receptors.</v>

2234
01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:24.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's really interesting that there's </v>

2235
01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:27.150
<v Speaker 4>these social hormones that we're making </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are really changed epigenetically.</v>

2236
01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:28.320
<v Speaker 4>So these are also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2237
01:49:28.321 --> 01:49:29.580
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the prairie voles,</v>

2238
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:35.120
<v Speaker 4>they release more of this Vasopressin </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're meeting,</v>

2239
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.640
<v Speaker 4>so like the act of mating with their </v>
<v Speaker 4>monogamous,</v>

2240
01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:40.680
<v Speaker 4>with their partner that they partner </v>
<v Speaker 4>with for life.</v>

2241
01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:43.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something that goes on with that</v>

2242
01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:47.040
<v Speaker 4>meeting event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bonding event that makes,</v>

2243
01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.330
<v Speaker 4>makes them more monogamous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2244
01:49:49.331 --> 01:49:51.950
<v Speaker 4>And it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember if,</v>

2245
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.860
<v Speaker 4>I think it was happening at the level of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the receptor.</v>

2246
01:49:53.861 --> 01:49:55.600
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were making more of the receptors.</v>

2247
01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:59.280
<v Speaker 4>The meeting event caused them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>strengthen that bond</v>

2248
01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.200
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2249
01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:05.250
<v Speaker 3>it'd be fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is if they could figure out some way to </v>

2250
01:50:05.250 --> 01:50:05.980
<v Speaker 3>experiment with Benobos who are patently</v>
<v Speaker 3>polygamous.</v>

2251
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Bonobos are freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have sex with everybody there.</v>

2252
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:14.250
<v Speaker 3>The only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only frictions.</v>

2253
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

2254
01:50:15.371 --> 01:50:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

2255
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:20.820
<v Speaker 3>They're homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only restrictions are the mother </v>

2256
01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:21.610
<v Speaker 3>won't meet with the suns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2257
01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Everything else is a free party and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be fascinating if they could </v>

2258
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.030
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to introduce that.</v>

2259
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Could you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you introduce it?</v>

2260
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2261
01:50:31.271 --> 01:50:33.880
<v Speaker 4>You can make a transgenic and until </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently,</v>

2262
01:50:33.881 --> 01:50:38.881
<v Speaker 4>transgenic by Informa Diet or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>transgenic in the context of,</v>

2263
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:43.120
<v Speaker 4>of biology on means that we take a piece</v>
<v Speaker 4>of DNA,</v>

2264
01:50:43.121 --> 01:50:48.121
<v Speaker 4>like a gene that does something and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>put it into any species of rodents and </v>

2265
01:50:50.141 --> 01:50:55.141
<v Speaker 4>we make it like we can give rodents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human genes and study their effects are </v>

2266
01:50:55.141 --> 01:50:58.621
<v Speaker 4>we can give Rodin's genes that we give </v>
<v Speaker 4>them more of them and see what happens </v>

2267
01:50:58.621 --> 01:50:59.930
<v Speaker 4>so we can take away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got started.</v>

2268
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Probably so fucking disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we do it in rodents.</v>

2269
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:07.990
<v Speaker 4>That's the chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now with this,</v>

2270
01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:11.470
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some limiting ability with the</v>

2271
01:51:11.471 --> 01:51:16.120
<v Speaker 4>cloning techniques and how we do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now we can do it more readily,</v>

2272
01:51:16.150 --> 01:51:18.510
<v Speaker 4>so I think those studies are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>done yet.</v>

2273
01:51:18.511 --> 01:51:21.230
<v Speaker 4>But you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always the variability that you.</v>

2274
01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.320
<v Speaker 4>The chaotic factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2275
01:51:23.321 --> 01:51:24.940
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if wake up,</v>

2276
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:28.420
<v Speaker 4>what if they like become really smart?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start over,</v>

2277
01:51:28.690 --> 01:51:29.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2278
01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the Zune,</v>

2279
01:51:30.631 --> 01:51:34.290
<v Speaker 3>the chimps have fucking welding masks on</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sorts.</v>

2280
01:51:34.590 --> 01:51:36.680
<v Speaker 3>That would be Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2281
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:38.300
<v Speaker 3>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying.</v>

2282
01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot meaner than people,</v>

2283
01:51:42.001 --> 01:51:43.630
<v Speaker 3>but nobody aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Which is really fascinating because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like the least violent of all </v>

2285
01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.620
<v Speaker 3>the primates or one of the least </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent.</v>

2286
01:51:49.621 --> 01:51:54.621
<v Speaker 3>They almost never harm each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're having so much sex </v>

2287
01:51:54.621 --> 01:51:54.621
<v Speaker 3>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2288
01:51:54.621 --> 01:51:59.150
<v Speaker 3>But chimps have a lot of sex too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have as much sex as Banabos </v>

2289
01:51:59.150 --> 01:51:59.760
<v Speaker 3>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Benobos have so much sex.</v>

2290
01:51:59.761 --> 01:52:03.420
<v Speaker 3>They don't use them in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never see Benobos at the zoo and the</v>

2291
01:52:03.421 --> 01:52:05.880
<v Speaker 3>reason being is that they're just so </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypersexual.</v>

2292
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:10.910
<v Speaker 3>They people would find a defensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>because western culture so ridiculously </v>

2293
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:12.360
<v Speaker 3>suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we had benobos in the zoo,</v>

2294
01:52:12.361 --> 01:52:13.410
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2295
01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:18.440
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're looking at here is a normal </v>

2296
01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:18.930
<v Speaker 3>natural expression of Banabos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like to have sex with each other.</v>

2297
01:52:18.931 --> 01:52:23.931
<v Speaker 3>They solve disputes with sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use sex for bargaining and we know </v>

2298
01:52:23.931 --> 01:52:28.751
<v Speaker 3>that chimps use bargaining for sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had an old bit about it was </v>

2299
01:52:28.751 --> 01:52:32.630
<v Speaker 3>because one of the first things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they ever discovered about chimpanzees </v>

2300
01:52:32.630 --> 01:52:33.290
<v Speaker 3>when they started experimenting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

2301
01:52:33.291 --> 01:52:38.291
<v Speaker 3>they started giving chimps coins and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could give those coins and get </v>

2302
01:52:38.431 --> 01:52:41.670
<v Speaker 3>fruit with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing they did was give the</v>

2303
01:52:41.671 --> 01:52:43.170
<v Speaker 3>coins the females and have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2304
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:45.850
<v Speaker 3>We're really the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2305
01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:46.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2306
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:48.560
<v Speaker 4>once they realized the coins represented</v>
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>

2307
01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:53.740
<v Speaker 4>they would give the coins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the females and the females would just </v>

2308
01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:56.261
<v Speaker 4>have fucking stacks of coins to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ceiling and all these males would be </v>

2309
01:52:56.261 --> 01:53:01.151
<v Speaker 4>having sex with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That associative learning where then </v>

2310
01:53:01.151 --> 01:53:02.040
<v Speaker 4>they immediately been able to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2311
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:05.300
<v Speaker 4>this prostitution is genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2312
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:06.980
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interestingly,</v>

2313
01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:08.970
<v Speaker 4>back onto the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2314
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's not really prostitution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but back on the whole life style and how</v>

2315
01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:19.721
<v Speaker 4>that changes your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've also shown that in mice when </v>

2316
01:53:19.721 --> 01:53:21.560
<v Speaker 4>they female minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when female mice,</v>

2317
01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.640
<v Speaker 4>when they're not cuddled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of this in behavioral </v>

2318
01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:30.500
<v Speaker 4>epigenetics stuff that they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do a lot of studies on,</v>

2319
01:53:30.650 --> 01:53:32.570
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens in early development?</v>

2320
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:34.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens to the brain,</v>

2321
01:53:34.611 --> 01:53:35.980
<v Speaker 4>like if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2322
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:38.360
<v Speaker 4>if you don't get attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get the cuddling and licking.</v>

2323
01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 4>How do you grow up like what's going on?</v>

2324
01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 4>And with the females,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens too is they,</v>

2325
01:53:44.181 --> 01:53:49.181
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they don't get cuddled and licked </v>

2326
01:53:49.181 --> 01:53:52.031
<v Speaker 4>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they grow up with more estrogen </v>

2327
01:53:52.031 --> 01:53:53.690
<v Speaker 4>receptors in their brain and they become</v>
<v Speaker 4>more sexually receptive.</v>

2328
01:53:53.691 --> 01:53:57.920
<v Speaker 4>So estrogen is make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes females more sexually receptive.</v>

2329
01:53:57.921 --> 01:54:02.921
<v Speaker 4>And so what ends up happening is usually</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you put a male mouse into a cage </v>

2330
01:54:02.921 --> 01:54:04.760
<v Speaker 4>with a female mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she may or may not meet with them.</v>

2331
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:10.480
<v Speaker 4>And if you put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you put one male mouse into the cage </v>

2332
01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:10.490
<v Speaker 4>with her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a normal,</v>

2333
01:54:10.491 --> 01:54:12.290
<v Speaker 4>like a mass attach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cuddling coddling.</v>

2334
01:54:12.291 --> 01:54:13.190
<v Speaker 4>And all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2335
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:18.580
<v Speaker 4>you put the second male mouse in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say she made it with the first </v>

2336
01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:18.630
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put the second one in and it's,</v>

2337
01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 4>she's not going to just meet with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

2338
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:21.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like she already made it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2339
01:54:21.291 --> 01:54:26.291
<v Speaker 4>she's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's not promiscuous where she just </v>

2340
01:54:26.291 --> 01:54:26.291
<v Speaker 4>having sex and after sex after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2341
01:54:26.291 --> 01:54:29.930
<v Speaker 4>But what happens with those female </v>
<v Speaker 4>mindset grow up without that cuddling,</v>

2342
01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.200
<v Speaker 4>they have increased,</v>
<v Speaker 4>epigenetically increased expression of </v>

2343
01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.080
<v Speaker 4>estrogen receptors in their brain to </v>
<v Speaker 4>become more promiscuous.</v>

2344
01:54:36.081 --> 01:54:41.081
<v Speaker 4>And you put it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put a male mouse in again and it </v>

2345
01:54:41.081 --> 01:54:41.081
<v Speaker 4>will make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you put another one in and it made.</v>

2346
01:54:41.081 --> 01:54:44.600
<v Speaker 4>So it's changing the sexual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2347
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:46.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether I'm sorry,</v>

2348
01:54:46.791 --> 01:54:48.680
<v Speaker 4>but isn't there a correlation with human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings?</v>

2349
01:54:48.681 --> 01:54:53.681
<v Speaker 4>Because human beings are come from </v>
<v Speaker 4>troubled childhoods with the lack of </v>

2350
01:54:53.681 --> 01:54:54.740
<v Speaker 4>love tend to be more promiscuous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2351
01:54:54.741 --> 01:54:57.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2352
01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:59.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously I can't make that statement,</v>

2353
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.730
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did.</v>

2354
01:55:02.630 --> 01:55:04.320
<v Speaker 4>The more we learn about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2355
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:09.610
<v Speaker 4>how these early life events are </v>
<v Speaker 4>affecting behavior of our own brain and </v>

2356
01:55:09.610 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 4>also of our offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2357
01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the more we can start to apply this</v>

2358
01:55:13.731 --> 01:55:16.130
<v Speaker 4>to humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it makes sense,</v>

2359
01:55:16.131 --> 01:55:18.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's definitely a correlation</v>

2360
01:55:18.051 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 4>between um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up in poverty,</v>

2361
01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:21.230
<v Speaker 4>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2362
01:55:21.231 --> 01:55:23.990
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without having that family there,</v>

2363
01:55:23.991 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 4>that love nurturing supportive system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a single parent,</v>

2364
01:55:28.251 --> 01:55:30.020
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not necessarily the case.</v>

2365
01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:33.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying like I grew up in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>single parent home and you know,</v>

2366
01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:35.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm not out there frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2367
01:55:35.421 --> 01:55:38.770
<v Speaker 4>freaking getting free gun kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get my science free gone,</v>

2368
01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:42.420
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2369
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:43.310
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2370
01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.690
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying I don't want to like say</v>

2371
01:55:45.691 --> 01:55:49.020
<v Speaker 4>that everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely no exceptions,</v>

2372
01:55:49.021 --> 01:55:54.021
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do think that our increased </v>

2373
01:55:54.021 --> 01:55:57.951
<v Speaker 4>understanding at the biochemical level </v>
<v Speaker 4>of how the environment changes the </v>

2374
01:55:57.951 --> 01:55:59.310
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2375
01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:03.000
<v Speaker 4>whether we're talking about behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cognitive function,</v>

2376
01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:08.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in general is very interesting and I </v>

2377
01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:11.301
<v Speaker 4>think that it should be extrapolated and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of apply to humans and in hopes </v>

2378
01:56:12.661 --> 01:56:15.060
<v Speaker 4>that we can start to make society </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

2379
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:20.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just so fascinating to me that a </v>

2380
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.580
<v Speaker 4>human being is essentially the product </v>
<v Speaker 4>of an equation.</v>

2381
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:24.600
<v Speaker 4>The equation of all these different </v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones,</v>

2382
01:56:24.601 --> 01:56:28.410
<v Speaker 4>all these different neurotransmitters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different epigenetic factors,</v>

2383
01:56:28.411 --> 01:56:31.020
<v Speaker 4>all these different life experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>factors,</v>

2384
01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:32.610
<v Speaker 4>all these different things.</v>

2385
01:56:32.610 --> 01:56:35.090
<v Speaker 4>It's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what producers are.</v>

2386
01:56:35.091 --> 01:56:36.030
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patrick.</v>

2387
01:56:36.330 --> 01:56:36.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2388
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:38.970
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

2389
01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:42.150
<v Speaker 4>it's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

2390
01:56:42.151 --> 01:56:43.410
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2391
01:56:43.411 --> 01:56:46.770
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of years the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we cannot control,</v>

2392
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:49.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the things that we cannot control,</v>

2393
01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:50.880
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2394
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:55.650
<v Speaker 4>our polymorphisms that we're born with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like me being born with apo e four,</v>

2395
01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.220
<v Speaker 4>I can't control that or it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>

2396
01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:04.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being raised in a family where let's </v>

2397
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.490
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2398
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:07.260
<v Speaker 4>you're from a single parent family and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mom's working hard.</v>

2399
01:57:07.410 --> 01:57:08.880
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't have time to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2400
01:57:08.890 --> 01:57:10.680
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get as much nurturing.</v>

2401
01:57:10.681 --> 01:57:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Dad's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2402
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't choose that.</v>

2403
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2404
01:57:15.070 --> 01:57:16.430
<v Speaker 4>you're very young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2405
01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:18.000
<v Speaker 4>when you're a young infant and young </v>
<v Speaker 4>toddler,</v>

2406
01:57:18.001 --> 01:57:23.001
<v Speaker 4>I mean these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain is very susceptible to all </v>

2407
01:57:23.001 --> 01:57:25.311
<v Speaker 4>these environmental interactions that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>epigenetically changing the way your </v>

2408
01:57:25.311 --> 01:57:26.670
<v Speaker 4>brain is working.</v>

2409
01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:29.310
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but things that you can change are,</v>

2410
01:57:29.311 --> 01:57:30.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

2411
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:34.600
<v Speaker 4>diet diets are really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One that you can change,</v>

2412
01:57:34.601 --> 01:57:37.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole ballgame.</v>

2413
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:38.130
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2414
01:57:38.131 --> 01:57:39.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>

2415
01:57:39.031 --> 01:57:43.860
<v Speaker 4>I really think there is a complex </v>
<v Speaker 4>interaction between genetics,</v>

2416
01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:45.690
<v Speaker 4>epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diet,</v>

2417
01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:49.280
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not the only one that thinks that,</v>

2418
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people researching all these </v>

2419
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:56.121
<v Speaker 4>different complex interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think what I like to focus on is </v>

2420
01:57:56.121 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 4>the part that we can control and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>part that we can control right now.</v>

2421
01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:00.300
<v Speaker 4>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2422
01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:01.580
<v Speaker 4>our lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2423
01:58:01.610 --> 01:58:03.630
<v Speaker 4>what we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we as an adult at least,</v>

2424
01:58:03.631 --> 01:58:08.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously when you're really young </v>

2425
01:58:08.631 --> 01:58:08.631
<v Speaker 4>you're sort of beholden to your parents </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding you and also,</v>

2426
01:58:08.631 --> 01:58:09.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the sort of unfortunate.</v>

2427
01:58:09.691 --> 01:58:11.630
<v Speaker 4>But at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2428
01:58:11.631 --> 01:58:15.600
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you're able to realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on,</v>

2429
01:58:15.601 --> 01:58:19.320
<v Speaker 4>I think that trying to control what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can is really important.</v>

2430
01:58:19.321 --> 01:58:21.040
<v Speaker 4>So getting a good diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2431
01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:26.060
<v Speaker 4>things like getting enough Omega threes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>EPA and your brain is literally an </v>

2432
01:58:26.281 --> 01:58:28.770
<v Speaker 4>antiinflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's extremely,</v>

2433
01:58:28.771 --> 01:58:30.150
<v Speaker 4>extremely important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2434
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:35.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this study where they're injecting </v>

2435
01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:35.480
<v Speaker 4>people with cytokines that are causing </v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>

2436
01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.670
<v Speaker 4>that gives them depression and yet if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they take epa with it,</v>

2437
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:40.320
<v Speaker 4>they don't get depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2438
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a massively</v>

2439
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:47.370
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a huge issue with children </v>

2440
01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:47.370
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2441
01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think it's a huge issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with children.</v>

2442
01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.130
<v Speaker 1>They have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2443
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.460
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2444
01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:53.800
<v Speaker 1>there's various um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2445
01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:59.340
<v Speaker 1>fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gummy bears and these different little </v>

2446
01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.690
<v Speaker 1>candies that you can give the children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really taste like candy,</v>

2447
01:59:01.691 --> 01:59:04.270
<v Speaker 1>the context quite a bit shittier than </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy,</v>

2448
01:59:04.630 --> 01:59:07.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're sweet enough so they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a treat the kids.</v>

2449
01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's extremely important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially early on to get to get that </v>

2450
01:59:13.841 --> 01:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've talked about in the past,</v>

2451
01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Dha has always talked about because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

2452
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:24.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a high level of it and the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I even talked about it in the </v>

2453
01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:27.721
<v Speaker 1>context of Krill oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some research after our last </v>

2454
01:59:27.721 --> 01:59:27.970
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a conversation about that.</v>

2455
01:59:27.971 --> 01:59:32.971
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up on my message board guys </v>

2456
01:59:32.971 --> 01:59:32.971
<v Speaker 1>wanting to.</v>

2457
01:59:32.971 --> 01:59:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Folks wanted to question you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the difference trend Krill </v>

2458
01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.060
<v Speaker 1>oil and fish oil and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the benefits of curoil and also</v>

2459
01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:44.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you know whether crow was rancid </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that appears to be an issue with</v>

2460
01:59:44.381 --> 01:59:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Krill oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really friendly with crude oil.</v>

2461
01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2462
01:59:49.271 --> 01:59:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll tell you what I know and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely tell you what I don't care.</v>

2463
01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:58.320
<v Speaker 1>So the thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason Dha and EPA are very </v>

2464
01:59:59.201 --> 02:00:04.201
<v Speaker 1>important is because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both an important part of the </v>

2465
02:00:04.201 --> 02:00:06.640
<v Speaker 1>brain in terms of Dha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important because it's part of</v>

2466
02:00:06.641 --> 02:00:11.641
<v Speaker 1>the cell membrane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like new neurons are astrocytes and </v>

2467
02:00:11.641 --> 02:00:15.991
<v Speaker 1>other cells in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but particularly it's concentrated in </v>

2468
02:00:15.991 --> 02:00:15.991
<v Speaker 1>the gray matter of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very important.</v>

2469
02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>The difference between fish oil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Krill oil.</v>

2470
02:00:19.570 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>And you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that I made a video on</v>

2471
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:27.571
<v Speaker 1>recently is is that sufficient oil is </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually a molecularly distilled because </v>

2472
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:34.711
<v Speaker 1>they use it to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have higher on the food chain and </v>

2473
02:00:34.711 --> 02:00:38.071
<v Speaker 1>they've got concentration of more bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like mercury and they're fat and </v>

2474
02:00:38.071 --> 02:00:42.541
<v Speaker 1>so they molecularly distill it to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of that junk because we don't want </v>

2475
02:00:42.541 --> 02:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>to take a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2476
02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:43.840
<v Speaker 1>mercury.</v>

2477
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>And also they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they distill it because they want to </v>

2478
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>concentrate the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the EPA and Dha to make it more </v>

2479
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>concentrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they do is they take the fit,</v>

2480
02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>the EPA and Dha and they put this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethanol backbone.</v>

2481
02:00:57.250 --> 02:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>They usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a glycerol backbone on it,</v>

2482
02:00:59.711 --> 02:01:04.711
<v Speaker 1>which makes it a triglyceride and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take that off and they do this ethanol </v>

2483
02:01:04.711 --> 02:01:07.861
<v Speaker 1>backbone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the molecular distillation </v>

2484
02:01:07.861 --> 02:01:07.861
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they distill it,</v>

2485
02:01:07.861 --> 02:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>get the impurities away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then most companies leave it like </v>

2486
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't put it back in a triglyceride</v>

2487
02:01:11.471 --> 02:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have this ethanol backbone,</v>

2488
02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>which is not recognized very well by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pancreatic lipase,</v>

2489
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:23.701
<v Speaker 1>is in our small intestine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't get absorbed very well </v>

2490
02:01:23.701 --> 02:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2491
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:25.960
<v Speaker 1>an ethanol backbone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not common,</v>

2492
02:01:25.961 --> 02:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does get absorbed,</v>

2493
02:01:27.401 --> 02:01:32.401
<v Speaker 1>but you just have to take more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fish oil can be reestablished into a </v>

2494
02:01:32.401 --> 02:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>triglyceride form where they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>glycerol back on and that is much better</v>

2495
02:01:37.210 --> 02:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>because know the triglyceride is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2496
02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>these</v>

2497
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:45.100
<v Speaker 4>pancreatic lipase is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are used to seeing so they can absorb </v>

2498
02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:48.551
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your small intestines can absorb it </v>

2499
02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.081
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the bioavailability is better </v>

2500
02:01:50.081 --> 02:01:50.081
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2501
02:01:50.081 --> 02:01:50.990
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is most fish oil </v>
<v Speaker 4>supplements don't do that.</v>

2502
02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:52.550
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of exceptions.</v>

2503
02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I know Nordic naturals is one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2504
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:57.560
<v Speaker 4>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the fish oil.</v>

2505
02:01:57.561 --> 02:02:01.370
<v Speaker 4>Krill oil is mostly in a phospholipid </v>
<v Speaker 4>form.</v>

2506
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:05.630
<v Speaker 4>And so that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing about the phospholipid form,</v>

2507
02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:10.780
<v Speaker 4>much like when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>with liposomes is so the thing with </v>

2508
02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:13.781
<v Speaker 4>phospholipid form is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Dha and EPA and Krill oil can be </v>

2509
02:02:13.781 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 4>easily absorbed by the small intestine </v>
<v Speaker 4>for one,</v>

2510
02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:20.110
<v Speaker 4>it can be absorbed and it's intact form </v>
<v Speaker 4>without having to undergo all this </v>

2511
02:02:20.110 --> 02:02:22.961
<v Speaker 4>enzymatic cleavage stuff so it can just </v>
<v Speaker 4>be absorbed intact and get transported </v>

2512
02:02:22.961 --> 02:02:27.311
<v Speaker 4>to the cholesterol at clough microns </v>
<v Speaker 4>like hdl ldl that can be transported </v>

2513
02:02:27.311 --> 02:02:28.610
<v Speaker 4>there in full tax form.</v>

2514
02:02:28.990 --> 02:02:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so that's,</v>

2515
02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:32.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>better bioavailability,</v>

2516
02:02:32.841 --> 02:02:37.841
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's been a couple of studies </v>

2517
02:02:37.841 --> 02:02:39.371
<v Speaker 4>showing that there's a 40 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase in bioavailability and from </v>

2518
02:02:39.371 --> 02:02:42.910
<v Speaker 4>getting EPA and Dha in phospholipid form</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Krill oil versus getting into a </v>

2519
02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:45.230
<v Speaker 4>triglyceride form from fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's Kinda cool.</v>

2520
02:02:45.530 --> 02:02:46.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2521
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:51.800
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's really cool about Krill</v>
<v Speaker 4>oil is that this phospholipid form,</v>

2522
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:52.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2523
02:02:53.190 --> 02:02:57.560
<v Speaker 4>is great because Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get Dha into the brain,</v>

2524
02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:01.790
<v Speaker 4>we actually have a transporter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means you can get the of the brain</v>

2525
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:06.850
<v Speaker 4>by just having it as a fatty acid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free fatty acid and it can be carried </v>

2526
02:03:06.850 --> 02:03:11.051
<v Speaker 4>into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's also a specific transporter </v>

2527
02:03:11.051 --> 02:03:14.681
<v Speaker 4>that has dha in a certain kind of fossil</v>
<v Speaker 4>liquid form called phosphatidylcholine.</v>

2528
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:20.950
<v Speaker 4>Phosphatidylcholine is a phospholipid </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't Krill oil and it's pretty </v>

2529
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:25.121
<v Speaker 4>awesome because the that Dha </v>
<v Speaker 4>lysophosphatidylcholine can transport </v>

2530
02:03:25.121 --> 02:03:26.240
<v Speaker 4>transport's Dha into the brand.</v>

2531
02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:28.490
<v Speaker 4>It's actually an important way that Dha </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets into the brain.</v>

2532
02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:33.730
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they knock out that transporter in </v>

2533
02:03:33.730 --> 02:03:33.730
<v Speaker 4>mice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mice had 60,</v>

2534
02:03:33.730 --> 02:03:36.730
<v Speaker 4>60 percent less Dha in their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's obviously an important pathway.</v>

2535
02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.920
<v Speaker 4>The brain likes it in that form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think for for for that reason in </v>

2536
02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.971
<v Speaker 4>and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Krill oil was cool for the Dha because </v>

2537
02:03:45.971 --> 02:03:46.880
<v Speaker 4>it's in that lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So phosphatidylcholine form.</v>

2538
02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:50.390
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the whole story.</v>

2539
02:03:50.391 --> 02:03:55.391
<v Speaker 4>I think that a fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because fish oil concentrates the EPA </v>

2540
02:03:55.391 --> 02:04:00.341
<v Speaker 4>and Dha to insane levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean even though Krill oil is more </v>

2541
02:04:00.341 --> 02:04:00.860
<v Speaker 4>bioavailable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2542
02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.700
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have high levels of EPA or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dha to speak,</v>

2543
02:04:04.701 --> 02:04:07.400
<v Speaker 4>but your brain doesn't need that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dha,</v>

2544
02:04:07.670 --> 02:04:10.670
<v Speaker 4>your brain conserves Dha very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very well.</v>

2545
02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:14.750
<v Speaker 4>The half life of Dha is like anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>between like six months to a year.</v>

2546
02:04:14.751 --> 02:04:16.070
<v Speaker 4>It's like very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very long.</v>

2547
02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Your brain is conserving it and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain doesn't take up a lot,</v>

2548
02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:25.600
<v Speaker 4>so on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's something like four </v>

2549
02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:28.781
<v Speaker 4>milligrams a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so your brain isn't taking up a whole </v>

2550
02:04:28.781 --> 02:04:29.450
<v Speaker 4>lot of Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it does take it up,</v>

2551
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:32.120
<v Speaker 4>it likes it in that Krill oil form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that phospholipid form,</v>

2552
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 4>EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>EPA is the thing that your brain needs a</v>

2553
02:04:35.511 --> 02:04:40.511
<v Speaker 4>lot of constant supply and EPA is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>important for so many different reasons.</v>

2554
02:04:40.651 --> 02:04:41.660
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2555
02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:46.800
<v Speaker 4>that whole neuro inflammatory pathway </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we started out talking about with,</v>

2556
02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:51.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury with just normal </v>

2557
02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:51.860
<v Speaker 4>brain aging with inflammation in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

2558
02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:55.440
<v Speaker 4>Anything going on in the body will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>any sort of gut issues.</v>

2559
02:04:55.441 --> 02:04:57.480
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff that's affecting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

2560
02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.710
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2561
02:04:58.711 --> 02:05:03.270
<v Speaker 4>having EPA in the brain is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so important.</v>

2562
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:07.230
<v Speaker 4>And so I like to get a concentrated </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of EPA from fish oil.</v>

2563
02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:11.790
<v Speaker 4>I get mine and triglyceride form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I use Nordic naturals because.</v>

2564
02:05:11.791 --> 02:05:16.791
<v Speaker 4>So I actually take both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take Krill oil and I take fish oil </v>

2565
02:05:16.791 --> 02:05:19.521
<v Speaker 4>because I think the Krill oil is awesome</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the Dha in that phosphatidylcholine </v>

2566
02:05:19.521 --> 02:05:23.721
<v Speaker 4>form and I think that the fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I can get like I try to get to </v>

2567
02:05:23.721 --> 02:05:25.830
<v Speaker 4>grams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've shown like multiple,</v>

2568
02:05:25.831 --> 02:05:28.500
<v Speaker 4>multiple studies have shown whether I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at cognitive function,</v>

2569
02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:33.770
<v Speaker 4>whether I'm looking at depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether I'm looking at impulsive </v>

2570
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:36.591
<v Speaker 4>behavior or other types of brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>functions and behaviors to Graham seems </v>

2571
02:05:36.901 --> 02:05:40.830
<v Speaker 4>to be a consensus in terms of benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's 2000 milligrams.</v>

2572
02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2573
02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:46.260
<v Speaker 4>And so I get that from my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nordic naturals EPA that I take.</v>

2574
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:50.280
<v Speaker 4>And then I get my Dha from Krill oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2575
02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:53.070
<v Speaker 4>the other thing about the Krill oil is </v>
<v Speaker 4>it has asked,</v>

2576
02:05:53.071 --> 02:05:56.310
<v Speaker 4>is dampen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a crock annoyed that is,</v>

2577
02:05:56.311 --> 02:05:59.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm also accumulates in the rods and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cones in the eye and also in the brain.</v>

2578
02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:04.760
<v Speaker 4>And the reason it does that is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a unique structure that is able </v>

2579
02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:08.421
<v Speaker 4>to sequester singlet oxygen which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>produced by UV light.</v>

2580
02:06:09.121 --> 02:06:12.960
<v Speaker 4>The Sun singlet oxygen is the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>damages our eyes with age.</v>

2581
02:06:13.250 --> 02:06:18.250
<v Speaker 4>It's very real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those reactive oxygen </v>

2582
02:06:18.250 --> 02:06:20.331
<v Speaker 4>species that I talk about and it damages</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rods and the cones of the eye and </v>

2583
02:06:20.331 --> 02:06:20.580
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a cause of,</v>

2584
02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:22.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>age related blindness,</v>

2585
02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:24.750
<v Speaker 4>whether we're talking about macular </v>
<v Speaker 4>degeneration,</v>

2586
02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:26.900
<v Speaker 4>degeneration or other sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2587
02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:29.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dibella attaining diseases,</v>

2588
02:06:29.851 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 4>so I'm asked is anthon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lutein,</v>

2589
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:34.020
<v Speaker 4>zeaxanthin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are carotinoids that are really,</v>

2590
02:06:34.021 --> 02:06:39.021
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they accumulate in the eye because </v>

2591
02:06:39.021 --> 02:06:40.551
<v Speaker 4>they're like basically every time we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>out in the sun and that blue light hits </v>

2592
02:06:40.551 --> 02:06:42.150
<v Speaker 4>which caused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has the elect,</v>

2593
02:06:42.151 --> 02:06:47.151
<v Speaker 4>the singlet oxygen in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it captures it and it stops it from </v>

2594
02:06:47.151 --> 02:06:47.930
<v Speaker 4>damaging brain and also eyes.</v>

2595
02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:49.530
<v Speaker 4>So acids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anthony is really cool.</v>

2596
02:06:49.531 --> 02:06:51.180
<v Speaker 4>It's also been shown in clinical studies</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2597
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:54.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>improve hdl to have know lower oxidation</v>

2598
02:06:54.991 --> 02:06:59.991
<v Speaker 4>locks at lower oxidative stress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these good sorts of goodies that </v>

2599
02:06:59.991 --> 02:07:00.220
<v Speaker 4>come along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I also think are really cool.</v>

2600
02:07:00.221 --> 02:07:03.450
<v Speaker 4>I like and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of rancidity,</v>

2601
02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 4>I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason,</v>

2602
02:07:05.550 --> 02:07:08.970
<v Speaker 4>another reason why I take Nordic </v>
<v Speaker 4>naturals is because of the isolate their</v>

2603
02:07:09.210 --> 02:07:14.210
<v Speaker 4>fish oil under nitrogen conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning there's no oxygen oxygen </v>

2604
02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:17.721
<v Speaker 4>present.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in order for these Omega threes to </v>

2605
02:07:17.721 --> 02:07:18.360
<v Speaker 4>get damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need to be oxidized.</v>

2606
02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.760
<v Speaker 4>So part of the whole distillation </v>
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>

2607
02:07:20.761 --> 02:07:22.410
<v Speaker 4>the pilling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff,</v>

2608
02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:25.680
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're exposing it to oxidative damage.</v>

2609
02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:30.920
<v Speaker 4>And so the fact that Nordic naturals </v>
<v Speaker 4>does all that in a nitrogen </v>

2610
02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:30.920
<v Speaker 4>conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no oxygen present.</v>

2611
02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.250
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2612
02:07:32.251 --> 02:07:34.540
<v Speaker 4>the Krill oil rancidity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2613
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't aware of how</v>

2614
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>rents rancid it gets just because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of new to the Krill oil field.</v>

2615
02:07:40.061 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I just did a lot of reading on this Dha </v>
<v Speaker 1>phosphatidylcholine form.</v>

2616
02:07:43.451 --> 02:07:44.920
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a similar situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2617
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xanthan is a very good at it.</v>

2618
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It's also good at preventing lipid </v>
<v Speaker 1>peroxidation.</v>

2619
02:07:53.230 --> 02:07:54.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2620
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:57.160
<v Speaker 1>it's doing some good students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an antioxidant,</v>

2621
02:07:57.190 --> 02:08:02.190
<v Speaker 1>it's preventing a lot of that rancidity </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a matter of maybe how much as </v>

2622
02:08:02.190 --> 02:08:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Stanton's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

2623
02:08:03.011 --> 02:08:08.011
<v Speaker 1>I've seen various doses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe more acid antin would help </v>

2624
02:08:08.011 --> 02:08:08.420
<v Speaker 1>prevent the rancidity uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>

2625
02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:09.340
<v Speaker 1>in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2626
02:08:09.590 --> 02:08:14.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be one thing that I would </v>

2627
02:08:14.590 --> 02:08:18.570
<v Speaker 1>look for if you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Cro will try to get a higher level </v>

2628
02:08:18.570 --> 02:08:19.990
<v Speaker 1>thinking of macular degeneration and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

2629
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:25.830
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what specifically is a good thing to </v>

2630
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:26.280
<v Speaker 1>take for vision?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard core sutton.</v>

2631
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's Quercitin yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2632
02:08:28.110 --> 02:08:33.110
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to promote healthy vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even better than that is Lutein and </v>

2633
02:08:33.110 --> 02:08:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Zeaxanthin leading the team as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sort of thing.</v>

2634
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:41.430
<v Speaker 1>There's this pure has a macular health </v>
<v Speaker 1>packet or some supplements they saved </v>

2635
02:08:44.201 --> 02:08:45.670
<v Speaker 1>that has both that loot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2636
02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you say Ludy and Lutein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looting,</v>

2637
02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Z Z is absent 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2638
02:08:51.101 --> 02:08:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2639
02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's course attendance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got generalized mechanisms where it</v>

2640
02:08:56.621 --> 02:09:01.621
<v Speaker 1>activates NRF two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a transcription factor that </v>

2641
02:09:01.621 --> 02:09:02.110
<v Speaker 1>activates glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

2642
02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those broad spectrum kind of</v>

2643
02:09:04.241 --> 02:09:08.500
<v Speaker 1>like the curcumin where it turns on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of good good genes in the body.</v>

2644
02:09:09.230 --> 02:09:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really if we're talking about the </v>

2645
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:14.230
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>

2646
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Lutein and Zeaxanthin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2647
02:09:14.621 --> 02:09:19.621
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really the main ones and moving </v>

2648
02:09:19.621 --> 02:09:21.220
<v Speaker 1>into Xanthan are present in like green </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants is really high in it.</v>

2649
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zucchini,</v>

2650
02:09:23.501 --> 02:09:28.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that it has all those </v>

2651
02:09:28.501 --> 02:09:28.501
<v Speaker 1>things is a pure one.</v>

2652
02:09:28.501 --> 02:09:28.780
<v Speaker 1>The one that I'd say has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2653
02:09:29.230 --> 02:09:32.180
<v Speaker 1>has looting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a zs,</v>

2654
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:39.970
<v Speaker 1>a in the course attend as well as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a and Siedel l sighting and inositol </v>

2655
02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:44.230
<v Speaker 1>assisting cystine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it says?</v>

2656
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2657
02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.920
<v Speaker 1>So actually that's another inositol </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain is another way that you can </v>

2658
02:09:50.890 --> 02:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>activate nrf two and also glutathione </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also a potent antioxidant.</v>

2659
02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2660
02:09:57.370 --> 02:10:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a general thing that's </v>

2661
02:10:02.370 --> 02:10:02.850
<v Speaker 1>specific to the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a,</v>

2662
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:04.720
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a specific thing to the eye.</v>

2663
02:10:04.721 --> 02:10:08.020
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a general thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can induce glutathione synthesis,</v>

2664
02:10:08.021 --> 02:10:08.740
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2665
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:11.650
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that are good </v>
<v Speaker 1>for multiple cells,</v>

2666
02:10:11.651 --> 02:10:16.651
<v Speaker 1>but especially when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're just talking about the eye </v>

2667
02:10:16.651 --> 02:10:18.100
<v Speaker 1>lutein and Zeaxanthin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you look in other tissues,</v>

2668
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>the only place you find it is in the eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rods and the cones in the eye </v>

2669
02:10:23.550 --> 02:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>and in the brain.</v>

2670
02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.060
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it accumulates.</v>

2671
02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Whereas n-acetyl NSU assisting gets in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like multiple cells.</v>

2672
02:10:28.811 --> 02:10:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just doing a general antioxidant </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2673
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:34.550
<v Speaker 1>So having the Lutein and Suzanne and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the.</v>

2674
02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a smoothie every morning,</v>

2675
02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>which has a lot of Kale in it and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greens,</v>

2676
02:10:40.551 --> 02:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's got a high concentration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lutein and Zeaxanthin.</v>

2677
02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my multivitamin has it as well.</v>

2678
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm confusing corset in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else because I think it was </v>

2679
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:53.681
<v Speaker 1>looting there was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't even think this pure </v>

2680
02:10:53.681 --> 02:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably what you were thinking about </v>

2681
02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>looting his course it into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2682
02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a polyphenol.</v>

2683
02:10:58.580 --> 02:10:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

2684
02:10:59.241 --> 02:11:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean it does a lot of good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that a lot of the mechanisms by</v>

2685
02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:05.420
<v Speaker 1>which these polyphenols work is through </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2686
02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it's slightly toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It activates all these different genes </v>

2687
02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:14.621
<v Speaker 1>in our tissues that are detoxifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymes like with Ioan and other </v>

2688
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:18.770
<v Speaker 1>reactive oxygen species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scavengers and things like that.</v>

2689
02:11:19.170 --> 02:11:24.170
<v Speaker 1>So inositol sustaining has been shown to</v>
<v Speaker 1>activate all the glutathione genes so </v>

2690
02:11:24.170 --> 02:11:24.170
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2691
02:11:24.170 --> 02:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2692
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:27.320
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those mechanisms where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2693
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2694
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.230
<v Speaker 1>like I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hormetic response.</v>

2695
02:11:30.231 --> 02:11:35.231
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that where it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that generalizing </v>

2696
02:11:35.231 --> 02:11:39.130
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked earlier about something that </v>

2697
02:11:39.130 --> 02:11:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was bullshit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2698
02:11:40.690 --> 02:11:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2699
02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:46.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the herbal shit that everybody always </v>

2700
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.700
<v Speaker 1>prescribed when people are sick at </v>
<v Speaker 1>conation.</v>

2701
02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2702
02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it is or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2703
02:11:51.591 --> 02:11:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it because I know that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in people's minds.</v>

2704
02:11:54.021 --> 02:11:59.021
<v Speaker 1>It's an herbal thing that people going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a couple of jobs of recognition </v>

2705
02:11:59.021 --> 02:12:00.350
<v Speaker 1>when you're on it and never did </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2706
02:12:00.351 --> 02:12:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I never felt any increased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2707
02:12:02.991 --> 02:12:06.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing or recovery from colds.</v>

2708
02:12:06.810 --> 02:12:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I honestly have no idea if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's real or not because I haven't </v>

2709
02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:11.810
<v Speaker 1>read about it enough.</v>

2710
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best thing to do,</v>

2711
02:12:13.011 --> 02:12:14.210
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2712
02:12:14.250 --> 02:12:17.600
<v Speaker 1>is making sure you don't have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation going on.</v>

2713
02:12:17.601 --> 02:12:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Making sure you're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's gonna be the way to have the</v>

2714
02:12:21.411 --> 02:12:26.411
<v Speaker 1>best immune response you can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>have when you are exposed to something </v>

2715
02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:31.420
<v Speaker 1>pathogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating the way human beings </v>

2716
02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:33.791
<v Speaker 1>work because we always go to try to fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>it once it's broken and don't try to </v>

2717
02:12:34.611 --> 02:12:36.190
<v Speaker 1>prevent it from being fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>

2718
02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:37.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2719
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:39.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of money in health </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>

2720
02:12:39.021 --> 02:12:43.550
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of money and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeopathic remedies once you're already</v>

2721
02:12:43.551 --> 02:12:46.460
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember,</v>

2722
02:12:46.461 --> 02:12:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who gave it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember there's this stuff,</v>

2723
02:12:49.131 --> 02:12:54.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like these little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little sugar capsules there.</v>

2724
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:56.600
<v Speaker 1>You pop the top and put in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2725
02:12:56.630 --> 02:12:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating sugar.</v>

2726
02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homeopathy is nonsense.</v>

2727
02:13:00.850 --> 02:13:01.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2728
02:13:01.131 --> 02:13:02.360
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

2729
02:13:02.570 --> 02:13:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Homeopathic remedy for Kohl's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2730
02:13:04.821 --> 02:13:08.330
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking sugar sugar effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

2731
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2732
02:13:09.801 --> 02:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that stuff called,</v>

2733
02:13:11.130 --> 02:13:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2734
02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you pop the top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like sugar crystals now.</v>

2735
02:13:14.451 --> 02:13:19.451
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what you're talking </v>

2736
02:13:19.451 --> 02:13:19.451
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do know that homeopathic stuff is,</v>

2737
02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:22.700
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective.</v>

2738
02:13:22.701 --> 02:13:27.701
<v Speaker 1>The way that diluted to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like one molecule of the </v>

2739
02:13:27.701 --> 02:13:28.250
<v Speaker 1>compound in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>

2740
02:13:28.450 --> 02:13:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

2741
02:13:29.511 --> 02:13:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I was given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that once,</v>

2742
02:13:31.110 --> 02:13:32.820
<v Speaker 1>and I took one I didn't know was </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeopathic,</v>

2743
02:13:32.821 --> 02:13:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was like Arnica or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2744
02:13:34.251 --> 02:13:36.920
<v Speaker 1>And I took it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like little tiny little cap,</v>

2745
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:40.230
<v Speaker 1>like sugar things inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could tell just by the way I shook</v>

2746
02:13:40.231 --> 02:13:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2747
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pop it open.</v>

2748
02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2749
02:13:43.381 --> 02:13:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I just took the capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

2750
02:13:45.211 --> 02:13:49.440
<v Speaker 1>that that's when his Arnica Arnica is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2751
02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:53.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anti inflammatory or anti microbial</v>

2752
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:58.870
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used for like mouthwash kind of </v>

2753
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.870
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2754
02:13:58.870 --> 02:14:00.870
<v Speaker 1>it's potent at inhibiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm aerobic bacteria.</v>

2755
02:14:00.930 --> 02:14:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Bacteria that are aerobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2756
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:04.920
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2757
02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done a ton of research on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the one thing that it does do </v>

2758
02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:14.280
<v Speaker 1>golden rule is another one that's always</v>
<v Speaker 1>partnered with Achalasia gold.</v>

2759
02:14:14.290 --> 02:14:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Golden Seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golden.</v>

2760
02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2761
02:14:17.341 --> 02:14:17.910
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2762
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:22.950
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing back memories from like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I just haven't </v>

2763
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:23.400
<v Speaker 1>looked into those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been.</v>

2764
02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I know the things that are good are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polyphenols course to 10 in Kerman </v>

2765
02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Turmeric in general because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

2766
02:14:32.301 --> 02:14:37.301
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the inositol assisting in Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 1>lipoic acid is another way to increase </v>

2767
02:14:37.890 --> 02:14:42.890
<v Speaker 1>glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also impart important for </v>

2768
02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:42.890
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial function.</v>

2769
02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2770
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:45.750
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are good things and who knows some</v>

2771
02:14:45.751 --> 02:14:47.460
<v Speaker 1>of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2772
02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Alpha lipoic acid is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

2773
02:14:50.490 --> 02:14:53.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my actually my mentor,</v>

2774
02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:58.730
<v Speaker 1>he is one of the pioneers that showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you give alpha lipoic acid to old </v>

2775
02:14:59.251 --> 02:15:01.470
<v Speaker 1>rats showed this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2776
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:04.860
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it made them young again,</v>

2777
02:15:04.861 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 1>like their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like made their brains young.</v>

2778
02:15:07.291 --> 02:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>So when you gave them to old rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was reversing aging.</v>

2779
02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:13.200
<v Speaker 1>How do they administer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an intravenous.</v>

2780
02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2781
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if it was intravenous </v>

2782
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.950
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can easily check that,</v>

2783
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:21.960
<v Speaker 1>check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Alpha lipoic acid does get absorbed.</v>

2784
02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It actually gets absorbed better when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not taken with protein,</v>

2785
02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:28.830
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it binds.</v>

2786
02:15:28.890 --> 02:15:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's something we make </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

2787
02:15:31.530 --> 02:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>like plants make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in,</v>

2788
02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.540
<v Speaker 1>it's in food that we eat and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2789
02:15:35.630 --> 02:15:37.200
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make it in our body,</v>

2790
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:39.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

2791
02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 1>when it's complex to protein for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

2792
02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been so long.</v>

2793
02:15:43.231 --> 02:15:46.140
<v Speaker 1>It's been quite a few years since I read</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this mechanism.</v>

2794
02:15:46.141 --> 02:15:47.850
<v Speaker 1>But something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2795
02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:53.460
<v Speaker 1>does it doesn't get absorbed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like getting cleaved away or </v>

2796
02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:56.901
<v Speaker 1>something with the protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually taking Alpha lipoic acid </v>

2797
02:15:56.901 --> 02:15:56.901
<v Speaker 1>supplement should be taken on an empty </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach.</v>

2798
02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

2799
02:15:59.060 --> 02:15:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2800
02:16:00.450 --> 02:16:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Which is kind of different than other </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods where you take them with morphine </v>

2801
02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:09.120
<v Speaker 1>or how many people like listen to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this information and there's a lot of </v>

<v Speaker 1>like fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

2804
02:16:14.611 --> 02:16:15.840
<v Speaker 1>There's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2806
02:16:17.611 --> 02:16:19.700
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2807
02:16:19.710 --> 02:16:20.940
<v Speaker 1>What do I take it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2809
02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:25.800
<v Speaker 1>gludethyon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that legit or do I need a lot of fun?</v>

2810
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2811
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.830

<v Speaker 1>the same thing</v>

2812
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:33.010
<v Speaker 4>that I would get from people on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>subway right now,</v>

2813
02:16:33.011 --> 02:16:38.011
<v Speaker 4>writing on their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to put all the shit in their </v>

2814
02:16:38.011 --> 02:16:40.450
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much stuff should you take a day?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2817
02:16:44.391 --> 02:16:49.391
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's apple podcasts and your </v>

2818
02:16:49.391 --> 02:16:49.391
<v Speaker 4>food when you're cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of foods?</v>

2819
02:16:49.391 --> 02:16:50.350
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2820
02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:52.600
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2821
02:16:52.650 --> 02:16:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been so long I can't,</v>

2822
02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I can't recall which ones have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of it.</v>

2823
02:16:55.571 --> 02:16:59.020
<v Speaker 4>It's in a lot of foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in terms of concentration wise,</v>

2824
02:16:59.021 --> 02:17:02.170
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>

2825
02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:02.970
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2826
02:17:02.971 --> 02:17:06.220
<v Speaker 4>like I'll take alpha lipoic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not part of my staple,</v>

2827
02:17:06.700 --> 02:17:07.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2828
02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:12.840
<v Speaker 4>what I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really focused on is on micronutrients </v>

2829
02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:15.721
<v Speaker 4>that are part of all these biochemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathways that are going on in all of </v>

2830
02:17:15.721 --> 02:17:15.850
<v Speaker 4>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including our brain.</v>

2831
02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Those things I want to make sure I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting.</v>

2832
02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:20.560
<v Speaker 4>That's key.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So getting the Omega threes,</v>

2833
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:22.210
<v Speaker 4>getting my EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dha,</v>

2834
02:17:22.211 --> 02:17:24.550
<v Speaker 4>getting vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 4>magnesium,</v>

2835
02:17:24.551 --> 02:17:26.260
<v Speaker 4>getting all my minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calcium,</v>

2836
02:17:26.261 --> 02:17:27.230
<v Speaker 4>magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting that right,</v>

2837
02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:29.470
<v Speaker 4>making sure I get all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vitamin C,</v>

2838
02:17:29.471 --> 02:17:32.890
<v Speaker 4>like all I need all those micronutrients</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to make sure I get that.</v>

2839
02:17:32.891 --> 02:17:34.510
<v Speaker 4>That's most important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2840
02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:36.340
<v Speaker 4>the other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2841
02:17:36.341 --> 02:17:41.341
<v Speaker 4>like the taking the current curcumin or </v>
<v Speaker 4>turmeric and I'm glad with my own things</v>

2842
02:17:44.111 --> 02:17:45.170
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2843
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:48.310
<v Speaker 4>those are more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think other measures that you can,</v>

2844
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:50.500
<v Speaker 4>I think first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy diet,</v>

2845
02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making sure you're eliminating the </v>

2846
02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:55.800
<v Speaker 4>inflammation at the source of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

2847
02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:00.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making sure you're not causing too much </v>

2848
02:18:00.661 --> 02:18:00.850
<v Speaker 4>inflammation by eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating sugar and refined crap.</v>

2849
02:18:00.851 --> 02:18:05.851
<v Speaker 4>Just eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to make sure you're eating a </v>

2850
02:18:05.851 --> 02:18:07.090
<v Speaker 4>lot of micronutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating your meats that are not all crazy</v>

2851
02:18:07.570 --> 02:18:09.090
<v Speaker 4>a processed.</v>

2852
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And nitrites and nitrates night.</v>

2853
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:19.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nitrates aren't used for um,</v>

2854
02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:20.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in,</v>

2855
02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:23.310
<v Speaker 4>they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're an all plant later,</v>

2856
02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:24.890
<v Speaker 4>like everywhere in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2857
02:18:25.390 --> 02:18:30.390
<v Speaker 4>nitrites are used to cure me and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>lunch meats and bake a lot of bacon,</v>

2858
02:18:30.551 --> 02:18:31.720
<v Speaker 4>I think has it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2859
02:18:31.810 --> 02:18:36.810
<v Speaker 4>the difference is that I try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's can form a nature,</v>

2860
02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:42.220
<v Speaker 4>a nitrosamines which are potent </v>
<v Speaker 4>carcinogens.</v>

2861
02:18:42.221 --> 02:18:47.221
<v Speaker 4>So they basically what they do is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>bind to your DNA and they formed this </v>

2862
02:18:47.221 --> 02:18:47.740
<v Speaker 4>bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bulky adduct on your DNA.</v>

2863
02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.560
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is when your cell tries</v>
<v Speaker 4>to replicate,</v>

2864
02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:53.380
<v Speaker 4>so that's DNA damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bulky addicts and I trusted means they</v>

2865
02:18:53.381 --> 02:18:56.680
<v Speaker 4>like interact with DNA and then when the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cell replicates,</v>

2866
02:18:56.681 --> 02:18:58.450
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2867
02:18:58.770 --> 02:19:03.770
<v Speaker 4>the replication machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't recognize that DNA sequence </v>

2868
02:19:03.770 --> 02:19:05.140
<v Speaker 4>because there's a big thing sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and so it just puts anything there</v>

2869
02:19:05.141 --> 02:19:08.020
<v Speaker 4>and it's actually associated with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific type of mutation.</v>

2870
02:19:08.020 --> 02:19:10.000
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a Gett one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been a while.</v>

2871
02:19:10.210 --> 02:19:10.800
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2872
02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:13.510
<v Speaker 4>that causes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's associated with cancer,</v>

2873
02:19:13.511 --> 02:19:15.310
<v Speaker 4>which is why it's labeled as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>carcinogen.</v>

2874
02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so nitrites can form that.</v>

2875
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly because they're in,</v>

2876
02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:24.430
<v Speaker 4>when they're in an accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>accurate solution,</v>

2877
02:19:24.431 --> 02:19:29.330
<v Speaker 4>they conform nitrous acid which then can</v>
<v Speaker 4>react with amiens which are everywhere.</v>

2878
02:19:29.331 --> 02:19:31.690
<v Speaker 4>And proteins like amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like ambience.</v>

2879
02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:32.630
<v Speaker 4>So that reacted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2880
02:19:32.631 --> 02:19:33.890
<v Speaker 4>informed them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conform on,</v>

2881
02:19:33.891 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 4>I trusted me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's not a good thing.</v>

2882
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:40.850
<v Speaker 4>And nitrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can form.</v>

2883
02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:43.940
<v Speaker 4>Nitrates can form nitrites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the saliva,</v>

2884
02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:46.730
<v Speaker 4>we have bacteria in our saliva that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

2885
02:19:46.731 --> 02:19:51.731
<v Speaker 4>And I've seen studies everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere ranging from like five,</v>

2886
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:55.370
<v Speaker 4>five to 20 percent or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that where it can form.</v>

2887
02:19:55.390 --> 02:19:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Nitrates are starting nitrites and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nitrates conform,</v>

2888
02:19:58.070 --> 02:20:02.750
<v Speaker 4>so eating lots of plants to inform which</v>
<v Speaker 4>get into your system,</v>

2889
02:20:02.751 --> 02:20:05.710
<v Speaker 4>but a significant amount can be toxic.</v>

2890
02:20:05.780 --> 02:20:06.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2891
02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:11.300
<v Speaker 4>so while there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what the toxicity,</v>

2892
02:20:11.301 --> 02:20:13.220
<v Speaker 4>I think that there is something that can</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

2893
02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:18.470
<v Speaker 4>but so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a nitrates conform nitric oxide,</v>

2894
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.660
<v Speaker 4>which is a vasodilator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2895
02:20:20.661 --> 02:20:25.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a good thing and actually </v>

2896
02:20:25.661 --> 02:20:26.891
<v Speaker 4>they use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they use that to help people </v>

2897
02:20:26.891 --> 02:20:26.891
<v Speaker 4>with hypertension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2898
02:20:26.891 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 4>and I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can also form that,</v>

2899
02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:33.160
<v Speaker 4>but it depends on whether or not there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough antioxidant around like vitamin C</v>

2900
02:20:33.551 --> 02:20:38.551
<v Speaker 4>or other antioxidants because nitrites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they'd be formed this nitrous </v>

2901
02:20:38.551 --> 02:20:42.971
<v Speaker 4>acid acid in acquia solution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can immediately then go into </v>

2902
02:20:42.971 --> 02:20:47.171
<v Speaker 4>nitrogen means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have this reducing agent </v>

2903
02:20:47.171 --> 02:20:47.570
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can shift them nitrites to form</v>

2904
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:50.270
<v Speaker 4>night nitris nitric oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2905
02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:52.160
<v Speaker 4>but so plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2906
02:20:52.161 --> 02:20:57.161
<v Speaker 4>which is good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so plants have a lot of vitamin C </v>

2907
02:20:57.161 --> 02:20:57.161
<v Speaker 4>when you're eating the nitrates in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plants,</v>

2908
02:20:57.161 --> 02:20:59.100
<v Speaker 4>you're getting vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting all these antioxidants,</v>

2909
02:20:59.750 --> 02:21:02.840
<v Speaker 4>vitamin CS and Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>celery,</v>

2910
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:03.440
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

2911
02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:05.180
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't,</v>

2912
02:21:05.181 --> 02:21:10.181
<v Speaker 4>they've done studies where they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at the amount of nitrogen means </v>

2913
02:21:10.181 --> 02:21:12.560
<v Speaker 4>formed from either nitrites or nitrates </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like so for meat like meat,</v>

2914
02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:17.730
<v Speaker 4>nitrates that are cured meat and they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>shown that nitrates don't form those as </v>

2915
02:21:17.730 --> 02:21:19.790
<v Speaker 4>readily because it's warming the nitric </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxide instead,</v>

2916
02:21:19.791 --> 02:21:24.791
<v Speaker 4>especially because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin C around which inhibits the </v>

2917
02:21:24.791 --> 02:21:26.951
<v Speaker 4>formation of the nitrogen mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take the nitrites and the cured </v>

2918
02:21:26.951 --> 02:21:31.931
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're not getting a lot of </v>

2919
02:21:31.931 --> 02:21:31.931
<v Speaker 4>antioxidants unless you're eating them </v>
<v Speaker 4>also with it.</v>

2920
02:21:31.931 --> 02:21:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the case where you're cooking the</v>

2921
02:21:33.531 --> 02:21:38.531
<v Speaker 4>nitrites cooking is dangerous because </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be dangerous because when you cook </v>

2922
02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:40.830
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2923
02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:45.080
<v Speaker 4>water is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you get water and the nitrites in,</v>

2924
02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:50.360
<v Speaker 4>in accurate solution and water form </v>
<v Speaker 4>nitrogen form nitric acid which then </v>

2925
02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:53.840
<v Speaker 4>react with the degradation products of </v>
<v Speaker 4>amino acids from like Bacon for example,</v>

2926
02:21:53.841 --> 02:21:55.750
<v Speaker 4>like has protein and they formed trust </v>
<v Speaker 4>in me.</v>

2927
02:21:55.751 --> 02:21:59.500
<v Speaker 4>And so cooking conformed the Nitros the </v>
<v Speaker 4>means and you can ingest them.</v>

2928
02:21:59.501 --> 02:22:04.460
<v Speaker 4>So cured bacon with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with chemicals is what's bad for you.</v>

2929
02:22:04.461 --> 02:22:05.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of,</v>

2930
02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:09.310
<v Speaker 4>of eating nitrites daily or even weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2931
02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:14.640
<v Speaker 4>you know that I think if you love Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not just buy the stuff without the </v>

2932
02:22:14.871 --> 02:22:16.770
<v Speaker 4>nitrites?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make it without it.</v>

2933
02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:18.560
<v Speaker 4>You can get to the butcher shop where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

2934
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've even seen it like at </v>

2935
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Berkeley Bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're,</v>

2936
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:26.400
<v Speaker 4>we're a shop so it's not so are bad and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I traits</v>

2937
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:29.500
<v Speaker 1>or plant formed and nitrates can form my</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>

2938
02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:34.520
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it was like a little confusing </v>

2939
02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:34.920
<v Speaker 1>and complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but commonly misconstrued commonly.</v>

2940
02:22:34.921 --> 02:22:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They commonly get.</v>

2941
02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2942
02:22:39.091 --> 02:22:42.120
<v Speaker 1>nine traits are not what are curing </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

2943
02:22:42.121 --> 02:22:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Nitrates are Woodson plants and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>form them.</v>

2944
02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:46.860
<v Speaker 1>You can form nitrites from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2945
02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.510
<v Speaker 1>because of all the vitamin C and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2946
02:22:48.570 --> 02:22:53.570
<v Speaker 1>they don't readily form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They chose the meetings I trust that </v>

2947
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:53.570
<v Speaker 1>means which is the bad stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's the carcinogen.</v>

2948
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:55.350
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you don't want to form.</v>

2949
02:22:55.590 --> 02:23:00.330
<v Speaker 1>It forms nitric oxide more readily so </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nitrites can form nitric oxide,</v>

2950
02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:03.990
<v Speaker 1>but they also form nitrogen means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And particularly if there's not a lot of</v>

2951
02:23:03.991 --> 02:23:05.520
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your antioxidants around,</v>

2952
02:23:05.521 --> 02:23:07.150
<v Speaker 1>they can get pushed towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I trust him.</v>

2953
02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Can State.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2954
02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Uber complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so complicated.</v>

2955
02:23:13.050 --> 02:23:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the switched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all over the place on the Internet </v>

2956
02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

2957
02:23:18.410 --> 02:23:23.410
<v Speaker 1>So I know a lot about it because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor studied nitrospan means and he </v>

2958
02:23:23.791 --> 02:23:28.791
<v Speaker 1>was like one of the pioneering guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like was talking about how this DNA </v>

2959
02:23:28.791 --> 02:23:29.520
<v Speaker 1>damage causes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>

2960
02:23:29.970 --> 02:23:31.980
<v Speaker 1>he's told me about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2961
02:23:31.981 --> 02:23:36.981
<v Speaker 1>so I know a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about them and he knows a </v>

2962
02:23:36.981 --> 02:23:39.591
<v Speaker 1>lot more than it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just seems like one of those </v>

2963
02:23:39.591 --> 02:23:42.561
<v Speaker 1>things where when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about all these </v>

2964
02:23:42.561 --> 02:23:45.381
<v Speaker 1>different nutrients and you talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this is a real constant area of </v>

2965
02:23:45.571 --> 02:23:48.360
<v Speaker 1>study for anybody who wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently healthy.</v>

2966
02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who really wants to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really nutritionally balanced diet and </v>

2967
02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:58.310
<v Speaker 1>optimize their health and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential to recover from illness and </v>

2968
02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:00.870
<v Speaker 1>prevent certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2969
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:06.110
<v Speaker 1>certain damage and free radicals and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the areas that could be problematic in </v>

2970
02:24:06.721 --> 02:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>our world and our diets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This just so much to think about.</v>

2971
02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:12.650
<v Speaker 1>There's so much to calculate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2972
02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:13.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2973
02:24:13.531 --> 02:24:18.531
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main things I think that my </v>

2974
02:24:18.531 --> 02:24:23.421
<v Speaker 1>advice would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to focus on what you </v>

2975
02:24:23.421 --> 02:24:27.051
<v Speaker 1>should eat then on what you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that in more inclusionary </v>

2976
02:24:27.571 --> 02:24:29.100
<v Speaker 1>diet is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is key.</v>

2977
02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:32.780
<v Speaker 1>So focusing on what your body needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2978
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:35.760
<v Speaker 1>not only for short term but what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs for longterm.</v>

2979
02:24:35.970 --> 02:24:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Focus on that more than focus on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eliminated from your diet because</v>

2980
02:24:39.811 --> 02:24:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2981
02:24:41.461 --> 02:24:43.320
<v Speaker 1>if you focus on what your limiting from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your diet,</v>

2982
02:24:43.321 --> 02:24:45.630
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to be getting all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good stuff that you need.</v>

2983
02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:49.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot about loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also thinking if you need that,</v>

2984
02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:52.020
<v Speaker 1>it's just like it's so there's too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

2985
02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:57.650
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to become caught up in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my new show and I know this because </v>

2986
02:24:57.650 --> 02:24:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>

2987
02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:00.600
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2988
02:25:00.601 --> 02:25:02.310
<v Speaker 1>getting caught up in all this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutia,</v>

2989
02:25:02.311 --> 02:25:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can take you forever to try to figure</v>

2990
02:25:05.041 --> 02:25:07.350
<v Speaker 1>out what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the meantime,</v>

2991
02:25:07.351 --> 02:25:09.900
<v Speaker 1>you're getting distracted from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing is not as what you need.</v>

2992
02:25:09.901 --> 02:25:12.690
<v Speaker 1>You know your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body is very resilient,</v>

2993
02:25:12.691 --> 02:25:16.200
<v Speaker 1>and if you feed it what it needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fight off stuff.</v>

2994
02:25:16.201 --> 02:25:16.680
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

2995
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:21.710
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna age better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know all these little chemical </v>

2996
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:22.530
<v Speaker 1>reactions and enzymatic reactions going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in all your cells,</v>

2997
02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 1>in your liver and your kidney and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

2998
02:25:24.191 --> 02:25:29.191
<v Speaker 1>All these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to keep happening because </v>

2999
02:25:29.191 --> 02:25:30.841
<v Speaker 1>you're feeding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a little bit of toxic </v>

3000
02:25:30.841 --> 02:25:30.841
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

3001
02:25:30.841 --> 02:25:32.890
<v Speaker 1>All of these pathways are ready because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so they're getting nourished,</v>

3002
02:25:32.891 --> 02:25:34.960
<v Speaker 1>are getting what they need that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>activate in the.</v>

3003
02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Your body has protective mechanisms to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure it doesn't get cancer.</v>

3004
02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I explained that when you make reactive </v>

3005
02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:45.691
<v Speaker 1>oxygen species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can repair it or you can see the </v>

3006
02:25:45.691 --> 02:25:45.691
<v Speaker 1>cell will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all those,</v>

3007
02:25:45.691 --> 02:25:48.220
<v Speaker 1>all those repairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stress response mechanisms,</v>

3008
02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:50.540
<v Speaker 1>they require that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3009
02:25:50.610 --> 02:25:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you're giving yourselves what they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

3010
02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:57.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you're so focused on what not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat that you're not getting enough of </v>

3011
02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:58.600
<v Speaker 1>what you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your body is,</v>

3012
02:25:58.690 --> 02:26:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to do that isn't gonna be as </v>

3013
02:26:03.690 --> 02:26:03.690
<v Speaker 1>optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really like,</v>

3014
02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for people that don't have a </v>

3015
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:09.640
<v Speaker 1>scientific background that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3016
02:26:09.641 --> 02:26:14.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean because it takes a lot of time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit there and read through all the </v>

3017
02:26:14.641 --> 02:26:15.310
<v Speaker 1>scientific studies and figure out what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

3018
02:26:15.311 --> 02:26:17.440
<v Speaker 1>all the complex interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3019
02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I barely have time to do that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I do this every day.</v>

3020
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I do research every day and on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that in my spare time I do.</v>

3021
02:26:24.350 --> 02:26:27.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's still overwhelming and I still </v>
<v Speaker 1>can only get so much done.</v>

3022
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And you have the education to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the information and you understand </v>

3023
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:35.410
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and the mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

3024
02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3025
02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:41.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last time we were here we talked about </v>

3026
02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:42.340
<v Speaker 1>some of the dis information that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical professionals,</v>

3027
02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:47.260
<v Speaker 1>guys who've written books that without </v>
<v Speaker 1>an understanding of the different,</v>

3028
02:26:47.261 --> 02:26:52.261
<v Speaker 1>like we talked about vitamin e and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of the different </v>

3029
02:26:52.261 --> 02:26:55.801
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms involved in vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorption in the body and people who </v>

3030
02:26:55.801 --> 02:26:58.060
<v Speaker 1>have written books that are incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

3031
02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:03.210
<v Speaker 1>what's negative about high levels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is good about high levels and what </v>

3032
02:27:03.281 --> 02:27:03.540
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3033
02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:08.600
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how your body should be processing it </v>

3034
02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:11.130
<v Speaker 1>and what different types of vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>either is just so there's so many </v>

3035
02:27:11.501 --> 02:27:12.220
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>

3036
02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:13.570
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3037
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that in addition to so many </v>

3038
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:21.601
<v Speaker 1>variables and it being so complex where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also continually finding out new </v>

3039
02:27:21.601 --> 02:27:22.120
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3040
02:27:22.121 --> 02:27:27.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about studies that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>published two months ago in the context </v>

3041
02:27:27.121 --> 02:27:27.730
<v Speaker 1>of traumatic brain injury in some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these neural stem cells.</v>

3042
02:27:27.731 --> 02:27:32.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a continual searching of the </v>

3043
02:27:32.731 --> 02:27:33.190
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3044
02:27:33.191 --> 02:27:38.191
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep up to date with all the new </v>

3045
02:27:38.191 --> 02:27:38.191
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3046
02:27:38.191 --> 02:27:41.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's incredibly difficult to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're occupied full time.</v>

3047
02:27:42.071 --> 02:27:47.071
<v Speaker 1>As for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a physician and you're treating </v>

3048
02:27:47.071 --> 02:27:47.830
<v Speaker 1>patients already overworked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3049
02:27:47.831 --> 02:27:48.700
<v Speaker 1>these are things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3050
02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:52.060
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely difficult for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicians.</v>

3051
02:27:52.061 --> 02:27:57.061
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't been trained in a lot of </v>

3052
02:27:57.061 --> 02:27:57.670
<v Speaker 1>these biochemical pathways in nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mechanisms.</v>

3053
02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that the training itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently it's flawed.</v>

3054
02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that needs to be </v>

3055
02:28:06.810 --> 02:28:06.810
<v Speaker 1>changed at the institutional level.</v>

3056
02:28:06.810 --> 02:28:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that doctors need to be,</v>

3057
02:28:09.730 --> 02:28:14.730
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be more of a focus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding how nutrition interacts </v>

3058
02:28:14.730 --> 02:28:16.420
<v Speaker 1>with genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how diet interacts with genes,</v>

3059
02:28:16.421 --> 02:28:19.750
<v Speaker 1>how these complex biochemical pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they,</v>

3060
02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:22.820
<v Speaker 1>why they need all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>micronutrients as cofactors,</v>

3061
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:24.860
<v Speaker 1>make enzymes work and all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

3062
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:30.110
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's lacking in the medical </v>

3063
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:31.841
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that talking [inaudible] I have </v>

3064
02:28:31.841 --> 02:28:31.841
<v Speaker 1>several friends that are physicians have</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me and also because,</v>

3065
02:28:31.841 --> 02:28:36.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even people that aren't my friends that </v>

3066
02:28:36.310 --> 02:28:36.560
<v Speaker 1>are physicians have told me that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get trained in this way.</v>

3067
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's really,</v>

3068
02:28:39.141 --> 02:28:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the flaws in medicine,</v>

3069
02:28:41.810 --> 02:28:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but in addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have doctors that work really hard.</v>

3070
02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:46.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

3071
02:28:46.850 --> 02:28:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I respect them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they do to some degree,</v>

3072
02:28:50.091 --> 02:28:50.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3073
02:28:50.471 --> 02:28:51.860
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they train hard,</v>

3074
02:28:51.861 --> 02:28:56.360
<v Speaker 1>they work hard and they try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to somehow help people.</v>

3075
02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.690
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to diagnose diseases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3076
02:28:58.760 --> 02:28:59.890
<v Speaker 1>to some degree that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3077
02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:02.150
<v Speaker 1>they do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3078
02:29:02.151 --> 02:29:07.151
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is that they also </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't keep up with all the new </v>

3079
02:29:07.151 --> 02:29:07.910
<v Speaker 1>literature that can't keep up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new research.</v>

3080
02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:13.360
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the whole human </v>
<v Speaker 1>component that comes in when you got </v>

3081
02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.770
<v Speaker 1>your patient that knows more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something than you do.</v>

3082
02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes ego gets in the way and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate response is sort of a jerk </v>

3083
02:29:20.890 --> 02:29:21.020
<v Speaker 1>knee response where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3084
02:29:21.021 --> 02:29:23.240
<v Speaker 1>this can't be true because I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

3085
02:29:23.241 --> 02:29:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm the person that knows this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially when you're talking about</v>

3086
02:29:25.971 --> 02:29:28.610
<v Speaker 1>things like you were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>study with the mice,</v>

3087
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:33.670
<v Speaker 1>the showing that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neurons or actually it's stimulating</v>

3088
02:29:33.891 --> 02:29:38.891
<v Speaker 1>the stem cell growth that this is all so</v>
<v Speaker 1>new and you're talking about something </v>

3089
02:29:38.891 --> 02:29:40.450
<v Speaker 1>that's like a couple months old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your,</v>

3090
02:29:40.451 --> 02:29:43.100
<v Speaker 1>your degree was in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good fucking luck.</v>

3091
02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:44.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

3092
02:29:44.541 --> 02:29:45.180
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3093
02:29:45.181 --> 02:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3094
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I do like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3095
02:29:48.771 --> 02:29:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting out some of these videos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this,</v>

3096
02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:53.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of,</v>

3097
02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do it more frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of my videos are a little more </v>

3098
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.990
<v Speaker 1>complex than like the general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3099
02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:06.220
<v Speaker 1>educational video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I try to really be comprehensive </v>

3100
02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:06.520
<v Speaker 1>and bring it home and sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3101
02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:11.660
<v Speaker 1>make sure I explained mechanism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>context and all those things and I've </v>

3102
02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:15.191
<v Speaker 1>been getting emails from positions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are thanking me because they're saying </v>

3103
02:30:15.191 --> 02:30:15.191
<v Speaker 1>they never knew this and they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3104
02:30:15.191 --> 02:30:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's really rewarding in addition to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like educating the public,</v>

3105
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think that's also very important </v>

3106
02:30:24.670 --> 02:30:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and making sure the public people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3107
02:30:24.670 --> 02:30:28.780
<v Speaker 1>understanding how to prevent disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding what you need to try to </v>

3108
02:30:28.780 --> 02:30:32.000
<v Speaker 1>optimally optimally perform is as good </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can now and to age as best as you</v>

3109
02:30:32.001 --> 02:30:32.360
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

3110
02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:37.600
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also important for physicians </v>

3111
02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:37.600
<v Speaker 1>to understand the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get.</v>

3112
02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:40.370
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get trained in and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have time to read about.</v>

3113
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:45.490
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full practice and you're constantly </v>

3114
02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:48.500
<v Speaker 1>training people on a daily basis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how much education is involved </v>

3115
02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:53.810
<v Speaker 1>in getting a degree in nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3116
02:30:53.811 --> 02:30:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a doctor,</v>

3117
02:30:55.701 --> 02:31:00.701
<v Speaker 1>if your general practitioner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of your time is really spent </v>

3118
02:31:00.701 --> 02:31:02.630
<v Speaker 1>learning about nutrition and when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a doctor for advice but nutrition,</v>

3119
02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:06.890
<v Speaker 1>you're almost better off just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>googling it.</v>

3120
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much time.</v>

3121
02:31:09.291 --> 02:31:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that relatively speaking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of their training,</v>

3122
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3123
02:31:15.350 --> 02:31:20.350
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also getting into new degree in </v>

3124
02:31:20.350 --> 02:31:20.350
<v Speaker 1>nutrition is also.</v>

3125
02:31:20.350 --> 02:31:21.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

3126
02:31:21.370 --> 02:31:23.820
<v Speaker 4>I got a degree in biomedical science and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3127
02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:24.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

3128
02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:29.430
<v Speaker 4>I've done research on aging cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm doing some nutrition research,</v>

3129
02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:34.350
<v Speaker 4>but I think that even getting a degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>in nutrition has flaws because,</v>

3130
02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:36.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that some of these,</v>

3131
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:41.870
<v Speaker 4>some of the dogma with nutrition itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>is been changing with new science and </v>

3132
02:31:42.511 --> 02:31:45.030
<v Speaker 4>then getting people to like change their</v>
<v Speaker 4>state of mind.</v>

3133
02:31:45.031 --> 02:31:46.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's always harder to do,</v>

3134
02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:50.820
<v Speaker 4>especially when they've been spewing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this out for years and uh,</v>

3135
02:31:51.090 --> 02:31:53.210
<v Speaker 4>and also that a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3136
02:31:53.350 --> 02:31:54.720
<v Speaker 4>degrees in nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3137
02:31:54.750 --> 02:31:59.750
<v Speaker 4>like they don't have a real hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 4>science in some cases like a science </v>

3138
02:31:59.750 --> 02:32:01.020
<v Speaker 4>background where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always liked,</v>

3139
02:32:01.050 --> 02:32:02.940
<v Speaker 4>I like to change fields.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm changing my,</v>

3140
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.860
<v Speaker 4>I've changed my field several times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3141
02:32:04.861 --> 02:32:09.780
<v Speaker 4>I've started out doing chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the very,</v>

3142
02:32:09.781 --> 02:32:14.781
<v Speaker 4>very molecular level and then I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>into aging research and then cancer and </v>

3143
02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:16.560
<v Speaker 4>now I'm doing nutrition and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting,</v>

3144
02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:21.620
<v Speaker 4>now I'm even getting into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that it's Kinda cool to also </v>

3145
02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:26.180
<v Speaker 4>have different perspectives like where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like because you see things that </v>

3146
02:32:26.180 --> 02:32:27.840
<v Speaker 4>other people had been in that field </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever don't see,</v>

3147
02:32:28.210 --> 02:32:28.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3148
02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:34.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neural stem cells and there's not a </v>

3149
02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:37.470
<v Speaker 4>lot of nutrition people talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>neural stem cells and things nutrition </v>

3150
02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:39.560
<v Speaker 4>that are important for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

3151
02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:42.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely,</v>

3152
02:32:42.241 --> 02:32:47.241
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the average person to figure out </v>

3153
02:32:47.241 --> 02:32:47.241
<v Speaker 4>what they should eat or what they should</v>
<v Speaker 4>supplement.</v>

3154
02:32:47.241 --> 02:32:47.930
<v Speaker 4>I know that you were saying</v>

3155
02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:54.420
<v Speaker 3>one of the companies that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved with does like nutritional </v>

3156
02:32:54.420 --> 02:32:57.901
<v Speaker 3>scans on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll do like a blood work panel and </v>

3157
02:32:57.901 --> 02:32:59.020
<v Speaker 3>then recommend what the person is </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficient in.</v>

3158
02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not involved with them.</v>

3159
02:33:01.171 --> 02:33:04.640
<v Speaker 4>I had done some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done a couple of guest blog post.</v>

3160
02:33:04.930 --> 02:33:09.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little over a year ago to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a because I liked what they were doing.</v>

3161
02:33:09.751 --> 02:33:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the service.</v>

3162
02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:15.780
<v Speaker 4>They companies with wellness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fx wellness effects is cool because </v>

3163
02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:17.450
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are they,</v>

3164
02:33:17.470 --> 02:33:20.430
<v Speaker 4>they're basically consumer based where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you sort of,</v>

3165
02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:26.220
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to go get a doctor's </v>
<v Speaker 4>prescription to go get your blood work </v>

3166
02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:27.600
<v Speaker 4>and to look at things like c reactive </v>
<v Speaker 4>protein,</v>

3167
02:33:27.601 --> 02:33:29.360
<v Speaker 4>your vitamin D levels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3168
02:33:29.370 --> 02:33:31.650
<v Speaker 4>your rbc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>magnesium,</v>

3169
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:33.570
<v Speaker 4>your lipid profile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3170
02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:35.580
<v Speaker 4>these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Omega three they do.</v>

3171
02:33:35.581 --> 02:33:40.581
<v Speaker 4>They measure ea at EPA and Dha and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>also measured the Omega three to Omega </v>

3172
02:33:40.581 --> 02:33:42.570
<v Speaker 4>six ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also important.</v>

3173
02:33:42.571 --> 02:33:47.571
<v Speaker 4>I mean having too much of omega six </v>
<v Speaker 4>fatty acids also leads to that </v>

3174
02:33:47.571 --> 02:33:48.480
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that generation of Youtube series,</v>

3175
02:33:48.481 --> 02:33:50.310
<v Speaker 4>prostoglandins and the brain and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

3176
02:33:50.311 --> 02:33:52.770
<v Speaker 4>It's causing inflammation in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so having a,</v>

3177
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:57.000
<v Speaker 4>having a good omega six to Omega three </v>
<v Speaker 4>ratio is also really good.</v>

3178
02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they do that as well and I think that</v>

3179
02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:05.780
<v Speaker 4>people that are going to get these tests</v>
<v Speaker 4>done and then they get their blood work </v>

3180
02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:05.840
<v Speaker 4>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3181
02:34:05.850 --> 02:34:10.850
<v Speaker 4>they'll wellness fx has like a panel of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutritionists and other physicians I'm </v>

3182
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:16.190
<v Speaker 4>not really familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They help people interpret and to what </v>

3183
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.620
<v Speaker 4>degree they know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you,</v>

3184
02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 4>but the point is,</v>

3185
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.230
<v Speaker 1>is that you have that information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

3186
02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.540
<v Speaker 1>you can also learn a lot from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet,</v>

3187
02:34:22.541 --> 02:34:23.970
<v Speaker 1>but also you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3188
02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:29.820
<v Speaker 1>look at your baseline and make dietary </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes and start to see how things </v>

3189
02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:30.790
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's really important.</v>

3190
02:34:30.850 --> 02:34:35.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this quantifying this quantified self </v>

3191
02:34:35.850 --> 02:34:38.461
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called where you're basically </v>

3192
02:34:38.461 --> 02:34:38.461
<v Speaker 1>quantifying your own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3193
02:34:38.461 --> 02:34:41.550
<v Speaker 1>blood work and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and figuring out how to optimize </v>

3194
02:34:41.550 --> 02:34:41.550
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of work.</v>

3195
02:34:41.550 --> 02:34:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it'd be really problematic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find a lot of Rhonda Patrick's out </v>

3196
02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:46.840
<v Speaker 1>there though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you there are.</v>

3197
02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not blowing smoke up your ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're my friend and I love you,</v>

3198
02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but if there was 100 Rhonda Patrick's </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there running clinics,</v>

3199
02:34:54.370 --> 02:34:57.340
<v Speaker 1>who will be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means 100 cities could have a place</v>

3200
02:34:57.341 --> 02:35:02.341
<v Speaker 1>where you could go and you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's really completely absorbed</v>

3201
02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:07.860
<v Speaker 1>in this sort of research like you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a real systematic breakdown of </v>

3202
02:35:08.891 --> 02:35:09.550
<v Speaker 1>your diet.</v>

3203
02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's your profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're missing is.</v>

3204
02:35:12.470 --> 02:35:14.840
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chip.</v>

3205
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you for that compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

3206
02:35:16.721 --> 02:35:18.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

3207
02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:23.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the blood work done and looking </v>

3208
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:26.281
<v Speaker 1>at these different micronutrients and </v>
<v Speaker 1>biomarkers and liberal panel lipid </v>

3209
02:35:26.281 --> 02:35:29.851
<v Speaker 1>panels is one aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the other aspect that I'm </v>

3210
02:35:29.851 --> 02:35:31.990
<v Speaker 1>becoming increasingly interested in is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the genetic data as well,</v>

3211
02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:33.900
<v Speaker 1>like 23 and me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

3212
02:35:33.901 --> 02:35:34.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3213
02:35:35.450 --> 02:35:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out a way somehow I</v>

3214
02:35:37.811 --> 02:35:42.811
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting more and more interested in </v>

3215
02:35:42.811 --> 02:35:45.121
<v Speaker 1>because I'm looking a lot at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex interaction between genes and </v>

3216
02:35:45.121 --> 02:35:46.060
<v Speaker 1>diet and I'm trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3217
02:35:46.061 --> 02:35:49.270
<v Speaker 1>you have this polymorphism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You being me,</v>

3218
02:35:49.271 --> 02:35:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apo e four,</v>

3219
02:35:51.130 --> 02:35:56.130
<v Speaker 1>what do I do to make sure that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>give myself the best chance of not </v>

3220
02:35:56.441 --> 02:35:58.690
<v Speaker 1>getting Alzheimer's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

3221
02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:02.680
<v Speaker 1>what can I do for my father who is 65 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old now?</v>

3222
02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's at a critical point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to make sure that if I don't </v>

3223
02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:09.370
<v Speaker 1>somehow intervene now and make sure he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things right,</v>

3224
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:12.670
<v Speaker 1>that he's going to get Alzheimer's and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably want that even.</v>

3225
02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure he doesn't get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more than idea probably because you</v>

3226
02:36:16.871 --> 02:36:17.740
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have it,</v>

3227
02:36:17.741 --> 02:36:19.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for all my family members,</v>

3228
02:36:19.931 --> 02:36:21.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I won't really know.</v>

3229
02:36:21.071 --> 02:36:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3230
02:36:21.570 --> 02:36:26.570
<v Speaker 1>it's dealing with your close loved ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then completely losing their mind </v>

3231
02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:30.421
<v Speaker 1>and not remembering who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a worse thing that can </v>

3232
02:36:30.421 --> 02:36:31.300
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3233
02:36:31.301 --> 02:36:34.090
<v Speaker 1>except from death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watched bunch of documentaries on people</v>

3234
02:36:34.091 --> 02:36:36.010
<v Speaker 1>with Alzheimer's and it's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

3235
02:36:36.011 --> 02:36:41.011
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the traumatic brain version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in fighters slowly start to appear.</v>

3236
02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in real time but in the highly </v>

3237
02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:47.760
<v Speaker 1>accelerated real time.</v>

3238
02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I've seen a guy go from being one </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

3239
02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:56.460
<v Speaker 1>two to three fights later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them a year later and he's a </v>

3240
02:36:56.460 --> 02:36:58.130
<v Speaker 1>different guy and this is fairly common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this.</v>

3241
02:36:58.690 --> 02:37:00.760
<v Speaker 1>You can literally see the struggle in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their eyes.</v>

3242
02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the struggle in the way they formed </v>

3243
02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:05.940
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the.</v>

3244
02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I talked about some things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to help you know,</v>

3245
02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:10.780
<v Speaker 1>people that are getting traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury,</v>

3246
02:37:10.781 --> 02:37:14.470
<v Speaker 1>repetitive traumatic brain injury and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I really,</v>

3247
02:37:14.530 --> 02:37:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I really think that the Aicpa we for </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic test is.</v>

3248
02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see that come into </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice where we're talking adopted by </v>

3249
02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:25.760
<v Speaker 1>athletic commissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see that adopted.</v>

3250
02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see it adopted by NFL.</v>

3251
02:37:28.941 --> 02:37:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>

3252
02:37:32.001 --> 02:37:37.001
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see all those types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic commissions adopted where it's </v>

3253
02:37:37.001 --> 02:37:37.001
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3254
02:37:37.790 --> 02:37:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3255
02:37:38.871 --> 02:37:43.871
<v Speaker 1>well they're going to say your April </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you can't do that because I hate </v>

3256
02:37:43.871 --> 02:37:44.960
<v Speaker 1>to like take that away from someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3257
02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe,</v>

3258
02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:51.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe people will figure it out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some committee formed and </v>

3259
02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:51.100
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3260
02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:52.160
<v Speaker 1>It's such a high risk that we aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't.</v>

3261
02:37:52.161 --> 02:37:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Have you been a hemophiliac sword fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

3262
02:37:55.970 --> 02:37:58.070
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that bad.</v>

3263
02:37:58.071 --> 02:38:03.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about going from </v>
<v Speaker 1>just having that a Lele I'm already </v>

3264
02:38:03.071 --> 02:38:07.391
<v Speaker 1>freaked out because I've got a two to </v>
<v Speaker 1>three fold risk of Alzheimer's disease </v>

3265
02:38:07.391 --> 02:38:09.110
<v Speaker 1>and you're talking about going from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to attend in some cases,</v>

3266
02:38:09.111 --> 02:38:09.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

3267
02:38:09.741 --> 02:38:13.430
<v Speaker 1>15 fold increase risk and and not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased risk,</v>

3268
02:38:13.431 --> 02:38:14.980
<v Speaker 1>it's an earlier onset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3269
02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.900
<v Speaker 1>it changes the onset like by seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3270
02:38:17.901 --> 02:38:19.610
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about getting it 17 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

3271
02:38:19.611 --> 02:38:23.060
<v Speaker 1>almost a decade earlier than other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3272
02:38:23.061 --> 02:38:27.680
<v Speaker 1>So that Aaliyah like having that isoform</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just an easy,</v>

3273
02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it's an easy test to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three and me does it and doctors </v>

3274
02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:32.810
<v Speaker 1>do it as well.</v>

3275
02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:38.020
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a really a recent study </v>

3276
02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:39.881
<v Speaker 1>published in the Journal of Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease that reported neuroscientists </v>

3277
02:38:39.881 --> 02:38:40.730
<v Speaker 1>using a cellular model of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's,</v>

3278
02:38:40.731 --> 02:38:45.731
<v Speaker 1>found low doses of Delta nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>tetrahydrocannabinol,</v>

3279
02:38:46.010 --> 02:38:51.010
<v Speaker 1>which is thc from marijuana actually has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been shown to reduce the production of </v>

3280
02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:59.420
<v Speaker 1>amyloid Beta and prevented abnormal </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulation,</v>

3281
02:38:59.421 --> 02:39:02.110
<v Speaker 1>which is some of the early signs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory loss,</v>

3282
02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:07.300
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious because marijuana has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been known to give people short term </v>

3283
02:39:07.300 --> 02:39:07.800
<v Speaker 1>memory loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3284
02:39:07.810 --> 02:39:12.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the one thing that pot heads like</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself constantly complaining about the </v>

3285
02:39:12.810 --> 02:39:13.880
<v Speaker 1>fuck was I just talking about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>

3286
02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>only when they're on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you were smoking marijuana or </v>

3287
02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:20.000
<v Speaker 1>eating it when you were intoxicated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3288
02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:25.120
<v Speaker 1>The big thing is short term memory loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting that you bring this </v>

3289
02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:28.040
<v Speaker 1>up because in my whole traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury quest,</v>

3290
02:39:28.041 --> 02:39:29.270
<v Speaker 1>as I've been reading about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3291
02:39:29.570 --> 02:39:31.430
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3292
02:39:31.580 --> 02:39:36.580
<v Speaker 1>cannabinoids came up on my radio radar </v>
<v Speaker 1>because new studies have just recently </v>

3293
02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:40.991
<v Speaker 1>come out related to als to also </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury where they found,</v>

3294
02:39:41.001 --> 02:39:46.001
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that patients that were admitted to the </v>

3295
02:39:46.001 --> 02:39:49.661
<v Speaker 1>hospital after a traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a mild to mild to </v>

3296
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:52.190
<v Speaker 1>moderate.</v>

3297
02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:56.660
<v Speaker 1>So it was like Glasgow Coma score of </v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five.</v>

3298
02:39:56.661 --> 02:39:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe,</v>

3299
02:39:58.250 --> 02:39:59.880
<v Speaker 1>like totally like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3300
02:39:59.881 --> 02:40:04.881
<v Speaker 1>in a coma and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they found that those people that </v>

3301
02:40:04.881 --> 02:40:06.020
<v Speaker 1>were admitted after having a traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain injury,</v>

3302
02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:09.620
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those that had the highest levels of thc</v>

3303
02:40:09.890 --> 02:40:13.070
<v Speaker 1>in their blood were the least likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

3304
02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:13.950
<v Speaker 1>And it was like</v>

3305
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.980
<v Speaker 4>there was a dose dependent thing where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they saw people that had higher levels </v>

3306
02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:19.740
<v Speaker 4>were much less likely to die in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital.</v>

3307
02:40:19.741 --> 02:40:22.900
<v Speaker 4>So that sort of sparked my interest in </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3308
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:27.910
<v Speaker 4>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a short little research and I </v>

3309
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:31.461
<v Speaker 4>found out that also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even in mice mice that were given a low </v>

3310
02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:36.560
<v Speaker 4>dose of thc that was not high enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a psychotropic effect.</v>

3311
02:40:37.700 --> 02:40:39.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually,</v>

3312
02:40:39.181 --> 02:40:44.181
<v Speaker 4>so they gave mice this low dose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a single low dose of thc either 48 </v>

3313
02:40:45.751 --> 02:40:50.751
<v Speaker 4>hours before the traumatic injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they induced traumatic injury in the </v>

3314
02:40:50.751 --> 02:40:54.891
<v Speaker 4>mice when they typically press put </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure on their little tiny mouse </v>

3315
02:40:54.891 --> 02:40:59.070
<v Speaker 4>skulls and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they gave it to them one to seven </v>

3316
02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.370
<v Speaker 4>days after the traumatic event had </v>
<v Speaker 4>occurred.</v>

3317
02:40:59.850 --> 02:41:04.850
<v Speaker 4>And what they found was that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>dramatically reduced the whole neuro </v>

3318
02:41:04.850 --> 02:41:07.620
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was less edema,</v>

3319
02:41:07.621 --> 02:41:11.040
<v Speaker 4>there was less inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less amyloid plaques were aggregated.</v>

3320
02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:13.530
<v Speaker 4>So this is quite significant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3321
02:41:13.531 --> 02:41:15.120
<v Speaker 4>so I started reading just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

3322
02:41:15.121 --> 02:41:18.180
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done a ton of reading on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>topic,</v>

3323
02:41:18.181 --> 02:41:23.181
<v Speaker 4>so I really am no expert by any means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So apparently there's two different </v>

3324
02:41:24.361 --> 02:41:27.390
<v Speaker 4>receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cannabinoid receptors in the brain,</v>

3325
02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:32.660
<v Speaker 4>there's a CB one and CB two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>CB one is found on neurons predominantly</v>

3326
02:41:32.971 --> 02:41:37.620
<v Speaker 4>in cb two is found on the Microglia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are the immune cells of the brain,</v>

3327
02:41:37.621 --> 02:41:42.621
<v Speaker 4>which is really interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're also found in the immune cells </v>

3328
02:41:42.621 --> 02:41:45.710
<v Speaker 4>in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like somebody about the CB two </v>

3329
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:46.260
<v Speaker 4>receptor is specific to immune cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether we're talking about immune cells</v>

3330
02:41:46.261 --> 02:41:51.261
<v Speaker 4>in the brain or in the periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's interesting is that </v>

3331
02:41:51.261 --> 02:41:55.010
<v Speaker 4>cannabinoid activation of the CB two </v>
<v Speaker 4>receptors in the Microglia,</v>

3332
02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.680
<v Speaker 4>it prevents them from getting activated </v>
<v Speaker 4>and prevents them from throwing out all </v>

3333
02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:03.540
<v Speaker 4>sorts of cytokines and causing all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of neuroinflammatory cycles that happen.</v>

3334
02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:06.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly how I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3335
02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:11.360
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also well known that </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannabinoids have some sort of anti </v>

3336
02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:12.000
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory effect in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3337
02:42:12.001 --> 02:42:17.001
<v Speaker 4>so that is one likely mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing was the CB one </v>

3338
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:22.910
<v Speaker 4>receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they recently found this led me into </v>

3339
02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:23.120
<v Speaker 4>this Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was studies.</v>

3340
02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:26.580
<v Speaker 4>So the fact that it can protect from </v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury is,</v>

3341
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:28.530
<v Speaker 4>and it's that it's an anti inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect,</v>

3342
02:42:28.590 --> 02:42:32.250
<v Speaker 4>is also is showing that this is relevant</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Alzheimer's.</v>

3343
02:42:32.430 --> 02:42:33.870
<v Speaker 4>So when I did a search on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure enough,</v>

3344
02:42:33.871 --> 02:42:38.871
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like lots of studies actually had </v>

3345
02:42:38.871 --> 02:42:39.690
<v Speaker 4>been done on the effects of cannabinoids</v>
<v Speaker 4>on Alzheimer's.</v>

3346
02:42:40.290 --> 02:42:41.160
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3347
02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:44.530
<v Speaker 4>there was a recent study that showed </v>
<v Speaker 4>that somehow the,</v>

3348
02:42:44.570 --> 02:42:49.570
<v Speaker 4>the receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you agonize the receptor cb one </v>

3349
02:42:49.570 --> 02:42:49.960
<v Speaker 4>receptor on neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3350
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:51.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>protects,</v>

3351
02:42:51.810 --> 02:42:56.810
<v Speaker 4>it does something where it's important </v>
<v Speaker 4>for longterm potentiation and it's kind </v>

3352
02:42:56.810 --> 02:43:00.981
<v Speaker 4>of a confusing mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but longterm potentiation is when you </v>

3353
02:43:00.981 --> 02:43:01.080
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

3354
02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:06.080
<v Speaker 4>So during learning the learning process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're learning something new and </v>

3355
02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.640
<v Speaker 4>you form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a synopsis forming between </v>

3356
02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:10.980
<v Speaker 4>the neurons and there's an enhancement </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that,</v>

3357
02:43:12.470 --> 02:43:15.820
<v Speaker 4>a signal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like it's enhanced.</v>

3358
02:43:15.821 --> 02:43:18.270
<v Speaker 4>So it's solidifying that memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that learning,</v>

3359
02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:20.530
<v Speaker 4>whatever you're learning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's making it stronger.</v>

3360
02:43:20.770 --> 02:43:24.730
<v Speaker 4>And that's a very important mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like neuroplasticity.</v>

3361
02:43:24.731 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 4>So making sure that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember something longterm,</v>

3362
02:43:27.730 --> 02:43:29.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you've enhanced that signal,</v>

3363
02:43:29.321 --> 02:43:34.321
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to do that enhanced that a longterm </v>

3364
02:43:34.321 --> 02:43:37.090
<v Speaker 4>potentiation you can activate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can cause,</v>

3365
02:43:37.091 --> 02:43:39.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more like activating types of signals,</v>

3366
02:43:39.521 --> 02:43:44.521
<v Speaker 4>but you also get rid of the inhibitory </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones and the CB one receptor seems to </v>

3367
02:43:44.521 --> 02:43:46.810
<v Speaker 4>somehow get rid of those inhibitory ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's activated.</v>

3368
02:43:47.290 --> 02:43:50.860
<v Speaker 4>And amyloid Beta plaques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they build up in the brain,</v>

3369
02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:52.300
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they act,</v>

3370
02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:57.360
<v Speaker 4>they antagonized CB One receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They prevent the CB one receptor from </v>

3371
02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:57.840
<v Speaker 4>doing that role.</v>

3372
02:43:58.110 --> 02:44:00.220
<v Speaker 4>It does in longterm potential </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentiation,</v>

3373
02:44:00.430 --> 02:44:05.430
<v Speaker 4>which is part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the effects on memory long term memory </v>

3374
02:44:05.430 --> 02:44:05.590
<v Speaker 4>to um.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now in terms of short term memory,</v>

3375
02:44:05.591 --> 02:44:10.591
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of interesting because I had </v>

3376
02:44:10.591 --> 02:44:10.591
<v Speaker 4>the same thoughts I've heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3377
02:44:10.591 --> 02:44:12.550
<v Speaker 4>will short term memory's affected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very stereotypical when you talk to</v>

3378
02:44:12.551 --> 02:44:15.940
<v Speaker 4>anyone on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've heard that 100 percent,</v>

3379
02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:20.920
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know that I would have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>read a lot more on this topic,</v>

3380
02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:26.220
<v Speaker 4>but there may be some sort of acute </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus chronic effect where it's like </v>

3381
02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:29.140
<v Speaker 4>there's something happening acutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're,</v>

3382
02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:30.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agonizing them while you're,</v>

3383
02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:35.530
<v Speaker 4>while you're taking the cannabinoids and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then versus the longterm effect.</v>

3384
02:44:35.531 --> 02:44:37.660
<v Speaker 4>And maybe there's some sort of trade </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

3385
02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:41.230
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's like short term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some things affected,</v>

3386
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:42.970
<v Speaker 4>but in the longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3387
02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:48.060
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to have that longterm </v>

3388
02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:48.060
<v Speaker 4>potentiation is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3389
02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:49.180
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting the cannabinoid.</v>

3390
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:54.760
<v Speaker 4>It's unfortunate that there's not a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of research being done in that field.</v>

3391
02:44:54.761 --> 02:44:57.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that more and more people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing more research on it.</v>

3392
02:44:57.731 --> 02:45:00.010
<v Speaker 4>As all these studies are coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just can't ignore it.</v>

3393
02:45:00.770 --> 02:45:05.770
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely happening more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially now that there's money </v>

3394
02:45:05.770 --> 02:45:08.870
<v Speaker 3>involved in it because of what's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in Colorado and Washington state.</v>

3395
02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:14.170
<v Speaker 3>There's so much money that's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>poured into marijuana research now </v>

3396
02:45:14.170 --> 02:45:16.190
<v Speaker 3>because people are starting to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in terms of,</v>

3397
02:45:16.310 --> 02:45:21.310
<v Speaker 3>well this is some seriously financially </v>
<v Speaker 3>viable stuff like this is not just like </v>

3398
02:45:23.050 --> 02:45:28.050
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a fringe thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to sneak in under the guise of </v>

3399
02:45:28.050 --> 02:45:29.240
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a crop and we have to look at it</v>

3400
02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:31.640
<v Speaker 3>as this is a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3401
02:45:31.641 --> 02:45:33.950
<v Speaker 3>they're making hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars now in taxes.</v>

3402
02:45:33.951 --> 02:45:37.640
<v Speaker 3>These states are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado is going to be over $100,</v>

3403
02:45:37.641 --> 02:45:42.641
<v Speaker 3>million dollars here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington state might surpass it and </v>

3404
02:45:42.641 --> 02:45:42.800
<v Speaker 3>once all is said and done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's gonna be crazy.</v>

3405
02:45:42.801 --> 02:45:46.730
<v Speaker 3>And once the new elections start rolling</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and these,</v>

3406
02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:47.290
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3407
02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:49.490
<v Speaker 3>options were on the ballot for other </v>
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>

3408
02:45:49.970 --> 02:45:54.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of states that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>economically challenged that are going </v>

3409
02:45:54.970 --> 02:45:56.060
<v Speaker 3>to probably jump aboard and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>California should be an barest that they</v>

3410
02:45:56.061 --> 02:45:56.390
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

3411
02:45:56.390 --> 02:46:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And especially with fucking Moonbeam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Brown in Sacramento,</v>

3412
02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:03.530
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should have been illegal a long,</v>

3413
02:46:03.531 --> 02:46:04.490
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>

3414
02:46:04.491 --> 02:46:05.420
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3415
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's going to be a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more studies being done on positive </v>

3416
02:46:10.750 --> 02:46:14.681
<v Speaker 3>effects because they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've looked at so many different </v>

3417
02:46:14.681 --> 02:46:18.791
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reduction of interocular pressure </v>

3418
02:46:18.791 --> 02:46:20.270
<v Speaker 3>for people that have glaucoma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have wasting disease and aids and</v>

3419
02:46:20.271 --> 02:46:23.360
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of people have a appetite </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues because of chemotherapy.</v>

3420
02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:25.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go on and on and on,</v>

3421
02:46:25.131 --> 02:46:30.080
<v Speaker 3>but now when you're fighting all termers</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anti-inflammation properties of it,</v>

3422
02:46:30.350 --> 02:46:35.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the differences between </v>

3423
02:46:35.350 --> 02:46:35.350
<v Speaker 3>eating it and smoking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give,</v>

3424
02:46:35.350 --> 02:46:39.170
<v Speaker 3>you get more benefits from eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people that complain about </v>

3425
02:46:39.170 --> 02:46:41.420
<v Speaker 3>chronic pain or hugely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3426
02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:43.410
<v Speaker 3>they find it hugely beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3427
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:46.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a really good plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3428
02:46:46.431 --> 02:46:47.060
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3429
02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

3430
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:54.030
<v Speaker 3>as more and more research comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a positive feedback </v>

3431
02:46:54.030 --> 02:46:56.711
<v Speaker 3>loop where it's like you test and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>addition with all these other </v>

3432
02:46:56.711 --> 02:46:56.720
<v Speaker 3>progressive states like Colorado and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington state,</v>

3433
02:46:56.721 --> 02:46:57.980
<v Speaker 3>which are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3434
02:46:57.981 --> 02:47:00.920
<v Speaker 3>it's recreational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreationally legal,</v>

3435
02:47:00.921 --> 02:47:02.870
<v Speaker 3>and it's not only that it's generating </v>
<v Speaker 3>income,</v>

3436
02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:04.910
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't ignore that.</v>

3437
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's money.</v>

3438
02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:09.410
<v Speaker 3>The money's too big at this point and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have a hard time ignoring money.</v>

3439
02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be really hard for them to take it </v>

3440
02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:17.411
<v Speaker 3>away now because what happens is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>states get addicted to that tax revenue </v>

3441
02:47:17.411 --> 02:47:19.520
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about withdrawing </v>
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,000</v>

3442
02:47:19.521 --> 02:47:24.521
<v Speaker 3>in tax revenue when the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's where it gets really crazy </v>

3443
02:47:24.521 --> 02:47:27.880
<v Speaker 3>decrease in violent crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decrease in Dui arrests and over and </v>

3444
02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:29.020
<v Speaker 3>over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

3445
02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:31.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no negatives.</v>

3446
02:47:31.371 --> 02:47:34.130
<v Speaker 3>There's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God jumped off a roof somewhere like,</v>

3447
02:47:34.131 --> 02:47:39.131
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking guy might've jumped off a </v>

3448
02:47:39.131 --> 02:47:39.131
<v Speaker 3>roof anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible.</v>

3449
02:47:39.131 --> 02:47:39.131
<v Speaker 3>Terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

3450
02:47:39.131 --> 02:47:40.550
<v Speaker 3>High driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you get in an accident,</v>

3451
02:47:40.551 --> 02:47:45.551
<v Speaker 3>you go into miles and hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's just bumping into each </v>

3452
02:47:45.551 --> 02:47:45.551
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really relaxed,</v>

3453
02:47:45.790 --> 02:47:47.570
<v Speaker 3>hydrating accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3454
02:47:47.571 --> 02:47:48.950
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>

3455
02:47:48.951 --> 02:47:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean getting hit by a drunk driver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're talking about.</v>

3456
02:47:51.390 --> 02:47:53.810
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing.</v>

3457
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly amazing how few drunk driving </v>

3458
02:47:58.870 --> 02:48:01.301
<v Speaker 3>accidents there are in comparison to how</v>
<v Speaker 3>frequent the places where you can get </v>

3459
02:48:01.371 --> 02:48:03.020
<v Speaker 3>alcohol or as you're driving down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street,</v>

3460
02:48:03.021 --> 02:48:04.760
<v Speaker 3>if you drive down the street and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street,</v>

3461
02:48:04.761 --> 02:48:09.761
<v Speaker 3>you drive down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have drug dealers all over the </v>

3462
02:48:09.761 --> 02:48:09.950
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every restaurant you pass a drug dealer.</v>

3463
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Every cvs store is a drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3464
02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:16.310
<v Speaker 3>they're all selling trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all selling alcohol.</v>

3465
02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost every bar.</v>

3466
02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:19.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course every bar,</v>

3467
02:48:19.341 --> 02:48:22.220
<v Speaker 3>but almost every restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost every drug store,</v>

3468
02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:23.690
<v Speaker 3>they're all selling alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3469
02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:28.780
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The availability of alcohol and if you </v>

3470
02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:31.511
<v Speaker 3>take that into consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible how few alcohol related </v>

3471
02:48:31.511 --> 02:48:36.131
<v Speaker 3>accidents we really do have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is that they're </v>

3472
02:48:36.131 --> 02:48:37.400
<v Speaker 3>selling this drug that alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

3473
02:48:37.730 --> 02:48:40.910
<v Speaker 3>It does a lot of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol does damage to your gut.</v>

3474
02:48:41.060 --> 02:48:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about poking holes in </v>

3475
02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:46.060
<v Speaker 3>your gut like sugar does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does that.</v>

3476
02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:50.470
<v Speaker 3>It also obviously your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what most people are familiar </v>

3477
02:48:50.470 --> 02:48:51.290
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the brain is my concern,</v>

3478
02:48:51.291 --> 02:48:56.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly because I can't repair </v>

3479
02:48:56.291 --> 02:48:57.020
<v Speaker 3>damage as efficiently as my husband who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>

3480
02:48:57.230 --> 02:48:59.420
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have this apl we for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3481
02:48:59.421 --> 02:49:01.460
<v Speaker 3>so when you drink and they've even shown</v>
<v Speaker 3>in studies,</v>

3482
02:49:01.461 --> 02:49:06.461
<v Speaker 3>people with April before illegal that </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink alcohol even increase their risk </v>

3483
02:49:07.321 --> 02:49:08.160
<v Speaker 3>of Alzheimer's even</v>

3484
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.570
<v Speaker 4>more because what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3485
02:49:09.571 --> 02:49:14.571
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about inducing cell </v>

3486
02:49:14.571 --> 02:49:14.880
<v Speaker 4>death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then if you can't replenish that,</v>

3487
02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:16.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cell death,</v>

3488
02:49:16.051 --> 02:49:19.520
<v Speaker 4>if you can't repair that damage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>April we for can't.</v>

3489
02:49:19.530 --> 02:49:22.980
<v Speaker 4>When you have that Apl we afford it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>impairs the ability to grow new,</v>

3490
02:49:23.010 --> 02:49:25.110
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow new neurons and repair damage.</v>

3491
02:49:25.111 --> 02:49:26.520
<v Speaker 4>And that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3492
02:49:26.730 --> 02:49:31.730
<v Speaker 4>it also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so bad because it's also causing </v>

3493
02:49:31.730 --> 02:49:33.300
<v Speaker 4>more aggregation of amyloid Beta and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3494
02:49:33.301 --> 02:49:36.750
<v Speaker 4>So that's the neurons are prime to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you had alcohol on top of that,</v>

3495
02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:40.050
<v Speaker 4>it's causing a tipping them over to </v>
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

3496
02:49:40.170 --> 02:49:42.360
<v Speaker 4>That stress plus stress like I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

3497
02:49:42.361 --> 02:49:43.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3498
02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:44.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3499
02:49:44.850 --> 02:49:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't drink a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun and I,</v>

3500
02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:48.390
<v Speaker 4>and I've always done it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3501
02:49:48.410 --> 02:49:53.410
<v Speaker 4>in social situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but after finding out about my April </v>

3502
02:49:53.410 --> 02:49:56.340
<v Speaker 4>before every time I am an associate </v>
<v Speaker 4>social situation,</v>

3503
02:49:56.420 --> 02:50:01.420
<v Speaker 4>if I'm having a dinner with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of friends and they give me a </v>

3504
02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:04.611
<v Speaker 4>glass of wine and even though there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>some benefits with polyphenols and the </v>

3505
02:50:04.611 --> 02:50:05.100
<v Speaker 4>wine resveratrol and one.</v>

3506
02:50:05.250 --> 02:50:06.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rivera trials one,</v>

3507
02:50:06.810 --> 02:50:07.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3508
02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:10.320
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I,</v>

3509
02:50:10.350 --> 02:50:10.960
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3510
02:50:11.020 --> 02:50:13.440
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the pros and cons.</v>

3511
02:50:13.441 --> 02:50:16.560
<v Speaker 4>The cons outweigh the benefits in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind because alcohol does so much damage</v>

3512
02:50:16.561 --> 02:50:21.561
<v Speaker 4>that I can't repair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you and I are drinking a glass of </v>

3513
02:50:21.561 --> 02:50:21.561
<v Speaker 4>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3514
02:50:21.561 --> 02:50:23.270
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just assume that you're,</v>

3515
02:50:23.310 --> 02:50:25.980
<v Speaker 4>you don't have this April before because</v>
<v Speaker 4>one in four people have it.</v>

3516
02:50:25.981 --> 02:50:28.680
<v Speaker 4>There's three people in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's likely that neither of us,</v>

3517
02:50:28.690 --> 02:50:30.390
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the one me,</v>

3518
02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:31.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3519
02:50:34.410 --> 02:50:36.120
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying is that,</v>

3520
02:50:36.121 --> 02:50:41.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to think about this interaction </v>

3521
02:50:41.121 --> 02:50:41.121
<v Speaker 4>between the genes and the Diet and me </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking the alcohol.</v>

3522
02:50:41.121 --> 02:50:43.470
<v Speaker 4>Now I know that I can't repair that </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage as efficiently,</v>

3523
02:50:43.770 --> 02:50:46.280
<v Speaker 4>so it's like it changes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it changes my,</v>

3524
02:50:46.300 --> 02:50:49.620
<v Speaker 4>my future behavior and incense and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people would probably say,</v>

3525
02:50:49.621 --> 02:50:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to enjoy life.</v>

3526
02:50:51.090 --> 02:50:56.090
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm not saying I don't ever </v>

3527
02:50:56.090 --> 02:50:57.150
<v Speaker 4>drink and I do a lot of other really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good things to counteract that,</v>

3528
02:50:57.420 --> 02:51:02.420
<v Speaker 4>counteract that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm trying to figure out more good </v>

3529
02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:02.420
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that knowing that,</v>

3530
02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:03.450
<v Speaker 4>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise exercise also,</v>

3531
02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:04.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was very,</v>

3532
02:51:04.681 --> 02:51:08.280
<v Speaker 4>very important for people with April </v>
<v Speaker 4>before and they've shown this in studies</v>

3533
02:51:08.281 --> 02:51:10.580
<v Speaker 4>that people that exercise more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3534
02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:16.080
<v Speaker 4>that have an April before Lele are less </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to get it to get Alzheimer's.</v>

3535
02:51:16.231 --> 02:51:21.231
<v Speaker 4>So this is where this complex </v>
<v Speaker 4>interaction between genes and </v>

3536
02:51:21.231 --> 02:51:23.601
<v Speaker 4>environment come into play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's interesting that cannabinoids </v>

3537
02:51:23.601 --> 02:51:25.230
<v Speaker 4>which are not found in every cvs store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any store,</v>

3538
02:51:25.231 --> 02:51:29.280
<v Speaker 4>like within a block radius,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually have the opposite effect on</v>

3539
02:51:29.281 --> 02:51:34.281
<v Speaker 4>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they actually help repair the </v>

3540
02:51:34.281 --> 02:51:36.141
<v Speaker 4>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually decreased the </v>

3541
02:51:36.141 --> 02:51:36.141
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3542
02:51:36.141 --> 02:51:39.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes people like me who are very </v>

3543
02:51:39.710 --> 02:51:40.590
<v Speaker 4>hyper aware of this Alzheimer's disease.</v>

3544
02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:44.760
<v Speaker 4>And all the mechanisms that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>accelerating it and how to stave it off,</v>

3545
02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:46.110
<v Speaker 4>it makes me think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3546
02:51:46.470 --> 02:51:51.470
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of interesting that </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's seems to be beneficial </v>

3547
02:51:51.470 --> 02:51:55.011
<v Speaker 4>from our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from our studies that we've had </v>

3548
02:51:55.011 --> 02:51:55.011
<v Speaker 4>published so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3549
02:51:55.011 --> 02:51:58.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when will we see that adopted in the </v>

3550
02:51:58.760 --> 02:51:58.760
<v Speaker 4>medical community?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3551
02:51:58.760 --> 02:52:02.790
<v Speaker 4>are we going to see changes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are we going to start to see people </v>

3552
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:02.790
<v Speaker 4>given cannabinoids?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3553
02:52:03.230 --> 02:52:05.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're trying to figure</v>

3554
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:10.110
<v Speaker 4>out a way to uncouple the psychotropic </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects from the anti inflammatory </v>

3555
02:52:10.110 --> 02:52:14.341
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm almost certain that people are </v>

3556
02:52:14.341 --> 02:52:14.341
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know if that's gonna work or</v>

3557
02:52:14.341 --> 02:52:14.341
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3558
02:52:14.341 --> 02:52:18.980
<v Speaker 4>there may be something about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychotropic effect of it that's also </v>

3559
02:52:18.980 --> 02:52:18.980
<v Speaker 4>important for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3560
02:52:18.980 --> 02:52:19.930
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no telling biology.</v>

3561
02:52:19.931 --> 02:52:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3562
02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:22.900
<v Speaker 4>it's the way it is for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3563
02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:24.310
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3564
02:52:24.350 --> 02:52:25.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3565
02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:29.980
<v Speaker 4>it's something that's on my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on my mind now that I,</v>

3566
02:52:29.981 --> 02:52:30.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially that,</v>

3567
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:33.580
<v Speaker 4>that I know I have this April,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we for a Lille,</v>

3568
02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:35.980
<v Speaker 4>which completely changes a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3569
02:52:36.850 --> 02:52:38.620
<v Speaker 4>things that I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I think about exercise,</v>

3570
02:52:38.621 --> 02:52:40.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think about exercise in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of,</v>

3571
02:52:41.830 --> 02:52:44.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to lose weight.</v>

3572
02:52:44.141 --> 02:52:46.420
<v Speaker 4>I want to stay toned and look good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think about it.</v>

3573
02:52:46.421 --> 02:52:51.421
<v Speaker 4>If I don't get exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am dramatically increasing my risk of </v>

3574
02:52:51.421 --> 02:52:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I don't get that exercise,</v>

3575
02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:57.040
<v Speaker 4>my brain is going to atrophy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to move more.</v>

3576
02:52:57.070 --> 02:53:02.070
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be more likely that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to lose my brain function and I'm </v>

3577
02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:02.890
<v Speaker 4>going to change my behavior in older </v>
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>

3578
02:53:02.891 --> 02:53:05.230
<v Speaker 4>And that is terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying,</v>

3579
02:53:05.540 --> 02:53:06.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3580
02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:07.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the exercise,</v>

3581
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:10.350
<v Speaker 4>it's becoming like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3582
02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:13.270
<v Speaker 4>I think people still really think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it in terms of,</v>

3583
02:53:13.550 --> 02:53:16.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>losing weight and it's just,</v>

3584
02:53:16.211 --> 02:53:18.070
<v Speaker 4>it's doing so much more.</v>

3585
02:53:18.130 --> 02:53:19.870
<v Speaker 4>It's doing so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3586
02:53:20.350 --> 02:53:21.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3587
02:53:21.250 --> 02:53:26.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm really glad that people do it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lose weight because at least they're </v>

3588
02:53:26.250 --> 02:53:26.250
<v Speaker 4>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3589
02:53:26.250 --> 02:53:28.450
<v Speaker 4>but they even just like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks ago,</v>

3590
02:53:28.451 --> 02:53:33.451
<v Speaker 4>a study came out showing that exercise </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally causes your muscle cells to </v>

3591
02:53:33.671 --> 02:53:36.970
<v Speaker 4>detoxify something that we made called </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

3592
02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:41.320
<v Speaker 4>which is actually a byproduct of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tryptophan metabolism trip to fan,</v>

3593
02:53:41.410 --> 02:53:44.140
<v Speaker 4>as I've talked about before in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations.</v>

3594
02:53:44.141 --> 02:53:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3595
02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:46.500
<v Speaker 4>it was a precursor to Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3596
02:53:46.510 --> 02:53:49.990
<v Speaker 4>So tryptophan and has to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain and in order when it gets into the</v>

3597
02:53:49.991 --> 02:53:51.710
<v Speaker 4>brain and make serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3598
02:53:51.730 --> 02:53:54.310
<v Speaker 4>trippy fan can also form something </v>
<v Speaker 4>called [inaudible].</v>

3599
02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:56.560
<v Speaker 4>And when it forms [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3600
02:53:56.970 --> 02:54:01.970
<v Speaker 4>this happens under conditions of stress </v>
<v Speaker 4>or when you're in you,</v>

3601
02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:08.020
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when there's some sort of pathological </v>

3602
02:54:08.020 --> 02:54:08.020
<v Speaker 4>invader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

3603
02:54:08.020 --> 02:54:09.460
<v Speaker 4>it's an important part of the Immuno </v>
<v Speaker 4>Immuno immunological response.</v>

3604
02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:12.430
<v Speaker 4>So kindness is important to make t </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulatory cells.</v>

3605
02:54:12.430 --> 02:54:12.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3606
02:54:12.731 --> 02:54:15.160
<v Speaker 4>you obviously want to be able to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this response mechanism.</v>

3607
02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:17.950
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you make too much kinder running,</v>

3608
02:54:18.490 --> 02:54:22.150
<v Speaker 4>not only his trip to fan not being made </v>
<v Speaker 4>into Serotonin in the brain because it's</v>

3609
02:54:22.151 --> 02:54:25.210
<v Speaker 4>getting sucked into this other pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in addition,</v>

3610
02:54:25.211 --> 02:54:30.211
<v Speaker 4>kind uranian can cross the blood brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>barrier and it conformed something </v>

3611
02:54:30.211 --> 02:54:32.050
<v Speaker 4>called quinolinic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like a neurotoxin.</v>

3612
02:54:32.051 --> 02:54:35.710
<v Speaker 4>It literally causes too much glutamate </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be released and it causes et Cetera,</v>

3613
02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:40.720
<v Speaker 4>toxicity in cell death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it activates Microglia so it causes </v>

3614
02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:41.320
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you already have amyloid Beta plaques</v>

3615
02:54:41.321 --> 02:54:43.660
<v Speaker 4>in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great more activation of Microglia.</v>

3616
02:54:43.661 --> 02:54:48.661
<v Speaker 4>You're going to keep making more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like feeding into that already </v>

3617
02:54:48.661 --> 02:54:51.600
<v Speaker 4>terrible cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So exercise causes muscle cells to like </v>

3618
02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:56.310
<v Speaker 4>convert that kind urinating into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>another byproduct that can't get into </v>

3619
02:54:56.310 --> 02:54:58.930
<v Speaker 4>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're talking about another way that</v>

3620
02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:01.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise is protecting the brain.</v>

3621
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:06.990
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these study that was published in </v>

3622
02:55:06.990 --> 02:55:07.010
<v Speaker 4>cell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they found that these mice that they did</v>

3623
02:55:07.070 --> 02:55:12.070
<v Speaker 4>this in mouse models when they injected </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mice with Kenya earning it got into </v>

3624
02:55:12.681 --> 02:55:15.770
<v Speaker 4>the brain and caused all this neuro </v>
<v Speaker 4>toxicity sort of effects,</v>

3625
02:55:15.771 --> 02:55:19.040
<v Speaker 4>but it also costs depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>caused them to have depression,</v>

3626
02:55:19.041 --> 02:55:20.470
<v Speaker 4>which of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3627
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:25.870
<v Speaker 4>inflammation in the brain depletes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability of the brain to release </v>

3628
02:55:25.870 --> 02:55:28.700
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin and that's one aspect of how </v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammations causing depression.</v>

3629
02:55:28.910 --> 02:55:33.910
<v Speaker 4>So you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not making serotonin cause </v>

3630
02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:36.221
<v Speaker 4>depressive symptoms in these mice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they do all sorts of little studies </v>

3631
02:55:36.221 --> 02:55:36.860
<v Speaker 4>where they look at exploratory behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all sorts of things in little mice.</v>

3632
02:55:36.861 --> 02:55:41.861
<v Speaker 4>Obviously humans are way more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then so when they made the mice </v>

3633
02:55:42.801 --> 02:55:46.400
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the depressive symptoms went away.</v>

3634
02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:49.250
<v Speaker 4>The neuro toxicity that did better on </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning and memory test.</v>

3635
02:55:49.251 --> 02:55:52.190
<v Speaker 4>So yet another reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3636
02:55:52.191 --> 02:55:55.130
<v Speaker 4>exercise is freaking awesome for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

3637
02:55:55.370 --> 02:56:00.370
<v Speaker 4>for depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me to make sure I'm not going to get</v>

3638
02:56:00.381 --> 02:56:02.710
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for everybody,</v>

3639
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:03.560
<v Speaker 4>for everybody,</v>

3640
02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:05.340
<v Speaker 1>we're out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

3641
02:56:05.341 --> 02:56:08.760
<v Speaker 1>we just rattled through three hours at </v>
<v Speaker 1>an accelerated rate.</v>

3642
02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just blasted through.</v>

3643
02:56:10.950 --> 02:56:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in a trance,</v>

3644
02:56:12.690 --> 02:56:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you were in a information disseminating </v>
<v Speaker 1>trans.</v>

3645
02:56:16.830 --> 02:56:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly hope people learn stuff.</v>

3646
02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I barely learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to go over it </v>

3647
02:56:24.300 --> 02:56:24.330
<v Speaker 1>again with a notepad and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to google the shit out of it.</v>

3648
02:56:24.331 --> 02:56:29.331
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we got a lot out of this to </v>
