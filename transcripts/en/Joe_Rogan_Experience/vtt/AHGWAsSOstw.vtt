1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.580
Absolutely not.
Never washed it.
Anybody know it?

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.560
Let me know where we live that we're actually live.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.060
We're on the air right now.
Eddie Bravo is here.
Is You Brah.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.120
Hello?
Brian Mother.
Yes,
I am.
And Brendan,
sharpest.

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.820
Perfect terrier.
I fucked up but too much Steven in the coffee though.
Oh yeah.

6
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.980
You just take this one and uh,
I trust your spit.

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.050
I hope you don't have herpes and just go back and forth with mine because

8
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:32.940
there's none in there.
And then we'll,

9
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.330
we'll make a concoction both for the both of us,
Bro.

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
Split up a concoction.
Just do it.
You're a scientist.
You could snort Stevia.

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.320
Yeah,
you can't if that dude.
Yeah.

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.970
And remember Diego Sanchez got really into that for awhile with Dan Quinn as

13
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.130
Diego Sanchez got really into Dang Quinn's Stevia thing.

14
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.340
Like he was going to melt fat with Stevia and cure cancer and go to the moon.

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.430
Just a guy out there.
His name was Dan Quinn,

16
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.920
who believes that Stevia can change the world.
Tell me how that big brown

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.770
companion chocolatey Mankous hell yeah.
All right.

18
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.180
So I'm going for taste like a chocolate.
He man,

19
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:13.860
mankind that if you're listening to this podcast,

20
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:18.300
we're watching the fights live from Germany.
They play at noon in La.

21
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:23.301
So we all got out of our comfy beds and beautiful wives arms and embraces and

22
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:26.400
came here to watch dudes fight.
We're not going to be watching the fights.

23
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.160
You want to know what happened?
We don't know better.

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.000
We'll be talking about subjects that belong in a 14 year olds,
treehouse.

25
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.550
That's essentially what we talk about.
Yeah.
The other thing about muscles did,

26
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:40.050
Greg might eventually get to some of these fights.

27
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:44.160
I want to talk about a liter Latifa and uh,
Ryan Bader.
When that fight happens,

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.360
tough fight.
That dude,
that dude scaries fuck that.

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.700
Latifa can bomb.

30
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.940
He can throw some punches and he's a tank because it has been known to eat a

31
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:57.930
couple.
That's,
that's it's just,
it does nothing for bait or either.
Yeah.

32
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:01.650
But baiters fought well against certain guys that are like powerful,
scary guys.

33
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.690
He just really fucked up against rumble.

34
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.620
But you're looking at that to bet against him.
He just made a giant mirror.
Yeah.

35
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.720
You can't blame.
I mean she,

36
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.420
what rumble just did the glow over that low like weird.

37
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.050
He had the ankle pickled pig

38
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.860
brains and I think he just took a chance at something weird.

39
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.800
Like hoping maybe it would work out.
Can't do.

40
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.110
I think you also maybe like had a moment,
you know in there.
Oh Shit.

41
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.310
Oh yeah,
that's not James.

42
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.390
Tony don't do the same game plan Randy couture had against James.

43
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.930
Anthony Johnson went ha punch him right in the face.
Not only that,

44
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:40.440
he controlled him on the ground till he punched him in the face and eventually

45
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:43.700
got them flatten down on his,
on his stomach.
He just stepped up with.

46
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.400
That might be the worst place in the world to be flattened out on your stomach

47
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.450
underneath rumble Johnson.
There is,
there is a,
uh,

48
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.140
like that's probably,
that is the worst place.
That's right next to that dude.

49
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.650
Got His arm trapped in the Rock and how to saw it off.
Yeah.
And also

50
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.440
<v 1>in a small crocodiles that's worse or standing right in front of him like
clover.</v>

51
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.260
Oh God.
Well glue over.
Just try to put that pressure on him.
Hey Man,
dude,

52
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.950
you can't walk forward.
You just see an upper cut.
Do you remember that?

53
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.140
Do you remember that white supremist where they had his brother in jail and in

54
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:25.330
protest.
He videotaped himself,
sawing his home,

55
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.200
his own handoff.
So hit.
Yup.
He had a camera on and he goes,

56
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.740
I want to show you guys something.
Essentially basically showing them that he,

57
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:35.170
that they had no control of him,
that he,
his mind was stronger than us

58
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.570
and just cut his own hand off.
Would you like to go with that same premise?
Jamie,

59
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.800
pull that up.
I need to see this.
Yeah.
My cousin brother ended up for me.

60
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:48.370
I feel like,
uh,
talk off off the air.

61
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.120
I want to send them Marcin held and a tay young bang t hung bay is from Korea.

62
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.870
He's a Korean cowboy.
He said Marcin held a lot of adolescent girl.
I'm sorry,

63
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.590
Nick Heine.
You know what Marcin held?
Just got signed.
I was up.

64
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.970
I was actually going to bring that up.

65
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.870
These jugs just got signed over from Bella tour.
Very hesitant here ladies.

66
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:15.460
And he's a really good foot lock guy.
Hug leg lock really,
really good.

67
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.730
Yeah.
I don't know why I confuse all white people.

68
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.440
I think all white people look the same.
They too.
Especially for athletes,

69
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.210
super racist when it comes to white people,
the whites to the whites,

70
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.440
white people from other countries where they talk word all the same.
Yeah.

71
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:32.790
That that can never be racist.
White people look the

72
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.290
be trouble.
Even Mexicans.
Yup.

73
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.780
A black person could say white people look the same to me on TV and nobody gives

74
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:48.310
a shit.
Not Exactly.
Exactly.
You'd have to be like,

75
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.900
you'd have to be really,

76
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:53.740
really funny and it'd have to be a really obvious joke for you to use any other

77
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:56.930
race if you were,
especially if you were white guy.
Sam.

78
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.890
Sam Probably has that joke where he goes,
he'll say,
he'll be like,
um,

79
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.450
I lost Bobby Lee and to Korean day parade.

80
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.000
You ever lose a Korean Korean and a Korean parade?

81
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.600
It's like looking for a needle in a needle stack.
Come on.
That's fine.

82
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.180
It was funny and it is true to this certain,
sir,
I'm not going to say it's true,

83
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:17.110
but I am saying it's funny,

84
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.640
there's certain races that it's share so many similarities like as far as like

85
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:26.510
their uh,
their mannerisms or their,
um,
their features and stuff.
I mean it's,

86
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.650
there's so much variety in like America,
right?

87
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:31.840
Because we come from so many different parts of the world mixing.

88
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.910
You thought of us as a country,
which,
you know,

89
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:35.830
we are a country but we're not a country.
Like,

90
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.210
like say if you wanted to go and meet some Colombians you were in Colombia,

91
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.340
most of them are going to look like Columbia.
You know what I mean?

92
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:46.690
They have a very distinct look to them,
especially the women baby.
Well,
China,

93
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:49.330
China,
very much like China with the,

94
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.380
I think in China to have that many people speaking mandarin,
which had to do,

95
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:56.490
I think with the Yangzi and the Yellow River,
we could,
they could trade and,

96
00:05:56.491 --> 00:05:57.770
and you know,
ideas.

97
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 0>And so it,
and plus I think they were pretty isolated.
So you're right,</v>

98
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.720
there wasn't as much,
you know,
immigration and mixed that United States.
I mean,

99
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.790
everybody's fucking,
everybody not only done,

100
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.940
it's never been like this before where there's 300 million people when we,

101
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.140
we vary so much and were more varied now than ever before.
Like they say,

102
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.481
what is it like that,

103
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:19.730
I think they said 20 more years and white people are going to be a minority.

104
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.700
It's fascinating.
Yeah.

105
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.630
It's just the Chinese and already can say Asian and Mexicans will be the

106
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:28.730
minority in America.
Correct.
Well,

107
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:31.730
China's film market is neck and neck with the United States now,

108
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.980
cause I mean China's expendables 19 nope.

109
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.080
They're making their own movies and they're building huge movie studios also

110
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:42.470
using our old like special own such a hit now over there.

111
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.260
Like they just found him.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Well it's just,

112
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.480
it's interesting man.
It's interesting that this world is sort of,

113
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.130
it's in some places it's not sort of meshing with the,
with everything else,

114
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:59.150
but in most places people are spreading out and sort of like integrating with

115
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:01.280
each other.
I remember when I was little,
my dad gets,

116
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:05.300
so I was like four or five and we'd see an Asian person.
I'd say,

117
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.210
Oh look at that Chinese got,
you know it's something I'd say some shit.
He's like,

118
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.080
he's not Korean.
I'm fucking five man.
That's what I do.

119
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.570
Can't tell the difference between the eyes.
I do.

120
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.630
Dad got mad at you it that when you were five.
Even today,

121
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.960
even today he's from Korea and day.

122
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.080
Maybe it should make sense like you should learn to my man.
It's tough.

123
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.710
I've never been over there.
Like I can tell a difference between like a Korean,

124
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.220
a Japanese person now my favorite number.

125
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.360
So my favorite thing to do is take clothes.
Yeah.

126
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.020
I love drawing a distinction and alerting people to the fact that I know the

127
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:39.220
difference and then I'll give you a little history lesson on it.
Yeah,
you did.

128
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.030
I walk away feeling good about my city to do.

129
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.790
Greg Fitzsimmons does this thing on his,

130
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.040
in his show where he guesses the Asian calls,
a guest,
the Asian.

131
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.160
He's hard to people.
God bless him.
He's really good at it.
I bet if you're,

132
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:51.690
if you can tell the difference,
he can pick up.

133
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.000
He tells differentiating Philippinos and people from Bali.
I think that's easy.

134
00:07:56.001 --> 00:08:00.680
They're huge difference.
I think that's a skill my man took an x men power.
No,

135
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.030
if you're in America,
it is.

136
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.940
You know what's weird is like that America has only been around for like really

137
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:08.420
a few hundred years from the first settlers,
right?
First European settlers,

138
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.960
40 or something.
Yeah.
And then before that,
just one look,
right?

139
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:14.810
Like native American.
And then in that time,

140
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.670
like just the change of the landscape has been so drastic and just a short

141
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:22.430
amount of time.
You think about any other time in the world,

142
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:23.540
any other part of the world,

143
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.370
some someplace as big as the continental United States just gets transformed

144
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.920
over a couple hundred years and just want paypal.
Just fail

145
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.470
shit over.
What about Israel?
And that like,
wizards wrote small,
you know,

146
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.363
Israel's 10th,

147
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.040
1948 and it's a tiny place and they still look like all the people that hate

148
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:50.780
another deal.
I used to have that bit.
Remember that there's,
there's,

149
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.750
there's uh,

150
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.860
Brown skin dude with dark curlier hair throwing rocks at a brown skin dude with

151
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:56.100
dark

152
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.890
<v 2>curly hair holding a machine gun.
I go,
what's going on?</v>

153
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.060
How do you guys look exactly like the Chinese words that

154
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.980
tennis match between the Williams sisters?
Who the fuck is zoo?

155
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.620
What's he going crazy or what's even crazier?
They believe in the same God.

156
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.070
They believe in the same God and basically the Koran says that everything in
the,

157
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.780
in the Old Testament is true.
So even the grand says that's the first book.

158
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.600
Then they had a problem with the new testament,
but it's kind of wild.
Sure.

159
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.940
Figure it out.
It's just territory.
Territory.

160
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.220
Well there's no way you going to figure it out cause you want to make your

161
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:29.950
parents happy and you know they have a set of rules and you grew up with them

162
00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:31.800
and you start raising your kid that way.

163
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.600
And then those all those ancient ideas about who those people that you don't

164
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:39.540
know our versus these people next to you that you don't know.
Well,

165
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.000
these people were on my side of the dirt and those people are and that side of

166
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:45.870
the door and we believe a certain type of wacky shit and they believe it's a

167
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:48.870
different type of work.
He Shit,
I mean they have their problems over there,

168
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:50.130
but we have prompts here to like,

169
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.580
have you seen how the Kaepernick situation escalated?
Yes.
In that.

170
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:57.420
Explain that to me.
So,
so Kaepernick won't stand for like explain who he is.
Uh,

171
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.440
Colin Kaepernick is uh,
the starting quarterback for the San Francisco 40 niners.

172
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.590
He's African American and mixed with something else.

173
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:06.750
So he's lighter skinned and he was adopted.

174
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:11.400
He was raised by white parents and so he was a big time core back playing like

175
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.650
shit lately.
But he was a big time quarterback.

176
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:17.850
Refuses to stand for the national anthem because says is people are pressed and

177
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.400
the cop treatment,
stuff like that.

178
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.550
And then a picture came out that he wore them a while ago.

179
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:26.700
These socks with a cops has pigs on him.

180
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:31.170
You want him to practice a while ago before he made this stance.
And so that's,

181
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.060
that photo had been brought back out.
So now the cops in Santa Clara are saying,

182
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.600
we're not working the games anymore unless you guys do some about Kapnik we're

183
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.750
not working in the games anymore.
So the cops were taking a protest now,

184
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:44.430
which to me is like,

185
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.020
it's definitely not the right thing to do cause he has freedom of speech,
right?

186
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.350
Yeah.
You know,
first amendment he can do that whether you agree with it or not,

187
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.300
but the cops like now you've got your sinking,
his left,
you're going to be vague,

188
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.270
big nutrition to not do your job because you don't like a guy's opinion.

189
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.300
Cops or cops I work games are off duty police officers.
That's a good point.

190
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.830
So they're doing it,
they're doing it for extra money.

191
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.590
It's kind of like they're just doing it cause you know,
they,

192
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.960
they enjoy the game and they want to keep the fucking San Francisco 40 another

193
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.300
shape.

194
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.450
Well they're going to exercise their right and then the is going to exercise his

195
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:17.940
right and somewhere in the middle something's got to have to complete nightmare

196
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:21.270
though.
It's not good.
You know,
it's not a good,

197
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.050
it's not a smart platform for all this because I agree it's all going to get

198
00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.450
lost in the noise is a real point.

199
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.200
If he has a real point about what he doesn't like about the way the United

200
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.640
States is going or the way our country is being led [inaudible] that's not,

201
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.830
it gets a lot of people paying attention,

202
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.180
but it's just going to get a lot of hate.

203
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.240
But it does nothing like you're not changing anything by not standing for the

204
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:43.950
anthem during the national football.

205
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.360
He liked the cops still going to be the cops and the black girls still me a

206
00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:47.620
press.

207
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.640
You're really not changing all these starting the dialogue he thinks and when

208
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:54.370
you're young and you know and you have a strong ego and you feel like you're in

209
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:57.880
a position of quote unquote leadership,
you feel like you can,

210
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.540
you can make a stand.
It's a clumsy,
maybe a little clumsy on his pipe clamps,

211
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.950
but now you have other players don't do the same thing.
What he wanted though.

212
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.300
Why would he say all that?
He wants this mission accomplished.
Well,

213
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.070
it's not working because everyone's talking about,
well,

214
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.050
but they'd be realized it was going to be like this.
Well,
I think he kinda did,

215
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.010
but the big issue is he's just not playing very good at football.

216
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:21.700
So now the niners if they release them,
they're going to get so much flack.
Oh,

217
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:23.650
that's fucking racist because this,
no,
no,
no,
no.

218
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:26.950
He just kept on fucking football and I bet they won't.
I bet they won't.

219
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:29.980
I bet the tougher thing will be him getting picked up by somebody else.

220
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.640
Like what team wants to take on that PR nightmare.
True.
You know,
and meet,

221
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.290
you're going to,
you're going to risk the,
the,

222
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.420
the ire of all the police unions that are working your games,
you know,

223
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.970
and all the people in your town,
they're going to say,
oh,
what was,

224
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.460
this is what our team's all about.
We're about taking this guy in.

225
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.890
What if you went to more African American market like Atlanta,
Philadelphia,

226
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.070
you don't do it.
But he'd be,

227
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:55.240
I wonder if most African Americans see when you don't stand for the national

228
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:57.060
anthem,
which is,
you know,

229
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.730
the United States versus government or government or a government policy.

230
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.660
Those things can be separate.
I the,
yeah,
he says that.

231
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:07.810
He says so now instead of just sitting on the bench,

232
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:09.310
he takes a knee because he goes,

233
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.830
I'm not doing this against the soldiers that I have friends.

234
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:13.120
My uncle was in the military,

235
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.750
so now it takes a knee and had a like former navy seal and next to him and

236
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:20.020
hugged him after he goes,
I'm doing it because the way that I made out.
Yeah,

237
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:24.370
that'd been dope.
He's just trying to make just a shit to this for gays as well,

238
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.140
just over the top for everybody.

239
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.110
He's trying to bring attention to something he felt strongly about.

240
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.250
And the question is,
is it,
like you said,
the best venue,

241
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.080
well,
it's,
maybe it's talking about getting people talking about it.

242
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.150
Obviously you want it to be loud about it and this is loud as fuck.

243
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.670
Even grew up powerful Afro,
I think he loves it.
Powerful Afro.
Maybe.

244
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.630
I think it's tough,
right?
Well,
yeah,
that's the thing.
Like if you,

245
00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:53.500
you got to be playing real well to have a fucked up opinion.
Tom Brady.

246
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.080
Well cool man.
Yeah Dude.
Your thing with him,
it's like fuck,

247
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.510
he's not even the starter probably and he's going to be paid $19 million this

248
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.620
year.
So that might have a little bit to do with him getting cut to,

249
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.200
that's what I'm saying is contracting is unfilled plays the bigger issue.
If,

250
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.460
if you're calling,
that's a tremendous amount of money.
A lot of money.

251
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.170
He signed $114 million contract to Lord.
What?
Brendan,
when he,

252
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:21.190
when if at a 19 million after agents and taxes,
what do you think he sees?

253
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.760
I mean,
19 millions.
That's his guarantee signing bonus.
Right?

254
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:27.330
So agents take 10% and the taxes,
I mean he,

255
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.810
he sees a shitload of money and he's about 10 mil,
but maybe,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

256
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.000
because you're to,
you got figure it out.
These probably in the 48% tax bracket.

257
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.690
It's probably as a manager,
an agent and a lawyer.
And there's a lot of ships.

258
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:44.530
He's about distributed,
but don't get it twisted.
He awesome.

259
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.030
This is just part of the contract.
He's rich as fuck.
Cause he had,

260
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.310
this is this third contract or second is second.

261
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:54.050
So before that he's already making money.

262
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.380
Was He better before was you had to play everything.
He took him to the,

263
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.150
to the conference finals and the playoffs,
you know.

264
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.960
So when did it start going bad for him?
From,

265
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.070
from my insiders who actually someone worked for San Francisco 40 niners they

266
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:07.904
were saying it,

267
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.970
it really went bad for him because he was like a really athletic quarterback and

268
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:14.540
no one could really pick up his style of play.
And once they figured it out,

269
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.380
he was a guy who was on social media all the time and he got all the negativity

270
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:19.550
got to him.
So he was,

271
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:23.660
he's a sensitive dude and just all the critique and from the media and everyone

272
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:27.260
else really got to them.
So He's lost weight.
He's changed his stolen motion.

273
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.160
He doesn't run anymore is he's all because the hour now,

274
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.340
social media fucked with them.
They're saying that that's just just this wave.

275
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.240
Like you let the criticism get to them.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.

276
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.300
The haters right now are going,
why the trolls?

277
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.010
We got 'em he starts $19 million people.
Yeah,

278
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:50.630
but if he's losing weight and feel nervous,
they win 100% yeah.

279
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.070
Losing weight.
How old is he?
How old is he?
He might be 26

280
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.010
how old is Jamie?
26 there is so much money on your shit.

281
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.510
Nevada twice.
First of all,

282
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.950
asking a 26 year old 20th stance about global issues.
Why?

283
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.030
While they're in the middle of a professional athletic career,

284
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.120
lot at the highest level,
which demands,
you know as much as anybody.

285
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.370
If you're playing professional football,

286
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:19.710
tell us how much fucking that demands of your day.
There's a course,

287
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.120
especially as a quarterback,
you're the man of your day.
Oh Man.
In season,
I mean

288
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.790
you're talking full time.
I mean nine to five doesn't count.

289
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.970
You've talked about endless hours of studying practice.

290
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.830
You're the leader of the strength and conditioning drills.
Plyo.
Those video.

291
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.210
Lee really learn the film room more than anyone.

292
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.870
Breakdown tape and how tired are you?
All the time.
I'm exhausted.
Exhausted.

293
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:45.860
Especially a guy like that who he relies on his athleticism and get the place

294
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:47.780
done,
but then it fell.
Felt doesn't work like that.

295
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.370
You have to use your brain at the passport.

296
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.470
How many players per team would you say?
Cause they have a book,
right?

297
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.690
I mean you're talking thousands,
thousands of plants that they have to now.
Yes.

298
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.820
To know the whole doesn't have time to be studying global issues.
No.
That's why.

299
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.140
That's why he's playing like shit.

300
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.870
It'd be way more powerful if he played well was a starter,

301
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.620
started winning games and then came out and did this maybe after the season two

302
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:14.120
there's no 26 year olds.

303
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:18.110
It's built to handle the kind of pressure that comes being that famous in a big

304
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:22.220
football player and then on top of that supporting some sort of a global issue

305
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.630
like some,
some sort of a national issue on,
on the United States,

306
00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:28.280
like the state of the United States,

307
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.730
you're going to make an official state managing.
It's putting up,

308
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:31.700
putting a lot on your plate.

309
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.380
I know I shouldn't be making an official statement today and I'm almost

310
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.040
not ready yet.
I'm back.

311
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.610
I can't imagine what he's dealing with the Haiti.
I'm sure it is,
you know,

312
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:47.240
support from a lot of people,
but a lot of it is a lot of,
it's negative.

313
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.190
Then you've got to get ready for a football game.
It's make or break.

314
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.040
I played poorly.
It's going to get,

315
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.580
it's going to get negative real quick and from all sides,
right?
I mean,
yeah.
No,

316
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.950
I don't think from all sides.
I mean,
I think,
you know,

317
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.730
African American people are pretty proud of them and certain aspect,
you know,

318
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.080
well,
some people proud of them too,

319
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:07.440
that feel like things aren't the way they should be in this country.

320
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.470
And at least this guy used that platform and took a chance.
Correct.

321
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.150
But I think you're dead right.

322
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:16.890
And that the real problem is you got to be playing really fucking good to pull

323
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:20.190
something like that off.
Like people don't want to just listen to you.
If you're,

324
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:21.560
you're ruining and you're going to go,

325
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.140
me is going to be so much pressure on him every time he does Pli,

326
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.770
it's people are going to be psyched if he gets nailed.
Yeah.
What's,

327
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.680
what's the pressure?
I mean,
he watches a couple of youtube videos and I mean,

328
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:35.400
there's not like something that he's got to study it or socks.
So what,

329
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:36.950
what is he doing?
You know what you mean?
Tweet.

330
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.810
He has the entire San Francisco 40 niners organization on his back to win games.

331
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.030
And if he doesn't perform the,
he's gonna lose his job.
Yeah.
Yeah.

332
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.900
I mean,
it's a tough game.
It's a tough Gig,
man.
You don't feel bad about them any?

333
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.410
No,
but he's got money because he's black ridges.

334
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.490
Shit,
super famous and he wants this attention.

335
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.310
Why else would he wear those socks if Tom Brady wore those socks?

336
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.590
The whole arena would be yelling.
Fuck the police.
Right.
Tom Brady's white though.

337
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.920
Exactly.
He's today though.
I think they would turn on him or thing.

338
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:14.910
They turn it down.
Tom Brady,
you just bullshit.
You can't do anything wrong.

339
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.680
He would turn on him.
You can't do anything wrong.

340
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.190
England wouldn't murder someone and they'd be like,
yeah,

341
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:24.510
what can you do it like even with us,
tell us the whole story.
And he did murder.

342
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.290
Well probably lift off.
You know like even with her and Hernandez,

343
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.370
the guy who's a straight up murder,
they were like,
I mean if he gets out,

344
00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:35.190
we'll take him.
He's such a good player.
We were was like,
I mean,

345
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:37.320
we wouldn't be mad if he gets,
he's such a good player.

346
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.750
They just want to win fucking football games in New England.

347
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.960
That's how good of a place where I went to the murderer.

348
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.190
You know what the Patriots might sell you for saying that they'd probably agree

349
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:50.580
with you now that I can see how it goes.
I'm trying to win games here.

350
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.200
Jesus Christ.

351
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.640
Neil Brennan has a fucking hilarious bit about football and I can't do it

352
00:19:56.641 --> 00:19:57.950
without doing it.
You know,

353
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.440
I can't like give you like the premise of it is talking about why football

354
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:04.980
players do fucked up shit.
It is hilarious.

355
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:07.740
He's my favorite guest on your podcast.
Is He really by far?

356
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:11.700
I think he's the most creative fucking he's,
I've never met him in person,

357
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.040
but dude,
he's great.
That's brilliant.
Very,
very smart.
So creative.

358
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.170
Get them in the fighter and the kid.
Yeah,
you guys love him.
He's awesome.
God,

359
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:23.670
he's talented.
So talented.
There was football,
but he did last night.
I was crying.

360
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.320
Really crying.
Okay.
I can't do it because it'll give away the bit,
but it's very,

361
00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:33.000
very old.
I finally watched the roast with Jim Ross with a big boy.

362
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:38.010
What's his name?
The,
the,
a big fat Guy Ralphie may be for his feelings got hurt.

363
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.860
I heard it was bad.
Dude.
I can't watch.
Dude.
I mean,

364
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.980
he got a,
it's a roast battle,
Ralph,

365
00:20:44.981 --> 00:20:49.981
he's going through a divorce and these people just fucking dope that the fucking

366
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:55.510
hammer and recall coffin.
The guy goes,
well,
you've lost your,

367
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.710
had itself like that.
You've lost your wife,
your career.
You can't sell tickets.

368
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.710
You've,
you know,
you've lost everything.
Only thing you have.

369
00:21:01.711 --> 00:21:06.340
It lost his weight motherfucker.
And it was like,
Oh,
I like that style because he,

370
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.610
he set us just all rose though.
Don't get involved in it.

371
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.170
She wears those Ding Ralphie may,
it was a,

372
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:18.980
Ralphie may wrote what I wrote,
John Roast each other years.

373
00:21:18.981 --> 00:21:22.450
He roast battle and so hilarious show.
Yeah.
They have it at the comedy store.

374
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:23.430
You've got to come.
And I love it.

375
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.380
They do it at the comedy store on Tuesday nights and they do it late at night.

376
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.470
And uh,
I think it starts at like midnight,
right?
I'm not sure,
isn't it?

377
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.580
But your boy Tony Hinchcliffe tore it up too.

378
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.240
It's just some of the funniest young up and coming kids and just adults,

379
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:38.950
I should say.
Some of them are like for whatever reason,

380
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:40.870
deepen their thirties there's some people,

381
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.950
some 50 year old people that are on roads battle.
They have great judges to yeah,

382
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.150
and they have comics judge it and then they'll,
they'll do like one,
you know,

383
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:52.660
one joke and the other person will do it in a joke against them and they go back

384
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:55.600
and forth and then the audience decides who got who better.

385
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.020
It's so creative and like Tony Hinchcliffe,
I guess he,

386
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.700
he does a podcast at the comedy store on Monday nights or something like that,

387
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:04.840
whatever it is.
And he texts me and goes,
cop killed Tony Killed Tony.
Yeah.

388
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:08.890
He texted me his,
hey man,
when he come by and do the podcast,
and I went,
oh no,

389
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:11.830
do the show.
And when I'm down to do like a podcast,

390
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:16.570
but I'm not letting you just roast the shit out of me.
It's to how to come.

391
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:19.450
I'm not good at roasting other people.
Like I'm not good at those comebacks.

392
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:21.200
I also,
you want everybody to love you.

393
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.310
You don't want to be mean to be on to hurt anybody's feelings for you.

394
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.690
Be it after you are.
Tony would eat you.
I can't.
I can't help people.

395
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.910
Even if I had a good tape put I put down,

396
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:35.860
I couldn't tell it was Tony would eat you
like a cannibal.

397
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.870
Brian Moses,
the guy who hosts it is perfect.
Yeah,
he's hilarious.

398
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.130
It's a great show.
You know?
It's tough on that because obviously they're,

399
00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:47.530
they're going based off each other.

400
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:50.080
You volleying back and forth telling jokes and roasting each other,

401
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.490
but when someone has a horrible,

402
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.140
you're like just a great roast and the other one's not ready there.
When it,

403
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.630
when a roast is bad,
it's bad.
That's why your,

404
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.480
your eyes are close together and the crowds like,

405
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.690
it's just dead silent.
I'm like,
Oh God.
I heard,

406
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:13.030
come watch it.
Get knocked outside.
I don't like to come.
He Central,

407
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:17.110
I'm sure it's on Youtube,
but Whoopi Goldberg was a coaching or she was a judge.

408
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.940
Man.
It was tough.
What was tough?
Whoopi Goldberg,

409
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.900
her commentary and everything.
Like she just,
she just out of the loop,

410
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:29.770
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
She's a grandma and the mic.
Yeah.

411
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.080
That's 100% where she was doing.

412
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.830
It's funny how people can ride something great for a long time.

413
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.250
Like her first HBO special with Pretty,
was it really great.
Yeah,

414
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:42.610
it was really good.
Really,
really good theatrically.
It was excellent.

415
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.070
This mother fuckers an audition again.

416
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.781
<v 1>He's great.
All right.</v>

417
00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:52.781
Now with the producer while last night in Santa Monica with some good friends

418
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:55.400
and not take away from Brian's trying to get on the view right now.

419
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.700
The two things she did to get herself known on Hbo,
they were pretty amazing.

420
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.620
We'll be gold,
but yeah,
you can't take that away from her.

421
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:02.780
But I will say that then she did ghost,

422
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:06.200
but you can ride that shit for a long time.
Blacking out right now.

423
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.030
There's no air in this room

424
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.780
20 years ago it 20 years ago.
She's not doing,

425
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:16.940
she's not like in the comedy scene.
She does.

426
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.710
She's got a look that's very distinctive and she seems like a very friendly

427
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:22.730
person in America.

428
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:27.020
Took around a long time ago and she's sort of been in this steady coasting state

429
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.580
ever since then.
Well,
so when she goes and does something that demands like pop,

430
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.790
like these things,
or when she expresses herself on the view,

431
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.370
she's got an opinion.
It's not very succinct.

432
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.810
It's not like clear and sharp and like,
like well defined.

433
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.940
There's like a lot,
there's a lot of like laziness to it,
you know?

434
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.913
And it's not that,

435
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.540
I'm sure she's just a really wealthy woman who is,
you know,

436
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:54.260
set for life.
She doesn't have to worry about shit.
She dressed in that way too.

437
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.490
And when she's up there,

438
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:58.580
she's like casual and she's being herself so essential as fuck.

439
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:01.770
Just crocs on in some ways it's like you will,
you will,

440
00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:04.310
you you're getting is when you get a person that's like at that level,

441
00:25:04.311 --> 00:25:07.550
she's an Oscar winner.
Yeah,
she's over it.
She's like,
what's up?

442
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:11.330
I'm going to be [inaudible] have to do,
she even brought that up in the show.

443
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:15.450
She said,
I have Oscars.
I was like,

444
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.160
that's what she said was a roast.
But yeah,
when someone came at her,

445
00:25:19.161 --> 00:25:21.560
when her and Jelinek we're going at it and she was like,
who are you?

446
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.590
You know I have Oscars like that's her thing.
Like she says I have Oscars.

447
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.930
That's not fun.
You know what happens to it.
But that's what you'd been known.

448
00:25:26.931 --> 00:25:31.160
Sometimes success can stop a lot of things.
So Bob Dylan was,

449
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:32.810
and he's produced a lot and been amazing,

450
00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:37.370
but they were going through like the lyrics that he was writing and stuff and

451
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:39.500
when he was younger that made him like a legend and he said,

452
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:43.190
and he literally went and that's something.
And they go,
what do you mean?
He goes,

453
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:46.700
I just don't that that was a different person back then who wrote that stuff.

454
00:25:46.701 --> 00:25:49.280
Like I could never do that again.
Can never replicate that again.

455
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.310
That magic that made me what I,
I am is gone.

456
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.810
So much of it was wanting to be heard so badly,
so much was can I even do this?

457
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.310
The wonder and the mystery of who am I and let me see if this African bear fruit

458
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.250
and when you get really wealthy and you get really famous and you become a

459
00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:04.641
legend,

460
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:08.090
it's very difficult to replicate that kinds of like Alan generous for me when

461
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:10.070
she was younger and doing standup.
Personally,

462
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:12.980
I love their stand up when she was younger and then I was thinking to myself,

463
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.430
you did,
you had this great Santa Queer and then you became a talk show host.

464
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.720
You make a fortune is really good at that,
but I just could never do that.

465
00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:23.090
That would be so boring to me.
Can you come to Harrison?

466
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.530
She's nice interview with her.

467
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.250
Her and Caitlin Jenner or Caitlyn Jenner was talking about how she doesn't

468
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:31.640
believe in gay marriage because there are more,
I'm more of a traditional lost,

469
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.950
so she's sitting there with a frozen face,
warfarin spreading.
Know

470
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.170
what the fuck are you talking about?

471
00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:44.070
Your FYS botox to cut and your jaws jaws missing.

472
00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:46.290
You're wearing lipstick,
there's all this.

473
00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.300
That's where a up there on the screen now.

474
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.900
All this craziness and she's saying that she's not in the gay marriage where she

475
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:54.930
wasn't in a gay marriage.
She's trying to change my partner now,

476
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.810
but because she's more of a traditionalist like you are,

477
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:02.430
a man thinks they're a woman.
There's nothing further from a traditionalist

478
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.490
insanity.
But Ellen Reich wrote her on it.
She's like,
how?

479
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.230
How can someone like you,
who's like,
it was faced so much discrimination?

480
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.620
How could you be against gay marriage?
And this is what my,

481
00:27:15.621 --> 00:27:18.030
my taking this Caitlyn Jenner thing that everybody's always been missing.

482
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.480
You're talking about a nonsense person.
You're talking about a male car dash.

483
00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.720
Correct.
This is what this is.
And we're having this national debate,

484
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.260
which is an important national debate because there's a spectrum of gender and

485
00:27:28.261 --> 00:27:31.710
there's some people that get stuck at some weird spots until like be mean about

486
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:35.950
those people because they're not a manly man like Brendan shop or a brand

487
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.730
council pride count or a girly girl,
you know,
like,
uh,

488
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.850
you know,
Katy Perry,

489
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.970
there's a lot of women and men that fall in these weird places.

490
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.570
But this is the wrong one to pay attention to.
Yes.
This is crazy.

491
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.710
I agree 100% this is,
I mean,
it's not a bad person,
you know,

492
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.160
they're not a horrible person.
She just go dashing.
Yeah.
But it's,
this is like,

493
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:00.090
this is what we've been dealing with when we're talking about like putting focus

494
00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:03.340
on people for no reason whatsoever other than the fact that his camera on the

495
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:08.350
people also get bullied into being super supportive and a completely a fanatic

496
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:11.940
on that side instead of having an objective fair,

497
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.540
critical point of view.
Like it's weird.
Or like,
man,

498
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:19.740
and now she's not that impressive.
What you did in 1976 was pretty impressive.

499
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:23.420
And whenever,
but so it's social media,
man,
social media,
the,

500
00:28:23.421 --> 00:28:25.950
the pressure and the amount of human beings that you're communicating with.

501
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.420
It's off the charts.
The numbers are crazy.
The numbers that you are,

502
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:32.520
you're interacting with on a daily basis.

503
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.940
If you have any sort of a point whatsoever,
like this football player dude,

504
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.990
if he has any sort of at a point that he wants to make,
dude,
you're,

505
00:28:39.991 --> 00:28:44.550
you're dealing with literally millions of people throwing their opinions your

506
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:46.590
way and it's a storm and you can't,

507
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.700
you can't like go outside in the rain and pick the rain drop that you're going

508
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:55.080
to communicate with essentially what he's doing when its opinions,

509
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.100
opinions are coming at him like rain.
Well,
but also look at hunger.

510
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:03.180
Who's the comedian from Ghostbusters?
The black girl chose these Jones.
She,

511
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.240
her shit got so bad.
Oh,
when she,

512
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.280
she goes acerbated that exacerbated by about naked.
No,
no,
no.

513
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.960
That was afterwards.
Yeah,
I know before went ham.

514
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.780
I don't know if it's the same people.
I mean,

515
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:17.580
obviously somebody leaked her naked photos,

516
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.750
but they'll leak your naked photos too if you leave them on iCloud.
Stupid.
Yeah,

517
00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:25.170
for sure.
Yeah.
They'll only everyone's naked photos.
You leave a dick on iCloud.

518
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:28.530
That shit.
All my Dick Pics are,
I'm pretty proud of that.

519
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:31.320
She interacted with some of those people and she did.
It came,

520
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:35.580
it was poorly thought out the warrant and then this guy that she's new to it too

521
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:37.180
though,
right?
Yeah,
she is new to it.

522
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:42.250
It's the most fuss sideways rain baby cause a fucking hurricane out your door.

523
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.990
Go out there and find a raindrop,

524
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.090
but I feel like successful people don't pay attention to.

525
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:47.890
Most of that's bullshit.
Some people do.

526
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.900
Tyron Woodley apparently has been paying attention to it.

527
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:52.780
I've been reading on the shit about Tyron reading all these haters,

528
00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:55.540
tweets and always people that be,
I don't know man.

529
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.120
Maybe someone needs talked to him.
Maybe he doesn't mind.

530
00:29:58.121 --> 00:30:00.610
Maybe he zoomed in as a psychological exercise,

531
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:04.640
but he's talking to all these people that are being racist to him.

532
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.360
He needs to focus on Wonderboy.
Not only that,

533
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:09.830
when you find out when they find out that you'll,

534
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:13.320
you're paying attention on its word freaks you out like this cabarnet guy and is

535
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.590
losing weight and he'd fucking can't throw around anymore.
Just too many of them.

536
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:18.670
Man.
It's too many people,

537
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.720
especially in negative and that can affect the celebrity in that fashion.

538
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.210
Also fucking tribe.
It's natural.

539
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.660
It's as natural as a virus natural at.
Yeah.

540
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:33.780
There's a certain amount of people that they got a fucking shit hand in life and

541
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.840
they are who they are through a series of bad decisions and life circumstances

542
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:39.130
and genetics and all the above.

543
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.050
And they see a guy like Kaepernick that's making 50 million bucks over the next

544
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.490
couple of years
and they can do to,

545
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.390
has a bit of a nose but good looking dude.

546
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.350
And they come home every day and they run to that computer from their Mcdonald's

547
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:57.940
job with the fucking fry smell over there by their hands and they just start

548
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:02.550
praying all kinds of rude shit about,
hey buddy,
you get,
oh,
the article we read,

549
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:06.520
a Time magazine had a front page article and according to that off author in his

550
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:11.200
research,
a lot of that hate comes from,
oh,
I don't know,
kindergarten teachers,

551
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.460
doctors,
lawyers and people.
Your next door neighbor,
you would never imagine,

552
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:18.520
but they just have a mean streak.
Well,
they just said just one free.

553
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.110
They said it could come from anyone.

554
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.900
Like they'll just don't assume the guys in the basement of his mom's house

555
00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:25.420
jacking off.
Right.
I can literally come from anyone,

556
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.230
especially tapping it cause the San Francisco 49,
you might be a Seattle Fan.

557
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:30.800
You're like,
damn,
I'm going to hate it.
I might as well.
Right.

558
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.590
Have a doctor in Seattle.
Fuck this dude.

559
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.770
But gives you a free pass to the three pillars if another state,

560
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.160
because it was something about some people when nobody's looking to do something

561
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:43.870
outrageous,
forbidden.
Uh,
that would be totally out of character.
It's freeing,

562
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:46.870
right,
so they just want to do like,
it's almost like when you go,

563
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:49.290
when you're in a really in,
you're in an airplane,

564
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.360
you have to be quiet and seven you go to the bathroom and you're about to pay

565
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:55.350
and you look in the mirror and you go and you just do some weird face cause his

566
00:31:55.351 --> 00:32:00.100
ass,
he's fucking weird.
I maybe guys,
I don't know.
No,
you're definitely right.

567
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:01.990
Like I think people that are buttoned down all day,

568
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:05.920
like doctors and lawyers and people that have to put on a persona all day long,

569
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.280
those are the ones who want to hire Mr says and get them to shit on them and

570
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.370
smack them in the face when they don't do wacky stuff.

571
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:17.230
They've done a lot of studies on cultures that produce a lot of like shit videos

572
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:19.600
and these really perverse videos talking about the Japanese,

573
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.420
the Japanese and the Germans who tend to be very disciplined,

574
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:26.890
very authoritarian and very buttoned down in formal.
Well listen man,

575
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.090
when you got to do it all the time,
I can't lock them up.
Throw up.

576
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.820
He wants some extreme human beings.
Will they just want to be,

577
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:37.240
it was like they were talking about why would the row,
the Germans at one point,

578
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.980
who would the quote unquote most civilized side in the world,

579
00:32:39.981 --> 00:32:42.860
they read Girtha and everything else.
And they had,
and what happened?

580
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.940
It culminated with concentration camps and feeding people the gas chambers and

581
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:50.150
ovens.
Huh?
What,
what the fuck?
Meanwhile,

582
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:52.520
Alere Latifa is stepping towards a cage.

583
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:56.690
It's a video of him online really recently where he dead lifts.

584
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.200
What was it like 450 pounds,
33 times the temperature.

585
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.790
Scott Brennan.
Sean might not be able to do that.
Something ridiculous like that,

586
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:10.390
but he does 33 dead lifts with it for you watching your spark plug.

587
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:12.980
Check this motherfucker out.
Like what is the weight,
what does it say?

588
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:16.340
There were 40 33 times.
We'll get 440 pounds.
He does it.

589
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:19.130
33 fucking reps.
Um,

590
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:23.870
Mister mister jobs doing five 50 for 10 and do intense sets of that.

591
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.100
I could probably get close to,
I blow my ass.
I bet you could.

592
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.550
Is a big Oh dude.
Oh,
he's not doing,

593
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:36.080
continue doing them and then dropping them and then letting them go rent a shop.

594
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.780
We'll do that.
No.
Let me ask you this.

595
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.550
Is that the way the way to go with dead lifts?

596
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:43.700
Do you just let it go when it goes to d,
you don't lower it down?

597
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.310
Like why wouldn't you lower it down?
Yeah,
I lower it down.

598
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.400
Especially if I'm doing continuous reps.
That's a little weird.

599
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.040
I guess maybe saving energy joint,

600
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.690
but you're restarting every time so it's more work.
I feel like,

601
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.670
well maybe that's why they're doing it.
Maybe it's just,

602
00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.440
I mean obviously something thought up.
I thought he was going,
oh no,

603
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.180
he's letting it drop.
It's still impressive.
Not as passive.

604
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:07.100
He's doing that 33 Reps.
Bp was doing,

605
00:34:07.101 --> 00:34:10.340
Brennan was doing five 50 don't call him Reps.
Don't call me.

606
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:15.140
He was doing 10 reps.
Sorry.
He was doing 10 reps and he did 10 sets that,

607
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:15.860
and you were doing that.

608
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.520
You were lifting five 50 like you were getting out of a chair that was de cure

609
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.110
last for for what?

610
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.190
Cause I fucking tell Dick Jokes and drink coffee and strong cause you want to

611
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:29.300
look good.
Very strong.
Correct.
Yeah.
You want to look like a stud.
This guy,

612
00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:30.920
this guy was like,
you're very strong,

613
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.880
big ass gorilla body and you weren't lifting weights.
So it'd be rude.

614
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.480
Like you've got this big ass body and you let it get all doughy and soft and get

615
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:43.340
a little pot that hangs over you.
Funny.
No,
no.
It's funny.
People would be upset.

616
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.720
This motherfucker got the perfect frame and he's wasting it.
Cheetos,

617
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.550
you know,
I mean if you have one of those bodies,

618
00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:54.120
you're supposed to fucking maintain that bitch.

619
00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:58.670
So if you have a Ferrari and you'd putting paint like audio paint,
move smartly.

620
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.390
Yeah,
put bumper stickers free to bet on a Ferrari.

621
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:08.080
I'm free until
I told him that.
Really funny.

622
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.740
You're ruining the shape of this beautiful thing.
Ryan Bader stepping in now.

623
00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:16.370
How does one,
you know,
like recover from that,
um,

624
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.660
that rumble Johnson fight.
Like he's moving into the top 10.
He's in the top 10.

625
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.860
Top 12.
Yeah.
One five hours.
Way Towards a title shot.

626
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.600
And then he fights someone like rumble and he gets so annihilated that it leaves

627
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.310
this like,
okay,
how much,

628
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.630
how much improvement would he have to make before he could beat rumble?
Well,

629
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.090
but that,
that,
that rumble fight,
I don't think if I'm Ryan Beetham

630
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.370
<v 0>his camp,
you can't really chalk it up as a,
he was the better fighter.</v>

631
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.460
I think Beta shit,
his pants in a huge situation.

632
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.730
It didn't go his way back to the drawing board to get past this one.

633
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.743
Then you're pro,

634
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.680
he's writing to get gusts and next if they both win is what I would assume.

635
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.450
Maybe it could be because you know t stone Lomex to Beto Ospi.
Yeah,

636
00:35:57.451 --> 00:36:01.440
he did.
But OSP,
I'm sure with Michael a rematch.
Yeah,
it'd be tough.

637
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.850
It'd be Tommy 33 near laser.

638
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.770
What do you think Ryan Bader won the ultimate fighter way back in the day,

639
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.520
forever ago.
So long ago.
Those wrestling,
they paid her six too.
I didn't know.

640
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:15.390
He's that tall.
It's a big boy.
He's fairly narrow.

641
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.060
Like he's not like,
let's see phase different.
Well how olds,

642
00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.780
I'll toss to the t phase e five 10,
10.
We're plug.
Where's he from?

643
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.870
What's his equity phase?
Albanian.
See if that's true.
But he lived,

644
00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.510
he wrote Swedish,
right?
He grew up in Sweden.
We have county,

645
00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:31.680
I'm going to say Afghany say,

646
00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:36.240
I'm pretty sure it rose from the comic store said that's her Albanian brother.

647
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:41.250
God Damn,
he's Jack find out.
And these,
uh,
these guys from Albania,
she's right.

648
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.240
This guy's a tank though,
man.
Like you get to the size of them.

649
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.030
If you look at his fucking head like he's a tank.

650
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.240
If I'm Beta I wear his ass out and looked for to knock them out in the late

651
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:54.240
second or third.
Yeah,
he's super explosive.

652
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.080
It says he was born in Sweden.
Says all Sweden.
Yeah,

653
00:36:58.081 --> 00:37:02.100
but he's not to say anything.
Albania.
He must be,
I can go to the Wikipedia,

654
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:04.430
but it's born and raised in Sweden.
Um,

655
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.720
cause they don't make them looking like that in Sweden was the same ethnicity.

656
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.310
This is Albania.
Albania.
There you go.
Look the same.
Yeah,

657
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:17.990
they do it their way and these Goddamn yt blue.

658
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.380
I'll tell you what though.

659
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.420
Musashi eight the fucking shit out of a Latifi.

660
00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:28.700
His whole world just took the TV,

661
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:31.680
took that fight on super short notice because somebody else got injured.

662
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.090
There was a last minute fight.
I was t phase first fight in the UFC teeth.

663
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:40.720
He doesn't have a good Latifi going to happen.
Like he,

664
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:41.820
he doesn't have a big wind.

665
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:45.390
This would be his biggest one by far in the UFC wasn't really beat anyone that

666
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:48.270
good.
So this would be his biggest opponent for sure.

667
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.410
But he's a spooky dude.
Oh I hate this fight for Beta.

668
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.460
Especially coming off a loss for Anthony Johnson.
S in fucking Germany.

669
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.880
Well let's see.
Phase a world class wrestler too.
Yes.
The other scary thing about,

670
00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:03.180
so Bader is most likely going to be out wrestled by him.

671
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.650
Like if they just go wrestling the wrestling and [inaudible] starts you with one

672
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:09.840
shot.
Like he clipped him right there.
He just clipped him with a left talk.

673
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:12.870
Remember Beta has power too though.
Mariette go over on the ropes.

674
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.270
Eight a fucking hook from Mars.
Well,

675
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:18.920
he won the ultimate fighter by bombing on Vinny Magalhaes.
Yeah,
I remember that.

676
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.291
Yeah.

677
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:23.490
I beat the Braves of the wrestling college him and came around the same team,

678
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.710
but he's,
you know,

679
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:31.190
he's fighting a guy with a lot gain and subsidiaries power and a guy that

680
00:38:31.491 --> 00:38:33.960
doesn't have a lot of miles on them.
That was a good right hand there by Beta.

681
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.730
Latifi has a lot of miles on because the world wrestling shows which in a
stance,

682
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.350
it's kind of what I'm saying Joe Wrestling Training you mean?
Yeah,

683
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.840
all of that wrestling.
I mean granted Bader grew up restaurant too,

684
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:47.440
but a little different on the world level.
Let the chief has really reaching,

685
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.950
he's trying to close the distance like with these frantic sprints and baiters

686
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.890
like really elegantly sliding out of the way,

687
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:58.450
not their number look good data.
Ooh,
Nice Kick Raiders beat Phil Davis.

688
00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:02.650
Rashad Evans like Osp.
You'd meet some fucking guys.
Man.

689
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.410
He's been in there with way better competition on the hunter.
Of course.

690
00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:07.960
100% no question.
And here's the thing about the CFA,

691
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:11.560
like he's gotten this big power,
but if you look at like his tactical approach,

692
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:13.720
like how he's trying to approach,
um,
Ryan,

693
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.900
he's trying to step and then bomb and if it works,
look,

694
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:20.250
if he catches you with one of those things,
Foxville but a guy at Ryan's level,

695
00:39:20.251 --> 00:39:21.940
we shouldn't really be getting caught with that stuff.

696
00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.490
And so he switched up the wrestling and Ryan's stuff to take down.

697
00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:29.491
So now Alere is like definitely losing this round so far and he's losing it in

698
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:33.400
terms of like strategy though,
his ability to execute.

699
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.710
So he switches to South Pole.
Oh,

700
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.740
kick to the body by Beta (306) 302-3013 minutes into the first round.

701
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:44.260
So if you want to sync it up with us,

702
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.100
yeah.
Latifa does not look good right here.

703
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.490
And he's excuse getting clipped with a kick and look how easy bait or a block

704
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:55.090
that punch,
because it's obvious,
you know,
it's that looping,
that looping,
right,

705
00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:58.750
that comes Latif even got double unders can take better down.
I mean,

706
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:00.550
people under estimate baiters wrestling,

707
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:03.010
they forget about it cause he really doesn't use it that much.

708
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.340
It's interesting how like the certain things that you just absolutely predict,

709
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:08.170
right?
Like if a guy catches your leg,

710
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.090
if you throw a right kick and the guy catches your leg,

711
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:13.150
he's gonna throw a right hand.
Like every time you know that,
right?
Hands comment.

712
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:18.040
You know,
it's unusual approaches to those real common situations.

713
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.030
Oh,
it keeps water check.
Oh the TFA throwing bombs.

714
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.500
Her a fucking fader clocked him with that South Honda.

715
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.360
Yeah.
Latifa is trying to sprint out them in these uh,
in these headaches.

716
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:35.500
She engineer's gonna catch a knee man.
TV's hair said.
See Ya.

717
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.860
Why not just shave it?
Right.
Fellas got most of it shaved.

718
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:41.170
I think he just lets it grow with his beard for a couple of days.

719
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.390
Elite.
That's a cool name in there.

720
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:56.140
So Beta is doing a lot of switching stances.
Looks Great.
It looks real loose.

721
00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.510
A big loss like the Johnson one man.

722
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.520
Especially when you come out that huge win streak.

723
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.890
I'm sure he went back to the drawing board just to improve on stuff.

724
00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:05.130
But if he get past and then give them like a Gusman next,

725
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.520
he's right back up in there,
man.

726
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:10.360
Especially at two oh five like who knows what's gonna happen with John Deasy

727
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.370
rumble,
you know?
Yeah.

728
00:41:12.371 --> 00:41:15.400
I mean everybody just assumes that a rumble catches you go to sleep no matter

729
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:17.570
who you are.
Well that's,
that'd be correct.
Unless John,

730
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.830
you see he did catch DC and put it up on his ass Beta like good,

731
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:23.710
good technique there.
Holds the left hand high pinned to his face,

732
00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:27.670
throws that counter right hand and he's able to throw like check hooks on both

733
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:30.130
sides.
Oh,
got a lyric trust,
takedown.

734
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.130
Baiters fucking on one tonight.

735
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.360
<v 2>Double unders can do shit.
Oh yeah.
It looks good man.
It looks good.</v>

736
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:42.020
And also you got to realize that the TFA,
we're four minutes into this fight.

737
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.010
He's been unsuccessful for four minutes.
Mine's got to be fucking with them.

738
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.980
Not even close either to fuck with you.
Oh,
we just,

739
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.800
it just connected with a left hand.
He just connected with a left hand.
That's,

740
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:55.430
that's the danger in fighting this guy.
Yeah.
He'll ball much power.
Look at him.

741
00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.640
It's the way it's coming from the fucking,

742
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.030
he's got to figure out a way.
Well you know,
you don't learn it.

743
00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.070
You fight a guy like this.

744
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.030
You got to figure out a way to do it technically and then bomb selectively.

745
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.930
Correct.
These guys that try to bomb exclusively,
those guys go dry.

746
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:15.260
They run out of gas.
Especially when you're getting in the top five.
Yeah.

747
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.770
I mean 1212 to 15 you're,
you know,
you're fine.

748
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:21.880
But like Lafarge even Hector lumbar does that,
you know,

749
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.310
and he's an experienced guy with a,
you know,
a world bell tour championship.

750
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.630
That's why he caught him.
That's what we were talking.

751
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.960
Knows what he should break free man and keep bombing.
Ryan Bader is in

752
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.660
Beta,
got shipped.

753
00:42:37.661 --> 00:42:42.500
Son Dan is tough dude.
And let me tell you something.

754
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.320
Okay,
fuck you got around the fight.
How do you score the fight?

755
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.100
How do you square that round?
This is a good question.
He'd,
he'd knocked him.

756
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.910
You got to get it.
Yeah.
You got to give us the later was winning,

757
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:59.050
30 seconds of that still and he knock him down and he got the Nazi.

758
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.420
There's no way you want to give it to the other to bait her.

759
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.710
There's no way you're going to give it to Bader is the end of the,
again,

760
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.580
I'd give it a draw.
Good.

761
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.370
I say under the round and he got knocked down and you're going to give it to

762
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:14.121
Beta.
Okay,

763
00:43:14.121 --> 00:43:18.380
but a ton but a down and the scoring was an MMA is not the same as knocked

764
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:19.940
knockout in boxing.
If it was boxing,

765
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.300
that would be either a ten eight round or a nine nine rounds.

766
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.020
It's done boxing though.
It was all striking grappling,

767
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.890
but boxing scoring.
So Eddie scoring,

768
00:43:30.891 --> 00:43:34.010
when a guy gets knocked down and there's a point,
Eddie,
I'm not saying that.

769
00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:35.330
Not to say that.
Eddie,
Brian.

770
00:43:35.331 --> 00:43:38.600
So let's say he knocked him down the first 20 seconds of that fight and then

771
00:43:38.601 --> 00:43:41.330
Bader one,
the rest,
four minutes and 40 seconds.

772
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.360
Who would you give the round two that's different.
It's not the same.

773
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.430
It is for Sam.

774
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.930
You described a totally different situation around Andy got knocked down.

775
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.800
Round means more at the end of the [inaudible] it's the guy would personally

776
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:57.670
count.
I said,
Doug,
how are you doing toward the end of the [inaudible] guys,

777
00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.670
Robert of the police.
That's not the way the judging works.
Fellas.

778
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.550
Come hate to tell you it's true.
It's true.

779
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.050
Like as far as like what the fight is or how it's being judged because of the

780
00:44:09.051 --> 00:44:11.300
rules that we're talking about.
Two totally different things.

781
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.770
If you're looking at the fight.
Yeah.

782
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:16.730
If this was a fight in the street and Latifi got pulled off of him at the last

783
00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:18.680
second,
everybody would think with Tfa one.

784
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.580
Well that's like the navy is funding the sport and he won.
Well,

785
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:27.380
he knocked him down at the very least.
At the very least he made it a debate.

786
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.770
Could have been over right there with some more time.
Yeah,
but he survived.

787
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:34.980
It doesn't,
you got Bader on that road.
Uh,
I think to have a drawl.

788
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.310
Yeah.
It could be.
Never heard.

789
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:41.040
I didn't see Bader doing anything besides stuffing takedowns though.

790
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:44.680
He didn't really connect a lot.
He's got his front head lock here to gun control.

791
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.170
Good.

792
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.480
Because that means that means baders probably kind of tired when he got clipped

793
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:51.090
there.
Yeah.
Bidders.
That's true.
He was pressing it though.

794
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.270
You guys just got to know how they score the round.
Yeah.

795
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.910
I want to know how you scored it.
Not how other people's score.

796
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.980
I would give that a draw and even round.
Okay.

797
00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.000
Just because one guy does something with last 20 seconds.

798
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.990
That's like saying the Connor Diaz fight man.
If that was a fight fight,

799
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.530
Diaz would probably just about my sport.
I'm not talking about Allie.

800
00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.693
<v 3>Right.</v>

801
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.890
<v 2>But see Faye threw a punch.</v>

802
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.740
I always like flinch when dudes threw a punch and they land with the thumb dog,

803
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.760
you know,
and they throw that light right hook but it doesn't land knuckles.

804
00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:25.220
That's why I have this fucking earthworms scoring my arm.
Yeah,
I'm sure.

805
00:45:25.221 --> 00:45:29.380
And on that it fucking compound fracture.
The TFA just did that.

806
00:45:29.381 --> 00:45:31.690
He just threw a whipping bomb of a right hand.

807
00:45:31.691 --> 00:45:34.720
He landed with his thumb and I'm like Ooh.
And it usually lands on like skull,

808
00:45:34.721 --> 00:45:39.070
like not on.
It's the worst.
Shatters your bone to keep an eye on his right hand.

809
00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.880
I shall.
I shattered my right thumb and when I got a surgery as the doctor went,

810
00:45:42.881 --> 00:45:47.860
how's the scarlet?
I did my best.
It looks like a fucking,

811
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.260
it's like a Senate peed on my right hand.

812
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.950
So you're saying it comes from my throwing that over that long hook?
Yeah,

813
00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:55.930
like a straight arm hooked and you hit with the thought.

814
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.330
Oh Shit.
Going down like that.
That's what I said.
He kept that,

815
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:08.350
that makes it easy.

816
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.460
That makes it even a step in his hand and he's to get caught or Bader dot away

817
00:46:12.461 --> 00:46:17.260
with fucking grammys.
Ryan Bader,
dangerous flight.

818
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:21.130
She's just such a dangerous fight and hurt at the end of the first round and

819
00:46:21.131 --> 00:46:25.600
comes back with that shot.
Holy Fuck Man.
Yeah.
Now was that a kicker and neat.

820
00:46:25.601 --> 00:46:29.320
It was a knee.
He kept going down like that.
He cause he's a salad.
Let's see.

821
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:33.990
Circle.
I think it was.
He's doing bull boats.
He was going for it.
Awful.

822
00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:40.060
Oh my God.
Look at that.
Go Away.
Yeah.

823
00:46:40.061 --> 00:46:44.170
That was a kick landed on the knee.
Dangerous.
That looks God.
It was perfect.

824
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.200
Perfect timing though.
Udl Shit.

825
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.940
God Damn [inaudible] in the first round.
This.
Ooh.

826
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.750
That kind of looks like a neat,

827
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:57.770
it's like he adjusted the it definitely Glasgow for a kiss and then just fall

828
00:46:58.031 --> 00:47:01.270
through on the knee.
I think he might have adjusted and turned it into a needle,

829
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.690
but being arrested,

830
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:05.590
the instinct look like he'd just would keep going for that double when he got in

831
00:47:05.591 --> 00:47:09.760
trouble.
God Damn Ryan Bader.
Holy Shit.
That's huge.

832
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:14.590
Such a big win for him.
That coming off that loss to knocked out win top four.

833
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.200
You're getting gusts for next son.
Enjoy that.
It's a tough fight.

834
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.710
Joe Silva is Joe Silva definitely out now.
He's retired.
He said,

835
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:25.580
I made bank son.

836
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.290
Is he done like this year or is it done right now and to the year.
Wow.

837
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.750
<v 1>And I made my money.
Fuck this silly matchup stuff.
Wow.
That's interesting.
Sean.</v>

838
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:36.970
Shelby take care of this.
He must.
It's interesting.

839
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.330
That's what they say Pam

840
00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.970
paid and what's he do after this?

841
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.870
Just lead the charge on morning Joe.

842
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.620
We'll just start doing UFC patrol charge.

843
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.890
He's the head troll online now.
Cut to Joe Silva's next project.
Quick Youtube.

844
00:47:56.891 --> 00:48:01.600
Clip him in a diaper.
Picked cage.
Bam.
Coming soon.
It's called.
He may be short,

845
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:05.980
but he's got a dick and just all luck.
Big dudes in MMA gloves.

846
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:07.650
Boom.

847
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:12.100
It's like he was going for a kick and then adjusted in mid swing and turn it

848
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:17.060
into a perfect name.
You could see it.
Yeah.
See?
See how he turned the hip,

849
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.130
the knee and toffee.
Beautiful.
Talk that the fuck man.
That's amazing.

850
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:25.870
Good for Ryan Bader.
Congratulations.
That's huge.
It's amazing.

851
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.310
Again that he's only 33 I mean we've seen this dude in the UFC for a long time,

852
00:48:30.311 --> 00:48:33.860
but realistically like he's in his prime right now.
Right now.
Yeah.

853
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:39.210
32 to like 35 starts to especially light heavyweight or heavyweight around 35 36

854
00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:44.020
you start going,
hmm.
If you're not doing anything,
how long can you keep this up?

855
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:48.550
Yeah,
yeah.
If you're not,
yeah,
you're not on an upward trajectory.

856
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:51.940
It's not going,
hey,
let me ask you that.
Because you,
uh,

857
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:56.000
you just had Scott Coker on,
well,
I'm a big fan of,
and he went over it.
Yeah.

858
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.680
Great Guy.
And he's a running belt,
are now,
wish him all the luck in the world.

859
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.390
Powerful Matt Hughes.
That's a chant.

860
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:04.270
That's an American channel right there off the fucking America hair cut.

861
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:08.020
That's an American period,
Joe Zone.
Abu Dhabi aspect about that.
Yeah,

862
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:11.430
they're gonna have a grappling match.
That's awesome.
Um,
but uh,

863
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:16.450
Scott Coker running a belt or if you're a fighter and a,
you know,

864
00:49:16.451 --> 00:49:19.960
quetsion you know,
you lack a little help,
you know,
and train.

865
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.160
Sometimes we tired and uh,
you know,
just a little pick me up,
you know,

866
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:26.440
run away from the doctor and you know,

867
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:30.050
no one need to know a couple of days I'll be back.
My friend,
my friend,

868
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.720
you know,
there had been doing that since the beginning of time.

869
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:35.890
They've been taken a little something,

870
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:39.310
something and then they get to the way in and all they have to do is pass what

871
00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:43.660
most fighters call the intelligence tests.
Don't get popped after the fight,

872
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:44.921
you know,
so it'll,

873
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:47.720
it'll help you with your training and how many guys are like looking at belter

874
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:51.670
and saying,
well this is,
no,
you sat over there.
He can fight a longer,
oh,

875
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:56.500
not only longer.
My hobbies,
how about better,
better,
better.

876
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.710
And I can have all my sponsors.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh,

877
00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:00.910
well we can't find Brendan.

878
00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:05.090
He's on a mountain somewhere in Colorado and we can't get on his test off of him

879
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:06.940
and why he just sat there.

880
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.940
Just veins coming out of your jacket and your face and your,

881
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:14.050
your tongue as veins and rocky mountain oysters just doing dead lifts.

882
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.000
Fucking 34 35

883
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.170
yeah,
man.
I mean there's a,
there's a real enough to go there for real incentive.

884
00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:26.260
And then there's a financial incentive because you can keep all your sponsors.

885
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.010
You don't have to worry about having

886
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.840
<v 2>a Reebok pair of shorts on.</v>

887
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.790
You could have Nike and fucking underarmour and condom depot and whatever the

888
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:37.850
fuck that's what's going on with GSP and UFC,
right?
Like just be goes.

889
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.220
So I retired,
but his contract freezes.

890
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.240
So the contract doesn't change because the last thing you thought was 2013 he

891
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:47.090
still has that old contract.
So he comes back,
they just go,
yeah,

892
00:50:47.091 --> 00:50:49.130
turn the contract back on.
He's like,
Whoa,
whoa.

893
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:53.150
When I was fighting for this money from the UFC,
I had under Armour,

894
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.240
I had all these,
you know the,
all these crazy brands,

895
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:58.010
I'm making tens of millions of dollars.

896
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.780
So you got to make up for that and they're gone.
Now we're good.
And he's like,
no,

897
00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:06.250
you can't do that.
I'm fucking George Saint Pierre.
Did you see the,
the,

898
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.170
the war of words he's been having with Dana or Dana is like,

899
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:10.400
he really doesn't want to fight.

900
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.660
He didn't want to fight a championship level and danger points.

901
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:17.120
He does not know me.
Yeah.
Gimme one side know me,
he goes,
give me one final show.

902
00:51:17.121 --> 00:51:21.440
He wants to find out how much money do you fucking need UFC just pay the man.

903
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.060
Here's the thing from my perspective,

904
00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:27.890
you can never say that a guy like George doesn't want it anymore unless he

905
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:32.210
fights.
You cannot say that he is the greatest welterweight of all.
Just two guys.

906
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.000
There's Matthews and there's George Saint Pierre.

907
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.250
Those are the two without a doubt.

908
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.100
Greatest welterweights historically ever.

909
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.190
So if either one of those guys wants to fight again,
the last thing you can,

910
00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:47.720
you can say is he doesn't want it because only he knows if he wants it.

911
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.040
The baddest motherfucker.
You're weighed in at 170 pounds ever and fought.

912
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:57.530
Everybody might go to Bella tart.
No he can't.
But he owns his contract.

913
00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.330
But if that,
but if I was Dana,

914
00:51:59.331 --> 00:52:03.890
I'd probably say the same shit like 100% all there just to get him back.

915
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:06.610
I'm a shy,
tried it.

916
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.880
I'll do it for free.
Fucking dude I bought kick it back.
I'll get money.

917
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:16.610
We'll go Jean Georges to smudge.
You hear me?

918
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:19.400
Cause I know what Dana is trying to do cause I'm too swipe to play these games.

919
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:22.660
I'll sit out like it's not going to happen is he's sitting out for more moneys.

920
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:23.494
Have what the deal is.

921
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.320
Why don't you take over Joe Silva's job watch called Dana and say yo bygones.

922
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:30.200
Let's let the shit go by water under the bridge.
Holla at me dude.

923
00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:38.540
I got flavor and a number one podcast.
Come with me Simon.
Let's take a ride.

924
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:42.550
Let's do this.
Take a ride.
Come on man.
Some fun.

925
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.190
Have a dude that you argue with all the time and you guys publicly have little

926
00:52:46.191 --> 00:52:48.170
spats.
Everybody gets excited.
Come on,

927
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.560
come on.
It's all good man.
Shake.
I can't wear Reebok so no reason.

928
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.860
One stickler,
he wouldn't.
Where would you wear Yeezys?
You fucking dunce.

929
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:03.810
You're fucking right and you're fucking right.
I would better.

930
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:08.910
I thought I had them on right now.
That's a large one.
Serbian,
maybe whatever.

931
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:14.150
These are like some slick look and chucks,
but these are old school chuck Taylor,

932
00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:18.800
converse man,
a soul.
You feel the grounds are classic fashion,

933
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:25.010
uncomfortable.
What's,
how dare you.
A long day.
There's not much comfort.

934
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.380
Although they redid the souls on this.
I don't like the new ones.

935
00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.830
The souls now I like the new ones as much.
I like them.
They're okay.

936
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:35.460
I should say I don't like this.
I prefer these.
Those are second,

937
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:39.960
but for the whole school fucking word bottoms.
You're just ones that,
oh,

938
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.590
those are new sun footwear,
but these are not new.

939
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.500
These are the old school converse,
Instagram,
BM foot where it,
check them out.

940
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:50.940
Be m footwear,
Vm,
VM.
Don't go BM.
This body bowel movement.

941
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.090
This dude,
these are upgraded son.
I don't have to believe so.

942
00:53:54.091 --> 00:53:58.610
But you feel the salt.
Feel it.
Feel the in the inside of the shoe.
Sole Brennan.

943
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:02.790
She's lunar line on there.
Where's the green?
No,
no,
no.
They're not the Nike Lunar.

944
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.670
They're just,
the padding on the bottom is thicker.
What they used to be.
Okay.

945
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.990
The inside,
not the Nike Lunar.

946
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.480
There's still a fucking hardest but souls the same.

947
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:15.660
But the insoles quite a little bit thicker either way.
That's what I like.

948
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:17.550
I like old school.
Chuck's cause they're flat.

949
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.350
That's like carry your foot's supposed to be like when you wear things where

950
00:54:20.351 --> 00:54:22.230
like an elevated,
he'll like a running shoe.

951
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.540
It's not always supposed to be very good for you.
Yeah.

952
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:27.390
Your body doesn't want to be elevated in your heel like that.

953
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.880
You're supposed to wear some boots like Eddie when you lifted,

954
00:54:29.881 --> 00:54:33.720
you would always lift with these on,
right?
Yup.
Yeah.
They're,
they're,

955
00:54:33.721 --> 00:54:37.530
they're real thin and just that's a fucking shoe there.
Joe,

956
00:54:37.531 --> 00:54:42.531
can we get you to where some Yeezys know why it's a [inaudible] in those things

957
00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:45.960
like why does it have a thin sole and where the toes are?

958
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:49.680
Shut your fucking mouth facile down there.

959
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.960
Why for pure comfort when he's running in those,
yeah,

960
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:58.140
it is around how dare you do not work out in these people do that.

961
00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:01.380
I just don't think that they're that cool looking.

962
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.080
I don't like what you're 50 I don't think you're the Democrat and the fact that

963
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.380
I still just down aesthetically they kind of suck.

964
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.520
You and Jamie are on the wrong side of history with these stupid shoes.

965
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:15.720
I've cons to balance to look back and look.
She was like,

966
00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:16.920
what people do and they're gonna get gonna be like,

967
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:18.780
I can't believe my wireless back.
You know what?

968
00:55:18.781 --> 00:55:22.770
I will never look back on me wearing sandals with jeans like you do all the
time.

969
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:28.000
You just can't.
Jesus did it.
Kiss my ass.
I guess Jesus is wrong too.

970
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.830
I always forget about Gustafson and when I think about this and find a while

971
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.570
such a bad ass.
Well,

972
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.690
and also Gustafson is one of those guys that's been talking about retirement.

973
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.490
He's talked about ending it soon he went down to San Diego because he wanted to

974
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:47.370
find the passion again and I guess he still didn't find it,

975
00:55:47.371 --> 00:55:51.030
so that's why they kind of short kind of a tossup fight.
Yeah,
he's still,

976
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.670
he was saying he's still having some struggles with it.
Well,

977
00:55:53.671 --> 00:55:56.880
he's been public about that.
Oh yeah.
While training for this fight.

978
00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:01.220
That might be a trap.
What?
I'm black,

979
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.780
he's a joke.
Well,
it's not a joke.

980
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:10.440
He's just inexperienced in comparison to Gustafson,
but he's not,

981
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:13.860
he's a dangerous guy.
He's from Poland.
They don't fuck around dude.

982
00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.860
Gus is the fucking,
you know what I'm saying?
He's,
he's,

983
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.780
he's not a crop one percenter and he almost beat fucking DC,

984
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:25.600
almost beat John and then he got that fuck freak knockout out by Johnson.

985
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.890
He's lost to just the 1% of 1% true.
True,
true,
true.

986
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:34.600
It's tough man.
Yeah.
Block of Itch is certainly a,
this is like without a doubt,

987
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:36.580
like the toughest fight he's ever had.
What are you looking for?

988
00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:41.390
The guy from the James Bond movie had gotten this right.
Look at that guy.
Jesus.

989
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:44.650
He looks tough.
Definitely kill people.
Yeah.

990
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:46.910
He's like the guy that James Bond has to fight.
Yeah.

991
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:51.610
He's like an elevator and it kills them with a pen.
He looks rough.
Like the suit.

992
00:56:51.611 --> 00:56:55.090
He's wearing a suit and it's just,
it's impossible to be elegant with that.

993
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:58.820
He just looks brutal.
It's not well tailored suit either is,
it doesn't look,

994
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:04.490
it's not at home in his suit and he's in home and Cammo Kim with a knife or

995
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:08.100
online classes,
you leave as easy as in home.
That guy doesn't wear the easiest.

996
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:12.410
You can't get ahold [inaudible].
They're just,
they're so exclusive.

997
00:57:12.411 --> 00:57:15.520
That's tough to get.
What about fake Yeezys from China?
Is that super popular?

998
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.370
It's super popular but it's very easy to tell.

999
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.200
Brian [inaudible] and Brian were at lunch the other day.

1000
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.950
Four guys had him on and went Brian and you want to see fake Yeezys Abby's fuck

1001
00:57:23.951 --> 00:57:26.440
he's got an iron man.
He's got an Nigga life for that.
How could you tell?

1002
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.510
There's little things like on the converse,

1003
00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:31.750
you know like maybe the stars black on the converse on the Yeezys,

1004
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:36.070
the stitching on the backs different.
The space between the soles is different.

1005
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.650
He's like a sneaker con of sewer assemblies.

1006
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.180
Like smelling him like long conversations and know,
you know,

1007
00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:46.280
can glue is from Indonesia,
not,
you know,
it goes down.

1008
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:50.600
It'd be the same as someone bought a z 28 and then put ss badges on it.

1009
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:54.580
Well those rems are different.
The exhaust is different.
Right.
Tears different.

1010
00:57:54.581 --> 00:57:56.220
Let me see the engine.
Like God dammit,

1011
00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:00.700
you're honey Dick Minnis and as he fucking ss cars are just like shoes.

1012
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.940
Exactly.
Detailed stalling the details kids.

1013
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:10.270
Exactly.
All on the deets.
Do.
How about your boy Damien Maia?

1014
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.340
Dude,
dude,

1015
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:17.370
his Jujitsu is so next level for him to do that to condit just slice through him

1016
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:20.410
like butter.
Ooh,
do can you imagine?

1017
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:24.940
Let's say Wonderboy beats Woodley and they have Damien Maia verse Wonderboy and

1018
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.720
it'd be like hot tub time machine,
nighttime three.

1019
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.860
Cause you got one guy who just does Jujitsu,

1020
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:34.030
won't guy that just a stand up 2016 he doesn't just do Jujitsu.

1021
00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.300
The reason why he's able to pull off as as beautiful as you get to this cause

1022
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:41.000
it's wrestling and he can take everybody down at one 70 it doesn't,
not sure,

1023
00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:47.220
but it's still one aspect of MMA compared to one aspect of MMA in 2016 right.

1024
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:52.210
But at the highest of highest level,
it's fucking dope.
Dope.
It's dope.

1025
00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:54.940
It's like hot tub time machine.
But we just,
you know what I'm saying?

1026
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:58.750
He went back but their skills are ridiculous equivalent cause one guys is elite

1027
00:58:58.751 --> 00:59:02.860
world class striker and you saw the guards just elite worldclass grappler who've

1028
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:07.080
like they could compete outside of the UFC.
Right.

1029
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.430
In striking or in grappling with Wonderboy,

1030
00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:11.200
like took on a kickboxing bound and glory.

1031
00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:14.530
He'd be very competitive with some of the best kick hard percent world and if

1032
00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:17.800
Damien Maia entered into a major Jujitsu competition tomorrow,

1033
00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:20.380
he'd be very competitive against some of the best grapplers in the world.

1034
00:59:20.381 --> 00:59:22.240
It's really crazy.
It's cool.
Right.
And it's cool

1035
00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:26.690
<v 5>to have that almost never got Amac.
Yeah.
I can't think of last time.</v>

1036
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:30.020
Something like generally the most UFC fighters,

1037
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:35.021
most of them they couldn't go into like Abu Dhabi or even Ebi and they would get

1038
00:59:35.331 --> 00:59:38.560
smashed and let's do a high high level wrestler.
Yeah,
it'd be tough.
Yeah.

1039
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.600
And even high level wrestler,
like in a submission only tournament,

1040
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:46.490
Dobby Ebi,
different Abu Dhabi.

1041
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:47.540
There's some high level wrestlers.

1042
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:50.970
The guys that jumped in there with not a ton of just too expensive.
Exactly.

1043
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:54.860
And I would dobby because of the point cause gum rustling becomes fucking

1044
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:55.490
correct.

1045
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:58.310
That's why you can see some guys go all the Brazilians when they're getting

1046
00:59:58.311 --> 00:59:59.660
ready for Abu Dhabi,

1047
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.480
they're going on a rustling caps it with the church boys take downs.
We,

1048
01:00:04.481 --> 01:00:07.580
she just explained it probably is the Abu Dhabi combat club.

1049
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:12.320
This is like the biggest,
so the Olympics.
Yeah.
Shake talk noon.

1050
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.270
A guy who owns,
I think he owns 10% of the UFC.
He also,

1051
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:17.660
uh,

1052
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:22.660
is a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu under Henzel Gracie and he puts on these

1053
01:00:23.061 --> 01:00:25.580
grappling competitions that are just monstrous.

1054
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.030
They spend money and they have the best fighters in the world and they put

1055
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:32.930
together,
they should really adopt Ebi rules.
Do like blood sport for Jujitsu.

1056
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:38.330
Ebi Rules need to be Standard Algebra and get fucked up tournaments or sweating.

1057
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.190
I see it.
And many,
many tournaments are switching to ebi roles that make sense,

1058
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:47.270
son and went to it.
Chill Sundance tournament went to her.
It's smart.

1059
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:50.660
It's the most exciting set of rules by far.
Far not even close.

1060
01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.950
Now let's go on to the show next week now.
Jihad or you gone?
Yeah.
Geez.

1061
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.940
Where's it at next Sunday at the Orpheum La la downtown at the Orpheum.

1062
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:03.350
I'll be EBI official DOTCOM.
We're in.
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.

1063
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:07.990
What about your next Sunday?
It's going to be fucking amazing.
Gordon and Gordon.

1064
01:01:07.991 --> 01:01:12.980
Ryan in New York,
Gotham Comedy Club on Sunday,

1065
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:18.050

day.

1066
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:22.990
Did you guys see Gordon Ryan versus Keenan?
Cornelius?
Go for what?
90 minutes?
No,

1067
01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.570
monster came into monster,
but Gordon,
Ryan Beta man.
Yup.

1068
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.860
20 years old.
Kids been training Jujitsu four and a half years.
Jesus.

1069
01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:35.570
But Kenny Cornelius is going to do Ebi November six we're doing the light

1070
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:38.470
heavyweights and Gordon Ryan's going to do that one as well.
Love came.

1071
01:01:38.471 --> 01:01:43.471
The next Sunday is one 85 next Sunday is one 85 it's the middleweights Ebi

1072
01:01:43.521 --> 01:01:47.780
downtown La at the Orpheum.
What time does it start at?
Five o'clock.
Okay,
cool.

1073
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.910
Not,
oh,
it's going to be on UFC fight pass,

1074
01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:54.380
but for those of you that don't live in southern California,
so UFC fight pass,

1075
01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:58.580
stepping up.
I love it man.
It's so cool that they did that.
Okay,
here we go.

1076
01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:02.480
We've got Gustafson versus block.
Covich Gustafson got checked.

1077
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:05.930
I would be willing to bet if Gustavus for whatever reason loses fight is done

1078
01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:10.190
fighting.
Damn.
A block.
A bit to the right hand over the top Gus when soap,

1079
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:13.760
which is the way you supposed to say it.
[inaudible]

1080
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.420
I'm saying block Covich I think it's public block a bitch.

1081
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.480
She called him the block.
The talking about the block

1082
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:25.370
<v 2>that blow the blow hole.
No,
that doesn't work.
Yeah,
I like the block,
the block.</v>

1083
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:27.720
Oh,
shuck.
He's um,

1084
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:31.690
I don't like to wake essence looking Blah hove which keeps his head,
um,

1085
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:35.520
like right in the center when he's throwing bombs against like a really elite

1086
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:37.950
guy.
He likes stiffens up a little bit.
When he's standing up.

1087
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.240
He could get clipped counters,
guests and that.

1088
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.940
I trained together for my metro and fight and he went six rounds with a

1089
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:51.570
worldclass boxer and it was fucking a war and then jumped in there,

1090
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:56.170
went three rounds with me back to back.
Wow.
He's a fucking animal animal.

1091
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.920
Tough guy.
And you know what I mean?

1092
01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:02.460
Like I'm full cm punk for Micky gall sponsor on the back then.
Where's that?

1093
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.570
Where's that?
Oh right there on the wall.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

1094
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:09.550
he's famous guy.
Look,
the cm punk thing,
the what?

1095
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:12.300
The thing that's most interesting about it is that he took all his time.
Whoa.

1096
01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.710
The,
which is throwing some bombs.
He's Steph,
Steph with the neck stiff in there.

1097
01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:21.730
He's like,
reach is so good.
It will not as farms.

1098
01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:26.410
I'm not in this fight,
but usually it's fucking on point.
His Jabs worldclass Oh,

1099
01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:30.510
blow hole.
Which is fighting really well.
Really,
really well.
It's very stiff.

1100
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.600
It's using up a lot of energy.

1101
01:03:31.601 --> 01:03:34.210
I'll tell you what a surprise you as Guthman wrestling man is,

1102
01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.240
is his counter wrestling is amazing.

1103
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:40.350
But when he took John Down in the first round,
everybody was like,
Oh shit.

1104
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:45.000
Called that because I was wrestling with,
uh,
with his ass.
Take John.
Dot.
Did.

1105
01:03:45.001 --> 01:03:48.240
And I called it.
Wow.
That's hilarious.
Because his wrestling,

1106
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:52.440
so unexpecting and good.
Wow.

1107
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.330
That's impressive.
He's so big for two or five or two men.

1108
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.230
He's tall a shit.
It's five man.
Yeah.
I always wonder like,

1109
01:04:01.231 --> 01:04:03.110
what does a guy like that walk around at?

1110
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:09.390
He's like too high to twenties to thirties so the guy like him,

1111
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:13.230
do you think there'd be any benefit in like a rigorous strength and conditioning

1112
01:04:13.231 --> 01:04:17.530
program and moving up to heavyweight?
Yeah,
I mean him verse steep,

1113
01:04:17.531 --> 01:04:18.660
it'd be a hell of a fight.

1114
01:04:18.661 --> 01:04:22.830
But I think when you got fight guys like Rothwell like steep bay,

1115
01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:25.020
jds cane,
I think you might be all right.

1116
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:28.630
I don't know if he doesn't possess the power.
That's the problem.
I Dunno man.

1117
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.870
He was knocked guys out.
He knocked Chimi Mattawa out.

1118
01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.150
I just want him to a high level guy that he's knocked out though.

1119
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.490
Well man was pretty high level.
Take it easy.
Let's just be real.

1120
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.200
I'm talking about when you're talking about Jon Jones DC,

1121
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:45.900
he's talking about 1% but you know,
the only guy out of that group that,
uh,

1122
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:48.960
that stopped him was rumble and rumble can stop anybody.

1123
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.820
And if you look at the way rumble stopped him,

1124
01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:54.960
it's actually arguably like more impressive than he lasted as long as it did.

1125
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:59.670
I agree.
When Robin was bombing on,
I agree.
But those extra shots that he took,

1126
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:03.900
those don't help you.
Not at all.
What's like,
Gosh,

1127
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:07.110
he's making a dog fight.
What's like Carlos Condit,
right.

1128
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.570
Like he lose that fight and he's like,
I don't know if I want to do it similar.

1129
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:13.020
Then I heard his coach on the interview,
Brandon Gibson,
powerful branding.
Gibson,

1130
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:16.030
there's his soon to take down Gibson timeout.

1131
01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:18.040
I don't know if he wants to do anymore.
He is that he wants to move

1132
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.310
<v 5>on to other stuff.
It's time to get out man.
Yeah.</v>

1133
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:25.360
Can you can still be 98% of the division but still man,
get the fuck out.

1134
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:29.980
Condit he's also a smart guy.
Very smart.
And when you're that smart,

1135
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:33.400
you're aware like,
okay,
how many more shots I'm not going to be able to take?

1136
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.780
Well he was at like,
what was he,

1137
01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:38.200
1617 doing valley Tuto bare knuckle boxing and shit.

1138
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.240
Like he's a nightmare that age.
Yeah.

1139
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:46.020
He fought his first ever kickboxing match against Andy Sour who's a world

1140
01:05:46.121 --> 01:05:48.580
champion.
He's,
and yeah,

1141
01:05:48.581 --> 01:05:52.630
if you don't even handy sours fucking out Google Youtube and kind of just my

1142
01:05:52.631 --> 01:05:54.730
marvel had conduct how good he's always been.

1143
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:59.920
Any sour is like a phenom,
like a world champion,

1144
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:03.730
multiple time world champion.
That was Carlos is first kickboxing about him.

1145
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:07.180
It's so insane that he took that fight.
He's done bare knuckle stuff.
He's,

1146
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:07.511
you know,

1147
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:10.630
he's just been fighting for Everman so that you know the head trauma and he's

1148
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:13.780
like you said,
he's a smart guy.
He talks about it.
He's open about it.

1149
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.450
Once he taught what he said about head trauma stuff or,
yeah,

1150
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:19.270
just like it's a concern of his and he doesn't know if he wants to keep doing

1151
01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:22.000
and stuff like that.
He has a second or third baby on the way I think.

1152
01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:26.500
So He's a guy.
He's probably got some money in the bank,
I hope.
Yeah,
I don't know.

1153
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:29.850
You know,
I don't know how much money's made.
It's tough with the Gallagher,

1154
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.970
he was interim champ,
right?
Yeah.
And then he's always fought like top five level.

1155
01:06:33.971 --> 01:06:38.680
But to really make that crazy retirement money,
you gotta be guy like GSP Connor.

1156
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:39.760
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1157
01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:43.630
Or you got to figure out some way to market yourself outside of the UFC.
I mean,

1158
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:46.810
it's gotta be something like Allen,
Joe Bands doing modeling.
You know,

1159
01:06:46.811 --> 01:06:51.670
you broke off in podcasting.
There's gotta be like another way as well,
just,

1160
01:06:51.671 --> 01:06:56.620
but to only rely on your success in athletic contests to make your money.

1161
01:06:56.770 --> 01:07:00.380
You almost have to Joe,
because Damien mocking up,

1162
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.560
thinking about making money anywhere else.

1163
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:07.150
Conduit right now can open up an MMA gym and make plenty of money.

1164
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:11.530
That's tough,
man.
I think that's easier said than done.
No,
it's not that.

1165
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:15.690
Well,
you're a UFC fight your kindness.
I,
I'm the UFC.

1166
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:19.280
The UFC gyms would beg to differ very doomsday for demos.

1167
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.630
They say that they're not doing well.
I'm just saying in general,

1168
01:07:22.631 --> 01:07:26.320
if you go off to a general consensus of opening a gym,

1169
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:29.350
if you do get your money back with a return within four years,

1170
01:07:29.351 --> 01:07:32.110
it's not a smart business going black belt and you're a legit,

1171
01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.530
if you're a UFC fighter and you're a black belt,
doesn't mean you're not.

1172
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:40.810
I'm in the,
this is my business.
You're a great teacher.
I talk.
No,

1173
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.410
he doesn't even have to teach.
He doesn't trust me.

1174
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:50.260
He could make plenty of money with his own gym.

1175
01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.910
Have two gyms,
super easy.
You just got to be a black belt at the marketing,

1176
01:07:54.911 --> 01:07:56.500
learn the market and learn how to do it.

1177
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.840
He's got a black belt and he's a UFC fighter.
I know guys that are,

1178
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:03.190
that are purple belts that are making a living.
Sure.

1179
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.370
They just have the marketing down.
It's huge.
It's still growing.

1180
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:11.100
It's expanding Jujitsu schools and MMA gyms done.
Right.
It really is like a,

1181
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:15.530
like the gold rush.
I agree 100% of just putting up it's wide open.
We now,

1182
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:18.920
let's now you're assuming he has the money put down to open a gym.

1183
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:22.080
She could do it.
Easy,
easy.
Oh Dang.

1184
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:26.420
1000000% easy conduct.
Famous UFC,

1185
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:28.130
smart black.
I'm not saying he can't.

1186
01:08:28.190 --> 01:08:32.660
I think to assume I can open a gym and make a Shitload of money.
It's 1000000%.

1187
01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:36.440
1 million percent.
So anyone the UFC could do it.
And if you're a black belt,

1188
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.420
if you're,
if you're a legit black belt and you,

1189
01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.480
you've had success in the UFC,
uh,
remember,
I mean like I just said,

1190
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:46.370
I've had guys that haven't been in the UFC,

1191
01:08:46.371 --> 01:08:48.660
not even black belts and there being there,

1192
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:52.030
you just gotta you just gotta another business.
There's a,

1193
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:54.680
there's some things up big if though is,
am I wrong?

1194
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:58.310
You're just like that no one running a business and knowing how to fight as a

1195
01:08:58.311 --> 01:09:00.050
completely different world.
Yes.

1196
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.360
That's why I said if you master the marketing and that doesn't,

1197
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:06.830
that's a big gift to learn how to speak Spanish.
She could write awesome books.

1198
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:10.370
No,
but it's not that Spanish learning Spanish.

1199
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:15.610
It's easier than I believe it begged the two cause it's like your money and it's

1200
01:09:16.371 --> 01:09:20.600
your family.
It's not that hard.
And Arnie had dealing with this every day.

1201
01:09:20.601 --> 01:09:24.380
I deal with this every day and you're brilliant at it.
Doesn't mean it's easy.

1202
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:28.280
There's a lot of guys,
but it's easy.
It's easy.

1203
01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.710
All you gotta do is know the system and work hard.
That's it.

1204
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.500
You work hard if you're lazy and I ain't going to happen.

1205
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:37.190
But that's the true with everything.

1206
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.660
There's so many people that are looking for it.
There's a lot of things that,
no,

1207
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:43.070
no,
but there's a lot of things that require to shit that you can never learn.

1208
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.230
Like being a standup comedian.
If you don't,
not everybody can do that,
right?

1209
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.450
Not Everybody.
Not everybody can be a singer.
Not everybody,

1210
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.760
but everybody can do certain things in business.

1211
01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:56.510
All you gotta do is do the work and not be lazy and you can make it happen.

1212
01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:59.270
Blow Hole.
You don't need a special talent

1213
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.450
bill Holt,
which cannot get off his back.
Powerful wrestling.
But yeah,

1214
01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.210
he's getting smushed.
But I didn't know a lot of elbows.
I agree with you,
Brandon.

1215
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:15.530
1000000% on once a fighter starts doubting,
you know,
whether they,

1216
01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:17.550
they have the heart.
I think it's time.
Yeah,

1217
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:20.960
it's time to just say shy like Carlos trends.
It's time to transition.

1218
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.580
<v 1>It's also an absolute fact that when you get hit in the head a lot,</v>

1219
01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:29.080
it starts to affect your enthusiasm.
It starts to affect your endocrine system.

1220
01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:30.370
It's,
there's a potential,

1221
01:10:30.371 --> 01:10:34.330
like I know a guy was a worldclass boxer and I know a friend who trains him who

1222
01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:38.020
said that he absolutely has pituitary gland damage and he has a really hard time

1223
01:10:38.021 --> 01:10:41.800
getting the energy up to train and he had his testosterone checked and it's just

1224
01:10:41.801 --> 01:10:44.460
ridiculously low and there's nothing they can do about it cause it's

1225
01:10:44.461 --> 01:10:47.500
supplemented.
It is illegal so they can't supplement his testosterone.

1226
01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:52.270
So this guy is forced to fight with low testosterone,
low enthusiasm.

1227
01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.750
He just can't muster up the kind of performances he had earlier in his career.

1228
01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:59.920
And that's super common man.
When you see fighters slowed down as they get older,

1229
01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:03.820
it is not just because they're older as because they're older and they've taken

1230
01:11:03.821 --> 01:11:04.990
a lot of punishment.

1231
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.890
Those are the big factors and it causes a physiological change in their body.

1232
01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:11.380
Yup.
Well,
you see like some guys like Chins.
Oh,

1233
01:11:11.381 --> 01:11:14.130
Machida chins was like not nine years old,

1234
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.380
<v 5>but he doesn't have a lot of fights on him.</v>

1235
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:19.650
And so he's fighting and belt or now he looks like a world beater.

1236
01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:22.770
He looks fucking fantastic.
Starching dude.
Damn.

1237
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.690
Starching kicks starching good.

1238
01:11:24.691 --> 01:11:27.330
He looks like his brother and a lot of ways he looks like Liotta.

1239
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.940
Maybe even a little more aggressive than Liotta.
He's aggressive.

1240
01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:33.350
He's very aggressive.
Yeah.
How's his Jujitsu and stuff?
Very good.
Great.

1241
01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:35.530
Well he's an elite elite martial arts.

1242
01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.910
Martial arts is such a good guy too.

1243
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.030
I bet he's a good [inaudible] is an awesome guy.
Yeah,
they're all great.

1244
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:45.990
But the point being that like that guy hasn't taken a lot of mileage,

1245
01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:48.840
so even though he's 39 years old,
he looks fucking good.

1246
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:52.710
He doesn't only like a 39 year old guy who was at the tail end of a long MMA

1247
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:55.650
career and he's got all these injuries he's constantly struggling against and

1248
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.050
can't get through camp without getting hurt.
It's not like that.

1249
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.970
You're looking at a guy's car tissue.
Yeah.
Well that's like the cm punk argument,

1250
01:12:02.971 --> 01:12:05.550
right?
He's 37 or 38 whatever he is,

1251
01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:10.050
and he has a lot of injuries come from professional wrestling and he's never

1252
01:12:10.051 --> 01:12:14.080
done the sport.
So then he has to train two years and then go into it.

1253
01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:16.890
You're talking about a different animal.
It's not a good fucking,

1254
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.810
it's not like if you look at it like a,

1255
01:12:18.811 --> 01:12:23.700
a plan like this is way I want to get into MMA.
It's not a good plan,

1256
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:26.400
but this is the plan that he was dealt.
I mean he's 37 years old.

1257
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:29.790
He decides he's going to do it now.
He does a lot of things that I'd like.

1258
01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:32.380
It goes to brewfest sport,
which is outstanding.
Jim,

1259
01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:37.260
one of the blanket with world class trainers and world costs,
sparring partners,

1260
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.270
and then on top of that he took two whole years.

1261
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.590
So it's as good as the guy could do two whole years,
two whole years.
Pick about,

1262
01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:48.000
think about gaming,
gaming,
Maya's damage he's taken throughout his career.

1263
01:12:48.001 --> 01:12:51.330
He hasn't really taken any drastic 13th or hunches in his last what,

1264
01:12:51.331 --> 01:12:54.690
four or five?
Yeah,
13 incredible.
Flip the fuck.

1265
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:58.570
What fight was involved in that?
That he received the most dam.

1266
01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:03.360
Nate Marquardt starched him with one punch.
I'll really know how to kick.

1267
01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.810
He struggled for a while there.
You know what he did?

1268
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.280
He figured there's a guy who broke down all his Jujitsu on,

1269
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:12.780
on youtube into four parts.
It's pretty fucking interesting.

1270
01:13:12.781 --> 01:13:17.781
You go through his early decisions on the ground to the decisions he's making it

1271
01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:22.790
making now he has got this path,
well he,

1272
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.850
the passes that he's using now that he,

1273
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:29.910
he kind of tripods and it's kind of like a smash pass.
He's just,

1274
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:33.750
he gets to top half.
He knows that if he just hovers over,

1275
01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:38.751
keeps his head on his opponent's chest and he's pinning him down and he gets the

1276
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:42.750
top happy,
doesn't even need to pass it on.
Then he turned,

1277
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.450
he's not taking any damage.

1278
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:47.570
Then he goes to three quarter mount and then from there he throws a couple

1279
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.971
punches.

1280
01:13:47.971 --> 01:13:51.720
The guy gives him this back because in three quarter mount you'll basically

1281
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:55.530
already have a hook and he's figured out this path nice and simple.

1282
01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:59.130
There's so many things you can do.
As did you get to black belt to pass?

1283
01:13:59.131 --> 01:14:02.160
Like your first initial move.
There's all these passes,
there's all,

1284
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.520
he has chosen the passes to the mount and to the back.

1285
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:12.120
That path is the best path.
He's three,

1286
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:17.080
he's 38 39 he's 39 38 or 39 not sure if he's smart.

1287
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.570
If I'm his management and Peel your mail and do the shit,

1288
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:23.890
but he's not fighting anyone to tell you the title shot and you know six in a

1289
01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:26.080
row.
You don't fight where you know what's really interesting?

1290
01:14:26.081 --> 01:14:29.920
Jake shields beat him and he al grappled them.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
We'll get the list.

1291
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.380
Judge,

1292
01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.700
I'll never forget how God damn good Jake shields was and he just submitted the

1293
01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:37.100
auto Machida.
By the way,
in Jesus.
He,
Danny beat wordly.

1294
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:40.260
He beat wordly my,
you know he's beat everyone.

1295
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:41.830
You look at the top five guys check.

1296
01:14:41.850 --> 01:14:46.800
She didn't he fight Robbie Lawler and beat Robbie.
Robbie Smith.

1297
01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:48.640
I'm standing canteen there you got jumped up,

1298
01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:50.520
grabbed a hold of his neck and was like,
um,

1299
01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:53.790
what's this worldclass squeeze son?

1300
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.030
This is a vegan squeeze.

1301
01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.600
My is doing on his back.
There's a million things you can do.

1302
01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:04.900
There's a painting styles.
He's keeping it nice and simple.

1303
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.010
All Damien Maia is looking for when he's on his back is the under hood.

1304
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:13.240
Everything is set up to the under hook.
He gets in a Z guard.
He covered,

1305
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:16.780
he times the punch.
As soon as you throw a right punch,
he shoots in.

1306
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:18.700
He has like a z guard.
Then he shoots in,

1307
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:22.490
grabs the under hook and either gets on top and they stand just like chuck

1308
01:15:22.491 --> 01:15:25.840
Ladell used to do with the under hook or he uses that to sweep.
I'm like,

1309
01:15:25.841 --> 01:15:30.680
he'll get into dog fight and you know what I see?
Simple.
When I see Kim,

1310
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.240
I want to see him fight a guy who was a worldclass Jujitsu guy with a wicked

1311
01:15:34.241 --> 01:15:37.780
guard,
like a Braulio esteem,
like someone who can,

1312
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:41.140
who's nasty off of his back.
You can see Damion,
yeah,

1313
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.170
because he's going to do the exact same path.

1314
01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:45.700
Whether the guy knows Jujitsu or not.

1315
01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:49.360
The path that he's chosen from the bottom and from the top,

1316
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:53.560
no matter who he's going with.
That's the best path.
When there's no gay,

1317
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.470
when there's punches,
when there's elbows,
Damien Maia,

1318
01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:01.580
it's just dwindled everything down to keeping it nice and simple on his back.

1319
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.960
It's just,
it's funny.
I'm sure he would do it,

1320
01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:09.370
but my question is would he be able to execute that kind of a strategy against a

1321
01:16:09.371 --> 01:16:12.250
guy like Braulio esteem a bit harder.
That's why I want to see it.

1322
01:16:12.251 --> 01:16:14.650
I want to see what a God with a worldclass guard,

1323
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:17.650
but you know for you it does a lot of weird stuff too.
Like he's got that,

1324
01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:21.760
that triangle that he does like that underneath triangle that we're like

1325
01:16:21.761 --> 01:16:24.960
backwards triangle.
He does he do an MMA?
Yeah,
he's doing him a minute.

1326
01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.013
Guys done some fine.

1327
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:31.090
When I watch someone like Damien Maia because I don't have that much of a

1328
01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:31.840
trained eye,

1329
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.900
it doesn't look like he's doing anything different than everybody else.

1330
01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:37.030
When he takes your back or when he's got,

1331
01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:39.890
he's on top of you and he's controlling you and what and what tips,

1332
01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:44.410
things that subtlety of Jujitsu on that level that unless you have a cultivated

1333
01:16:44.411 --> 01:16:47.910
I,
it just looks like he's wearing like a sweater or he's clinician,

1334
01:16:47.911 --> 01:16:49.390
he's controlling the army's coming in.

1335
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:51.850
He somehow gets that figure for him on his stomach,

1336
01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:55.330
but there's no way you're getting that dude off.
You're not getting them off.

1337
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:58.060
And why someone like Carl Carlos,
I can't even get them off.

1338
01:16:58.061 --> 01:17:01.610
And Carl's Kinda his experiences at anybody and that's where that,

1339
01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:05.680
that level of mastery is so subtle and almost invisible.

1340
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:09.110
It's hard to see unless you really know what the hell he's doing because a lot

1341
01:17:09.111 --> 01:17:12.410
of it seems to be like where he's putting his weight,
those little differences,

1342
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:13.370
how he's countering,

1343
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:15.830
how he's predicting what you're going to do before you do it.

1344
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:20.840
Will that path that Maya is on,
the techniques that he's putting together,

1345
01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:24.020
the treasure map that he's on,

1346
01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:27.890
Carlos condit probably wasn't getting someone,
uh,

1347
01:17:27.891 --> 01:17:32.660
on a daily basis at a high level,
hitting him with that specific right path.

1348
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:37.520
Those moves that he chose,
that he's strung together nice and simple,

1349
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:41.060
nice and tight.
And uh,
um,
you know,

1350
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.850
you got to prepare for something as simple as that.

1351
01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.070
You got to prepare for someone coming at you.

1352
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.700
Exactly like that because everything that Maya chooses,

1353
01:17:49.701 --> 01:17:54.560
all those positions are the best positions for MMA.
No doubt.
And he's,
he,

1354
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.020
he's got a pasture it out.
Yeah.
He's figured out the path.

1355
01:17:57.021 --> 01:17:57.860
There's a million moves,

1356
01:17:57.861 --> 01:18:00.920
but he's got the path and it's the same shit he's doing over and over.

1357
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:04.640
How Damion,
each smaller,
you know,
I want to see guys like,
you know,

1358
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:09.700
Rafael Lovato is now getting into MMA and he's had a few MMA fights,

1359
01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:13.370
uh,
outside of the U is going to do well.
He's going to smash guys.

1360
01:18:13.371 --> 01:18:18.110
It's a very similar style.
That top heavy pressure just grinds.
It's

1361
01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.540
one position in the next like small,
methodical one position his,

1362
01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:26.420
his chest and he was so heavy.
It's all Hixon Gracie lineage,

1363
01:18:26.421 --> 01:18:29.970
Hixon Gracie Salahi Barrow and he's with sallow.
It's like that,

1364
01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:33.950
that old school solid Jujitsu.

1365
01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:37.760
Like that fucking scary.
Perfect based.
You did too.

1366
01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:41.470
It's really not as specific.
You can't breathe.
It's,

1367
01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.850
it's the specific moves that he's choosing.

1368
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:47.050
It's how he's doing it's oxide to pick all of them.

1369
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:51.050
Are you talking about the Maya were talking about how failed Lavato so he does

1370
01:18:51.051 --> 01:18:53.590
have that smashing high level you Jitsu,

1371
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.000
but there've been a bunch of high levels.

1372
01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.550
You get to guys trying to transition into the UFC.

1373
01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.700
The problem is they're not selecting the moves that Damien Maia selecting

1374
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:07.880
everybody in MMA right now.
If you're not studying,

1375
01:19:07.881 --> 01:19:12.881
if you're in the UFC and you are not studying exactly the moves the Damien Maia

1376
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:16.820
has chosen and the path,
it's all laid out for you.

1377
01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:21.380
That's the path you need to get on.
There's a lot of different tech,

1378
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:23.870
Jujitsu techniques,
a lot of different styles of playing God,

1379
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.880
different guard passing styles.

1380
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:28.940
There's all this shit you can decide to do in the mountain.
Three quarter mount,

1381
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:32.630
all these decisions,
gaming,
mice,
making all the right decisions.

1382
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:34.280
If you're not studying in his shit.

1383
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:37.830
I mean there's the catalog into the ticket there.
Yeah.

1384
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:42.140
He went through some shit to figure out himself.
There's an evolution.

1385
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:46.820
He wasn't choosing that exact path.
Early Australia stand too much on the bottom.

1386
01:19:46.821 --> 01:19:50.000
He was always about the under hook it from his early days.

1387
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:53.360
But what he changed his,
he doesn't sit when he's on top,

1388
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:57.050
he never sits into a z half guard.
He calls it headquarters.

1389
01:19:57.230 --> 01:20:02.180
He doesn't sit into that anymore because when he wants people to do to sit and

1390
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:04.910
dizzy guard,
when he's on bottom cuts from there,

1391
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.650
he just waits for you to throw a right punch and he times it,

1392
01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:10.980
he shoots for the under hook cause you just left a big ass opening and from

1393
01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:13.230
there he gets the dog fight.
That's all waiting for.

1394
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.560
So he doesn't want to do that because he knows that that's the actually the

1395
01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:17.370
wrong thing to do.

1396
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:21.720
So we try pods when he's in that headquarter position and he gets up and he

1397
01:20:21.721 --> 01:20:23.790
drives his head down and then he just,

1398
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:27.810
he maneuvered his way in the top half and then he turns towards it like it's

1399
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:30.810
really simple.
It's not like he's mixing it up.

1400
01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:33.300
He knows the best shit.

1401
01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.350
You know who else is in an MMA recently?

1402
01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:40.170
I just found out that Tiffany van hoose the to me time,

1403
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:44.160
she fights in Invicta I think next week or two weeks.
Is it a first MMA fight?

1404
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:47.690
I think so.
It's your first time.
I'm sure we'll chat.

1405
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:53.210
We'll chat.
Moitai nasty,
nasty,
nasty,

1406
01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:57.210
nasty little tiny girl.
She's the one 15 right?
You got to be 14.
Yeah.

1407
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:58.920
But when you look at the winds division,

1408
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:02.820
she's going to be in the UFC quick knock in bitches out to,

1409
01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.230
well fuck if she can avoid the take down.

1410
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.160
It's going to be interesting because she's based,
she's Gianna's.

1411
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:12.480
She's in Gianna's that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Jamie,
bring her up for a sec.

1412
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.200
Let me see your Tiffany time.
Isn't it crazy that just maybe four years ago,
uh,

1413
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.040
women's being huge in the UFC was,

1414
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.670
I mean most people thought that would never happen because

1415
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:28.350
she's beautiful.
She's a world champion Muay Thai and she,
uh,

1416
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.830
I think she lives in Bali,
but then she does a camps out here.

1417
01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.620
She's doing it right,
man.
She's bad ass,
bad ass.

1418
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:36.850
If you've seen her on access TV just knocked in,

1419
01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:39.960
bitches out left and right all the time and with little gloves it's going to be

1420
01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:40.690
very interesting.

1421
01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:44.700
I think she's training at a alliance down there teaching part of it.

1422
01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.420
She has her same striking coach from white tie but then I think she's doing some

1423
01:21:48.421 --> 01:21:49.021
at alliance.

1424
01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:53.750
If I was just going to be a level of technique that she has that most girls just

1425
01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:56.490
are not going to be able to hang with.
Just such a big advantage.

1426
01:21:56.750 --> 01:22:00.810
So Joanna's pretty fucking high level dude.
I agree but let,
let,

1427
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:03.530
let tiff get a few fights.
Then he got yourself a real burn.

1428
01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:07.610
Burn it cause everyone else in that division can't even match up with a strike

1429
01:22:07.611 --> 01:22:10.530
and wise.
His Tran.
Yeah,
there's a,

1430
01:22:10.531 --> 01:22:13.980
there's a lot of dangerous kickbox and women that are coming over now like a

1431
01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:17.360
Valentina Shevchenko you see when she puts Holly Holm Down,

1432
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:18.181
she's fighting in the UFC.

1433
01:22:18.181 --> 01:22:21.620
She do you know what I'm talking about in belt or the chicken belt?
Valentino.

1434
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:25.380
When you see like all her years of of [inaudible] experience at a world

1435
01:22:25.381 --> 01:22:28.540
championship level,
when she fight someone like Holly,
you get to see that like,

1436
01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:32.040
oh there's levels to this shit.
Plus they there that,
yeah,

1437
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:34.230
that check hook that you kept nailing it with a check.

1438
01:22:34.231 --> 01:22:37.290
Right Hawk like Holly got rattled like early in the first round.

1439
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:40.480
He realized like the timing is very different for someone who's that good plus.

1440
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:44.250
Plus those girls that come from that super high level background of striking was

1441
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:46.180
boxing,
Muay Thai,
whatever it is.

1442
01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.000
You don't really see women come from a high level background other than those

1443
01:22:51.001 --> 01:22:52.170
two.
The ones that do,

1444
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:57.200
I have to just to some of Kenzie dern she's in now in the UFC with high low with

1445
01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.900
WHO's killing it.
Well she's not in it yet,
but I mean then she just women out.

1446
01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:05.710
She did.
She had one fight.
Mackenzie dern.
Yeah,
UFC.
Yeah.

1447
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.580
I'm just saying Joe from history with women's fighting,

1448
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:12.190
usually they come from that high level striking background.

1449
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.700
They have such an advantage because they've been in the live fire.

1450
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:17.480
You know what I'm saying?
So when they get in the UFC,

1451
01:23:17.481 --> 01:23:20.680
he knew the fight and the girl who maybe she just likes to fight and do it all.

1452
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.940
When they fight these super high level strikers,
they're fucked man.
Yup.

1453
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:26.550
A lot of them.
That's why you know,

1454
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:31.540
that's where they're going to need that wrestling and Jujitsu and I don't think

1455
01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:36.010
about Daymond Maya's when he gets the back,
a lot of people get the back and MMA,

1456
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:40.630
but he ha he's on that Marcella Garcia level,
but when he gets your back,

1457
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:43.030
he knows how to close and he knows how to finish.

1458
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:48.180
It takes so long to have that master because anybody could get on a back and put

1459
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:50.490
the leg hooks in and then they got the over on Fiverr,

1460
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:55.150
but people to be able to close that shit.
It's tough.

1461
01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:59.860
It takes a while and he got to the point now in the beginning it probably,

1462
01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:02.830
he wasn't really known for taking people's backs and choking him like really,

1463
01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:07.180
really easily.
It took a while,
but now man,
when,
when he gets your back,

1464
01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:11.350
it's very hard to escape unless you're high level,

1465
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:15.760
unless you're already at a black belt.
But you know he gets closes a black belt.

1466
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:20.690
Yeah,
different levels.
How many rear naked choke says Damien Maia got six,

1467
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:25.930
seven.
Dot.
It's like when he gets to that position,

1468
01:24:25.931 --> 01:24:29.470
he doesn't even have to get into your chin.
He just squeezes your fucking head,

1469
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.820
all that shit.
That's what it's all about.
Closing the deal,
making you tap.

1470
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:38.120
He knows how to make you tap.
Somebody played an interesting video,
a,

1471
01:24:38.121 --> 01:24:42.270
they send it to me on Twitter of want to Hickson's black belts in uh,

1472
01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:47.110
Australia.
This guy's doing this demonstration with a rear naked choke and he's,

1473
01:24:47.111 --> 01:24:51.010
he was saying that the rear naked choke is all about the legs and so he's got

1474
01:24:51.011 --> 01:24:53.470
the rear naked choke on and just using his legs.

1475
01:24:53.471 --> 01:24:55.300
I was like stretching the body out like,

1476
01:24:55.301 --> 01:24:58.540
but applying pressure just with his legs and he was like,

1477
01:24:58.541 --> 01:25:02.650
that's what the rear naked choke so about.
I'm like,
man,
I see what you're doing.

1478
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:07.600
And I think that is definitely,
it's definitely,
uh,
it adds pressure.

1479
01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.580
It adds Po.
But to me,

1480
01:25:09.581 --> 01:25:12.580
I think the most important thing is to squeeze all of it because the guy,

1481
01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:16.060
every ounce of their body is perfect.
Yeah.
Everything's gotta be perfect.

1482
01:25:16.061 --> 01:25:19.740
But your hips,
your shoulders,
your neck,
everything has to be perfect.

1483
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:22.420
That's a high level squeeze,
right?
It's every,

1484
01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.290
I mean you get like Gary Tonin when didn't he a win Ebi.

1485
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:28.900
He got to run Nigga choke with no hooks in.
Yeah.

1486
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:33.970
If like a guy worldclass squeeze and you get to clean,

1487
01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.420
uh,
uh,
angle on the neck.

1488
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.930
If it's clean deep and you're under the chin,

1489
01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:44.020
you don't need that like hooks no more.
You know,
and Gary,
Tony and I forget her,

1490
01:25:44.021 --> 01:25:47.530
we did that too,
but he did that an Ebi five.
It was fucking awesome.

1491
01:25:47.531 --> 01:25:50.770
I forget what we did it to too,
but so he's the guys,
right?

1492
01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:52.600
Like legs definitely have a huge factor.

1493
01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.990
And when someone's got your back and they have like really,
like if you see,

1494
01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:00.550
ever see,
um,
when,
uh,
Tokyo,
uh,
grappled with mayhem.
Miller,
yes.

1495
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.610
Jesus Christ.
And the grappling.
No,
they were in Brazil,

1496
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:09.020
Brazil and he was down there training and uh,
to just,

1497
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:11.570
well I talked to man,
man was like,
hey all y'all,

1498
01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:15.530
I was out partying the night before drunk.
It was probably totally true,
you know,

1499
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:18.140
but it didn't matter to Kenya just took it,

1500
01:26:18.150 --> 01:26:20.420
took his back like a ghost or took his arm.

1501
01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:24.290
I thought that was half size has salivary varies when it was his arm.

1502
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.400
You're talking about,
you're talking about when he was smart Pahara pop.

1503
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:30.580
I thought that's what I'm talking about.
Paul Harris.
Yeah,
that's his nickname.

1504
01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.750
Means tree stump.
But um,

1505
01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.350
there was a guy like that when they get,

1506
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:39.860
they get your back with those giant ass legs that he has when he's like

1507
01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:43.460
squeezing down on your shit and stretching you out as he's choking you.

1508
01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:49.150
Fucking Keanio and Polaris.

1509
01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:53.270
Yes.
You see that?
Yeah.
Amazing.
Amazing.

1510
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:57.080
That's an example of caring of those submission only matches that ends up in a

1511
01:26:57.081 --> 01:26:59.470
draw,
but it was amazing.
You know what I mean?

1512
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:03.080
There's so many bad ass draws out there.
They're not all bad.

1513
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:06.200
Just because it's the draw doesn't mean that,
I mean,
oh,

1514
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:11.450
draw with sideboards to a guy like you or are you who could really appreciate

1515
01:27:11.451 --> 01:27:14.900
the technique and sees what's,
did you just say,
look at my drove a Cyborg,

1516
01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:16.360
all this sleep debt,

1517
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:22.580
paying attention.
Still don't man.
I know.
It's crazy.

1518
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.980
What's crazy about this Ebi coming up?

1519
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:27.630
It's one of the worst case scenarios people would,
would,

1520
01:27:27.631 --> 01:27:30.170
would come up to me and ask me about it and I would think about it too,

1521
01:27:30.171 --> 01:27:31.370
is like would have someone,

1522
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:36.371
one Ebi by escapes got into overtime and every round and then one by quick

1523
01:27:38.061 --> 01:27:41.630
escape time.
Like what would,
would that ruin the show?
And I thought,
damn,

1524
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:42.870
I don't know,
but it wired.

1525
01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:46.940
Oh tell us he's a turtle guard master and Turtle Gardens is basically giving up

1526
01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:50.090
your back.
So anybody who goes to turtle guard,
very few people can do this.

1527
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:53.810
They got to have the best back defense ever.

1528
01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:56.210
If you're going to play turtle guard,
right?
Right.
So he does.

1529
01:27:56.211 --> 01:27:59.050
And he's known that and he's known in the Jujitsu communities,
that legend,

1530
01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:03.590
Legend,
Legend at defense.
Untoppable this guidewire don't tell us.

1531
01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.130
So he's doing Ebi eight next Sunday.
You can watch the countdown show on,

1532
01:28:08.131 --> 01:28:11.020
on Youtube.
Ebi countdown.
Ebi Eight.
Uh,

1533
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:16.390
he's on the countdown show talking about winning Ebi on escapes.

1534
01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:20.600
That's crazy.
So now that's an actual real scenario that we're dealing with.

1535
01:28:20.601 --> 01:28:22.850
So instead of killing the show,
now it's like,

1536
01:28:22.851 --> 01:28:27.440
it's actually interesting to see if he could win the whole thing by escaping.

1537
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:31.400
So look at this shit.
Ricardo Lamas versus Bj Penn.

1538
01:28:31.401 --> 01:28:35.800
October 15th and Manila.
They do that to my boy,
Bj Penn's.

1539
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.920
Why not man?
Let's see.
What's a good fight right there.
See what's up.

1540
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.990
I keep thinking Bj's retired.
He's,

1541
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:47.140
well BJ honestly should be fighting someone who is outside of the top 20 to like

1542
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:53.300
get his uh,
his timing back,
but let him fight Sam punked.

1543
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:54.380
But that said,

1544
01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:59.590
Bj Penn is fucking Bj Penn and Bj Penn wants to fight the tough guys because

1545
01:28:59.591 --> 01:29:02.070
whatever he wants,
he can do whatever he wants.
And if

1546
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.500
<v 0>he doesn't fight it,
a guy who's like super dangerous,</v>

1547
01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:06.960
he's probably not going to train as hard.
He's not going to get up for it.

1548
01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:11.660
So this is how Bj's Kinda gotta do it.
Fucking love smart lamas.

1549
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.680
Call him out or something happened around him.

1550
01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.970
[inaudible] he had a fight with,

1551
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.800
was it Bermudez who the fight he had scheduled,

1552
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:25.770
it wasn't tense from you up to meet us?
No,
it wasn't Bermuda.

1553
01:29:26.490 --> 01:29:29.640
Someone he had a fight scheduled rents?
No,

1554
01:29:29.641 --> 01:29:33.410
it wasn't Nick Lens Cause Nick Lands fighting at one 55.
Um,

1555
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:38.520
they um,
there was some fight that got canceled because yeah,

1556
01:29:38.521 --> 01:29:42.070
because Bj had taken a Nivea to rehydrate himself.
That was on the a La Carte.

1557
01:29:42.130 --> 01:29:45.870
Yeah.
What was the fight?
I see if your front and out anyway,

1558
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.240
so they had to give him another fight.

1559
01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:51.210
And so the other fight that gave him as lamas,
which is a tough,

1560
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:55.650
anybody through the fucking one 45.
Bj Penn,
what are you going to do?
But still,

1561
01:29:55.651 --> 01:30:00.480
apparently he's,
he's uh,
his fighting stance is back to the old Bj,
right?
Yeah.

1562
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:03.130
He went to Winkle.
John,
you know what I mean?

1563
01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:06.090
In Brandon gives you there now and yeah,
he's,
he's been training that.

1564
01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:10.530
Jackson's it.
Here it goes.
What does it say?
Cole Miller.
Oh,
Cole Miller.

1565
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:14.170
Cole Miller is a real good fight.
That's a real good point too.

1566
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:17.520
That's a real good fight.
Did he listen man,
he did.

1567
01:30:17.521 --> 01:30:20.850
He went to remember people would say,
what did Bj when to like Jack?

1568
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:24.930
What would happen then?
And he actually did it.
How cool is that?

1569
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:27.090
He speech a fucking pen.
Don't ever forget that.

1570
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:31.050
If that guy's body is willing and he could figure out a way to motivate himself

1571
01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:34.930
into awesome shape again,
he is Bj motherfucking.

1572
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:36.390
I think he should.

1573
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:40.860
I think he should just focus on using a striking to take people down and just

1574
01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:45.000
take him to the ground.
I think he's still one of the best on the ground.

1575
01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.130
You know who I don't want to see fight again and I hope,

1576
01:30:47.131 --> 01:30:50.520
I hope for whatever reason,
contractual.
It doesn't happen as GSP man,

1577
01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:53.760
his last like three or four fights,
so many hits to the head.

1578
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:58.110
He has money in the bank.
The 70 pound divisions completely changed now.

1579
01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:01.500
I just don't want to see it.
Maybe he's bored.
He promptly,

1580
01:31:01.501 --> 01:31:04.590
he must be bored as fuck.
Making like kickbox or two and shit.
Yeah,

1581
01:31:04.591 --> 01:31:06.640
and he did something with a cigar or so.

1582
01:31:06.641 --> 01:31:10.290
God kills him and some movie that would make me want to fucking get back to

1583
01:31:10.291 --> 01:31:11.210
anything else.

1584
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:16.110
Different video that he's not been missing any meals.

1585
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:21.070
Oh,
he's so big now.
She's so big.
It's crazy.
He would fuck you guys.

1586
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:24.750
Is this giant barrel of a chest he's like,

1587
01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:26.860
has got to be a hundred pounds overweight.
Yeah.

1588
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:31.470
It's really weird because like if you go back to like hard to kill like this

1589
01:31:31.471 --> 01:31:35.540
first.
Oh my God,
he looks awesome.
I used to like him man under sea.

1590
01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:37.290
Each one watch your mouth.

1591
01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:40.140
Posy did a bunch of weird stuff that nobody's ever seen before.

1592
01:31:40.141 --> 01:31:41.250
A bunch of smacking.

1593
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.390
Like it's like if you go and watch Steven Seagal is earliest movie.

1594
01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:50.010
It was hard to kill,
right?
No,
no.
It wasn't for justice saw above.
Above the law,

1595
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:53.910
justice and Bob above the laws as first one.

1596
01:31:54.150 --> 01:31:58.350
It's fun to watch like his fight scenes.
You're like,
I kind of feeling this.

1597
01:31:58.351 --> 01:32:01.960
I feel like he could pull this off.
You know,

1598
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.940
he's kind of doing like wing Chong,

1599
01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:07.570
but he's smacking some fucking clothes lines on people and sweeping them off

1600
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:09.700
their feet and snapping arms and shit.

1601
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:13.960
I think it's actually kind of a good actor too under siege ones too is fucking

1602
01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:15.700
brilliant.
Laura's feels great.

1603
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:19.470
Who does face in [inaudible] 88 and 88 above the law.
Handsome too.

1604
01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:20.470
Time piece and hard to,

1605
01:32:20.471 --> 01:32:25.471
Kenny was only probably 30 years old back then teaching a Kido in Japan.

1606
01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.850
He was a first American to run a Dojo in Japan.
That's under a,

1607
01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:35.250
that's been a contestant.
Shut the fuck up Brian.
Why are you ruining?
Sorry Buddy.

1608
01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.270
Sorry,
I'm looking at it back then.
Look at the body,

1609
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:43.000
but that's a body of a guy who actually knows martial arts.
Now he's um,

1610
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.261
or not.
I mean,

1611
01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:49.261
I don't know sort of that nude John Claude van Damme show cause John Claude van

1612
01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:53.470
Johnson,
he plays himself and he's Van Johnson.
The reality show.

1613
01:32:53.471 --> 01:32:57.250
Dave Callahan wrote that the D my student who wrote a Godzilla.
Yeah.
Yes.

1614
01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:01.170
And show now it's on Amazon or I don't even know,
but I'm Tate's in it too.

1615
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.940
Really?
It's got John Claude van Johnson.

1616
01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.890
It's about John Claude van Damme is in any plays himself and he's like this like

1617
01:33:08.891 --> 01:33:10.780
washed up actors.
Like he's just himself.

1618
01:33:10.781 --> 01:33:14.440
So it's a story about John Compton dam and he's playing himself but making fun

1619
01:33:14.441 --> 01:33:16.900
of like a parody.
Yeah,
it's kind of like that little bit.
Damn Times.

1620
01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:22.050
Choose to watch it.
I love it.
Supposed to be plenty of shit.
Can't that shit.

1621
01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:26.340
Can't do it.
I remember him from bloodsport.

1622
01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:29.510
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1623
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:32.080
<v 0>Awful.
Josh Barnett still swinging.
Got Debit.</v>

1624
01:33:32.081 --> 01:33:35.590
That's a total bilirubin is still throwing leather.
Tough fight to call man.

1625
01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:40.390
Two vets.
Yeah.
You saw the testing Germany.
Well,

1626
01:33:40.391 --> 01:33:40.721
I mean,

1627
01:33:40.721 --> 01:33:43.720
who would have ever predicted that are Lawsky would've gotten that close to a

1628
01:33:43.721 --> 01:33:47.380
title shot again after all those years out,

1629
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:52.240
I have to get in starched barked surgery Keratan off after getting beaten down

1630
01:33:52.241 --> 01:33:55.570
by rumble Johnson to come back from all that,

1631
01:33:55.810 --> 01:34:00.580
get back into the UFC and work his way to the top for like what amazing.

1632
01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:05.260
How the fuck did he do that when to Jackson's got a huge four or five fight win

1633
01:34:05.261 --> 01:34:07.090
streak.
Amazing.
I mean,

1634
01:34:07.091 --> 01:34:10.690
it's amazing when like a lot of people thought the care I'll fight.
Like they,

1635
01:34:10.691 --> 01:34:12.900
like someone's got to step in,
someone's got to knows.

1636
01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:16.450
It's amazing the difference in his nose now.
And when he first started fighting,

1637
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.670
did you know many times this guy's been knocked out?

1638
01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.790
Like if you really look went over like his entire career,

1639
01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:24.250
I would like to find out,
well,
between him and Overeem,

1640
01:34:24.251 --> 01:34:27.560
it's a God damn highlight ran in training.
I wonder.
Yeah.

1641
01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.530
Overeem's had a lot of style more than anyone.
Yeah.
Well all the kickbox losses.

1642
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:36.190
MMA losses.
Yeah.
Yeah man.

1643
01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:40.600
A lot of these guys have been stopped a lot of times.
I'm too slim for this.

1644
01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:44.380
When he
knows,

1645
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:47.410
I know that's a guy who's been in some wars,

1646
01:34:47.411 --> 01:34:51.760
man who's been in as many slug fest is our Lawsky Dan Barnett.

1647
01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.370
Barnett has,
yeah.
I mean they're close.

1648
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.980
But Andrea is almost always in slug fest cause he's a,
you know,
he's

1649
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.150
<v 2>not like trying to take someone down as Josh Barnett been knocked out.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

1650
01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:06.620
yeah.
He got knocked Travis Brown elbows to the back of their real,
real,
real bad.

1651
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:08.900
And then,
um,
before that though,

1652
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:12.200
he has for sure and the Grand Roswell just choked him out.
Yup.

1653
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:16.420
Rothwell caught him with that crazy finger Gogo gay teens,

1654
01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:18.110
whatever it calls it.
Go,

1655
01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:21.050
go get your team to so many different ways to put on that guillotine.

1656
01:35:21.051 --> 01:35:24.320
And they're all secretive because you can never see the grip and everyone has a

1657
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.380
certain way they hold a grip,
never gets a hidden grip.

1658
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.000
There's probably 13 different,

1659
01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.450
at least killing our Lawsky went old school with the,

1660
01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.400
with this pregame fight interview too.

1661
01:35:34.401 --> 01:35:36.560
He's talking about how when he was the UFC champ,

1662
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:41.440
Barnett was in prides and how our last,
he wasn't the real champ.
He was.
Yeah,

1663
01:35:41.441 --> 01:35:45.380
but,
but John [inaudible] was never a champion Raj ago.
I know,
but he was just,

1664
01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.220
he was a runner up and he's the one they were asking Barnett back then.

1665
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:53.330
He was like,
God,
UFC champ doesn't really count.
I lost,
he's not the real champ.

1666
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:58.190
Or Laski brought that shit back like an old elephant in,
forget.
Wow.
He's like,

1667
01:35:58.191 --> 01:36:01.000
excuse me,
sir.
That was 20 years ago.
Oh,

1668
01:36:01.001 --> 01:36:04.310
they'll have like an old Belarusian elephants.
It's another one.

1669
01:36:04.311 --> 01:36:06.800
If you look at him,
he's 37 that's amazing that he was,

1670
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:09.530
he was like elite in the UFC and it's early,

1671
01:36:09.531 --> 01:36:13.960
early twenties and Josh Barnett,
a youngest heavyweight champion.
Ever.
Rarely.

1672
01:36:14.130 --> 01:36:15.950
Yeah.
Well,
yeah.
When he beat Randy couture,

1673
01:36:15.951 --> 01:36:18.830
he became the youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion.

1674
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:23.480
But then didn't he get stripped?
It stripped,

1675
01:36:23.481 --> 01:36:27.320
stripped the pissed hot.
Yeah.
He's pissed hot shit between him and over him.

1676
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:31.100
It's a god Damn God.
The MLB and the in the,

1677
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:36.260
in the glory days,
Mark McGuire.
Barry bonds too bad asses.

1678
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:37.573
They'll piss hot.

1679
01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.870
It will be interesting if Bella toward just becomes like a PD ling pride.

1680
01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:46.720
Just ped league.
Just let them do whatever.
Taco Bell said that he's like our,

1681
01:36:46.721 --> 01:36:49.880
our walkouts.
We tried to mimic pride.
I'm like,
yeah,
for sure.

1682
01:36:49.881 --> 01:36:54.380
Just look guys juice to the Gill and do that.
Do you hate money Mr Coatsin try.

1683
01:36:54.381 --> 01:36:56.540
I smoke juice to the guilt.

1684
01:36:56.870 --> 01:37:01.260
I mean someone's got to explain to me Bobby Lashley explain why.

1685
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:04.450
Explain.
Explain what's going on there.
How's that possible?

1686
01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.770
Why can I say a picture of place?

1687
01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:10.350
You're going to see him [inaudible] he's a very strong,
powerful wrestler.
Dot.

1688
01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:15.040
Jack is the cover boy for the smell test.
Look at them.

1689
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:19.430
Well that's um,
that's the craziest Shit I've ever seen him.
That's,

1690
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:22.040
that is so ridiculous.

1691
01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:27.480
Now does he moonlight as a bodybuilder or used to be?
Look at.

1692
01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:28.670
That's natural.

1693
01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:32.620
Those tribes are all natural and he fighting in Beltour looking like that.
Yup.

1694
01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.120
Yeah.
Show a picture of him in bells.
Dolce way.

1695
01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:42.450
Taking a lot of dolce way.
Rustler though.
Look at him there,

1696
01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:46.850
Jerry Bellis or look to the size of them in tour.
Yeah.
Now listen,

1697
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.850
some people are just born super muscular,

1698
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:55.420
but he only fights it funky places like they're not local Indian casinos and

1699
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.770
shit.
That's great.
Crazy shit.

1700
01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:04.710
This is the thing,
the nicest guy in the world.
Honestly,

1701
01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:09.650
on some Mexican supplements,
motherfucker can wrestle his ass.

1702
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.200
Yeah,
he's a monster.
I can eat it.
I'm looking at him.

1703
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:16.110
I wouldn't say he's a an accountant.
I would say he's a restaurant,

1704
01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:19.130
but he know he has.
It's not like cm punk.
Greyson is legit wrestling.

1705
01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:22.500
I believe that in the military he's champ and he's had a lot of fights.

1706
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:22.861
You know what I mean?

1707
01:38:22.861 --> 01:38:26.610
He fought and showtime for awhile or he's only had I think like eight or nine.

1708
01:38:26.670 --> 01:38:29.970
He's not that active.
We Fund strike force and lost a Trad Griggs.

1709
01:38:29.971 --> 01:38:34.440
Remember grave digger?
Yeah,
that's right.
The grave digger.
And that was like,

1710
01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:37.230
that was a big setback for him.
He had to get his shit together again.

1711
01:38:37.670 --> 01:38:40.710
Start all over again.
Transplants bodies and interesting.

1712
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:43.840
You know who his training partners?
Josh Barnett,
Bobby Lashon.

1713
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:46.020
Barden train together all the time.
It makes sense.

1714
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.960
Never seen by the less you taking now ever.
Okay.

1715
01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:52.840
Prediction Orlowski Barnett that looks bigger than us.

1716
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:57.420
Big Man.
They're both giant barn.
It's heavier or lost.

1717
01:38:57.421 --> 01:39:02.420
He's in better shape out as soon.
But uh,
Barnett's got a lot of options.
Yeah.

1718
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:06.570
Barnett,
he,
he's like a suicide guy.
His too many options and there's a lot of,

1719
01:39:06.571 --> 01:39:11.370
our last few of his only options is to knock them out
over the top.

1720
01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.520
What's going on?
Hey guys.
Oh,
what tough.

1721
01:39:20.190 --> 01:39:22.440
Oh my God.
We all out of our minds here,

1722
01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:25.520
one to oldies fucking slanging ice slot.

1723
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:30.260
Just took a big deep breath and by all these 12 years younger than me and Joe

1724
01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:34.890
Barnett,
it's sang something.
Brad sang something.
What he's saying he's,

1725
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:37.650
what was he grabbed like gloves.
He's saying he's grabbing my gloves.

1726
01:39:37.651 --> 01:39:41.310
Grab my gloves.
Oh,
is that what you're saying?
I think so.
Wow.

1727
01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.880
Let's shut up and fight.
I think that's what he said.
Did he say that?

1728
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:50.340
I don't think that show.
We said let's just fight.
Wow.
Holy Fuck.

1729
01:39:50.341 --> 01:39:55.200
These boys ain't messing around.
Wow.
This is when there are lots.
He does do this.

1730
01:39:55.201 --> 01:39:57.330
He's usually out his best.
Like you're thinking about Trump's brown.

1731
01:39:57.331 --> 01:39:58.840
We just caution to the wind.
Yeah,

1732
01:39:58.890 --> 01:40:01.110
but Barnett is good at controlling the pace here.

1733
01:40:01.111 --> 01:40:03.180
When he gets a hold of you like this,
this is going to saps.

1734
01:40:03.181 --> 01:40:07.890
Got the string wide hips.
He's just so strong.
So tank of a guy.

1735
01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:12.030
It's all,
it's super hard to man.
Fuck.
Oh,
caught on the break.

1736
01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.780
Who someone's about to get knocked out and get ready to Bulla is,
oh Jesus.

1737
01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.210
He's bleeding hardcore.

1738
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:25.440
Tough way to make a,
Oh,
don't listen to do that.
Left hook from Barnett coming up.

1739
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.870
This is intense.
Someone's going to sleep or real soon.
Oh Damn.

1740
01:40:30.871 --> 01:40:34.310
Attack that body.
Oh,

1741
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:36.143
there's like a,

1742
01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:40.410
there's like a weird way that our Laski throws his right hand.

1743
01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:44.130
If you noticed that,
almost like a,
like a whipping action from the hips.

1744
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:48.900
He doesn't throw it the way he threw it when he was young.

1745
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:56.890
He painted his toenails.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't bring it up.
Sorry.
Sorry.

1746
01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:59.320
He's a warlock.
He's a fucking warlock and I knew it.

1747
01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:01.090
That's what a bad motherfucker chuck with Delos.

1748
01:41:01.091 --> 01:41:03.460
He had everybody paying their damn toenails really did

1749
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:09.310
and no one said Shit.
I'm not saying shit.
I'm just,
I just made an observation.

1750
01:41:09.311 --> 01:41:10.330
I'll wind up doing it.

1751
01:41:11.130 --> 01:41:16.130
Sacrifice to go to Satan last night and that's why he had a stuff with it take

1752
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:21.040
to
see.
I like her Lawsky point.

1753
01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:24.510
Bartonella is backbone.
It's not like parties off his back.
Ramos.

1754
01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:26.840
He doesn't party off his back.
He doesn't.

1755
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:30.970
I wonder if she's got some shit off his back and they were holding Aussie man.

1756
01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:35.650
Come on.
So he went for a double wrist lock from the bottom for that bully.

1757
01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:38.620
Beatdown double risk luck.
Wonder what he was going to do there with that.

1758
01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:41.590
Look at a blood coming down.
He doesn't care.

1759
01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:45.400
That's a head by blood by looking at,
go ahead.
Give me a charley horse.

1760
01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:49.330
This is an interesting fight.

1761
01:41:49.331 --> 01:41:52.650
Barnett on his back or lost his legs.
Punch him in the Dick.

1762
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:57.250
He needs to watch his legs here,
man.
If there's one thing Brian,
it does.
No,

1763
01:41:57.251 --> 01:41:58.660
it's fucking like luxe done here.

1764
01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:02.270
I think you forget the sambo background of Andrea.

1765
01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.550
I didn't remember when he got,
what's his name?
Tim.
Sylvia in that,
in that,

1766
01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:11.650
a lot of strict.
A lot.
I think you forget about that fucking dude.

1767
01:42:11.651 --> 01:42:16.060
I think Josh Barnett,
Kiva Guard for one split second.

1768
01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.600
Barnett is thicker than a snickers right now.

1769
01:42:19.610 --> 01:42:24.450
Stop Vanilla snickers doing the damn thing.
Pig Man,
look at that.
Oh,

1770
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.570
and they're bolster their bolster skin.
This is the veteran.

1771
01:42:28.571 --> 01:42:32.650
Let's wrestle the arts.
Is that what it is?
Okay.
How many rest you rest?

1772
01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.310
Take it a couple of one,
two old bucks.
Keep the hands up please.
Somebody.

1773
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:37.940
All of you.
Brian.
It looks tired.

1774
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:45.280
Clash heads,
man.
She'd gone Teske as you Ganti man.

1775
01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.280
Nobody's,
oh boy.
Oh nation by our Lawsky.

1776
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:56.780
Josh tough.
He looks fine.
Josh Barnett looks fine.

1777
01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:59.870
Someone's going to sleep.
Barnett switch stances.

1778
01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.353
<v 3>Yes.</v>

1779
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:07.430
<v 2>Was He,
was he standing in the Orthodox earlier?
He was right.
Yeah,
he switches.</v>

1780
01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:14.310
Interesting.
I wonder,
uh,
there's our landscape.

1781
01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:19.010
Always have black nail Polish.
Sorry.
No,
first time I listened to guide.

1782
01:43:19.050 --> 01:43:22.050
Great fight.
Fuck his nail,
Bro.
I'm just saying,
man,

1783
01:43:22.051 --> 01:43:27.050
I'm allowed to make an observation.
God,
you're white,
Josh.

1784
01:43:27.051 --> 01:43:28.990
Let's get a 10 you're whiter than I am now.

1785
01:43:28.991 --> 01:43:32.090
He can't 10 it would look weird on him.
He'd,
he'd looked pink.
He just turns pink.

1786
01:43:32.091 --> 01:43:36.710
Right.
He'd be red and get all red.
Come out there like our red fucking pickle.

1787
01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:42.200
Yeah.
Fucking giant pickle.
A red,
white and said pick a lobster.

1788
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:47.150
Yeah.
He had a big fucking blonde lobster.
Josh has given up the neck.

1789
01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:49.070
He's like,
go ahead and take it.
You know,
I love,

1790
01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.980
she's begging for those crazy pull good dean

1791
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:55.340
<v 0>off.
Wow.
Both of them.</v>

1792
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:59.270
I would never think that Josh would lean on anybody like that ever again after

1793
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:03.950
that Travis Brown fight.
Well,
the thing about that is Travis is so good.

1794
01:44:03.951 --> 01:44:08.870
I am cause there's leverage.
How Tall Jesus,
oh my goodness.

1795
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:11.990
Slash knockouts on both ends here.
Oof.
Great takedown,

1796
01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.730
I think tries to only one who can pull off those elbows because he's so tall.

1797
01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:21.320
Maybe.
Well he's also just explosive as fuck with them in that position.

1798
01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:26.270
It's like that's his spot.
Deer tick and saga and they jumped on that.

1799
01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.070
<v 5>You're on the air.
We're doing the the bike companion,</v>

1800
01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:36.930
Joe Das.
Well,
Joey,
it's gone too.

1801
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.580
You're not watching the UFC on bypass.

1802
01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:58.280
Nice
legacy.

1803
01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.670
To be honest,
dude.
After a minute,

1804
01:45:04.690 --> 01:45:07.600
rest a the fights.

1805
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:12.170
You got to watch that overhand right.
Keep telling our Lawsky though.

1806
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:20.760
<v 0>Keep your head and chin.
That's I,
when I teach clench,
I always say,</v>

1807
01:45:20.761 --> 01:45:23.730
use your fucking head.
Spear Spear the chin.

1808
01:45:25.530 --> 01:45:29.610
When you what?
When I teach Clint,
when I do,
uh,
uh,
clench clinic,

1809
01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:33.120
I call it the clinch clinic with the kid.
Nobody ever comes.

1810
01:45:34.530 --> 01:45:37.320
But if somebody did,
I would always say,
use your head.

1811
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:40.280
I cannot get anybody to fucking calm.
And I have something to say.

1812
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:41.640
It's on a message board.

1813
01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.790
It's going to be a quince clinical with the kid piece of paper with a bunch of

1814
01:45:46.890 --> 01:45:50.230
things you could rip off that have the phone number on it.
Just,

1815
01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.750
just one ripped off and he ripped it off from himself.
I put it up on post,

1816
01:45:53.751 --> 01:45:57.810
get things,
go on phone calls.
I put it up on foam balls and nobody called,

1817
01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:01.130
nobody caught,
can't get anybody in my fucking clinics.
Man.
I have skied.

1818
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:05.760
I have cupcakes and Koolaid for everybody.
How's this not a five rounder,

1819
01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:10.050
right?
Brent has the old,
I don't give a fuck.

1820
01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:15.150
Isn't every main event five rounds?
Is it a 500 it might be all it is.

1821
01:46:15.151 --> 01:46:19.830
It is size it.
The fucking reindeer thing was blocked in those all three.

1822
01:46:20.610 --> 01:46:22.890
Did you guys see that thing where those fucking reindeer,

1823
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:27.550
300 of them got a electrocuted d was it 300 of them was,
it's crazy.

1824
01:46:27.570 --> 01:46:29.070
How many was what?
Why don't?

1825
01:46:29.071 --> 01:46:31.290
Why don't want to say it's funny how many you got to keep your hands up.

1826
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:35.400
323 323 reindeer got electrocuted to death.

1827
01:46:35.610 --> 01:46:38.580
They were all standing in water.
Lightening hit the ground.

1828
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:43.380
The ground was soaked with water so they all got barbecue him instantly.

1829
01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.780
Boy,
these boys are hundreds of core.
Landed a huge,

1830
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.793
oh fuck.

1831
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:53.490
<v 1>It was harp.
So can you just go there and eat them?
Kick,
kick,
kick,</v>

1832
01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:57.900
go there and eat.
Although it depends on how cold it is,
you know,
if they,

1833
01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.060
if it was right afterwards,
yeah,
definitely.

1834
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.700
So that could happen to us when we were hunting.
Technically.

1835
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.500
Technically could happen.
Yeah.

1836
01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:07.410
Because of the ground's all wet so it's connective.

1837
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:09.210
So that should shut that shit all the time.

1838
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:11.880
It could happen while we got rubber boots on though.
Yeah.

1839
01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:16.620
We have rubber boots on and uh,
also we're not fucking reindeer.
Yep.
God likes me.

1840
01:47:16.621 --> 01:47:19.570
Morning likes.
Reindeers that's they're called Caribou.
I call them Karen.
Yup.

1841
01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.310
They're delicious animals.
If you were there and you,

1842
01:47:22.311 --> 01:47:27.120
you came right after the fact,
you'd be psych like,
cause you'd have all the meat,

1843
01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:31.170
you wouldn't want it to go to waste.
So it's not even like you,
uh,

1844
01:47:31.171 --> 01:47:34.290
you feel bad for shooting the Caribou did,
you're starving the wilderness.

1845
01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:37.740
You post those Instagram videos of grill in that fine,
fine,

1846
01:47:37.741 --> 01:47:41.940
loud me hungry.
It's my favorite thing to cook.

1847
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:45.750
I cook some last night.
I will say that one you did with the Jalapenos.
Yeah.

1848
01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:48.180
That's my shit dog.
My fucking mouth.
I'm telling you.

1849
01:47:48.181 --> 01:47:50.190
I know you like you're scared of uh,

1850
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:54.360
Eddie grew up with a fucked up stepfather and so he's got some crazy food issues

1851
01:47:54.361 --> 01:47:57.210
cause it's Stepdad used to force him to eat food.
So Eddie's like meat.

1852
01:47:57.211 --> 01:48:02.000
Potatoes stop,
don't get,
they'll get crazy.
And you don't eat meat?
No.
No.

1853
01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:05.170
She's like super like down in the middle except something I don't like.

1854
01:48:05.171 --> 01:48:09.390
It gave me something that brothers now and the milk is not gamey.

1855
01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:13.440
That's the thing,
man.
I'm telling you.
It's like,
like if you like a Fogo de Chao,

1856
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.030
you like when they come over,
it's not,
it doesn't taste like that because it's,

1857
01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.720
it's got more firmness to it.
Oh
now,

1858
01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:25.560
oh this is not good.
This is terrible.

1859
01:48:25.561 --> 01:48:30.000
Barnett is a smasher look at that instant pass full mount grape vine.

1860
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:32.760
Old School car at the Saturday night live ride.

1861
01:48:32.761 --> 01:48:36.390
We call it that Saturday night ride.
Got To call it one of the other,

1862
01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:40.840
you can't call skydive.
We call it staying alive.
Boy,

1863
01:48:40.841 --> 01:48:44.460
if you can last a minute.
He's going to be gas.
Got It for a minute.
Yeah.

1864
01:48:44.461 --> 01:48:48.670
I don't know about all that.
You might get as much tier dude,
just hold on time.

1865
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:52.210
He's looking for the arm triangle on that role.
That right Ana.
Did you say?

1866
01:48:52.590 --> 01:48:56.760
No Man,
just hold on him.
Yeah,
for sure.
With Josh Barnett,

1867
01:48:56.761 --> 01:48:59.520
we'll put a beating on you and that fucking mount position too.

1868
01:48:59.521 --> 01:49:04.270
He's an expert at maneuvering.
Get you in bad spots,
you know,

1869
01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:08.580
anticipating your defense and dropping those short palm to elbow elbows down on

1870
01:49:08.581 --> 01:49:09.930
you.
Those press down.

1871
01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:14.190
You Know Jeremy Horn style elbows has a great head arm choke here that he's
does.

1872
01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.950
Jeremy Horn was like one of the first guys who were always teaching.

1873
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:21.200
I smashing him 40 seconds.

1874
01:49:21.201 --> 01:49:23.970
He's got oh nasty looking for that.

1875
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.440
RFO He's looking to straighten those arms out.
Yup.
But our last,

1876
01:49:27.441 --> 01:49:30.900
he's got fairly good defense,
but not right here.
Come on Andre.

1877
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:35.940
Don't turn it into not 30 seconds.
Oh my God.
He's getting beat on.

1878
01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.800
Oh Jesus Christ.
It's not enough to stop it though.
Is it?

1879
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.630
Because he's getting smashed.
It's over.

1880
01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:47.980
He's beating on him,
man now.
Oh,
it was fly.
You got time.
You got to tell you

1881
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:52.720
<v 2>that time.
You got time.
Oh,
now it's,
Oh shit.
He's going sink Josh Barnett.</v>

1882
01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.290
There it goes.
Oh,
he's going to survive.
I don't think so.
Yes.
Yes.

1883
01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:03.000
He survived it.
They're not going to stop it.
Oh,
he got it.

1884
01:50:03.570 --> 01:50:06.360
Wow.
Wow.
To what?
A beating.

1885
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:10.020
He took a ferocious bead.
Laughs.
He's in trouble getting up.

1886
01:50:10.021 --> 01:50:11.640
He's got to be reeling right now.

1887
01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:16.250
I mean his face is smushed and he's tired as fuck.
They has to be,
man.

1888
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:19.650
He just exploded for survival for the last minute.

1889
01:50:20.250 --> 01:50:25.250
The last minute was just a crazy swim to shore with sharks biting your asshole.

1890
01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.230
Is that Winkeljohn right there.
Got to go back out there.
That's,

1891
01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.870
that's Mike Winkeljohn is a god who was left like right in front of our Lawsky

1892
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:36.360
tools.
That's Mike.
We've

1893
01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:42.300
been here a bunch of times.
That's not good.
You've been here 100 times.

1894
01:50:42.330 --> 01:50:45.630
Well can literally on the brink of starting you start thinking about

1895
01:50:48.230 --> 01:50:51.680
where to either of these guys go from here.
I guess they're both.

1896
01:50:51.681 --> 01:50:55.720
They're both in the mix.
Yeah.

1897
01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:58.050
Heavyweight division is pretty old take down by our landscape,

1898
01:50:58.051 --> 01:51:03.051
but he got to reverse the momentum man mounted way and that's not what you want.

1899
01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:09.420
Oh my God.
Barnett just dropping bombs down on him.
Super accurate.

1900
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:14.230
Josh Barnett is no joke,
man.
Come on.

1901
01:51:14.290 --> 01:51:19.290
Andrea Barnett also can keep up this pace for five rounds.

1902
01:51:21.631 --> 01:51:25.350
He fought Roy Nelson and gave Roy Nelson a beating like that for five rounds.

1903
01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:29.490
He did.
That was super impeaches such a vet man.
He's seen it all.
Yup.

1904
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:32.460
Well he's also just so fucking tough.
Durable.

1905
01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:36.900
It has so many fucking trick.
But you still got the bomb man.

1906
01:51:36.901 --> 01:51:39.240
He's still got the bomb in his hand.
Look at him.
He's trying to set it up.

1907
01:51:40.410 --> 01:51:43.410
Oh,
I don't think that Landon dude,

1908
01:51:43.411 --> 01:51:47.520
it's weird the way he throws that right hand.
It's like his elbows down,

1909
01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:50.550
his shoulders up and he like,
he like whips it.

1910
01:51:51.390 --> 01:51:54.330
It's almost like he doesn't throw it straight anymore.
See what I'm saying?

1911
01:51:54.710 --> 01:51:56.310
And he throws that kick,
these getting caught.

1912
01:51:56.311 --> 01:51:57.450
That's the second time he's gotten caught.

1913
01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:00.960
But it's like he's thrown it with his body and then the arm is sort of following

1914
01:52:00.961 --> 01:52:05.420
behind it.
It's like whipping.
It's weird.
Oh,
they're so tired.

1915
01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:10.200
These guys are,
I mean,
if Kinda,
Oh man,
my Barnett,

1916
01:52:10.230 --> 01:52:13.820
right hand or net.
Oh,

1917
01:52:15.090 --> 01:52:16.230
these guys are amazing.

1918
01:52:20.670 --> 01:52:25.530
Well,
the ref didn't see it,
but it goes.
Got To stop it.
Pardon?
Oh Shit.

1919
01:52:25.590 --> 01:52:28.430
Oh my God.
This is an amazing fight.
Come on,
lost.

1920
01:52:28.431 --> 01:52:31.160
He said enjoy your wind with one fucking eye

1921
01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:39.980
or loss.
He needs to stop this shit.
He
Damn,

1922
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:46.910
he's fuck you.
Super fucked.
Yeah.
This is Barnett.

1923
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:51.530
All fucking says world
submitted.
Dean lister.

1924
01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:56.390
He on Gracie here on.
Yes.
Easily.
That is a big feat,
man.
Huge.

1925
01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:58.080
It's over right here.
This is nice.

1926
01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:02.600
Oh Dude.

1927
01:53:02.601 --> 01:53:07.270
This is a fill over and sit in.
Amazing [inaudible] over.

1928
01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.550
There's no way he's going to get until over.

1929
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:14.180
He's not going to get hit like he's going for the Colorado.
Alaska is a warlock,

1930
01:53:14.181 --> 01:53:17.810
so it's got those pipes gone for it.
Again.
This isn't that much room though.

1931
01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.830
Barnett upset that it got away,
man.

1932
01:53:21.831 --> 01:53:25.940
It's got to make a big point to try to get [inaudible] quick funnel grapple with

1933
01:53:25.941 --> 01:53:27.530
them.
Oh,
his elbow,
and I'm too,

1934
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:31.700
he's going to open it up so nasty little tender eyes.
It's so nasty.

1935
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:33.950
Do you,

1936
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:37.610
do you remember that time when Arlovski was on the ground and Roy Nelson had

1937
01:53:37.611 --> 01:53:42.530
them inside control with a double wrist lock locked in and they stood him up?

1938
01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:47.270
Elite elite XC.
That crooked ass organization.
Remember that?
Hell yeah,

1939
01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:50.870
I do.
And then
Oh,

1940
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.390
oh,
two minutes.
20 seconds.
That's not good.

1941
01:53:58.230 --> 01:54:02.600
This is not good.
He's gone back.
He's,
he had choked out.
Yeah.

1942
01:54:02.601 --> 01:54:06.140
He's giving up the back and judge,
judge,
Judge Austin,
he's flatten them out.

1943
01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.190
He's getting the neck that's tapped him.
Josh motherfucking Barnett,

1944
01:54:10.191 --> 01:54:14.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
two warriors,
man.
Two legends.

1945
01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:17.390
God Damn.
If I was Brennan Shop,
I'd say for sure.

1946
01:54:17.391 --> 01:54:20.260
Get off me before he congratulate.
Yeah,
for sure.
Get the fuck outta him.

1947
01:54:20.261 --> 01:54:23.980
And let's do this when we get up.
I'm sure his friendship Shit with mounting me.

1948
01:54:24.610 --> 01:54:28.970
Great Cardio you would does,
man.
He God,
is he good?

1949
01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:33.640
God Damn.
That was a good fight.
Tough as nails,
man.
Josh Brenna is tough as nails,

1950
01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:38.630
nails.
That was a Goddamn war.
Chase's whew.
What a fight.

1951
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:42.950
And you know,
all due respect,
he doesn't seem,
he's got great cardio.
He doesn't.

1952
01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:46.370
If you looked at his body physically,
isn't that good a shape?

1953
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:50.530
What's good Josh Barnett?
Come on now he's talking about the ledge.

1954
01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.680
Don't judge a book.
Don't judge a book by its cover.

1955
01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:59.480
Brick of fatal voice said that Leah Fate or God,
he's amazing.
Boom.

1956
01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:03.290
Oh No.
Oh
he had his hand.

1957
01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.940
Barnett fucked him up after this.
He went,

1958
01:55:04.941 --> 01:55:07.160
oh you won't put them in the fucking eye.
Check this out.

1959
01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:12.200
See this our Lassi left to fight there.
I poke thing that was weird.

1960
01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:15.950
Maybe see it.
You didn't see it when when they're looking at certain things,

1961
01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:17.900
you know and they Ms. Little stuff like that.

1962
01:55:17.901 --> 01:55:22.310
It's so hard to stop and reset cause you also stopped the momentum and the fight

1963
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:25.430
and sometimes a guy gets punched in the eye and they'll,

1964
01:55:25.431 --> 01:55:28.670
they'll real away as if they got poked.
But if you watch the replay,

1965
01:55:28.671 --> 01:55:30.050
it's just the knuckle.

1966
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:34.250
Chuck Dell used to get guys all the time and he would throw these wild,

1967
01:55:34.251 --> 01:55:37.370
crazy punches.
He would because of the way the raps are.

1968
01:55:37.371 --> 01:55:40.160
And because of the way the gloves are sometimes the chuck was punching you.

1969
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:44.100
He's hitting you like this.
She says these are growing in your eyes.
You can't

1970
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.790
<v 0>stop it because of that.
I mean it's just,
he's just dropping bombs on you.</v>

1971
01:55:47.791 --> 01:55:50.700
And sometimes they don't land perfectly with a knuckle or sometimes even with

1972
01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:54.690
the knuckle,
the knuckle goes into your eye.
But these,
um,

1973
01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:57.510
these things,
right?
These are not covered.

1974
01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.710
So if you're slinging and you catch someone like this and it goes in the eye,

1975
01:56:01.711 --> 01:56:06.090
it feels just like a poke duffing yet.
Stop it.
Yeah.
Probably with Dan Hardee.

1976
01:56:06.091 --> 01:56:08.200
Look at him.
He looks like an English team.
Did you see Bruce Buffer?

1977
01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:12.600
Fucking white Tux,
some Germany Shit.
That's up for and shit.

1978
01:56:12.601 --> 01:56:16.540
Don't bring that here.
Oh,
it shouldn't.
No.
Can't have that here.
How come?
Why does,

1979
01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:20.250
which can't do it?
No one talks to his heart.
Those aren't jeans.

1980
01:56:22.710 --> 01:56:23.543
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1981
01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.020
<v 0>Powerful,
powerful.
Josh Barnett.</v>

1982
01:56:27.650 --> 01:56:29.850
<v 7>I know we still down,
but</v>

1983
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:31.890
<v 0>we went for the finish every time.</v>

1984
01:56:33.090 --> 01:56:34.220
<v 7>Please give it up for all up.</v>

1985
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.640
<v 0>Give it up for Andrea last.
You Damn right.
Damn right.</v>

1986
01:56:37.670 --> 01:56:41.840
That's like a great sportsman.
This is a crazy division.

1987
01:56:41.841 --> 01:56:43.100
It's going to be opened up next week.

1988
01:56:43.101 --> 01:56:45.470
We're going to find out what the hell is going on because if Steve Bay can

1989
01:56:45.471 --> 01:56:46.221
defend the title,

1990
01:56:46.221 --> 01:56:49.610
you know you've got a real champion in your hands and if a Overeem could beat

1991
01:56:49.611 --> 01:56:54.140
him,
things get very,
very interesting.
And then you got to put the choke on.

1992
01:56:54.141 --> 01:56:58.520
Look at the grip.
Then he got Travis smushed it.

1993
01:56:58.521 --> 01:57:01.640
He like punched at it.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Huh?

1994
01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:08.320
Well he's a real artist when it comes to submissions.

1995
01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.720
Josh Barnett and the best of all time,
he knows his shit.
Um,

1996
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:16.720
there's some big ass fights coming up,
dude.
Some big ass rights coming out.

1997
01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:18.950
If you were to hit his face,
it would have been different.
Oh,

1998
01:57:18.970 --> 01:57:20.520
it's so fucked up man.
But that's,

1999
01:57:20.730 --> 01:57:22.560
that's stuff that when you see a guy turning away with this,

2000
01:57:22.561 --> 01:57:26.390
all you can holding in his eye like that.
Go ahead and put his,
um,
Jamie,
what's,

2001
01:57:26.391 --> 01:57:29.890
um,
the card next weekend?
Get the heavyweights right.
So you got,

2002
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:34.240
you got Steve Bay Overeem,
Verdomme Travis Browne rematch.

2003
01:57:34.930 --> 01:57:39.790
I didn't know until today.
Just now that Steve Bay over in with September 10th.

2004
01:57:39.791 --> 01:57:42.250
I thought it was today.
I've been really excited about it.

2005
01:57:42.251 --> 01:57:45.820
You thought it was on five path?
Yeah.
Why'd you think it was today?
I don't know.

2006
01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:49.270
She so you're upset.
I'm a little upset right now.
You thought it was next?

2007
01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:51.850
STPA Allister,

2008
01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:57.210
look at this very doom and Travis Brown.
Very interesting.
What,

2009
01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.870
what was the original fight?
Was it,

2010
01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:03.010
this is the original file for Bricio was supposed to fight.

2011
01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:07.420
Um,
God who pulled out?
Who the fuck pulled out?

2012
01:58:07.421 --> 01:58:12.100
Trust Brown was a late replacement.
Oh,
Rothwell Paul pulled out.
Oh,
that's right.

2013
01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:13.900
He pulled out.
Brown got back in.
Right.

2014
01:58:13.901 --> 01:58:17.830
Cause he's got his face kicked off by cane,
so he came back in for this rematch,

2015
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:22.570
man.
Travis Brown's in a tough spot.
He loses this one.
Yeah,
it's,
well,
it's also,

2016
01:58:22.571 --> 01:58:26.440
you'd taken a gun,
Rhonda.
Pregnant.
How?
Fairly shorter.
There's a notice,

2017
01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:29.620
not that short.
Right?
Like four or five weeks,

2018
01:58:30.490 --> 01:58:34.690
but it's pretty recent since the fight with 'em Kane.

2019
01:58:35.010 --> 01:58:36.940
I know it's tough to get back in.

2020
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:41.260
Then he got that spinning Kod cane.

2021
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:46.180
That's a good question.
Probably a title fight.
I would imagine.
Look at that.

2022
01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:50.590
Cm punk versus Mickey galls the third fight of the night.
That's crazy.

2023
01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:55.650
That is done before favor and uh,
it,
her,
yeah,
it's after Faber.

2024
01:58:56.330 --> 01:59:00.220
Yes.
Sorry.
Favor.
And Jimmy Rivera,
which is an interesting fight,
man.

2025
01:59:00.221 --> 01:59:05.050
It's Jimmy Rivera is a tank.
Super tough fight for,
yeah,
he's Wayne.
So dunny well,

2026
01:59:05.051 --> 01:59:09.400
he wins a lot.
It's the title.
Yeah.
Well the Dominick Cruz fight was,
you know,

2027
01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:12.770
he got dropped in that fight a couple of times.
He got hurt,
which is,
uh,

2028
01:59:12.850 --> 01:59:16.420
interesting.
I'll tell you the fight I want to see is a steep avers Kane.

2029
01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:20.500
That's the fight matchup wise.
It's such a fun fight.
Very similar styles.
Hey,

2030
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:24.610
what's going on with a tie?
Some off.
He can't get into the country.
I,
yeah,

2031
01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:27.820
I don't think so.
That's what I've heard.
Ted Cheyenne Wrestler.
No,
no,
no.

2032
01:59:27.821 --> 01:59:28.690
He's not the giant guy.

2033
01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:33.690
He's a one 55 or was he 45 or 55 who is he supposed to be fighting?

2034
01:59:33.850 --> 01:59:38.830
A 55 read.
Jenny looked that up.
Who is Lansburgh cyborgs funding runs.

2035
01:59:38.831 --> 01:59:38.981
Yeah,

2036
01:59:38.981 --> 01:59:42.610
he's fighting Nick Lens and that was it would nick lance has been fighting 55

2037
01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:46.390
damn.
Who is in verse is Dodson is Co Raisie.

2038
01:59:47.050 --> 01:59:51.930
That is God damn crazy.
October 1st.
Portland,
Oregon.
That is madness.

2039
01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:57.310
Who's the poor soul fighting Cyborg?
Holy Shit.
That's his name is Lansburgh.

2040
01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:00.870
Who's the body back fight and fucking Cyborg in Brazil?

2041
02:00:01.630 --> 02:00:06.310
Swimsuit model in Brasilia.
Brasilia that's going to,
you shouldn't be Jamie.

2042
02:00:06.311 --> 02:00:09.160
What's her background?
She's a demon hunter.

2043
02:00:09.250 --> 02:00:13.210
Landsberg she's all fucking go there with us.

2044
02:00:13.211 --> 02:00:17.830
She's a demon on necklace of garlic and a fucking sword with a crucifix of the

2045
02:00:17.831 --> 02:00:21.190
bottom of it and still won't help.
You will get knocked the fuck out.

2046
02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:25.750
Here's a shield.
Good luck and not enough fight.
Damn man.
That's when I'm good.

2047
02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:30.010
Loves can't beat sideboard.
Um,
that's a good question man.
Who is going to be,

2048
02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:30.281
yeah.

2049
02:00:30.281 --> 02:00:35.120
Marybeth tied them off out of UFC two or three visa issues such as like start
to,

2050
02:00:35.170 --> 02:00:36.670
he's very good.
So fucking,

2051
02:00:36.671 --> 02:00:39.640
but he's had visa issues for several fights in a row now.

2052
02:00:39.641 --> 02:00:43.780
I just don't know why the UFC can't clear that up unless there's some weird shit

2053
02:00:43.810 --> 02:00:46.990
for sure.
Somebody did one of what the problem is.

2054
02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:50.020
I don't understand visas,
man.

2055
02:00:50.021 --> 02:00:52.630
I don't understand like who gets them and who doesn't,
you know,

2056
02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:57.460
I think right now it's a little tough.
It was different grind.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I wonder,

2057
02:00:57.461 --> 02:01:01.180
I wonder what,
why did they decline those things,
man?
You know,
I'm a wonder.

2058
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:06.100
I don't know what it is,
but too bad.
Cause he could fight his ass off.
So good.

2059
02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:10.720
Yeah.
He's very good man.
Very good.
And you'll look at that whole card.

2060
02:01:11.650 --> 02:01:14.440
That's a Ooh,
Ian Mccall and Ray Borg Boys.

2061
02:01:14.441 --> 02:01:19.390
Ready to forgot that Ray Borg is no joke.
That's interesting.

2062
02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:22.610
Who's on the flight path?
Uh,

2063
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:26.440
batch go and he answered me.
Darryl's Shawn Spencer.
That's a good fight.

2064
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.720
That should be next weekend.
So,
uh,
what else is going on?
You are.

2065
02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:35.410
You're calling that fight off.
It's Habibi chimp.
I'm there next week.
Yeah.

2066
02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:39.070
Powerful Cleveland.
See Ya.
See You fuckers Cleveland.

2067
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:41.840
He's going to finally have one that's deep based town.

2068
02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:44.330
It's going to be interesting man.
They're going to come out in droves for him.

2069
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:48.610
Hopefully.
Yeah,
no,
it's going to be,
it's a,

2070
02:01:48.690 --> 02:01:52.340
it's a very interesting fight man.
Steve Bay is no fucking joke.

2071
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:56.570
It's a toss up for me,
but Alistair Overeem is so good striking.

2072
02:01:56.690 --> 02:01:59.660
He's so clever and sneaky and now the way he fights,

2073
02:01:59.930 --> 02:02:04.670
he like moves around you and doesn't take any chances until he sees an opening.

2074
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:07.160
Then he snipes on you and he,
you know,

2075
02:02:07.161 --> 02:02:10.280
meal CIC has got to be able to counter that and if he can end clip him and hurt

2076
02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:13.370
them the way Rothwell did,
then the fight becomes interesting.

2077
02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.210
You also look at the way Steve Bay like almost terminators forward.

2078
02:02:17.211 --> 02:02:19.880
You know what I'm saying?
How that mean when this pace,
like you do jds,

2079
02:02:20.050 --> 02:02:23.960
you can't really do that with over Overeem.
There's no trading like that really.

2080
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:28.340
Well,
it's going to be hard if he gets hit with leg kicks like right away because

2081
02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:33.200
Alistair Overeem has some fucking for Roche's leg kicks and kicks.

2082
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:37.700
He also throws that left kick to the body.
He switches stances a lot.

2083
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:40.430
He can do a lot of different shit in their striking wise.

2084
02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:44.890
His knees are fucking horrific.
And then his grappling.
Yeah.
And his grappling,

2085
02:02:44.891 --> 02:02:48.500
his credit,
but we forget about it.
Yeah.
Is grappling is good.
It's a very good,

2086
02:02:48.501 --> 02:02:52.310
he won the European Abu Dhabi qualifier.
Correct.
And he's a,

2087
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:55.640
I think there's a first guy to submit veto before Jon Jones did.

2088
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:59.540
He submitted him with a good team back into pride days.
Now he's no joke,
man.

2089
02:02:59.930 --> 02:03:04.400
Yeah.
People forget about the Johnson versus boys.
It's hot fun hall brunch.

2090
02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:09.350
That's very good.
Yeah.
Y'All,
we riot hall almost got the Anderson Silva fight.

2091
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:13.760
Right.
And Anderson hurt himself.
He'll Brooks is a wrestling superstar.

2092
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:20.240
It's interesting,
this whole thing.
So interesting that it's taken so long.

2093
02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:26.390
Yeah.
I mean I uh,
I don't hate on the guy for pursuing something new.

2094
02:03:26.391 --> 02:03:29.210
Who am I to hate on a guy for doing something to him out of his lane.
You know,

2095
02:03:29.211 --> 02:03:29.991
that's my life.

2096
02:03:29.991 --> 02:03:32.810
But Cowboy and I were making fun of him the other day for being a straight edge

2097
02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.160
for not drinking.
People got so mad.
Yeah,

2098
02:03:37.161 --> 02:03:41.090
they got so mad.
He's never,
he's never been drunk.
No drinking,
no drugs,

2099
02:03:41.091 --> 02:03:44.360
no steroids,
no nothing.
And we were like,
all right,
good luck with all that.

2100
02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:50.510
How Fun.
People get so mad.
Like folks relax.
You know?

2101
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:52.520
If you don't want to drink,
you don't have to drink.

2102
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:56.180
I'm not saying you should drink and I'm not,
not drinking right now.

2103
02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:00.050
Dumped stone cold sober.
I didn't drink at all last night either.
I go many,

2104
02:04:00.051 --> 02:04:04.810
many days without drinking.
You don't have to drink,
but I only drink here.
I,
I,

2105
02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:09.290
I almost don't drink.
It's a fun,
Damn.

2106
02:04:09.291 --> 02:04:11.480
His shirt was super corny,
but you don't have to do it.

2107
02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:15.230
He's got a lot of guts though.
I'm not mad at his girl either.
Well,

2108
02:04:15.231 --> 02:04:17.090
it's also like how many options does he have?

2109
02:04:17.091 --> 02:04:20.360
It's really interesting when you think the fact that this guy was competing in

2110
02:04:20.361 --> 02:04:25.361
the WWE and he's going to fight at one 70 it's kind of crazy because you know

2111
02:04:26.361 --> 02:04:30.350
one 70 is small.
It's not very big.
A big way cut for him.

2112
02:04:30.351 --> 02:04:33.080
What does he walk around that?
No,
it's not a big way.
He's not a big guy,

2113
02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:36.650
but it's even more interesting that this guy was able to compete as a

2114
02:04:36.651 --> 02:04:40.110
professional.
Yeah.
Like on television,

2115
02:04:40.111 --> 02:04:43.230
like to do all that stuff against guys that they must be way bigger than him.

2116
02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.660
Cause he's not a big guy.
No,
he's not a huge guy.

2117
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:52.410
He's going to get fucked up.
Are you Eddie Bravo.
How dare you question the,

2118
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:55.770
you've been trying to look at the striking.
It's fucking elite.

2119
02:04:56.210 --> 02:04:59.270
You will train in three years.
How bacteria with Joe Rogan to elite.

2120
02:05:00.330 --> 02:05:02.850
It's elite world class.
Well it is.

2121
02:05:02.851 --> 02:05:05.100
He's trying to help world class level and he's,
look,

2122
02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.200
he's the guy who's taking a big fucking chance.

2123
02:05:07.201 --> 02:05:10.500
We can mock them all their stack that at the end of the day you got to respect

2124
02:05:10.501 --> 02:05:13.140
the fact that he's going to do it.
I don't think too many people would do it.

2125
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:16.830
Well,
I mean his level,
I don't know man.
Also,

2126
02:05:16.831 --> 02:05:19.680
I'm very curious to see how he responds to the pressure me to,

2127
02:05:20.190 --> 02:05:21.540
because you can't heat.

2128
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:23.970
That's the one thing that bothers me is I heard people go,
oh,

2129
02:05:23.971 --> 02:05:26.730
are you worried about the crowd and the UFC?
Jailers,
the real needles.

2130
02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:30.120
I've been in front of big,
big crowds.
It's no different.

2131
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:33.660
I'm telling you it's different.
I played football and way bigger crowds.

2132
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:37.260
Fighting's completely different.
Even though you wrestled,
it's one on one.

2133
02:05:37.290 --> 02:05:42.070
It does not,
but the is not real.
See,
he hasn't done anything.
Competition was,

2134
02:05:42.090 --> 02:05:46.170
no pressure.
Didn't do karate tournaments,
didn't wrestle,
didn't kickbox.

2135
02:05:46.350 --> 02:05:49.080
There was,
there's no Jujitsu tournaments in his past,

2136
02:05:49.230 --> 02:05:54.150
so the only competition is that he's had really realistically are smokers inside

2137
02:05:54.151 --> 02:05:56.980
the gym,
which I believe they put him through a few.
How they did.

2138
02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:01.190
How did he get into the WWE?
Like how did that happen?
What's that story?

2139
02:06:01.191 --> 02:06:05.320
He says he's not a big guy.
Was He an actor?
How did he do it?
Question.

2140
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:09.030
It's a good question.
And when he did that was something special about him.

2141
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:12.180
If he's a small dude,
it's just taking this guy,
you know,

2142
02:06:12.181 --> 02:06:13.550
he's been on any steroids and,

2143
02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:16.860
and he's doing pro wrestling because Todd happened.
She's a good talker.

2144
02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:19.440
But if you watch is like,
I mean he's good a entertainer,

2145
02:06:19.590 --> 02:06:21.030
but if you watch like it's pro wrestling,

2146
02:06:21.031 --> 02:06:24.780
like there's guys that are in pro wrestling,
they're just freak athletes,

2147
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:26.660
you know,
and they can somersault,

2148
02:06:26.670 --> 02:06:30.600
flip over their opponents and land behind them and then spin them around and get

2149
02:06:30.601 --> 02:06:33.190
them a figure for a toe hold or whatever the fuck they guy.

2150
02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:34.770
He's not one of those guys.
He's not one of those guys.

2151
02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:37.780
He was the guy that jumped off and did flips and status quo

2152
02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:42.250
Mexican mass one those guys the craziest,

2153
02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:45.640
they'll sponsor you in the legs and flip you buy your own neck.

2154
02:06:45.641 --> 02:06:50.040
Cause it's not as staff to do crazy shit.
That's just a law.

2155
02:06:50.050 --> 02:06:52.220
If you're going to be tiny and Rhett,
you gotta be fucking,

2156
02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:56.820
he was like the outcasts and Deb Darby.
He was like the the the anti man.

2157
02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:00.300
Like would it go against Vince?
Vince Mcmahon,
the businessman.

2158
02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:05.610
That was his whole spiel like one,
what is this jumping through the air?

2159
02:07:05.630 --> 02:07:07.560
It's going to land on a table or are we showing them,

2160
02:07:07.561 --> 02:07:11.940
make them do crazy shit there,
but that doesn't mean he's jumping onto a cushion.

2161
02:07:11.941 --> 02:07:14.580
How crazy that my kids do that?
My mom,

2162
02:07:14.581 --> 02:07:15.960
because it's a place down the street from here,

2163
02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:19.480
this trampolines and they have cushions.
He jumped on the sky zone.
Yeah,

2164
02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:24.330
all the time.
This is a,
I mean it's kind of funny,

2165
02:07:24.331 --> 02:07:27.120
but at the end of the day,
it's not like Brock Lesnar.

2166
02:07:27.210 --> 02:07:29.340
You look at Brock Lesnar and by the way,

2167
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:31.260
just he would move around and he'd be like,

2168
02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:32.760
I like to see that guy fight for real.

2169
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.250
You look at this guy and he's like a reasonable athlete.

2170
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:40.130
Like you look at his body,
he's like a reasonably athletic guy who's,
you know,

2171
02:07:40.131 --> 02:07:44.140
it looks like it works out,
but you like,
you look at his legs,
you don't go,
Jesus.

2172
02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:47.230
I bet that guy could jump over the fucking moon,
you know?
Well,
not,
yeah,

2173
02:07:47.231 --> 02:07:50.380
he's like a like a,
he's not a big guy.
He's not real athletic.
Yeah.

2174
02:07:50.381 --> 02:07:54.040
He just like your everyday average Jimmy guy and said,
cool.
Let's see him fight.

2175
02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:57.040
He has a big name.
Hey,
you never,
never wants tuning in.
Yeah.
I mean,

2176
02:07:57.041 --> 02:08:00.820
I do know he won't be the one 70 pound champ of the world.
We do know that.

2177
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:01.810
How dare you?

2178
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:06.040
How dare you question with a man to do that either look at him next to the rock.

2179
02:08:06.190 --> 02:08:08.270
It looks like the rocks about to eat him.
I will eat you.

2180
02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:11.770
I would love to see the rock fight in the smaller than the rock.
Oh,

2181
02:08:11.771 --> 02:08:15.880
he's way smaller than I'm doing.
Not In that picture.
Wow.
Look at those arms.

2182
02:08:15.881 --> 02:08:20.340
They look similar.
I got big arms for sure.
The camera thing.

2183
02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:22.670
It's a perspective issue.
Have you seen any of the,
I mean,

2184
02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:24.580
I'm not degrading his body or anything like that,

2185
02:08:24.581 --> 02:08:26.650
but if you look at most of the pictures of him wrestling,

2186
02:08:26.651 --> 02:08:29.680
like go to that one on the upper left,
right hand side,
go down,

2187
02:08:29.690 --> 02:08:33.220
scroll down a little Jamie,
that next column and there go to the right,

2188
02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:36.470
right there.
I click.
Yeah,
you can tell you wasn't taking cow.

2189
02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:40.300
It's like he's a fit guy.
He's in shape,
you know.
But I mean,

2190
02:08:40.330 --> 02:08:45.330
the difference between him and a rock or absolutely Lesnar like rock is like a

2191
02:08:46.421 --> 02:08:50.950
big powerful athlete.
A guy works out a lot.
He's,
yeah,
yeah,

2192
02:08:50.951 --> 02:08:54.460
he's a Jack fucking giant dude.
But Brock moves around,

2193
02:08:54.461 --> 02:08:57.520
their guy knows how to kill people.
There's a total difference.

2194
02:08:57.521 --> 02:08:59.770
Like when he grabs guys and what happened recently,

2195
02:08:59.771 --> 02:09:04.110
he broke some guy's head open with elbows and elbow.
Yeah,
it's all on purpose.

2196
02:09:04.130 --> 02:09:06.650
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it was a real shot.
Yeah.

2197
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:10.170
I would think they have a lot of scar tissue up there from k taking chairs to

2198
02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:12.970
the head and stuff.
So if you're going to open a professional wrestler,

2199
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:14.980
do it there.
Jamie,
you know this is true.

2200
02:09:15.490 --> 02:09:18.910
He supposedly got into a real fight with somebody backstage that didn't know

2201
02:09:18.911 --> 02:09:22.680
that the thing that was going out in the ring was staged to Oh really?
Okay.

2202
02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:27.200
I got mad that you went too far,
bro.
But he didn't let everybody knew about it.

2203
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:31.060
So they planned on doing that in advance.
So the guy in the back was like,

2204
02:09:31.061 --> 02:09:34.480
you went too far,
bro.
He didn't know about it and he didn't know it was staged.

2205
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:39.550
Is he retarded?
2016 has he not know it's staged.

2206
02:09:39.551 --> 02:09:40.960
It's pro wrestling,
right?

2207
02:09:42.010 --> 02:09:44.230
Supposedly Broccoli's there's none for going off script,

2208
02:09:44.231 --> 02:09:48.280
which is part of that motherfucker is crazy.
That's off script motherfucker.

2209
02:09:48.730 --> 02:09:52.810
Roid raging mother fucker.
Yeah,
it's a,
he's a big fella.

2210
02:09:53.290 --> 02:09:55.450
It's too bad,
dude.
Yeah.
You know,
you saw the,

2211
02:09:55.451 --> 02:09:57.330
I don't know what kind of a suspension they're gonna give him,

2212
02:09:57.331 --> 02:09:59.940
but they're talking about not giving them that much of a suspension.
Fuck,

2213
02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:03.540
I'm gonna get the Hillary Clinton treatment because this is a straight Clomid.

2214
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:07.420
Doesn't shut the fuck up.
Different.
The judge,
what the fuck is he talking about?

2215
02:10:07.421 --> 02:10:09.760
Coming back and fighting another fight.
Oh yes.
I'm sure.

2216
02:10:10.210 --> 02:10:13.930
I'm sure he would made a ton of money.
Crazy.
Marley didn't get beat up,
you know,

2217
02:10:14.170 --> 02:10:17.200
fuck mark hung control them on the ground.
Nothing that would be next.

2218
02:10:17.201 --> 02:10:21.110
I Bet I was going about to say that'd be an interesting,
that would be very,

2219
02:10:21.111 --> 02:10:25.030
and Jon Jones,
Brock Lesnar facing potential shorter suspensions from Usada.

2220
02:10:25.690 --> 02:10:29.200
Listen,
they need to just throw you sato and he'll go,
look,
we,
we uh,

2221
02:10:29.201 --> 02:10:32.140
we proved the point.
I think we got it.
He got it.
But how does it work?

2222
02:10:32.141 --> 02:10:33.980
Cause you it up.
You sort of take the place

2223
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.980
<v 1>of the commission now in testing.
No,
no,</v>

2224
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:39.200
it's not that they take the place of the commission.

2225
02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:42.410
I believe the commissions are still within their rights to test fighters.

2226
02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.660
You'd have to actually look that up to make sure that's correct.

2227
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:49.900
But the most important thing is the UFC is testing fighters all year round.

2228
02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.090
You have to give notice of where you are constantly all the time.

2229
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:54.530
So they're testing you,

2230
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:57.140
whether you're in competition with your attic competition,

2231
02:10:57.141 --> 02:10:58.220
they're testing you randomly,

2232
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:01.220
the shown at your house at seven o'clock in the morning.
And if they catch you,

2233
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:03.770
they're going to suspend you.
But who do they report it to?
Joe?

2234
02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:07.170
That's a good question.
Who Do they report to and who makes the decision?

2235
02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:12.320
Cause you saw it as hired by the UFC.
Like dill,

2236
02:11:12.321 --> 02:11:14.910
not us commission the Commission.
So,
and you cite a test,
you,

2237
02:11:14.911 --> 02:11:17.270
you get tested by two different bodies,

2238
02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:21.590
<v 2>right?
But remember you sought us,
they don't test the whole card.</v>

2239
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:26.840
Selective testing are not nuts.
You saw to the commission.
But the question is,

2240
02:11:27.170 --> 02:11:28.760
and this is what we talked grow Scott Coker.

2241
02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:32.990
So when you sign a test and who's an employee of the UFC,

2242
02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:37.270
the UFC hired Usada tests or athletes.
Nothing to do with the commission now.
So,

2243
02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:41.690
so when you Sada,
let's say they find Lesnar Lawsky,
you know,

2244
02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:46.010
random names.
Let's say cm punk fail the test.
Do they go,
Hey Dana,

2245
02:11:46.130 --> 02:11:50.710
he failed a test.
Like how's it work?
What's the exact steps?
What's this?

2246
02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:53.930
These our exact question on firing the kid.
No one answered it.
Really?

2247
02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:57.670
What's the chain of p?
What's the path to like in Dana?
Go?
Fuck.
All right,

2248
02:11:57.710 --> 02:12:02.420
well it's just Molly.
Let's not spend it for that.
Or he was,
you know,
it's this.

2249
02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:06.740
He's our main event.
Let's not do that.
I don't think I'd have to Dana or Holly.

2250
02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:11.040
There's no way I had to like to party.
It's weird to think about.

2251
02:12:11.070 --> 02:12:16.040
I don't know.
I'd love to.
I'll see.
There's no way Dana or whoever's late will.

2252
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:19.730
It would be Dan as going,
well,
he just spent for that.
Let's do this.
You know,

2253
02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:23.650
I think when it comes to Bella [inaudible],
the commission still checks,

2254
02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:26.990
but it's a random thing and yeah.
Well they can't be checking that.

2255
02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:30.200
They can't be checking that much.
Well,
no mission for fight week.
You get,

2256
02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:34.490
I mean it's,
it can for sure.
Well,
how does that guy,
Michael [inaudible],

2257
02:12:34.491 --> 02:12:36.830
whatever his name is,
get away with it.
Bobby Lashley.
Yeah,

2258
02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:40.040
he's fighting Michael Chiseling.
He's standing.
Michael Chiseling.

2259
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:44.750
He's fighting in places that don't have commissions like Oklahoma,
wherever.

2260
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:47.800
Oh,
certainly.
Certain states don't have no commission.

2261
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:52.810
So then Bella tore the UFC is responsible in deciding what they want to test or

2262
02:12:53.481 --> 02:12:56.900
not.
Like when bell tour went to England,
there's no commission.

2263
02:12:56.901 --> 02:13:00.080
There was no fight commission testing them.
So belt or had their own testing,

2264
02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:06.350
which has again,
how's that work?
Shoot.
It's interesting.

2265
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:10.410
That's very interesting.
And it fell as though no commission.
Do you think

2266
02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:13.750
<v 1>she'll be able to do whatever the fuck they want?
It's their organization.</v>

2267
02:13:13.751 --> 02:13:16.600
If they don't want to hire you Sada and they don't want to do it that way.

2268
02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:20.240
Let's see what it's like you do with the old.
Yup.
Well we still deal with,

2269
02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:21.160
you're talking about pride,

2270
02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:25.930
talking about a strike force to UFC pre days.

2271
02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:30.940
Talking about Uber in verse Broccoli.
Well,
without mentioning names too,

2272
02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:32.280
you can see set a difference

2273
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:35.490
<v 0>in some people's bodies in the UFC.
Now they've cracked down on this shit.</v>

2274
02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:40.190
No more.
The new bream.
Yeah.
Well maybe.
Yeah.

2275
02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:42.420
TRT TV tour.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.

2276
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:45.420
That was a weird one because it was so transparent because it was TRT.

2277
02:13:45.421 --> 02:13:46.320
I mean he was taking it.

2278
02:13:46.321 --> 02:13:49.080
It was legally prescribed heavy towards number one on that.

2279
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:53.520
He's number one also number one for like the poster boy for results like Jesus,

2280
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:58.230
where do I sign like fuck,
hello civic.
If you show a kid a video,
I'm like,

2281
02:13:58.231 --> 02:14:01.800
dad,
why the fuck would I do?
I have no sun,
no argument.

2282
02:14:01.801 --> 02:14:05.100
Like a human and Elian made a baby.

2283
02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:09.120
Even Tanner,
he was Tanner and the Mohawk,

2284
02:14:09.121 --> 02:14:13.290
the whole thing comes out like crosses shaved into his head.

2285
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:19.800
Uber religious.
Jesus ain't putting that testosterone in your blood son.
Yeah,

2286
02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:23.190
well that was one of the things that he said after he got off of it is that he

2287
02:14:23.191 --> 02:14:26.730
has a wholly supplement that he doesn't need TLC and the one working out for it.

2288
02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:30.120
It took a while for the holy supplement to really hand the blood of Christ.

2289
02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:32.790
I'm still fucking waiting.
Yeah,
just pray every day.

2290
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:36.210
Get Jack who's widening going to fight?
That's what I want to know.

2291
02:14:37.410 --> 02:14:40.650
He's fighting in New York though.
Well he should be,
but I mean damn.

2292
02:14:40.651 --> 02:14:41.700
He was like in the mix.

2293
02:14:41.701 --> 02:14:44.670
Now they're talking about rumble versus John Jones for a shot.

2294
02:14:44.671 --> 02:14:47.760
At the title and um,
they're talking about,
uh,

2295
02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:49.980
does that supposed to be at Madison Square Garden?

2296
02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:52.530
Is that they were saying that's what they're saying,

2297
02:14:52.531 --> 02:14:57.150
but I'm so wouldn't be Rockhold Weidman too,
right?

2298
02:14:57.210 --> 02:15:01.860
If Wyman two would be fucking awesome because you love is being the Henderson

2299
02:15:01.861 --> 02:15:05.770
for the title in England happening.
That's October.
That's in Manchester member.

2300
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:09.060
You would have Weidman Vuss Rockhold right.
It's not a bad idea.

2301
02:15:09.061 --> 02:15:12.360
But then what do you put,
what do you do with Yoel Romero?
He's still in the mix.

2302
02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.340
Very much so.
Yeah.
Not really.
He's out.
He's next.
Not when it comes to those guys,

2303
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:22.050
man.
What do you,
what do you mean hard to market?
You can mark it the fuck out.

2304
02:15:22.170 --> 02:15:25.440
You're not going to put uol verse one of these guys in New York.
It's a huge,

2305
02:15:25.441 --> 02:15:29.160
huge Madison Square Garden.
He's coming off suspension.
Rockhold Weidman.

2306
02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:31.290
We're going to watch,
let me tell you something.

2307
02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:35.940
I will see Yoel Romero fight against fucking or Nivo to wow.

2308
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.330
Rashad Evans,
maybe Rashad Evans versus y'all were okay.

2309
02:15:39.370 --> 02:15:43.950
Rashad's fighting Tim [inaudible].
What is this?
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

2310
02:15:43.951 --> 02:15:48.240
The only one that's supposedly confessed Jesus Christ.

2311
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:53.010
Wow.
That's interesting.
So it Kennedy's back in full training mode.
Oh yeah.

2312
02:15:53.070 --> 02:15:56.910
Cause he's been,
he's always interested.
He's,
he's been like still serving well,

2313
02:15:56.911 --> 02:16:00.230
he was in kill mode.
Yeah.
This is,
this is a fist fight mode.

2314
02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.450
This is easy mode for him.
Get ready for a fight.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2315
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:06.990
What is he talking about?
A guy living in an intense light.

2316
02:16:06.991 --> 02:16:08.940
Tough fight for a shot.
I like the matchup though.

2317
02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:12.570
It's interesting and see if he could make that one 85 cut.
Cause he was not,

2318
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:16.650
he's not a big two.
Oh,
Fiverr.
And he was carrying around quite a bit of muscle.

2319
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:20.250
Um,
I'm surprised Tim went,
went,
went on with the Reebok deal.

2320
02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:25.080
I wonder what did it for him?
I don't know.
Maybe
he wants to fight.

2321
02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:28.830
Maybe he just wants to fight.
But yeah,
man,
it's a,

2322
02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:33.840
it's to see what can happen without the Reebok Dia Without Usada over at

2323
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.240
Bellator.
And they're slowly starting to get top talent.
You know.
I mean,

2324
02:16:37.241 --> 02:16:41.980
now they've got Benson,
they've got Rory.
Rory voiced by far the biggest,

2325
02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:46.540
by far,
the best.
Right.
Young can still has a lot fight leftover.
Yeah.

2326
02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:50.650
And Ben's right up there within Benson Henderson too many,
too many long,

2327
02:16:50.651 --> 02:16:54.250
and he's had some wars.
He slipped a little bit.
I mean,
he might,

2328
02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:55.990
he might still be elite of the elite,

2329
02:16:55.991 --> 02:16:59.930
but at one point in time he's accomplished more than any of them.
I mean,
he's,

2330
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:04.180
he was,
yeah.
I mean,
he was a champ.
Yeah,
that'd be,
see Chubby

2331
02:17:06.210 --> 02:17:08.770
casts even kind of talk that,
he kind of hinted that,
you know,
he's not,

2332
02:17:09.130 --> 02:17:12.220
he's coming to the end of sort of what he considers his MMA career.

2333
02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:16.240
I only do it for so long,
but he didn't hit that.
Now.
He still,

2334
02:17:16.241 --> 02:17:19.870
he thinks he's going to be champ and he's also fighting for the belt.
Sure.

2335
02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:21.670
He's fighting the Chandler for the belt,

2336
02:17:21.671 --> 02:17:25.870
which is a tough fucking five tough fucking chairs and nightmare.
He's dangerous.

2337
02:17:25.871 --> 02:17:27.790
And Ben hasn't let you know.
I Love Ben.
He knows,

2338
02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:30.790
but he hasn't looked that great and part the tour lost his first fight,

2339
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.270
his last fight with pit bull.
Not a great pilot.

2340
02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:35.380
I'm actually losing that fight until people got hurt.

2341
02:17:35.490 --> 02:17:38.170
Rory is going to take a whole year off for his nose.

2342
02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:43.870
And that's from Robbie Lawler?
Yeah,
Wonderboy to mash them up.
Fight.

2343
02:17:43.871 --> 02:17:45.100
Well the Wonderboy open it up,

2344
02:17:45.101 --> 02:17:49.150
but as Robbie Lawler broke it so bad and that fight that he broke it twice more

2345
02:17:49.151 --> 02:17:52.120
and training for wonder boy just kept,
keeps breaking was,

2346
02:17:52.121 --> 02:17:54.730
I don't know if he gets surgery for that,
like what do you do?

2347
02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:58.390
He thinks just time,
like he had the proper surgery,

2348
02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:01.690
but he keeps rushing back and it's just not getting better and breathe.

2349
02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:05.710
If he had the proper surgery and he went and got smashed up again,

2350
02:18:05.711 --> 02:18:08.260
it's probably got to be cleared out with true clear up again.

2351
02:18:08.261 --> 02:18:09.670
So maybe that's why he's taking a year.

2352
02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:11.560
That is such an issue with fighters because they get,

2353
02:18:11.670 --> 02:18:14.200
they want to get their nose fixed,
but if you do get your nose fixed,

2354
02:18:14.201 --> 02:18:15.880
you really shouldn't get punched in it for a while.

2355
02:18:15.970 --> 02:18:18.640
But if you don't get your nose fixed and you can't breathe out of your fucking

2356
02:18:18.641 --> 02:18:21.490
nose,
you have to do it.
Yeah,
it's,
it's a real weird,
fun.

2357
02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:26.950
Vandelay had the craziest solution.
Make your nose bigger.
Go to get surgery.

2358
02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:31.800
Take a chunk of cartilage.
Your ribbon.
Make me a big nose.
Breathe out.

2359
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:34.480
Yeah.
Gimme that Lebron James knows.
I'll take them the Bron.

2360
02:18:34.510 --> 02:18:38.770
He got this like extra chunk in his nose where his nose was like it did.

2361
02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:43.210
It was bigger than it was before.
His fighting career.
He got a nose job.

2362
02:18:43.211 --> 02:18:47.110
Let's be real here.
He got a nose.
Job is bigger.
Yes.

2363
02:18:47.111 --> 02:18:50.410
Which is cray just written.
No one's ever,
Hollywood is like,
do what?

2364
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:55.450
I want it bigger.
Bigger with my nostrils like this.
So the air's like Ram,

2365
02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.800
Ram air,
right.
Nostrils.

2366
02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:03.070
Like he's got a hood scoop on the life if you want.
I guess.
Man,

2367
02:19:03.730 --> 02:19:07.990
it's fucking nuts.
We think about it.
That is funny,
man.
It is funny.

2368
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:12.190
Yeah.
He's a,
he had to get all sorts of stuff done.

2369
02:19:12.191 --> 02:19:14.380
He had to get his eyebrows cut down.

2370
02:19:14.390 --> 02:19:18.460
He had so much scar tissue around his eyes that his eyes were sagging.
Yeah.

2371
02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:23.230
He's,
well,
he got all this scar tissue cut and then they pull it up.

2372
02:19:23.260 --> 02:19:27.140
Let's say a before and after when you could see that he's got deep scars all

2373
02:19:27.141 --> 02:19:32.060
around his eyes,
like Vandelay has been in some fucking wars,
legend,

2374
02:19:32.061 --> 02:19:33.740
Legend.
And then on top of that,

2375
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:37.940
he comes from shoot to box and they're sparring sessions.
Nobody spars.

2376
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:40.820
Like they used to spar hell today.
Nobody does it like that.

2377
02:19:40.821 --> 02:19:43.610
They used to knock each other out for fun.
You can't,
there's an old,

2378
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:48.200
it's an old story of Vandelay four and after,
oh,
that's not a good one.

2379
02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:50.780
That's not even a good one.
Cause that right ones,
not the new one.

2380
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:54.200
Well the right one is,
uh,
the one on the right hand side is relaxed.

2381
02:19:54.470 --> 02:19:57.620
Like after the surgery,
go,
go above,
they're like,
they're like there,

2382
02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:01.820
he could see like it's,
you got to see him like right after the surgery.

2383
02:20:01.821 --> 02:20:05.090
That's his nose number three.
He's at three different noses.
Like it says one,
two,

2384
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:10.080
three.
You see that Jamie knows one then it was too,
yeah,

2385
02:20:10.170 --> 02:20:11.510
that,
so what that is is that,

2386
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:14.660
that's right after surgery and that's when it's a little bit more relaxed I

2387
02:20:14.661 --> 02:20:18.230
guess.
But yeah,
he uh,
he had to get sliced down.

2388
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:20.150
That guys had some crazy wars.

2389
02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:23.900
Him and shogun fought over a pit bull puppy supposedly,

2390
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:27.940
and he knocked shogun out and took the puppy.
Like they,
they made a contacts.

2391
02:20:27.941 --> 02:20:31.670
If I knock you out,
I get the puppy for free.
If you knocked me out,
I'll give you,

2392
02:20:31.671 --> 02:20:34.400
you know,
whatever,
whatever you're asking me and shit.

2393
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:36.850
She actually do a really good Vander Lee impression,

2394
02:20:36.851 --> 02:20:40.510
but I do know why it's in the old,

2395
02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:43.670
this is a good day of dawn in the Nevada.

2396
02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:47.540
This does the athletic commission.
What they've done is,
uh,

2397
02:20:48.050 --> 02:20:52.030
it's not good.
It's almost as good as Calvin.
Just like them.

2398
02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:56.510
They fucked him,
man.
He,
he might've got fuck more than any MMA fighter ever.
Yeah.

2399
02:20:56.600 --> 02:21:00.980
They banned him for life,
for life,
for life.
And he won.
He,
so they made,

2400
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:05.840
they threw it out,
but now he doesn't have a license.
He doesn't have a timeline.

2401
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:08.150
He doesn't have it.
And they're talking about him fighting.

2402
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:10.970
They were talking about him fighting fade or in,

2403
02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:15.080
in Japan in like December even had posters and shit.

2404
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:16.250
I don't know if that's ever going to happen.

2405
02:21:16.251 --> 02:21:19.400
When does it guy got after all that damage?
Take Stop.

2406
02:21:19.401 --> 02:21:24.140
I mean that's probably fade or I'll want to fight.
Fight the good fight.

2407
02:21:24.141 --> 02:21:28.300
It's like a Brazilian artist.
Well,

2408
02:21:29.170 --> 02:21:32.740
day the whites back to to pride.

2409
02:21:33.090 --> 02:21:37.350
Did you want to hear a fucking crazy story I heard about Jake Ellenberger pro.

2410
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:41.990
This is from his camp.
So Jake,
after his last fight,
have you heard this?
No.
Jake,

2411
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:46.310
after his last fight gets cut.
Joe Civil closet like Devin.
Oh yeah know.
Cut.

2412
02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:51.650
Jake flies to Vegas,
shows up with UFC headquarters.
Meet with Dana.

2413
02:21:51.651 --> 02:21:53.870
He's in his office.
He's like,
I need one more man.

2414
02:21:54.250 --> 02:21:57.060
You got to give me one of my fight monsters.
My head wasn't right.

2415
02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:01.010
I have all the shit going on.
He got to give me one more dance like I can't,
man,

2416
02:22:01.011 --> 02:22:03.860
you've lost whatever,
400 last five it just thinking happening,

2417
02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.960
gets up leaves and Jake goes,

2418
02:22:05.961 --> 02:22:08.300
I'm not going anywhere and I'm not going to give me another fight.

2419
02:22:08.301 --> 02:22:12.380
I'm not doing anything.
Are you staying at leaves?
Tell us all shit comes back to,

2420
02:22:12.381 --> 02:22:16.460
it's still in his office.
They,
Jesus Christ.
Amen.
Fine.
One more.

2421
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:17.840
One more fucking shot.

2422
02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:22.370
Pays go by day skill by Joe Civil calls,
his manager,

2423
02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:26.820
his manager Morgan,
who I know really well.
And he goes,
all right man,

2424
02:22:26.821 --> 02:22:30.810
we get your wife fucking fight.
Uh,
we got Matt Brown and his,
his magic goes,

2425
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.300
Jesus man,
Matt Brown.

2426
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:38.100
I don't know if we do have anyone else and Joe pseudos.
No,
that's the fight.

2427
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:41.180
Just forget it.
He doesn't have a fight.
Hangs up many more.
He was like,
no,
no,
no,

2428
02:22:41.181 --> 02:22:44.400
no.
We'll fucking take it.
And they calls Jake and then off.

2429
02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:47.890
See Jake goes in there.
Terrible matchup for him.
Just starches.

2430
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:49.950
Matt Brown knocks him down with a right hand,

2431
02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:53.210
takes him off his feet and then liver kicks him.
Great story,
man.

2432
02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:56.740
Crazy amazing when they told us goosebumps.
Good for you.

2433
02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:01.560
Good for you man.
Damn.
Desperation can sometimes breed great success.

2434
02:23:01.980 --> 02:23:04.590
God probably also started working with nick.
Curse on,
you know,

2435
02:23:04.591 --> 02:23:08.580
Nick [inaudible] who's a strength and conditioning trainer.
Speed of sport.

2436
02:23:08.581 --> 02:23:11.220
He's Martin Marinovich,
his disciple and uh,

2437
02:23:11.310 --> 02:23:16.120
he's the guy that's done Joe Schilling.
He handles providing a cough.

2438
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:19.590
Uh,
Aaron Peko like a lot of elite athletes go to him.

2439
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:23.580
It's really like pretty revolutionary strength and conditioning ideas and uh,

2440
02:23:23.581 --> 02:23:27.690
he worked with them and like really built up his training and built up his

2441
02:23:27.691 --> 02:23:31.470
endurance and did a lot of Plyo,
some shit with them.
And for Jacob,

2442
02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:35.820
I'll see his fighting just monsters.
We seem to be a little bit of mental thing.

2443
02:23:35.821 --> 02:23:39.210
He's been fighting forever.
So finding the best of the best.
Yes.

2444
02:23:39.211 --> 02:23:42.160
It's hard to first find the UFC is against Carlos condit.
Yeah,
man.

2445
02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:45.690
Remember he knocked out Jake shields,
knocked him out.
Starts to him.

2446
02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:47.510
Was it his first fight in the UFC?

2447
02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:51.030
Was it [inaudible] first fight in the UFC was Ellenberger I want to say conduits

2448
02:23:51.031 --> 02:23:51.260
first.

2449
02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:56.260
Frighten the Kim Wc Ellenberger his first fight in the UFC.

2450
02:23:56.611 --> 02:24:00.240
Then I want to know,
I was interesting.
It wasn't Nate,
right?
No.

2451
02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:02.540
Ellenberger is a beast,
man.
I was way down the road.

2452
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:06.420
Remember we need knocked out a Palae.
Yes.
Outside of the UFC.

2453
02:24:06.421 --> 02:24:11.000
Kol Palae with one punch.
I was like,
cray power man.
Crazy pay.

2454
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:14.340
Landy,
Carlos Condit Carlsbad was his first fight as well.

2455
02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:17.790
So I think it was Carlos his first fight as well.

2456
02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:20.033
<v 8>Hmm.</v>

2457
02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:24.480
<v 0>Decision Split.
Real close fight.
Oof.
And remember,
remember when,
uh,</v>

2458
02:24:25.050 --> 02:24:27.480
Jake Ellenberger beach shields?

2459
02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:31.440
That's the same week shields dad passed away and he was thinking about not

2460
02:24:31.441 --> 02:24:32.190
fighting.

2461
02:24:32.190 --> 02:24:36.030
They took the flight and just got starts not to take anything away from that

2462
02:24:36.031 --> 02:24:39.960
fight.
He was super close with his dad to SuperZoo imagine.
No,
I can't.

2463
02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:43.710
It's hard to imagine how hard.

2464
02:24:43.711 --> 02:24:46.260
Imagine fighting right after losing your dad like that.

2465
02:24:46.261 --> 02:24:49.830
Like your motivation would be out the window.
His Dad was his manager too,

2466
02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:50.873
I think.

2467
02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:54.800
<v 8>Yeah,
it's Obama ran.
Yeah.</v>

2468
02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:58.980
<v 0>What is this rumor Conor Mcgregor versus GSP at two oh five.</v>

2469
02:24:58.981 --> 02:24:59.880
Where are you hearing this?

2470
02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:04.550
<v 9>I was looking around for a rumor mill stuff for that fight and uh,</v>

2471
02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:07.330
there's supposedly a big fight announcement is all I saw.

2472
02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:09.570
And then I saw big McGregor fight announced

2473
02:25:10.010 --> 02:25:13.340
<v 0>awesome.
[inaudible] get wrestle.
Fuck.</v>

2474
02:25:13.341 --> 02:25:15.600
Just the roof right now compared to get

2475
02:25:18.270 --> 02:25:22.650
prepared to get French fucked for 25 minutes.
Give me my fucking money back.

2476
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:26.410
It would be interesting man,
because Connor is fast as fuck.

2477
02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:28.420
And at least in that first round,

2478
02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:33.160
while he's exploding with those ridiculous sprint punches that he lands,

2479
02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:37.240
he lands those counter shots on you and they're so fast and Peter's not slow.

2480
02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:40.600
He's not so way,
way too smart to,
and he's big.

2481
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:43.630
He's a big boy and can grapple with the best of him.

2482
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:48.580
And his natural walk around weight is a solid 20 plus pounds heavier.
Solid.

2483
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:50.140
Yeah.
Yeah.

2484
02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:55.140
He's probably in a lease in the high one 1800% and Konner weighed one 68 against

2485
02:25:55.271 --> 02:25:58.660
Nate,
which you gotta assume that that's him not really cutting weight.

2486
02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:02.720
He's just really fit for economists.
And everyone knows I'm a,
uh,

2487
02:26:02.810 --> 02:26:07.180
the biggest Connor fan.
But you look at the matchup that 55,
besides 45,

2488
02:26:07.181 --> 02:26:08.170
which you can't really make him more,

2489
02:26:08.171 --> 02:26:12.260
but you look at 55 and then the super flights just not great man.
Well,

2490
02:26:12.261 --> 02:26:16.120
they're talking about doing him and Eddie Alvarez that has no picnic.
No,
I know,

2491
02:26:16.290 --> 02:26:20.930
and that's as easy as matchup at 55 and funds easiest.

2492
02:26:21.790 --> 02:26:25.300
No,
just go through the top five.
Bring up the top five.
Jimmy.

2493
02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:27.230
I went through this slow down.
I'm like,
Jesus Christ.

2494
02:26:27.490 --> 02:26:32.490
I could not imagine that the champion would be as easiest style stylistically.

2495
02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:39.250
I don't think that's an easy fight for anybody,
Monster.
Exactly.

2496
02:26:39.251 --> 02:26:42.490
That's what I'm saying.
It's not good for comics.
A rough fight for it,

2497
02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:46.720
but you think that list the least out of the top five.
I'm like,
fuck sakes,
man.

2498
02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:48.680
He doesn't want to fight Khabib.
Well,

2499
02:26:48.690 --> 02:26:52.460
dos Anjos is going to fight Tony motherfucking Ferguson.
That's the both.

2500
02:26:52.461 --> 02:26:56.250
Those both those two are top,
top those angels.
Tony Ferguson in Mexico.

2501
02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:01.060
[inaudible]
right guys,
look at the,
look at the top five fam.

2502
02:27:01.250 --> 02:27:03.220
Hey,
get that.
Yeah.

2503
02:27:03.250 --> 02:27:07.850
Have even heard of Macra met off is a monster.
That's a seed.

2504
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:12.640
Dosign geos and Tony Ferguson or locked in a in a death fucking match for the

2505
02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:15.640
number one winter.
Even the winter that are either of those guys.

2506
02:27:15.641 --> 02:27:20.110
Even the loser fights conduct a fucking tough flight and Barboza.
Well,

2507
02:27:20.111 --> 02:27:25.111
here's the thing about Barboza Barboza his kicks are out of this fucking war

2508
02:27:25.641 --> 02:27:29.670
lightly.
Like he might be,
but he's been caught before.
He's been cracked,

2509
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:34.930
cracked them and took his back and Donald Cerrone and him would be k.

2510
02:27:35.650 --> 02:27:38.900
Dot.
Donald would taken a loss is not fighting 55 anymore.

2511
02:27:39.130 --> 02:27:41.890
He's going to keep fighting at one 70 so I don't even know why they got him

2512
02:27:41.891 --> 02:27:46.000
ranked there cause I think he's top 10 right now at Walter was seven.
Yeah,

2513
02:27:46.001 --> 02:27:50.950
isn't he?
Yeah.
Donald Cerrone seven it's interesting.
He's top 10 in both.

2514
02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:53.920
He's fine.
Better than he's ever fought.
I mean,
he's just incredible.

2515
02:27:53.921 --> 02:27:58.060
How dare you haven't before Neil Mag?
No,
no,
no,
no.
How dare you?
I th I think,

2516
02:27:58.090 --> 02:28:00.600
I think you,
I think Donald's,

2517
02:28:00.601 --> 02:28:03.310
especially after that last wind should be number five in that line.

2518
02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:06.070
He beat Edson Barboza.
Yes he did.

2519
02:28:06.071 --> 02:28:09.490
But he beat him at a lightweight and now he's not really fighting at lightweight

2520
02:28:09.491 --> 02:28:10.151
anymore.
But yeah,

2521
02:28:10.151 --> 02:28:12.730
you've got a good point because Barboza was listed as number four,

2522
02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:15.100
but Barboza is looks sensational,

2523
02:28:15.101 --> 02:28:17.320
especially in his last fight against Gilbert Melendez.

2524
02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:22.100
Barboza is just off the charts technical head to head.
I know,

2525
02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:25.340
I agree.
And then before that,
his fight with Pettis,

2526
02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:29.530
but the fact that Donald is semi retired from that division.
Yeah.

2527
02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:32.730
You got to give Barboza a little bit of a bond.
You see,
you see my thing?
Joy?

2528
02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:35.630
Like you look at it all right.
It could be fuck sakes.

2529
02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:39.860
Dos Anjos Good God Tony Person,
not great.
Nate Diaz at 55.

2530
02:28:39.861 --> 02:28:44.250
He's better at 55 thing with 70.
Why?
Uh,
I think it's natural for him.

2531
02:28:44.350 --> 02:28:47.420
I think he's gonna be faster or better cardio.
I think it's a thought.

2532
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:52.280
It's a tough fight.
Maybe all I'm saying for Connor 55,
it's a,

2533
02:28:52.570 --> 02:28:55.400
if you're as management,
you're like,
God damn man.
There's no like,

2534
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:58.760
you know what I'm saying?
There's a lot of killers looking for easy fights.

2535
02:28:58.761 --> 02:29:00.800
I think he wants big.
Didn't say that.
Didn't say that.

2536
02:29:00.801 --> 02:29:02.390
If you want big money fight Floyd Mayweather.

2537
02:29:02.391 --> 02:29:05.380
You do a super fight with these guys.
Yeah,

2538
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:08.870
Mcgregor would be awesome.
That'd be awesome.

2539
02:29:08.871 --> 02:29:13.871
As to Manav ranked 15th at one seven days won the welterweight division is

2540
02:29:15.350 --> 02:29:19.400
insane.
It is insane.
That's insane.
It is insane.

2541
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:24.290
And then did you see how good Lorens Larkin locked against Neil Magni could
lord.

2542
02:29:24.291 --> 02:29:27.820
And how is he wrote the whore?
How's he ranked lower than new magnate?

2543
02:29:27.850 --> 02:29:31.550
Y Z nine in Neil's eight cause this reading suck.

2544
02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:36.170
That's terrible.
He just ran through Neil magic fingers do these.

2545
02:29:36.390 --> 02:29:40.370
But he literally ran through them in the first round like fucking warm like a

2546
02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:43.760
knife to warm butter.
Just starch.
How it is man ranked below him.

2547
02:29:43.761 --> 02:29:48.110
That is insane right there Kelvin.
Number five by the way,

2548
02:29:48.111 --> 02:29:51.860
to Nauv beat Neil magnet or excuse me,
Lorens Larkin.

2549
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:56.000
So Tumen off one a decision against Lorens Larkin and he's down there at number

2550
02:29:56.001 --> 02:30:01.001
15 where's Lorens just destroyed Neil Magni and he's at nine and magnesium eight

2551
02:30:01.051 --> 02:30:04.970
that these rankings are retarded.
They're so bad.
They're probably old.

2552
02:30:05.090 --> 02:30:08.180
I doubt they're old now.
They're not all cause they have the up and down side.

2553
02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:10.710
Well this is what it is.
These journalists,

2554
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:13.520
do you know how these things are established?
Journalists,

2555
02:30:14.450 --> 02:30:18.650
a bunch of journalists give their top pick and half of them are drunk and not

2556
02:30:18.651 --> 02:30:20.420
paying attention.
They're doing drugs.

2557
02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:23.620
Well half of them are jacking off to their favorite fighter.
Well,

2558
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:24.560
it doesn't make any sense.

2559
02:30:24.561 --> 02:30:28.610
Like those ratings don't make any sense to me off being at 15 Lorens Larkin who

2560
02:30:28.611 --> 02:30:30.860
he beat being ranked way above him.

2561
02:30:30.861 --> 02:30:34.610
And then Neil Magdi been above him when he just ballooned magni out of the water

2562
02:30:34.611 --> 02:30:35.361
and the first round.

2563
02:30:35.361 --> 02:30:38.720
Does it make any sense when they're getting base guys pay off the rankings and

2564
02:30:38.850 --> 02:30:42.290
fighters?
Like what the fuck is going on here?
Dana was like,

2565
02:30:42.291 --> 02:30:45.830
just fucking with you.
There's going to be Reebok.
Yeah.
Just fucking with you.

2566
02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:50.510
We ain't doing that.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
It's uh,
the,

2567
02:30:50.511 --> 02:30:54.860
the rankings and the money and all that jazz.
It's just what a,
what a mess.

2568
02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:58.100
But yeah,
for,
for,
for economy gets tough at 55.

2569
02:30:58.101 --> 02:31:02.030
I'd love to see him fight you though that.
I agree that the fight he could win,

2570
02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:02.960
that's probably the Beta.

2571
02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:06.680
That's probably the fight and then what happens if he gets the belt then he

2572
02:31:06.681 --> 02:31:11.090
would probably defend against Khabib are good luck with all that.
Yeah,

2573
02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:13.460
that's a disaster.
I don't think anyone wants to fight.

2574
02:31:13.470 --> 02:31:17.330
Could be no one is timing the congress.
She was the entire fucking their way.

2575
02:31:17.350 --> 02:31:20.490
They're just hoping that he keeps training like a fucking werewolf and then

2576
02:31:20.491 --> 02:31:23.020
tears another knee or blows his back out.
That's it.

2577
02:31:23.021 --> 02:31:26.910
Everybody has a stay back while that guy whips himself frenzy and every he's

2578
02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:30.330
training his coke.
That bitch is just on the Arrow.
That's his whole camp.

2579
02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:31.820
He's just erudite.

2580
02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:35.190
Where's that crazy Russian hat and jumps in the fucking octagon.

2581
02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:37.800
He just jumps with a sauna into the frozen lake.

2582
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:39.230
I don't people to talk and Blake,

2583
02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:42.440
I just have a bubble around aerodyne crazy fashion hat.

2584
02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:45.180
This is use to do spray build up that cardio.

2585
02:31:45.210 --> 02:31:49.200
He's a fucking nightmare when you watch him fight dos Anjos and like you see how

2586
02:31:49.201 --> 02:31:53.430
dos Anjos just overwhelms guys with grappling and pressure and then have eve

2587
02:31:53.431 --> 02:31:58.431
just racked off rag doll to grapple check the show.

2588
02:31:58.540 --> 02:32:02.760
This is my favorite things to do to break people.
Cheer was grappling.

2589
02:32:02.761 --> 02:32:06.770
Grizzly bears.
You fuck check this.
Does he have a fight coming up?
Uh,

2590
02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:10.840
is he scheduled to fight?
Uh,
anybody who doesn't have anything?
No,

2591
02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:14.730
he doesn't have any.
We'll probably injuries.
I'm an asshole out or something.

2592
02:32:14.731 --> 02:32:17.880
He's always,
he's,
I think he's healthy.
He gets her.
Well I hope he is.

2593
02:32:17.881 --> 02:32:21.260
He won a fight recently against the guy who took the fight on real,

2594
02:32:21.330 --> 02:32:24.480
real short notice and it was straight your hand.
Miller bully beat downs.

2595
02:32:24.481 --> 02:32:28.710
Now it was pretty ferocious beat down,
but he,
you know,
he looked,
uh,
you know,

2596
02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:31.780
he looked like it was good for him to get that fight under his belt,

2597
02:32:31.781 --> 02:32:34.920
but he did look like a killer.
It's a killer.
I mean his,
his grappling.

2598
02:32:34.921 --> 02:32:39.630
So next level,
he's very strong.
Healing him then trains hard do,
did you,

2599
02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:43.310
did you see his video of him in Russia doing like a signing for Reebok?
No,

2600
02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:47.190
it was like Tom Cruise Shit.
I'm sure they freaked the fuck out dude.

2601
02:32:47.191 --> 02:32:48.810
Anytime I post anything about the UFC,

2602
02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:53.100
my Instagram like comments get swarmed with Khabib.

2603
02:32:53.101 --> 02:32:57.330
Khabib Time Khabib,
Tyler.
Oh my God.
And other parts of the world like here he is.

2604
02:32:57.570 --> 02:33:02.010
He see like this fucking the high level smash and grappling this guy has.

2605
02:33:02.050 --> 02:33:03.360
You're right Joe.
This was good.

2606
02:33:03.900 --> 02:33:06.390
This was good for him cause he had a lot of time off with the injuries.

2607
02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:10.110
Darrel Horcher and to get that fight on the under his belt feel good too.

2608
02:33:10.111 --> 02:33:11.280
He does whatever he wants.

2609
02:33:11.610 --> 02:33:16.110
He's so powerful when it comes to his grappling play this fight,

2610
02:33:16.111 --> 02:33:21.000
play him versus dos Anjos full fight.
He's just,
he's,

2611
02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:25.980
he's a Goddamn Werewolf man.
Even the weight like leaps in and throws punches.

2612
02:33:25.981 --> 02:33:30.750
He's so ferocious.
It's hard to stay healthy when you train like that though.

2613
02:33:30.751 --> 02:33:34.340
I don't,
I don't know what a guy,
some guys are fucking figuring out.
Hey yeah,

2614
02:33:34.341 --> 02:33:37.410
answer me this.
How come they can show this on youtube?

2615
02:33:37.470 --> 02:33:41.760
Is it because it's in like a little window?
The tricks they play so there's

2616
02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:45.360
this faded line over here.

2617
02:33:45.361 --> 02:33:49.780
This is also going to add to like tricking the computer inside the truck on it.

2618
02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:53.670
They add an interest.
Definitely illegal.
Yeah,
it's definitely illegal.
Yeah,

2619
02:33:53.671 --> 02:33:57.930
scoot up ahead so we don't have to watch them walk in.
Yeah,
it's interesting man.

2620
02:33:57.990 --> 02:34:02.520
This guy has been more plagued with injuries than any elite fighter other than

2621
02:34:02.521 --> 02:34:06.870
Dominick Cruz like Dominick Cruz and him probably take the cake with Dominick.

2622
02:34:06.871 --> 02:34:09.960
Cruz had how many fights before he started getting all these injuries.

2623
02:34:09.961 --> 02:34:13.470
Like he hasn't had that many fights in the UFC and he's undefeated,

2624
02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:16.860
which is really crazy.
No one at this level's undefeated.
Never.

2625
02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.720
Madoff is the only guy that's undefeated just because in the,

2626
02:34:19.721 --> 02:34:22.480
funny enough though,
but it's the fucking pressure.

2627
02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:26.320
Look at this guy only moves forward.
Just massive pressure.

2628
02:34:26.470 --> 02:34:31.470
Constant pressure just but good distance control just outside the range but

2629
02:34:31.601 --> 02:34:33.040
always putting that pressure on you.

2630
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:36.520
Skinny dose and it's a good kick to the body.
But yeah,
a lot skinnier.

2631
02:34:36.521 --> 02:34:40.510
Dos Anjos this is the fight that probably got them to start lifting weights and

2632
02:34:40.511 --> 02:34:45.340
drink watermelon juice
Boone's look at this,

2633
02:34:45.341 --> 02:34:49.000
look at this,
this like,
it carries him around and he drags him to the ground.

2634
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:54.010
Dude,
his grappling,
his so next level,
combat sambo,

2635
02:34:54.011 --> 02:34:57.760
my friend,
master of sport,
world champion.

2636
02:34:58.450 --> 02:35:02.590
Just so fucking brutal and this style that he does,
it's like,

2637
02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:07.800
it makes sense that this guy gets injured a lot because his style is pedal to

2638
02:35:08.081 --> 02:35:11.020
the metal and you,
you gotta train like this.

2639
02:35:11.021 --> 02:35:12.610
There's no way he doesn't train like this.

2640
02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:14.350
So if you're training like this all the time,

2641
02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:15.740
you're dealing with little injuries,

2642
02:35:15.741 --> 02:35:20.140
a little micro injuries to get exacerbated and then your fucking knees below
out.

2643
02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:24.070
Let's get the fuck out of here boys.
Let's wrap this bitch up.

2644
02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:28.600
Let's bring it home.
Bring it home.
Go three rounds,
three rounds.

2645
02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:30.491
I always quiet.

2646
02:35:30.491 --> 02:35:33.070
I always feel like I'm particularly quiet because I'm watching the fights.

2647
02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:37.200
Did he stop him and the third one?
No,
no.
He just overwhelmed.
Decision.
Yeah.

2648
02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:41.770
Overwhelmed them.
Just kept us,
kept us on.
Joe's defending.

2649
02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:46.140
It's all he was doing was defending towards the end of the fight.
Appy Hobby.

2650
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:49.990
I've worn this hat several times.
Twice sweaty had it,
puts it on me when we,

2651
02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:53.890
when I interview him after he wins,
I forget what that thing is called.

2652
02:35:53.900 --> 02:35:55.210
The big crazy hats.

2653
02:35:55.410 --> 02:36:00.160
Bush guy think is it really Babushka but are you sure?
Look it up.

2654
02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:02.200
What is that thing called?
Find out what that things called.

2655
02:36:02.690 --> 02:36:05.530
That might be just a wig,
but I think it's a Babushka.
No,
no,
no.
It's a,

2656
02:36:05.531 --> 02:36:07.480
it's a warm hat man.
It's like,

2657
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:11.740
like probably like lambs for sheep for something like that.
There it is.

2658
02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.520
What is it called?
No,
that's not it.
Well by boosts cause a grandmother.

2659
02:36:15.521 --> 02:36:19.890
But this goes,
I think the hat head scarf tied under the chin.
Okay.
Images.

2660
02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:22.420
Well what is that?
What?
Just what?

2661
02:36:22.421 --> 02:36:27.310
Google neuroma Grumet offs hat and just for by Bush because open have the name

2662
02:36:27.311 --> 02:36:29.140
of it.
I don't think it's a Babushka Bro.

2663
02:36:29.410 --> 02:36:31.300
I think it kind of looks like a Babushka,

2664
02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:36.280
but I think it's a c is that a Babushka?
Okay,

2665
02:36:36.281 --> 02:36:38.590
well we'll just Google neuroma.
Go Madoff's hat.

2666
02:36:39.610 --> 02:36:42.370
Because he comes from a very particular place.

2667
02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:47.140
Dagestan and they have their own kind of hat.
Is it Dagestan?

2668
02:36:47.170 --> 02:36:50.980
I could see right there.
I've even heard of met off hat.
I be Pat.

2669
02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:54.550
Maybe it's just called the Hubby Bat.
Find out what it is.
There it goes.

2670
02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:59.590
The Pakistani distinctive hat,
the heritage behind his distinctive hat pup.

2671
02:36:59.630 --> 02:37:04.030
Pekka p a.
P.
A.
K.
H.
A man means hat.

2672
02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:07.480
They call it half the right that are in fact people.

2673
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:12.510
It says a very shaggy wild popped back up and pop Paka simply means hat on board

2674
02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:16.070
and lamb for Jesus.
So when is he,
what is it?

2675
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:21.110
<v 1>Onboard lamp.
Unborn lamb.
What?
He made the hat.
Where are the for of unborn lamp.</v>

2676
02:37:21.111 --> 02:37:25.010
How's that?
Does that right?
All right.
Yeah,
so it's super soft.

2677
02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.100
They give birth to them like that.
No,
they take it out.
Doesn't make any sense.

2678
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:32.930
They can take it out of the womb and they take that for that's already there

2679
02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:35.570
cause it's extra soft.
But does that,
does that make sense?

2680
02:37:35.571 --> 02:37:38.810
That they could get that much further along inside the wound?

2681
02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:40.160
They do that stuff too.

2682
02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:45.340
Like so one car company on camera was was using cow fetus because the leather

2683
02:37:45.861 --> 02:37:48.350
was super sa shut the fuck.
All right.
God,

2684
02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:53.580
what company affinity and no way animals,

2685
02:37:53.751 --> 02:37:57.530
they'd have to kill bees.
They were using,
they were using cow fetus,
cow fetuses.

2686
02:37:57.531 --> 02:37:59.720
Like it's in the womb and it's so,

2687
02:37:59.721 --> 02:38:02.210
so that's pretty fucking brutal if you think about it.

2688
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:05.460
And affinity was doing that.
I believe it or not,

2689
02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:09.970
it was some kind of,
some concrete ensued.
I will.

2690
02:38:10.090 --> 02:38:12.440
You're going to get to yeah,

2691
02:38:12.441 --> 02:38:15.710
they're going to see me because they waited for the academy born then they used

2692
02:38:15.711 --> 02:38:20.150
it.
Wow.
How weird.
Huh?
Pretty well.
You know that's what Lam is.

2693
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:22.460
I was trying to explain something to like what's the difference in sheep and

2694
02:38:22.461 --> 02:38:25.520
lamb?
Lamb,
baby sheep baby sheet.
Someone looked at me like,
what?

2695
02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:32.980
Ah Huh.
Yeah.
You didn't know that condoms are made from baby shit.

2696
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:37.880
Damn,
that's,
this is a depiction of lamb and a sheep.
Like if you,

2697
02:38:37.881 --> 02:38:41.390
if you eat lamb,
you're eating a baby sheet,
but if you eat mutton,

2698
02:38:41.450 --> 02:38:44.350
you're eating a sheet.
That's right.
So like the people and like Scotland,

2699
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:47.600
eight and Scotland,
they're,
they're eating that stuff.
That's a different,

2700
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:51.840
let's a much more,
don't kill the lambs.
Amy.
Don't fuck with Liz.
I slept on it.

2701
02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:56.810
The good for you.
Those fuck at us.
It's really like a very healthy protein.

2702
02:38:56.811 --> 02:38:57.950
Very easy to adjust to.

2703
02:38:57.980 --> 02:39:02.980
A lot of people don't fuck with Glam or pay grade and he paid on the bacon thing

2704
02:39:04.850 --> 02:39:08.630
and hit Rom.
I hate putting say,
yeah,
I like Bacon,

2705
02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:13.040
but I don't like domesticated pigs.
It the whole pig industry.

2706
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:16.640
It bothers me because pigs are smart and they're all penned up like that.

2707
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:20.510
It was like there's only one way to get bacon.
Outside of that.

2708
02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:23.300
You've got to find a dude who's a farmer who's ethical.

2709
02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:27.170
You got to find like a guy who was a farmer who's given,
they're like,

2710
02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:31.880
this is orange and stuff with,
yeah,
Joel Salitan.
What he does is he has a,

2711
02:39:31.881 --> 02:39:35.630
he moves his pay as a giant piece of land and he moves his pigs around with

2712
02:39:35.631 --> 02:39:39.350
electric fences.
So he sets up an electric perimeter and then he moves.

2713
02:39:39.351 --> 02:39:42.200
It sets up a new electric perimeter and he moves it and says it.

2714
02:39:42.201 --> 02:39:46.820
So they're constantly forging like regular pay,
but they're constantly contained.

2715
02:39:47.290 --> 02:39:48.470
They're domesticated,

2716
02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:53.540
but they have dark meat like a wild pig does cause they're hitting every like

2717
02:39:53.541 --> 02:39:57.230
their shit.
Everything that she does,
everything they can get their hands on.

2718
02:39:57.260 --> 02:40:01.610
It's a hard scrabble life.
They do the wild pig ham,

2719
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:05.660
the Blackfoot hog.
They eat acorns.
That's why that funding issue does.

2720
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:09.490
I got something up the refrigerator back there.
Yeah.
My buddy brought him back.

2721
02:40:09.770 --> 02:40:14.070
Chris Ryan,
Dr Chris Ryan brought it back from Spain.
Cuts him,

2722
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.820
cut me off some snow.
It's a,
it's like Prosciutto,
the best preacher in the world.

2723
02:40:17.930 --> 02:40:21.630
Yeah.
We could have a fight companion with pig pursuit has it'd be smacking into,

2724
02:40:22.100 --> 02:40:24.360
I'm going to have to get some again,
just animated gifs.

2725
02:40:24.361 --> 02:40:28.650
If you poppin peanuts in your mouth and shout and chewing,
chewing bars.

2726
02:40:29.740 --> 02:40:31.680
All of us,
all of us are guilty.

2727
02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:34.380
We didn't drink any wine is what we did and that's why it was a good,

2728
02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:39.240
good pull it.
No,
my wife,
I'm afraid.

2729
02:40:39.241 --> 02:40:43.060
I'm the wide master and I must reserve the white for after the five combatants.

2730
02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:45.920
So sometimes we just get a little hammered.
We'll hammer.

2731
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:49.170
Well I can get you going man.
I'm a little ridiculous.

2732
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:53.160
This is a non drunk podcast.
Yeah.
Was a noon podcast.
We're responsible.

2733
02:40:53.161 --> 02:40:56.930
We're all parents.
Good cause for dads is our new Sitcom.

2734
02:40:56.931 --> 02:41:01.770
It's called for dads escape fo dads.
We don't want to buy.
It's,

2735
02:41:01.771 --> 02:41:03.980
we don't know what's going on.

2736
02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:09.140
The only place where we can be ourself because we live with women,

2737
02:41:09.511 --> 02:41:14.340
with women and by ourselves with me and we talk about fighting had nausea,

2738
02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:14.981
you know,
you do.

2739
02:41:14.981 --> 02:41:18.030
You get all those four bitches to move into a house together and take care of

2740
02:41:18.031 --> 02:41:22.120
the kids and we'll move into the house right next door and just have FICA Pena's

2741
02:41:22.140 --> 02:41:26.650
every day can come along and go,
this place smells like man,
Eh.

2742
02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:31.050
They come over and pick up your sockets.
This yard,
it's Brandon and Brian.

2743
02:41:31.051 --> 02:41:35.100
You left pizza on the fucking counter.
Sorry.
We're like,
sorry.

2744
02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:38.520
This is way she lived over in the world,
Bro.
You gotta live by their rules.

2745
02:41:38.521 --> 02:41:42.930
You got to fucking,
you got to not use those special towels.
Yeah.
Geez.

2746
02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:46.140
The towel that's hanging is a towel.
It's a fucking towel.

2747
02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:49.710
Of course it yesterday of towel.
This is a different kind of task guys.

2748
02:41:49.711 --> 02:41:51.850
We sleep in the same bed but it's guys,
but

2749
02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:59.790
I got a morning hard on you guys should this and that.
Scared Brennan grab it.

2750
02:41:59.791 --> 02:42:04.710
Let's see how big your hand is.
I might dig
down man.

2751
02:42:04.850 --> 02:42:07.840
My prostate's big cause I'm older so I'm dribbling.
You guys edit,

2752
02:42:07.841 --> 02:42:10.410
you'll see you shoot.
One of the things I think about Brian,

2753
02:42:10.411 --> 02:42:11.850
whenever we go on these hunting trips,

2754
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:14.820
it's like it's all dudes were all like in Rainelle and his crew,

2755
02:42:14.821 --> 02:42:18.720
who are this the fucking salt of the earth or hanging around just laughing.

2756
02:42:18.721 --> 02:42:21.000
I'm like,
this is what we're supposed to do.

2757
02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:23.820
It's true when men are supposed to do is get in these groups and they go out and

2758
02:42:23.821 --> 02:42:26.460
they list,
leave the women alone.
The women talk shit about you while you're gone.

2759
02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:30.060
And then the enough time passes where they miss you and you come back and they

2760
02:42:30.061 --> 02:42:32.910
meet you at the door and your hug.
This is traditional.
That's right.

2761
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:35.220
This is when you're all on top of each other all the time.

2762
02:42:35.221 --> 02:42:36.560
It just wears on each other.
Right.

2763
02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:40.200
And we have so much fun trips are all one big comedy show.

2764
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:41.840
Well it's all men being men.
Yeah.

2765
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.390
It's saying things that will get you in real trouble.
People heard.

2766
02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:48.060
Don't you feel like you're doing that in general though when you're doing your

2767
02:42:48.061 --> 02:42:50.880
comedy and hang out with your friends and companions and shit,

2768
02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:53.010
but when you're in the middle of Alaska,

2769
02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:57.740
like we're literally miles from anything including other animals by the way.
Uh,

2770
02:42:57.780 --> 02:42:58.770
you just ended up,

2771
02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:00.810
there's something that happens to you where you just want to say the most

2772
02:43:00.811 --> 02:43:03.780
outrageous shit cause he's like,
how can I one up Joe,

2773
02:43:03.781 --> 02:43:07.200
now I'm going to say something outrageous that's gonna even shock me.
No,

2774
02:43:07.210 --> 02:43:09.600
I guess we could do that dinner though.
Right?

2775
02:43:09.601 --> 02:43:12.970
But there's a difference when you're in the woods and you're doing this.

2776
02:43:12.971 --> 02:43:17.971
And me and Brian are like specifically geared for like fucking with each other

2777
02:43:18.011 --> 02:43:21.370
and those kinds of situations.
And I also know that what he's saying,

2778
02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:22.420
he doesn't mean,

2779
02:43:22.570 --> 02:43:25.990
and he's joking and I'm expecting him to take it to another place that's even

2780
02:43:25.991 --> 02:43:28.450
more fucked up and it just keeps going.
And it,

2781
02:43:28.451 --> 02:43:29.770
when we were in Montana the first time,

2782
02:43:29.771 --> 02:43:34.771
it was literally five days of gay jokes and a few with a few wife beating jokes

2783
02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:40.950
thrown in there and just took a shit choke fuck jokes.
And I took a shit,

2784
02:43:41.330 --> 02:43:46.060
took a shit and Joe took a fucking,
he put a flag in it.
I made an aluminum foil

2785
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:51.930
in my shit.
Terrible shit to a terrible mountain.

2786
02:43:53.310 --> 02:43:57.360
Do you?
Don't bury your shelf.
Buried them in the middle of Lou did.

2787
02:43:57.430 --> 02:44:00.930
That place sucks.
I'm sorry about the shit that I had boot.

2788
02:44:01.010 --> 02:44:01.661
Nobody's going to be like,

2789
02:44:01.661 --> 02:44:04.620
God damn it in the Missouri breaks worth nothing dries out there.

2790
02:44:04.621 --> 02:44:09.030
You take a shit,
you ruin the landscape.
Fuck,
we'll use a mustard poop.

2791
02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:13.540
You were supposed to take it and put it in bags and most of the time we did
that.

2792
02:44:14.470 --> 02:44:18.490
Occasionally you're supposed to like protect the environment.

2793
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:19.390
You don't want a bunch of shit.

2794
02:44:19.391 --> 02:44:22.250
Especially your shit after you've been eating that dehydrated meals and food and

2795
02:44:22.290 --> 02:44:25.900
the it comes in a pouch.
Aw.
Can't just bury it,
but you can burry it.

2796
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:29.560
That's probably the best.
Or you can put a flag in it.

2797
02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:32.140
You buried the message that says Brian was here.

2798
02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:35.050
Well he shit all log and then I put a aluminum foil.

2799
02:44:35.051 --> 02:44:39.160
I'm seeing if I have it in here.
Aluminum foil flag in the log.
Yeah,

2800
02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:43.740
it was good times.
Yeah.
And by the way,
we are,
we were in our late forties ago.

2801
02:44:44.250 --> 02:44:48.760
Taxpaying adults,
anecdotal often with opinions.

2802
02:44:48.850 --> 02:44:51.340
You guys could do that like once a year.
I do it.
I do it.

2803
02:44:51.341 --> 02:44:53.590
I could do it once a month.
Once a month.
I mean if I'm with him,

2804
02:44:53.591 --> 02:44:57.040
which just say that the fun of being haunted and once a month,

2805
02:44:57.160 --> 02:44:59.590
one being an idiot,
being out there and being miserable,

2806
02:44:59.591 --> 02:45:01.210
but kind of having fun at the same time.

2807
02:45:01.211 --> 02:45:05.310
There's something about it that makes it brings out in many ways the best of
you.

2808
02:45:05.650 --> 02:45:08.350
You have a good time even though you're miserable,
it's bonding.
Like you,

2809
02:45:08.351 --> 02:45:09.820
you're miserable and you're cold and you're wet,

2810
02:45:09.821 --> 02:45:14.290
but you're laughing your ass off.
Like when we finally made that fire and uh,

2811
02:45:14.430 --> 02:45:16.570
I mean,
well if you've ever enjoyed a fire that much,

2812
02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:20.320
we were rained on for like five days in a row and then we finally got a dry

2813
02:45:20.321 --> 02:45:24.640
night and we've got a bunch of the guys from campus find is many small pieces of

2814
02:45:24.641 --> 02:45:28.000
dry wood as we could.
We stacked it on top of each other and started lighting.

2815
02:45:28.001 --> 02:45:31.720
Fritos,
you are wet.
Joe.
Joe didn't bring the proper reindeer.

2816
02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:35.320
He was basically wet,
including the sleeping bag was wet the whole time.

2817
02:45:35.650 --> 02:45:38.350
And I remember we were in that 10 and I was looking at you and you were,

2818
02:45:38.410 --> 02:45:42.490
you were just talking,
but you were shaking shivering ships.

2819
02:45:42.910 --> 02:45:46.290
Your lips are going blue and they were just chilling back and

2820
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:53.050
he's got huge lips but,
and you just kept talking and it was just,
it was just,

2821
02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:56.110
guess what?
It's the morning.
Our body temperature is low.
We're wet,

2822
02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:59.520
we're cold as fuck,
and we're going to be cold until we start walking.
Yeah.
Well,

2823
02:45:59.521 --> 02:46:02.140
once you start walking,
even though you're wet,
you're wearing wool clothes.

2824
02:46:02.141 --> 02:46:06.760
That's the thing about those first light.
Merino wool.
Even when you're wet,

2825
02:46:06.850 --> 02:46:10.640
how many days?
We were there for six days.
Yeah.
It was awesome though,
man.

2826
02:46:10.641 --> 02:46:13.520
Even though it sucked,
I think about the memory and it was awesome.
Yeah,

2827
02:46:13.521 --> 02:46:17.870
and then also the landscape was awesome.
It's just,
it's so wild there,
man.

2828
02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:21.660
Do that shit every Saturday at Runyon or something.
She'd be surprised though,

2829
02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:24.650
because you do,
the memory brings you back.
That's Turkey Hunt and look at that.

2830
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:27.770
Look at how handsome I am.
I mean we are.
That was a,

2831
02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:29.270
that was in northern California.
That was like,

2832
02:46:29.390 --> 02:46:32.390
that was hilarious because we would go Turkey hunting during the day and then

2833
02:46:32.391 --> 02:46:37.040
grind and I would go to the finest restaurants at night because it was all these

2834
02:46:37.041 --> 02:46:38.630
amazing restaurants in Napa.

2835
02:46:39.050 --> 02:46:41.270
These fucking guys wanted to pretend they were camping.

2836
02:46:41.390 --> 02:46:45.380
So they went back to this airbnb house and made like fucking burgers from like,

2837
02:46:45.530 --> 02:46:50.020
I go,
come on guys.
I saw it in me.
Let's go eat.
Let's get wine.
Yes.

2838
02:46:50.050 --> 02:46:53.870
They didn't want to do it.
Cars up down for that.
Yes,

2839
02:46:53.871 --> 02:46:56.540
we drink the best wine eight the world.

2840
02:46:56.541 --> 02:47:01.520
Brian and I went to this fucking insane restaurant and I had this,

2841
02:47:01.700 --> 02:47:05.420
this short rib Rizzo know that I still jerk off to this day.

2842
02:47:05.490 --> 02:47:09.820
That sounds fucking Rad.
Like shape,
like shaved squash,
like oh God.

2843
02:47:09.850 --> 02:47:12.640
Cam like a pumpkin.
He takes two jumpers.

2844
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:15.560
Sodo and like this rich like burgundy salt,

2845
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:20.570
like a red wine sauce for the short ribs.
Oh,
I'm getting nostalgic right now.

2846
02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:24.470
Looking at these pictures
are mine hunting.

2847
02:47:24.530 --> 02:47:28.730
I just did one without you.
It wasn't as fun.
I,
well,
you know,
nearly as firing me.

2848
02:47:28.970 --> 02:47:31.400
Well I couldn't.
You know how to shoot a bow and arrow.
You fuck fuck.

2849
02:47:31.401 --> 02:47:34.630
That's right you.
But you could be there for moral support and it's kind of cold.

2850
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:36.710
Josie,
I could have practiced and I could've,

2851
02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:39.710
I have held your hips while your shot.
You could do that.

2852
02:47:40.980 --> 02:47:43.880
I could have gotten your ear while you were drawing and I could've gone control

2853
02:47:43.881 --> 02:47:46.460
your breathing,
control your breathing,
control your,

2854
02:47:46.461 --> 02:47:49.280
but this is going to feel like what it is and it is what it is.
You know,

2855
02:47:49.281 --> 02:47:51.950
the more spectacular thing about it or the,

2856
02:47:51.951 --> 02:47:54.830
the weirdest thing of as being introduced to the world of public land.

2857
02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:58.250
That's one of the weirdest things about a hunting that I didn't anticipate.

2858
02:47:58.251 --> 02:47:59.084
What do you mean?

2859
02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:03.830
We own human beings that live in the United States and pay taxes.

2860
02:48:03.831 --> 02:48:08.831
We own enormous chunks of land that are public land that you can go hiking on

2861
02:48:10.281 --> 02:48:14.750
and rafting and you can go fishing and hunting if you have the proper tags and

2862
02:48:14.751 --> 02:48:17.810
licenses and it's not like this anywhere in the world.

2863
02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:19.760
Like we have this incredible resource.

2864
02:48:19.761 --> 02:48:24.380
We have all this public land that you can go and explore on and it's all

2865
02:48:24.381 --> 02:48:28.350
amazing.
There's so much amazing wilderness.
Where were you?

2866
02:48:28.750 --> 02:48:31.010
We were in Nevada in the high country desert.

2867
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:33.350
What is that like five hours outside of Reno,

2868
02:48:33.351 --> 02:48:35.670
you go to Reno and then he'd go five hours into the desert.

2869
02:48:35.671 --> 02:48:38.090
Hot as fuck drove five hours.

2870
02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:45.590
Mule deer.
And what's that topography like?
What's it's alien man?

2871
02:48:45.591 --> 02:48:46.371
It's amazing.

2872
02:48:46.371 --> 02:48:51.371
These hills that are covered in sage and then these patches of small Mahogany

2873
02:48:51.591 --> 02:48:53.120
and and like um,

2874
02:48:53.540 --> 02:48:57.460
like desert trees and it just springs.
He got to find,

2875
02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:00.590
you find springs and the animals generally go near the springs and the springs

2876
02:49:00.591 --> 02:49:04.040
are really easy to fine cause you look at him,
this like sort of grayish,

2877
02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:06.140
greenish,
dry landscape.

2878
02:49:06.141 --> 02:49:09.840
And then you see these lush patches and then you go to those lush green patches

2879
02:49:09.841 --> 02:49:12.540
and that's where their springs and that's where a lot of animals tend to

2880
02:49:12.541 --> 02:49:17.220
congregate.
It's fucking amazing.
You allowed to use a drone to hunt?

2881
02:49:17.430 --> 02:49:21.420
No.
In most states they're starting to stop that.
But in some states,

2882
02:49:21.421 --> 02:49:22.800
yet some states it's still illegal.

2883
02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:25.910
And most of them what they're doing is they're using them to spot me.
It's,

2884
02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:29.130
it's super controversial like what you're allowed to do and what you're not

2885
02:49:29.131 --> 02:49:32.880
allowed to do.
Like,
like in Nova.
Yeah.
And like in Nevada where we were,

2886
02:49:32.881 --> 02:49:34.650
you're allowed to use walkie talkies.

2887
02:49:34.770 --> 02:49:37.710
So you could tell me were a deer is and it's totally legal.

2888
02:49:37.770 --> 02:49:41.400
But if we're in Montana,
that would be illegal.
How the fuck they gonna tell?

2889
02:49:41.610 --> 02:49:45.030
Well they,
you don't just don't,
you know,
if you have goals,

2890
02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:47.880
you really should follow them because the rules that are in place,

2891
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:50.400
if it's so fucking hard,

2892
02:49:50.430 --> 02:49:53.430
if you are bone Arrow hunting to close in on a mule deer,

2893
02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:57.500
it's so hard that they're like,
yeah,
go ahead.
Use a walkie talkie.
Yeah,
bitchy.

2894
02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:00.600
Go ahead.
But Montana's like,
yeah,

2895
02:50:00.601 --> 02:50:02.730
but what if a guy has a rifle?

2896
02:50:02.731 --> 02:50:04.600
We have to kind of have universal rules across the bat.

2897
02:50:04.601 --> 02:50:08.700
And if you have a rifle in Montana,
you're dealing with much more wooded area.

2898
02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:11.820
You could kind of pinpoint where the animal is.
Maybe a little bit better.

2899
02:50:11.821 --> 02:50:15.030
Maybe it's a little too much.
And Montana is like a real traditional state.

2900
02:50:15.031 --> 02:50:17.370
Like they don't even allow lighted Arrow knocks.

2901
02:50:17.730 --> 02:50:20.730
You can't have a light on your Arrow site on your both site.

2902
02:50:20.731 --> 02:50:25.170
You can have a light walkie talkie law because they don't want you to be able to

2903
02:50:25.171 --> 02:50:28.650
have a bunch of friends.
Like here's,
here's a perfect example.
Like one state,

2904
02:50:28.651 --> 02:50:32.460
like Arizona is famous for allowing the use of,
um,

2905
02:50:32.490 --> 02:50:36.600
of walkie talkies and allowing the use of a electronics.
So,

2906
02:50:36.660 --> 02:50:39.240
and there's certain tags that are really hard to draw.

2907
02:50:39.390 --> 02:50:42.630
Like there's a unit called 13 B and it's called the strip.

2908
02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:46.950
It's a strip between Utah and Arizona and it's so coveted in so cherished

2909
02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:50.520
because the animals are enormous and it's really well matched.

2910
02:50:50.521 --> 02:50:55.410
Like pull up Arizona Strip mule,
deer buck.
These things look like elk.

2911
02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:57.960
Like some of them are like 270 inches.

2912
02:50:57.961 --> 02:51:00.660
Enormous fucking when they measure like each time.

2913
02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:04.170
And you know what else was huge?
Columbus,
Ohio,

2914
02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:08.250
Ohio has giant.
Okay,
why a lot of the Midwest us.

2915
02:51:08.251 --> 02:51:12.090
But my point is this one area,
because it's so difficult to get a tag there.

2916
02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:16.650
They'll a guy,
we'll see what it is.
It Paul.
Oh My god,
this is a deer.
By the way.

2917
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:19.190
This isn't an elk.
These are enormous,
dear.
Oh.

2918
02:51:19.570 --> 02:51:23.550
So once in a lifetime tag to be able to hunt.

2919
02:51:23.551 --> 02:51:28.551
One of these animals is literally once in a lifetime because they make sure that

2920
02:51:28.831 --> 02:51:32.610
very few people can hunt them so they can keep the populations very strong

2921
02:51:32.611 --> 02:51:37.380
credit,
credible,
because the genetics are so powerful.
So when a guy gets a tag,

2922
02:51:37.381 --> 02:51:39.930
like for a deer like this,
what they,
this is,

2923
02:51:39.931 --> 02:51:44.130
if you get three 13 B tag for Arizona,
you want to get a deer like this.

2924
02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:46.920
So these people literally will bring 20 of their friends.

2925
02:51:46.921 --> 02:51:48.390
This is a once in a lifetime thing.

2926
02:51:48.610 --> 02:51:51.960
So your buddies come and help out and they all get around on these different

2927
02:51:51.961 --> 02:51:54.540
points and they glass meaning they set up tripods,

2928
02:51:54.541 --> 02:51:56.490
they put on binoculars and spotting scopes,

2929
02:51:56.610 --> 02:52:00.540
and they locate the animal and then everyone's coordinating.
So like,
you know,

2930
02:52:00.541 --> 02:52:03.060
you got to go a hundred yards down,
go down there.

2931
02:52:03.061 --> 02:52:06.490
He's at the bottom of the canyon and then the other at the other entities,

2932
02:52:06.491 --> 02:52:08.620
like we've got an eye on him out here.
He's not coming this way.

2933
02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:12.010
We've got about it gets,
it's still,

2934
02:52:12.011 --> 02:52:15.760
it's still difficult because first of all,
it's impossible to get a tag,

2935
02:52:15.761 --> 02:52:16.630
but for these people,

2936
02:52:16.631 --> 02:52:20.350
it's like so important that they capitalized on this one opportunity that

2937
02:52:20.351 --> 02:52:22.970
they're ever going to have in their life to hunt in this area.
Look at that.

2938
02:52:23.270 --> 02:52:26.590
It's very controversial.
Wouldn't be hunting because some people say,
oh,

2939
02:52:26.591 --> 02:52:28.810
you should be able to have one guy who's communicating with you,

2940
02:52:28.811 --> 02:52:31.600
and some people say you shouldn't ever be able to communicate.

2941
02:52:31.690 --> 02:52:35.350
It's always going to be a debate,
but with these guys,
the way it's set up,

2942
02:52:35.380 --> 02:52:36.880
you can,
you could have a bunch of people,

2943
02:52:36.881 --> 02:52:39.250
so I can tell you that even if you have a lot of people,

2944
02:52:39.251 --> 02:52:42.640
I'm sure a lot of people leave that hunting ground empty hand.
Of course,

2945
02:52:42.641 --> 02:52:46.440
the rate of success is super low and that's an elk.
Look at that rack.
You know,

2946
02:52:46.490 --> 02:52:51.320
they're using drones to keep the rhino safe and African though those phones yet

2947
02:52:51.550 --> 02:52:53.890
to make sure the poachers end to find poachers.

2948
02:52:53.891 --> 02:52:57.460
Now the drones are beasts down there.
Well,
it's helping with that.

2949
02:52:57.580 --> 02:53:00.910
We're going to have to have some drone rules over the next few years because

2950
02:53:00.911 --> 02:53:03.160
they're going to get bigger and better and quicker and easier.

2951
02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:06.870
Smaller and more stealthy.
Yeah.
They're going to look like bugs.
Yup.
You got it.

2952
02:53:06.871 --> 02:53:09.940
Will you know you're gonna be able to spy on your ex girlfriend by floating one

2953
02:53:09.941 --> 02:53:13.420
right in her house when she opens her door and she's not even gonna know,

2954
02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:15.100
just kill everything.
It's not even gonna know.

2955
02:53:15.110 --> 02:53:18.460
They might have silent solar powered Tesla.
Tesla made drones.

2956
02:53:19.910 --> 02:53:24.250
All right kids.
That's it.
You leave it on that.
I guess my amount of Tesla,

2957
02:53:24.251 --> 02:53:27.970
I've got to get home,
but a level three of you and just come see me in New York.

2958
02:53:27.971 --> 02:53:30.200

2964
