00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Hello dirty freaks,</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.681
<v Speaker 1>Jess,</v>

3
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you are shut up.</v>

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Get over it.</v>

6
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just a label.</v>

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by ting.</v>

8
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.241
<v Speaker 1>What's Tang?</v>

9
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:23.241
<v Speaker 1>Joe Ting is a cell phone service that cuts out all the bullshit that you have to</v>

10
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>deal with with most cell phone services like contracts.</v>

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no contracts with Tang Tang sets it up smoothly and easily.</v>

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to fucking bail,</v>

13
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you just bail sun.</v>

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time when you get a phone from a,</v>

15
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>a major provider,</v>

17
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing when you buy a phone for like 200 bucks,</v>

18
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>the phone really probably costs like 500 bucks or more.</v>

19
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>But what you're doing is you're paying for the phone,</v>

20
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of like on layaway.</v>

21
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you go home,</v>

22
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>quit and your phone service sucks or can't make calls from my house.</v>

23
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>When you cancel your,</v>

24
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

25
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I made you sound so dumb.</v>

26
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Just figurative.</v>

27
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not really you.</v>

28
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.961
<v Speaker 1>That's only me.</v>

29
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>That's actually how I speak off there.</v>

30
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>He has a weird voice off the year on the air.</v>

32
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>He's so smooth,</v>

33
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>but off the year just judge duper going home down.</v>

34
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of fucking assholes tweeting at me.</v>

35
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.191
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

37
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.024
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

39
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>the anyway point is if you try to leave your contract,</v>

40
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.553
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay money.</v>

41
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not our Tang has it?</v>

42
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Tango has it set up where they rent time on the sprint backbone,</v>

43
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>which sounds really fucking weird,</v>

44
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but just the term renting time on a backbone.</v>

45
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.123
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>back points.</v>

48
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably come up with a new name for backbones.</v>

49
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Is it a sweaty backbone or is it an LTE vacuum and backbone?</v>

50
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

51
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a computer network sort of a thing.</v>

52
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

53
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.351
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

55
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>why call it background?</v>

56
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you run out of words you can make with your face?</v>

57
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not a backbone.</v>

58
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I know what a backbone is.</v>

59
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Network network doesn't sound as cool or grid.</v>

60
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.603
<v Speaker 1>It does sound though.</v>

61
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.513
<v Speaker 1>Grid.</v>

62
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>The sprint network is a,</v>

63
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>major provider.</v>

66
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:11.991
<v Speaker 1>So you get major cell phone service with a company like tank with no early</v>

67
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>termination fees,</v>

68
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense,</v>

69
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>no contracts.</v>

70
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And here's the best part.</v>

71
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>You pay for what you use.</v>

72
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.283
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

73
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you pay,</v>

74
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>if your cell phone costs x amount per month and you're allotted 120 minutes,</v>

75
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>if you use less of those minutes,</v>

76
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't get any money back.</v>

77
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean you pay every month.</v>

79
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>The same with with 10 you only pay for what you use.</v>

80
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.571
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

81
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's no overage fees,</v>

82
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.721
<v Speaker 1>there's no like,</v>

83
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:42.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't get charged like a penalty.</v>

85
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>He does pay for what you use.</v>

86
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>

87
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not confusing.</v>

88
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And they have the latest and greatest in android cell phones,</v>

89
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:59.481
<v Speaker 1>including the Samsung Galaxy s five which just came out this week and it's quite</v>

90
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>dope malicious.</v>

91
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.881
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

92
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:01.714
<v Speaker 1>it's waterproof.</v>

93
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It has a fucking fingerprint sensor and it has a heart rate monitor on it.</v>

94
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

95
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty bad as well.</v>

96
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

97
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I w I did a good read or read or good review about it and it said it's an</v>

98
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.351
<v Speaker 1>amazing phone.</v>

99
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:11.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

100
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>it's better than the last one and stuff.</v>

101
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.864
<v Speaker 1>The waterproof things,</v>

102
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>probably the best thing about it,</v>

103
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>but they're also through so many options on this phone that it's ridiculous.</v>

104
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Like the fingerprint sensor.</v>

105
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And stuff like that.</v>

106
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things on this phone.</v>

107
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is they're leaving apple so far behind that apple would have</v>

108
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>to be a big fat copycat in order to catch up when they start putting things like</v>

109
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>heart rate monitors on phones and making phones waterproof.</v>

110
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the only waterproof phone.</v>

111
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

112
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>there's another android phone,</v>

113
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>the Sony Xperia,</v>

114
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>which looks pretty fucking bad ass.</v>

115
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>That phone is also waterproof and that phone,</v>

116
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

117
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>has some red donkey Dulles Mega Pixel camera two.</v>

118
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't what the fuck?</v>

119
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>How's the,</v>

120
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>how's the price of the Sony?</v>

121
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Cause I've liked Sony stuff,</v>

122
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like it's always like one and a half times more expensive than,</v>

123
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked into it quite honestly.</v>

124
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.853
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

125
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.251

00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you where you don't have to go to a store.</v>

160
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.641
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

161
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>do you know you're going to use x amount of toilet paper per month?</v>

162
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Well if you to figure out a way to get that shit shipped to you,</v>

164
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>that's probably better than forcing yourself to go to the store all the time.</v>

165
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>And what dollar Shave Club does is gives you a four pack for six bucks and just</v>

<v Speaker 1>sends them to you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You could check out their Dr Carver's easy shave butter and a one wipe Charlies.</v>

169
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the best there.</v>

170
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>But wives for men,</v>

171
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:27.214
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

176
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>You don't panic about what your underwear look like.</v>

177
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're out with a chick and you decide to get freaky and you have white</v>

178
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>underwear on,</v>

179
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.991
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

180
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking crazy risk it is.</v>

181
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:45.290

183
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you took a shit and then you sweated,</v>

184
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who knows what kind of look.</v>

187
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Wiping your ass is a very inefficient way to go about your business.</v>

188
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.510
<v Speaker 1>It's toilet paper,</v>

189
00:05:58.511 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>smushing shit.</v>

196
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>but what's really important is saving money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>14 grams of protein per serving.</v>

289
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And only four grams of fat and it's healthy fat,</v>

290
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 1>organic buffalo meat bitch with cranberries.</v>

291
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>It's really yummy too.</v>

292
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.953
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

293
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.341
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

294
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

295
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>it's an ancient recipe.</v>

296
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:31.861
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

297
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>This is what they used to do with buffalo meat,</v>

298
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>way back in the dizzy when they hadn't figured out refrigerators yet.</v>

299
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.781
<v Speaker 1>We're also,</v>

300
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>caring,</v>

302
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

303
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.240
<v Speaker 1>align of hemp force protein force protein powders and hemp force,</v>

304
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 1>a protein bars and there bars that are made out of the finest hemp protein.</v>

305
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.491
<v Speaker 1>We A,</v>

306
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 1>we buy all of our hemp protein from Canada,</v>

307
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately for now.</v>

308
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 1>But as these laws change,</v>

309
00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk to David Simon about this.</v>

310
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we're going to probably be able to,</v>

311
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

312
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 1>get a farm going in America,</v>

313
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 1>which will drop the cost down on all of our hemp products substantially.</v>

314
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.730
<v Speaker 1>It's very expensive to get the highest quality hemp.</v>

315
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:10.941
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

316
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

317
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>there's several grades that you can get.</v>

318
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:16.560
<v Speaker 1>We get the very highest grade because we doing everything online.</v>

319
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

320
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a store that we send to that takes a cut out of everything.</v>

321
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:21.264
<v Speaker 1>So we can,</v>

322
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.330
<v Speaker 1>we can give you things in,</v>

323
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 1>in the qualities and in the purity that it's like very difficult to get anywhere</v>

324
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.084
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

325
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.860
<v Speaker 1>The combinations of ingredients,</v>

326
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 1>like things like Alpha brain and people have found when they tried to do it by</v>

327
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:35.831
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

328
00:10:35.831 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to get the same purity,</v>

329
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 1>like you realize like how much it actually cost to make these things.</v>

330
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of supplements that cut corners on the ingredients,</v>

331
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:46.440
<v Speaker 1>quality of ingredients.</v>

332
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And what we tried to do it on it is just get the very best shit available.</v>

333
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>By default,</v>

334
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 1>we don't have any economy models,</v>

335
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 1>we don't have anything.</v>

336
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean the only thing that you can get cheaper than we have it with kettle</v>

337
00:10:59.311 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>bells,</v>

338
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.620
<v Speaker 1>you have regular kettle bells and then the Zombie bells and the prime bells cost</v>

339
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

340
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>But that's because they're works of art and they're very difficult to recreate</v>

341
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.011
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

342
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:08.844
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

343
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 1>we just go for the greatest shit that they have.</v>

344
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And that philosophy is sort of,</v>

345
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:15.900
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

346
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what I tried to do with everything in life.</v>

347
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean just what's the best air conditioner?</v>

348
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Get that fucking thing.</v>

349
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Why are you playing games?</v>

350
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:22.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

351
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>what's the food that's the best for you?</v>

352
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 1>You should probably eat that.</v>

353
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

354
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:26.941
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

355
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:27.510

356
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.051
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

357
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>what's the healthiest way to live your life go that way.</v>

358
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>And what we sell it on it is just the best shit that we can find.</v>

359
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's the best organic coconut oil,</v>

360

383
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver is where,</v>

384
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

385
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.391
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

386
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:20.041
<v Speaker 3>Eckhart Tolle.</v>

387
00:12:20.041 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 3>He is from,</v>

388
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 3>and that's where he sat on the park bench for a couple of years.</v>

389
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Really formulating all of his positive thoughts.</v>

390
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

391
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 3>It after two years he realized that he should be in the present moment,</v>

392
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.543
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

393
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's more to it than that,</v>

394
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Speaker 3>but like it really took him years to fully embody like this is all I have is</v>

395
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 3>this exact moment and nothing else.</v>

396
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:37.751
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

397
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 3>And he figured it out in Vancouver and Vancouver.</v>

398
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

399
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Probably would have figured it out in Kansas.</v>

400
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.870
<v Speaker 3>It's bad mother fucker.</v>

401
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

402
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.100
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

403
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

404
00:12:44.281 --> 00:12:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

405
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking you can give Vancouver any credit for that even though Vancouver is</v>

406
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:48.684
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

434
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.590
<v Speaker 3>That's a great intro for my podcast from now and I'm just going to sample that.</v>

435
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a couple other things.</v>

436
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.281
<v Speaker 1>We were talking on the,</v>

437
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 1>during the commercials about these um,</v>

438
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>new laws that are slowly being worked in where people got allow them hemp farms</v>

439
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

440
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm really curious to see how they handle that and woo hoo.</v>

441
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Who starts getting arrested were you know,</v>

442
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 1>this Bundy ranch thing that's going on in Nevada and the blow back.</v>

443
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.500
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

444
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I know absolutely nothing about Bundy ranch.</v>

445
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.060
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I know about it is somebody tweeted me and said like,</v>

446
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.490
<v Speaker 3>why have you been silent on this?</v>

447
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:01.740
<v Speaker 3>And it's like I've been solid nine cause it's the first I've fucking heard of it</v>

448
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:03.420
<v Speaker 3>is like the other day somebody asks me,</v>

449
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.200
<v Speaker 3>broach the righteous indignation for you ignoring topics.</v>

450
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:09.300
<v Speaker 3>If there is a man gotten to David Seaman,</v>

451
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.610
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to talk about ranchers rights.</v>

452
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.541
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

453
00:14:12.541 --> 00:14:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I see where you draw the line.</v>

454
00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:15.590
<v Speaker 3>It's all fine if it's drones and bitcoin.</v>

455
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

456
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I was so confused about it because I thought it was the bunny ranch the whole</v>

457
00:14:19.921 --> 00:14:20.131
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

458
00:14:20.131 --> 00:14:20.401
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

459
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.390
<v Speaker 3>why do they have cattle there?</v>

460
00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:21.961
<v Speaker 3>That's so funny.</v>

461
00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:22.241
<v Speaker 3>I saw it.</v>

462
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:23.020
<v Speaker 3>The same thing.</v>

463
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

464
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.610
<v Speaker 3>when I saw that there was a protest at the bunny ranch,</v>

465
00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:27.061
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

466
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:27.751
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

467
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I thought like maybe someone killed a prostitute or something or some horrible</v>

468
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:32.790
<v Speaker 3>thing happened or,</v>

469
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.160
<v Speaker 3>or they were trying to shut them down.</v>

470
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Someone did not get their money's worth.</v>

471
00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:39.780
<v Speaker 3>So if you didn't get the price of protestors,</v>

472
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:40.051
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

473
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:40.650
<v Speaker 3>leave this guy,</v>

474
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.580
<v Speaker 3>these guys alone,</v>

475
00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:42.660
<v Speaker 3>let them just get whacked off.</v>

476
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it has something to do with,</v>

477
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:45.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

478
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.780
<v Speaker 1>using land to graze cattle on and that this guy's been doing this forever and</v>

479
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 5>he says that,</v>

480
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:53.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

481
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 5>he's just using the land the way God intended and is all,</v>

482
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

483
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 5>private or it's all public land.</v>

484
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.110
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

485
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.970
<v Speaker 5>the government wants grazing fees from this guy and they say that he owes the</v>

486
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 5>American tax payers millions of dollars for grazing fees.</v>

487
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know who's right or who's wrong,</v>

488
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 5>but what I do know is what they're trying to do is not handling court.</v>

489
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 5>They're trying,</v>

490
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 5>they're not trying to even like make a public plea for why this guy owes money.</v>

491
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

492
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 5>they're going there with guns and dogs and tasers and people are freaking out</v>

493
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.770
<v Speaker 5>and people rising up and they're saying,</v>

494
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 5>hey listen,</v>

495
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.151
<v Speaker 5>you assholes.</v>

496
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 5>When you wonder why we want to keep the second amendment,</v>

497
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.050
<v Speaker 5>when you wonder why we're worried about hostile takeovers and police dates.</v>

498
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 5>It's shit like this.</v>

499
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about grass,</v>

500
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:39.890
<v Speaker 5>you fuck heads.</v>

501
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.750
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about cows eating grass and how you're responding.</v>

502
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.270
<v Speaker 5>You're responding with snipers and dogs and tasers.</v>

503
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.890
<v Speaker 6>Well last night I had to pick my mom up at lax cause she's visiting and uh,</v>

504
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 6>on the way out the woman would not let me out of the parking lot where you'd</v>

505
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.330
<v Speaker 6>like pay the fee and leave and the little gate goes up.</v>

506
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.741
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

510
00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:02.890
<v Speaker 6>Like it doesn't have to be credit card.</v>

511
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:03.501
<v Speaker 6>I'll pay with cash.</v>

512
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:03.670
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

513
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.690
<v Speaker 6>I just want to get the fuck out of here.</v>

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.141
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't really matter.</v>

527
00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:23.080
<v Speaker 6>Like it's dark.</v>

528
00:16:23.081 --> 00:16:24.610
<v Speaker 6>You can barely see through the windshield.</v>

529
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:25.211
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

530
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:26.050
<v Speaker 6>just let me go.</v>

531
00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:26.950
<v Speaker 6>And here's the funny thing,</v>

532
00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:27.160
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

533
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:27.993
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

534
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a racist,</v>

535
00:16:29.261 --> 00:16:30.340
<v Speaker 6>I'm not an Islamophobe,</v>

536
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.900
<v Speaker 6>but she was wearing one of the,</v>

537
00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:32.111
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

538
00:16:32.111 --> 00:16:32.944
<v Speaker 6>the headscarves,</v>

539
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.480
<v Speaker 6>the fucking Burka things.</v>

540
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:35.381
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

541
00:16:35.381 --> 00:16:35.740
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

542
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.370
<v Speaker 6>if we're going to,</v>

543
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:41.370
<v Speaker 6>if we're going to be very crass as a civilization and very cold and calculating,</v>

544
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:45.820
<v Speaker 6>how many young white guys driving Toyota Corollas with their fucking mom in the</v>

545
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:46.510
<v Speaker 6>car,</v>

546
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.540
<v Speaker 6>how many of them have been responsible for terrorist attacks over the last 10,</v>

547
00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:49.901
<v Speaker 6>20,</v>

548
00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:50.830
<v Speaker 6>or a hundred years?</v>

549
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.813
<v Speaker 6>Zero.</v>

550
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.211
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

551
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:52.361
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

552
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:56.470
<v Speaker 6>this is ridiculous white guys with their mom and Toyota Corollas.</v>

553
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.640
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

554
00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:58.181
<v Speaker 6>what is this?</v>

555
00:16:58.181 --> 00:16:58.481
<v Speaker 6>And she's like,</v>

556
00:16:58.481 --> 00:16:58.601
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

557
00:16:58.601 --> 00:16:59.890
<v Speaker 6>it's homeland security policy.</v>

558
00:16:59.891 --> 00:17:00.101
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

559
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:00.221
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

560
00:17:00.221 --> 00:17:00.880
<v Speaker 6>it's bullshit.</v>

561
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.800
<v Speaker 6>Like I think we have to,</v>

562
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 6>we don't want to go overboard with being too adversarial or to uh,</v>

563
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.840
<v Speaker 6>like unaccepting of the fact that nothing is going to be perfect ever.</v>

564
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.190
<v Speaker 6>We have to acknowledge that.</v>

565
00:17:12.191 --> 00:17:14.920
<v Speaker 6>But I think if we don't put our foot down at some point and see like enough of</v>

566
00:17:14.921 --> 00:17:16.150
<v Speaker 6>this bureaucratic bullshit,</v>

567
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.770
<v Speaker 6>then it's only a matter of time before.</v>

568
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:20.050
<v Speaker 6>That's the situation in a grocery store parking lot,</v>

569
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:20.761
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

570
00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:22.210
<v Speaker 6>And like people say that's ridiculous.</v>

571
00:17:22.211 --> 00:17:24.640
<v Speaker 6>But that is how mission creep happens is big.</v>

572
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.950
<v Speaker 6>Oh well the TSA needs to keep our grocery store parking lot safe because can,</v>

573
00:17:28.951 --> 00:17:31.480
<v Speaker 6>you could be shot by a psychopath and you don't want that.</v>

574
00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:31.811
<v Speaker 6>And it's like,</v>

575
00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:32.531
<v Speaker 6>where do we draw the line?</v>

576
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:33.940
<v Speaker 6>Like life is unsafe,</v>

577
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.650
<v Speaker 6>everybody dies guaranteed.</v>

578
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:36.941
<v Speaker 6>And that's that.</v>

579
00:17:36.941 --> 00:17:37.331
<v Speaker 6>And then like,</v>

580
00:17:37.331 --> 00:17:38.770
<v Speaker 6>we should try to keep airports safe.</v>

581
00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:41.560
<v Speaker 6>We should try to profile people beforehand,</v>

582
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.453
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

583
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.070
<v Speaker 6>kind of filter out the threats before they even get there.</v>

584
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.630
<v Speaker 6>All that stuff I'm in favor of,</v>

585
00:17:46.631 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 6>but we got to have common sense and we're lacking that.</v>

586
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:49.741
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

587
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:49.951
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

588
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

589
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:50.941
<v Speaker 6>agree with you.</v>

590
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

591
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.340
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

592
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

593
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 6>you're totally right.</v>

594
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 6>And I think that that's the thing about that people don't recognize about,</v>

595
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 6>it's slowly creeping into new places.</v>

596
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 6>It's like all it would take is one event,</v>

597
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 6>whether it's at a great forum parking lot,</v>

598
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:06.991
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

599
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 6>whether it's sad,</v>

600
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

601
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:08.851
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

602
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:09.560
<v Speaker 6>they already,</v>

603
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.970
<v Speaker 6>the TSA wants to start arming their agent,</v>

604
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 6>arming their whatever they are.</v>

605
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 6>They're people because of the shooting at lax.</v>

606
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 6>So now we're going to go from a situation where there's pretty much nobody with</v>

607
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 6>guns at every airport to 20 dumb asses with guns at every airport and you're</v>

608
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 6>just creating an exponentially higher risk of something going wrong.</v>

609
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.291
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

610
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 6>somebody is going to make the wrong decision.</v>

611
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 6>Somebody who's going to be jumpy,</v>

612
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 6>you don't need to arm a bunch of people who,</v>

613
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:33.871
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

614
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:34.201
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

615
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:36.240
<v Speaker 6>are barely able to do their jobs as it is.</v>

616
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:36.911
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

617
00:18:36.911 --> 00:18:37.241
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

618
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.074
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

619
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.820
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely a slippery slope.</v>

620
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.410
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely a slippery slope.</v>

621
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.303
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

622
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.220
<v Speaker 5>what kind of qualifications are these people going to have to decide whether or</v>

623
00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:46.270
<v Speaker 5>not they should pull the trigger?</v>

624
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.600
<v Speaker 5>You heard about what happened to the PA that worked for tosh point?</v>

625
00:18:49.601 --> 00:18:50.200
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

626
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.000
<v Speaker 5>they've got accidentally shot by the cops.</v>

627
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:52.630
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

628
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.781
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

629
00:18:52.781 --> 00:18:56.770
<v Speaker 5>I didn't hear responded to someone they knew got stabbed.</v>

630
00:18:56.771 --> 00:19:01.771
<v Speaker 5>He went to help and the cops showed up and he was running out of the place with</v>

631
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.930
<v Speaker 5>the guy who had gotten stabbed.</v>

632
00:19:04.931 --> 00:19:05.651
<v Speaker 5>The guy ran out,</v>

633
00:19:05.651 --> 00:19:07.990
<v Speaker 5>he ran out behind him and the cops unloaded on him.</v>

634
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.410
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

635
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.030
<v Speaker 5>They just start firing on him and you know,</v>

636
00:19:10.031 --> 00:19:13.660
<v Speaker 5>the cops had no idea he was running towards them and they just made a bad</v>

637
00:19:13.661 --> 00:19:14.170
<v Speaker 5>decision.</v>

638
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 5>Now these are cops train police officers that made a,</v>

639
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.420
<v Speaker 5>a slippery decision and they were incorrect.</v>

640
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.711
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

641
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 6>And they go to a firing range and they have to pass certain tests.</v>

642
00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:24.930
<v Speaker 6>TSA officers are like rent a cops</v>

643
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.590
<v Speaker 5>basically.</v>

644
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.861
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

645
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what kind of stringent safety standards they have to go through.</v>

646
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:30.760
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

647
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm not comfortable with all those fucking dudes.</v>

648
00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 5>Can.</v>

649
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.360
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

650
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 5>I've seen too many of them that it just,</v>

651
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.960
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

652
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

653
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.910
<v Speaker 5>some of them are really cool for sure,</v>

654
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.040
<v Speaker 5>but I've seen too many of them where I'm like,</v>

655
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 5>this guy did not go through a tight filter to get here.</v>

656
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 5>He just didn't,</v>

657
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.960
<v Speaker 5>he's not that bright.</v>

658
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.150
<v Speaker 5>The way they're interacting with people's clunky,</v>

659
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.350
<v Speaker 5>it's rude.</v>

660
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:49.651
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

661
00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:52.980
<v Speaker 5>You see a lot of people that have this authoritative way of talking where they</v>

662
00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 5>don't recognize the fact that,</v>

663
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:54.841
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

664
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 5>you're just a person.</v>

665
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.791
<v Speaker 5>You're a person.</v>

666
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:57.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm a person.</v>

667
00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:57.541
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

668
00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:58.800
<v Speaker 5>you don't own me.</v>

669
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 5>You're not better than me.</v>

670
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.811
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

671
00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:04.590
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to talk down to me because I forgot to take my belt off.</v>

672
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.180
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

673
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you lighten the fuck up?</v>

674
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a terrorist.</v>

675
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm a human being who is going through your job.</v>

676
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:11.911
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

677
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 5>Just because you have power doesn't mean you should exercise it.</v>

678
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.841
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

679
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 5>In all fairness,</v>

680
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.020
<v Speaker 5>most of the people I run into a TSA are very pleasant and very nice</v>

681
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

682
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 6>Especially when I get in the preapproved line.</v>

683
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:22.501
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>

684
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:23.334
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like,</v>

685
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:23.641
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

686
00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:24.391
<v Speaker 6>this is what it should be.</v>

687
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:24.931
<v Speaker 6>All the time.</v>

688
00:20:24.931 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 6>It shouldn't be a special treat.</v>

689
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 6>It should be,</v>

690
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.190
<v Speaker 6>you know that just prescreen the shit out of me.</v>

691
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:30.320
<v Speaker 6>You're already reading my emails.</v>

692
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 6>Like let's figure this out.</v>

693
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 6>I got on the list where I can be preapproved and can leave my shoes on and</v>

694
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:35.341
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>

695
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm okay with that.</v>

696
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.651
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

697
00:20:36.651 --> 00:20:37.700
<v Speaker 5>That's how it should be.</v>

698
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.660
<v Speaker 5>100% I remember when you used to not have to take a driver's license.</v>

699
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.670
<v Speaker 5>He could give somebody else your ticket.</v>

700
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.670
<v Speaker 5>You could give Brian your ticket and he can go on a fucking plane.</v>

701
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 5>Like don't have to have</v>

702
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.730
<v Speaker 7>a ticket that says David Seaman.</v>

703
00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 7>Show your passport.</v>

704
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 7>Do you have any other forms of ID,</v>

705
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 7>sir?</v>

706
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.560
<v Speaker 7>Let me read your DNA.</v>

707
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 7>Can I check your fingerprints?</v>

708
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 7>What's the scar in your hand?</v>

709
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.210
<v Speaker 7>You've ruined your fingerprint.</v>

710
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.640
<v Speaker 7>You know mean.</v>

711
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 7>It's just unbelievably ridiculous that it's still escalating in this.</v>

712
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:04.683
<v Speaker 7>By the way,</v>

713
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.153
<v Speaker 7>where's the terrorism?</v>

714
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.541
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

715
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:08.374
<v Speaker 7>don't give them,</v>

716
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 7>don't give them any ideas.</v>

717
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 7>I know I'm not saying,</v>

718
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.550
<v Speaker 7>but what I am saying is Boston police arrest man for bringing hoax explosive</v>

719
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 7>device to Boston marathon finish line.</v>

720
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.610
<v Speaker 7>They should eat that guy.</v>

721
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 7>They should cut him up into pieces and serve him to prisoners.</v>

722
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 7>There was a pressure cooker and it too,</v>

723
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.603
<v Speaker 7>like he just made,</v>

724
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.820
<v Speaker 7>oh what a fucking idiot.</v>

725
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.461
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>

726
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 7>Not a smart God.</v>

727
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:30.010
<v Speaker 7>What a fucking idiot.</v>

728
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 7>But you know what,</v>

729
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 7>what would have prevented that guy from doing that?</v>

730
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.160
<v Speaker 7>I mean maybe,</v>

731
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 7>maybe if they had more security at the Boston airport or at the Boston marathon.</v>

732
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.950
<v Speaker 7>But really what would have prevented it is if they followed up on all the</v>

733
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:46.170
<v Speaker 7>creepers like that.</v>

734
00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 7>They had been looking at that guy for a long time.</v>

735
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

736
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.580
<v Speaker 7>the CIA had been investigating that guy for awhile.</v>

737
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.770
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

738
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 7>Important piece of shit.</v>

739
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 7>We're a country of 300 million people.</v>

740
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:58.110
<v Speaker 7>So unless we put everybody under house arrest and like,</v>

741
00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

742
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.780
<v Speaker 7>padded bubble wrapped rooms to keep us safe,</v>

743
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.880
<v Speaker 7>some people are going to do crazy shit.</v>

744
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 7>And that's what happens when you have a society where people have rights and</v>

745
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:08.980
<v Speaker 7>people can have guns and people can drive cars.</v>

746
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:10.450
<v Speaker 7>Like you're going to have car accidents,</v>

747
00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 7>you're gonna have people shooting people.</v>

748
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 7>And if you don't have that,</v>

749
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 7>you'll still have crazy people.</v>

750
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 7>The other day there was a headline story on CNN.</v>

751
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:17.794
<v Speaker 7>Some school,</v>

752
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 7>I forget where it was,</v>

753
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.691
<v Speaker 7>Wisconsin,</v>

754
00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:22.860
<v Speaker 7>maybe there was a fucking knife thing where this guy went in and a rampage and</v>

755
00:22:22.861 --> 00:22:23.170
<v Speaker 7>knife.</v>

756
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 7>Like a crazy amount of people.</v>

757
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:25.571
<v Speaker 7>He didn't have a gun.</v>

758
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 7>He was like five people.</v>

759
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

760
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.603
<v Speaker 7>it's insane.</v>

761
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

762
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.201
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

763
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:31.750
<v Speaker 7>and we got a lot of problems in this country.</v>

764
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:35.110
<v Speaker 7>We definitely have a lot of problems but I think are behavioral problems.</v>

765
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.830
<v Speaker 7>It's what would cause a person to do any of those things.</v>

766
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 7>It's the same thing that what would cause a person have no environmentally</v>

767
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 7>concerned,</v>

768
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.410
<v Speaker 7>no environmental concerns.</v>

769
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 7>If they could profit from it,</v>

770
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.630
<v Speaker 7>what could cause a person to release something on the market that may have</v>

771
00:22:49.631 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 7>potential horrific side effects without,</v>

772
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:52.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

773
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 7>doing the kind of screening that they should do every time.</v>

774
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 7>Something like Vioxx slips through.</v>

775
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.830
<v Speaker 7>Are these pharmaceutical drugs give you strokes?</v>

776
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 7>They find out years later like I know dude,</v>

777
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 7>it's like 30 years old.</v>

778
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 7>He's an MMA fighter and a fucking stroke from taking Vioxx.</v>

779
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 7>I mean that stuff,</v>

780
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.163
<v Speaker 7>they pulled it,</v>

781
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 7>they yanked it.</v>

782
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.500
<v Speaker 7>But there's been a bunch of those things where they just said fuck it,</v>

783
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 7>let it roll.</v>

784
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.263
<v Speaker 7>Let's find out later.</v>

785
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 7>You know maybe weird shit will happen to people,</v>

786
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:17.740
<v Speaker 7>but we've got to have data run makes him money.</v>

787
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.000
<v Speaker 7>I had a family member have a heart attack from a adverse reaction to a drug</v>

788
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 7>that's relatively new last couple of years it came on the market and it's still</v>

789
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:26.261
<v Speaker 7>on the market.</v>

790
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 7>Even though this is a known side effect,</v>

791
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 7>like you'll see a,</v>

792
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:29.764
<v Speaker 7>if you Google it,</v>

793
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.570
<v Speaker 7>you'll see like a law firm's soliciting victims of this,</v>

794
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.330
<v Speaker 7>this issue and I guess whatever bean counter there decided that it would be</v>

795
00:23:37.331 --> 00:23:41.380
<v Speaker 7>massively expensive to to reign in the drug and admit the word fault.</v>

796
00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:43.150
<v Speaker 7>So instead we're just going to say,</v>

797
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:43.361
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

798
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 7>this is the risk of using this medication is,</v>

799
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 7>it's</v>

800
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 6>insane to me that I still see commercials for this drug on TV and like know that</v>

801
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 6>it's responsible for giving a family member or a heart attack.</v>

802
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 6>That's so crazy.</v>

803
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:53.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

804
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.470
<v Speaker 5>And is it just a weird one?</v>

805
00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.450
<v Speaker 5>1 million people freak out and blow a gasket on this stuff or is it a real</v>

806
00:24:00.451 --> 00:24:01.710
<v Speaker 5>common side effect?</v>

807
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 6>It's not super common,</v>

808
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 6>but it's also,</v>

809
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 6>from what I,</v>

810
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.461
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

811
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:06.580
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a doctor or anything since it just googling around.</v>

812
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 6>It's not super uncommon either.</v>

813
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 6>It's not like,</v>

814
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:08.931
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

815
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 6>you saw the ads from Mesothelioma and nobody actually has it.</v>

816
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:15.350
<v Speaker 6>This is something where like you get prescribed this instead of the one that's</v>

817
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:16.790
<v Speaker 6>tried and true and that,</v>

818
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

819
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 6>hospitals have been using for decades with,</v>

820
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

821
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 6>very known a risk profile.</v>

822
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.240
<v Speaker 6>This one replaces that.</v>

823
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Speaker 6>And because it's under patent,</v>

824
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:26.660
<v Speaker 6>they make more money and they claim it's more efficient,</v>

825
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:27.494
<v Speaker 6>which it may be,</v>

826
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.650
<v Speaker 6>but it also has this small chance of really fucking you over.</v>

827
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.290
<v Speaker 5>What is Mesothelioma?</v>

828
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.610
<v Speaker 5>Cause I see those ads,</v>

829
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.560
<v Speaker 5>they're on all the time on television.</v>

830
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Do you have Mesothelioma?</v>

831
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:37.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

832
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 6>I honestly don't know.</v>

833
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 6>I think it might be some kind of lung disorder.</v>

834
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 6>And it was from what?</v>

835
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.810
<v Speaker 6>No idea is a,</v>

836
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.610
<v Speaker 6>looks like a cancer that develops from cells.</v>

837
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:49.723
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

838
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 5>here it is from exposure to asbestos.</v>

839
00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:54.983
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

840
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.890
<v Speaker 5>It's a cancer only from Express's.</v>

841
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

842
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

843
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.130
<v Speaker 5>So I guess what they're trying to do with those ads is target people that used</v>

844
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 5>to work in offices that have asbestos in them.</v>

845
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 5>So there's,</v>

846
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 5>that has nothing to do with what we're talking about,</v>

847
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.500
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

848
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:07.651
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

849
00:25:07.651 --> 00:25:08.401
<v Speaker 6>but my point is like,</v>

850
00:25:08.401 --> 00:25:10.080
<v Speaker 6>you see those ads online,</v>

851
00:25:10.081 --> 00:25:10.840
<v Speaker 6>like have you,</v>

852
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.530
<v Speaker 6>are you suffering from Mesothelioma contact our law firm?</v>

853
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.200
<v Speaker 6>And I've never met anybody who's suffered from that.</v>

854
00:25:16.201 --> 00:25:17.700
<v Speaker 6>But this is something where if you Google it,</v>

855
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.110
<v Speaker 6>there actually are cases of people having adverse side effects and it's because</v>

856
00:25:22.111 --> 00:25:23.160
<v Speaker 6>it's a new drug.</v>

857
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:27.240
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to make money and push aside this extremely cheap drug drug that</v>

858
00:25:27.241 --> 00:25:28.320
<v Speaker 6>costs like nothing,</v>

859
00:25:28.321 --> 00:25:32.160
<v Speaker 6>like a dollar and has been used in hospitals for a hundred years and they want</v>

860
00:25:32.161 --> 00:25:34.260
<v Speaker 6>to replace that blood thinner with this new one,</v>

861
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.330
<v Speaker 6>which is not all that tried and true.</v>

862
00:25:36.331 --> 00:25:36.691
<v Speaker 6>And it's just,</v>

863
00:25:36.691 --> 00:25:36.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

864
00:25:36.871 --> 00:25:39.510
<v Speaker 6>it's gone through the FDA process but then shit happens.</v>

865
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.853
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

866
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.530
<v Speaker 6>I dunno how I got off on this tangent,</v>

867
00:25:43.531 --> 00:25:43.820
<v Speaker 6>but I think,</v>

868
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

869
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:44.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

870
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:48.100
<v Speaker 5>Well we got off talking about people that are just behavior problems.</v>

871
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 5>It's an uh,</v>

872
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:54.611
<v Speaker 5>thinking and behavior problem that people are willing to put money over humanity</v>

873
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.790
<v Speaker 5>or the people were willing to commit horrific crimes like I,</v>

874
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.410
<v Speaker 5>what is it that causes someone to be able to run through a school and stab a</v>

875
00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:04.071
<v Speaker 5>bunch of kids?</v>

876
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:04.251
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

877
00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:04.910
<v Speaker 5>what is it?</v>

878
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:05.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

879
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Speaker 5>is he on drugs?</v>

880
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Is it an antidepressant?</v>

881
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.650
<v Speaker 5>Is it a childhood abuse?</v>

882
00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 5>Is it trauma?</v>

883
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:14.330
<v Speaker 5>When he was young and just ruined his mind,</v>

884
00:26:14.331 --> 00:26:16.130
<v Speaker 5>ruined the connections at his mind.</v>

885
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 5>Makes forever.</v>

886
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.140
<v Speaker 5>What are those?</v>

887
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 5>What are those answers?</v>

888
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.360
<v Speaker 5>Because that's not what we ever hear.</v>

889
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:24.220
<v Speaker 5>All we ever hear is tightened down and security take away the guns but locked</v>

890
00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:26.240
<v Speaker 5>the gates installed guards.</v>

891
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.070
<v Speaker 5>But is that really the answer?</v>

892
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:31.790
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't we be trying to figure out at least making an attempt because I</v>

893
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:36.791
<v Speaker 5>don't hear a fucking peep out of anybody to examine the motivations and the</v>

894
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 5>possibilities.</v>

895
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.720
<v Speaker 5>Like what are the possibilities that could cause someone to become a monster?</v>

896
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.823
<v Speaker 5>What is it,</v>

897
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

898
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 5>what are the variables?</v>

899
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that when they add more security guards and more checkpoints,</v>

900
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 6>I really don't think it's about making us safer.</v>

901
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:53.090
<v Speaker 6>And it's not that they don't want us to be safer.</v>

902
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 6>I'm not like super,</v>

903
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

904
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 6>super cynical about this.</v>

905
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.060
<v Speaker 6>But what it is,</v>

906
00:26:57.061 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 6>is pretty much a jobs program.</v>

907
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:02.370
<v Speaker 6>It's like this is a way to give people jobs and keep the employment rate right</v>

908
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 6>at decent range.</v>

909
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 6>And if we don't give people these jobs that basically they're just standing</v>

910
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 6>around like what is the abbreviation for Tsa that people use thousand standing</v>

911
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.630
<v Speaker 6>around there.</v>

912
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.080
<v Speaker 6>It's a fucking jobs program.</v>

913
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:15.930
<v Speaker 6>And so I would much rather see us,</v>

914
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.261
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

915
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:16.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

916
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:19.830
<v Speaker 6>why don't those people do something that actually helps the community plant</v>

917
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:23.700
<v Speaker 6>trees instead of harassing people at an airport or a,</v>

918
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.121
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

919
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 6>we don't want to militarize our schools because then every day you're going into</v>

920
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 6>school and subconsciously you're like,</v>

921
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 6>am I a fucking prisoner?</v>

922
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 6>Like why are there guards around here?</v>

923
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:35.590
<v Speaker 6>It's supposed to be a voluntary thing where like I'm coming for knowledge and to</v>

924
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 6>interact with other people my age and learn something about the world and then</v>

925
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 6>go home and it's not a prison.</v>

926
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:41.664
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

927
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

928
00:27:42.141 --> 00:27:45.980
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird thing that you have to even think about that they even worry about</v>

929
00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:48.260
<v Speaker 1>going to a school and there's guards,</v>

930
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>they're like protecting what it's like.</v>

931
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to get to a point where it's just,</v>

932
00:27:53.211 --> 00:27:56.240
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that's different is that people haven't figured out that they can</v>

933
00:27:56.241 --> 00:28:00.620
<v Speaker 1>attack people at stadiums or figured out that they can attack people at the</v>

934
00:28:00.621 --> 00:28:00.951
<v Speaker 1>mall.</v>

935
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:01.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

936
00:28:01.161 --> 00:28:03.500
<v Speaker 1>once those things start happening on a regular basis,</v>

937
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.590
<v Speaker 1>there really will be some sort of a lock down the parking lot.</v>

938
00:28:06.591 --> 00:28:08.900
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to show your vin number and they're going to have to read</v>

939
00:28:08.901 --> 00:28:09.621
<v Speaker 1>your DNA.</v>

940
00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:10.454
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

941
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.381
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

942
00:28:11.381 --> 00:28:12.400
<v Speaker 6>it was really a,</v>

943
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:13.810
<v Speaker 6>when somebody says,</v>

944
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.920
<v Speaker 6>I need your vin number,</v>

945
00:28:14.921 --> 00:28:17.530
<v Speaker 6>it just feels so invasive because they're like,</v>

946
00:28:17.531 --> 00:28:18.131
<v Speaker 6>we own you.</v>

947
00:28:18.131 --> 00:28:19.480
<v Speaker 6>That's like the message that I get.</v>

948
00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:22.030
<v Speaker 6>I realize that they need to do it cause they don't want somebody putting a</v>

949
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.710
<v Speaker 6>explosive device in a car that doesn't have a license plate.</v>

950
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.230
<v Speaker 6>I totally understand the logic.</v>

951
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.330
<v Speaker 6>But just as an individual who,</v>

952
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

953
00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.670
<v Speaker 6>goes to airports fairly often,</v>

954
00:28:30.671 --> 00:28:33.970
<v Speaker 6>it's dehumanizing and there's no proof that this makes us safer.</v>

955
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

956
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 1>There's no proof that this makes us safer.</v>

957
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

958
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 1>the actual numbers of terrorist attacks,</v>

959
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:43.740
<v Speaker 1>like not taking anything away from the horrific nature of nine 11 or the Boston</v>

960
00:28:43.741 --> 00:28:44.640
<v Speaker 1>bombings or anything,</v>

961
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

962
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:49.350
<v Speaker 1>the numbers of those things taking place in comparison to the numbers of human</v>

963
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 1>beings is quite staggering.</v>

964
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

965
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:55.620
<v Speaker 1>there are very few terrorists attacks and God damn,</v>

966
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people,</v>

967
00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:01.730
<v Speaker 1>there's 300 million fucking people in this country.</v>

968
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Not including transients,</v>

969
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.630
<v Speaker 1>not including vacationers from other countries,</v>

970
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.370
<v Speaker 1>not including illegal aliens.</v>

971
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.210
<v Speaker 1>We really don't know the full number is because when I'm actually,</v>

972
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 1>homes are good at crossing that border.</v>

973
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.930
<v Speaker 1>La is a joke,</v>

974
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 1>like when they try to figure out like the sense of Ella.</v>

975
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:18.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

976
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:19.141
<v Speaker 1>You get it.</v>

977
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:19.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

978
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:24.411
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 million people in La and approximately a hundred thousand undocumented</v>

979
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:25.974
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

980
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any,</v>

981
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how many,</v>

982
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea how many Mexicans they are.</v>

983
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:30.891
<v Speaker 1>They aren't,</v>

984
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking to you about how they're undocumented.</v>

985
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:34.434
<v Speaker 1>They're hiding.</v>

986
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:34.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

987
00:29:34.621 --> 00:29:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Go to work,</v>

988
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 6>go to one TACO truck next to a car wash.</v>

989
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.040
<v Speaker 6>It was like a thousand,</v>

990
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

991
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.600
<v Speaker 6>Mexican people there.</v>

992
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

993
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.540
<v Speaker 7>speaking of Mexican immigrants,</v>

994
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 7>this is one of my issues with the media is right now they would have us believe</v>

995
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 7>that the two biggest problems facing all of us,</v>

996
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 7>gay marriage and illegal immigration,</v>

997
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:53.221
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

998
00:29:53.221 --> 00:29:54.230
<v Speaker 7>the right about one thing.</v>

999
00:29:54.231 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking queers kitchen up on the way,</v>

1000
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 7>on the way over here,</v>

1001
00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 7>the freeway was backed up because there was a wedding right in the middle of the</v>

1002
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:01.331
<v Speaker 7>freeway.</v>

1003
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:02.740
<v Speaker 7>All these gays just getting married,</v>

1004
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 7>right and left destroying our way of life.</v>

1005
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1006
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.230
<v Speaker 7>they're sucking each other off right before they got married.</v>

1007
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 7>They don't even believe in the sanctity of marriage in a gay household.</v>

1008
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 7>They don't abstain before they get married.</v>

1009
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 7>They're not like regular people.</v>

1010
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 7>They have sex all the time.</v>

1011
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 7>And then we know that the wedding ring goes on your cock.</v>

1012
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure if they do that where it's how it keeps your Dick hard.</v>

1013
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.340
<v Speaker 7>None of 'em abstain ever.</v>

1014
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.271
<v Speaker 7>It never abstained.</v>

1015
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:26.940
<v Speaker 7>Did you never going to find a single gay version?</v>

1016
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 7>They come out of the gate thing in their own,</v>

1017
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:29.764
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

1018
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Speaker 7>they really had a wedding in the middle of a fuck head.</v>

1019
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ.</v>

1020
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:36.420
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1021
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 7>so you have an eight year old on the podcast.</v>

1022
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:39.760
<v Speaker 7>We have to explain things to him.</v>

1023
00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 7>That should be obvious.</v>

1024
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 7>I thought you really said there was and I'm like,</v>

1025
00:30:42.701 --> 00:30:42.941
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>

1026
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:43.721
<v Speaker 7>that's ridiculous.</v>

1027
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 7>That's a good idea though.</v>

1028
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 7>Everyone I know about your wedding.</v>

1029
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:48.880
<v Speaker 7>I'm so deadpan about everything that people can't even tell when I'm joking</v>

1030
00:30:48.881 --> 00:30:49.320
<v Speaker 7>about shit,</v>

1031
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.950
<v Speaker 7>but the other,</v>

1032
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.740
<v Speaker 7>it'd be 99.9% of the people listening.</v>

1033
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 7>Brian's half awake,</v>

1034
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 7>he woke up 15 minutes.</v>

1035
00:30:57.581 --> 00:30:58.980
<v Speaker 7>He hasn't had his bulletproof coffee.</v>

1036
00:30:58.981 --> 00:30:59.814
<v Speaker 7>It worked out.</v>

1037
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 7>So that's what it is.</v>

1038
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:02.764
<v Speaker 7>You're tired.</v>

1039
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.000
<v Speaker 7>The illegal immigration thing,</v>

1040
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 7>it's like if we want to solve this,</v>

1041
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:08.350
<v Speaker 7>like instead of putting all these judge Dredd border patrol people along the</v>

1042
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:08.950
<v Speaker 7>border,</v>

1043
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 7>which I don't think it's a terrible idea because we do need some border</v>

1044
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:11.950
<v Speaker 7>protection,</v>

1045
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.240
<v Speaker 7>but it's enormously expensive.</v>

1046
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.190
<v Speaker 7>It's dehumanizing.</v>

1047
00:31:14.191 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 7>We're rounding these people up like animals.</v>

1048
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.240
<v Speaker 7>Why don't we start by making it so that American corporations stop fucking</v>

1049
00:31:19.241 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 7>promoting them coming over here.</v>

1050
00:31:20.771 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 7>If we are not giving them any kind of jobs,</v>

1051
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.100
<v Speaker 7>the immigration with,</v>

1052
00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:24.821
<v Speaker 7>to a large extent,</v>

1053
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:25.601
<v Speaker 7>stop it.</v>

1054
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:29.020
<v Speaker 7>They're coming over here cause it sucks in Mexico and they can get jobs here and</v>

1055
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 7>send money.</v>

1056
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:29.651
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:30.610
<v Speaker 7>But I don't think the,</v>

1058
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:35.970
<v Speaker 7>the rational response is stop giving them jobs once they get here because it's</v>

1059
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:38.500
<v Speaker 7>never going to happen.</v>

1060
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 7>There's always going to be landscapers and there's always going to be</v>

1061
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:42.650
<v Speaker 7>construction.</v>

1062
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.300
<v Speaker 7>Agriculture.</v>

1063
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.770
<v Speaker 7>Like any vegetables you bought in the supermarket have probably been picked by a</v>

1064
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:47.771
<v Speaker 7>legal day.</v>

1065
00:31:47.771 --> 00:31:48.760
<v Speaker 7>Laborers sure.</v>

1066
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:50.260
<v Speaker 7>Go to AWC star and get a strawberry.</v>

1067
00:31:50.261 --> 00:31:51.094
<v Speaker 7>Who are you getting from?</v>

1068
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 7>You're getting that shit from someone who probably came to America to find a</v>

1069
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:55.660
<v Speaker 7>better life for their family.</v>

1070
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 7>So I don't think you can say the corporations are at fault.</v>

1071
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Speaker 7>The human being should be allowed to go to a better place.</v>

1072
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 7>You should be allowed to take your fucking family to a better place.</v>

1073
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.320
<v Speaker 7>And everybody over here that's got a good is scared that these poor people are</v>

1074
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:10.060
<v Speaker 7>going to come over here and fuck everything up.</v>

1075
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.110
<v Speaker 7>And that's what the,</v>

1076
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 7>the real fear is.</v>

1077
00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 7>What about passports?</v>

1078
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:16.450
<v Speaker 7>What an antiquated idea that is because I think as long as you're not on the</v>

1079
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 7>Interpol list and you're not wanted for something,</v>

1080
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 7>you should just be able to go wherever you want.</v>

1081
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 7>As long as it's an allied country,</v>

1082
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:22.960
<v Speaker 7>you shouldn't need a passport.</v>

1083
00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:26.290
<v Speaker 7>That's valid because it's like they know how to you find out if someone's on the</v>

1084
00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 7>Interpol list without a passport.</v>

1085
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:28.811
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:30.640
<v Speaker 7>I mean I guess you need some kind of system,</v>

1087
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 7>but I think it can be done with what they have already.</v>

1088
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:34.870
<v Speaker 7>Like they know what you're doing at every second of the day.</v>

1089
00:32:34.871 --> 00:32:36.850
<v Speaker 7>This is what's so Orwellian and fucked up.</v>

1090
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 7>It's like yesterday was tax day and we saw all this stuff</v>

1091
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 6>like make sure you file your taxes on time.</v>

1092
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 6>And it's like,</v>

1093
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 6>what is this?</v>

1094
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:43.791
<v Speaker 6>Like?</v>

1095
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:45.370
<v Speaker 6>What kind of mind benders?</v>

1096
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 6>We know that the NSA is sharing data with agencies like the IRS giving them,</v>

1097
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:50.061
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1098
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 6>we know that they're sharing financial data with those kinds of agencies and IRS</v>

1099
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:57.800
<v Speaker 6>knows exactly how much you owe because they get the 10 90 nines every year from</v>

1100
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 6>the people who pay you more than $600 so they know everything.</v>

1101
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 6>Why don't they just send you a fucking bill and then if there's a problem you</v>

1102
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 6>can dispute it the same as a credit card bill instead of like,</v>

1103
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 6>I've got a guest to make sure that I'm paying the right amount and if I don't</v>

1104
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.880
<v Speaker 6>match their number,</v>

1105
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.100
<v Speaker 6>they are,</v>

1106
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 6>we have right here.</v>

1107
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 6>Even Donald Rumsfeld who I consider to be the closest thing to like the man</v>

1108
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 6>that's out there tweeted out the other day about how the IRS is just out of</v>

1109
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:21.230
<v Speaker 6>control.</v>

1110
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 6>Like it makes no sense anymore.</v>

1111
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 6>It's not a logical thing.</v>

1112
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:25.910
<v Speaker 6>Like there's some Democrat Foreign Office.</v>

1113
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.201
<v Speaker 6>It's true,</v>

1114
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:27.921
<v Speaker 6>it's partisan,</v>

1115
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 6>it's just attacking the other side.</v>

1116
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 6>But I think in general like why don't you just send me a bill,</v>

1117
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:33.501
<v Speaker 6>just send me a bill.</v>

1118
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:35.150
<v Speaker 6>And like in most cases I think most people are like,</v>

1119
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:35.691
<v Speaker 6>oh this is what I,</v>

1120
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 6>oh cool.</v>

1121
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 6>20% 25% what are the fuck it is?</v>

1122
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.400
<v Speaker 6>People can pay it cause that's how it works for cable.</v>

1123
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.720
<v Speaker 6>It's what?</v>

1124
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.810
<v Speaker 6>How it works for your credit card,</v>

1125
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 6>for your car payment.</v>

1126
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.630
<v Speaker 6>Why isn't your tax bill the same one?</v>

1127
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 6>Because they don't want people to pay or get money back.</v>

1128
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 6>Most people get money back.</v>

1129
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 6>That I know of.</v>

1130
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.460
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1131
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 6>unless you're making over a certain amount of money,</v>

1132
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 6>you actually get money back.</v>

1133
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:53.511
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's like,</v>

1134
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:53.601
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1135
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:53.910
<v Speaker 6>it's time.</v>

1136
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 6>I get my tax check yet.</v>

1137
00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:55.541
<v Speaker 5>Well here's,</v>

1138
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:56.374
<v Speaker 5>here's a fucker.</v>

1139
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.341
<v Speaker 5>Here's a fucker.</v>

1140
00:33:57.341 --> 00:33:58.450
<v Speaker 5>State taxes.</v>

1141
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.040
<v Speaker 5>You don't always have to pay him.</v>

1142
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.113
<v Speaker 5>That's the fucker.</v>

1143
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Like if we lived in Washington state or if we have done,</v>

1144
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.770
<v Speaker 5>we lived in Vegas or la,</v>

1145
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.160
<v Speaker 5>I think Texas as well.</v>

1146
00:34:06.161 --> 00:34:06.671
<v Speaker 5>Florida,</v>

1147
00:34:06.671 --> 00:34:07.090
<v Speaker 5>Florida.</v>

1148
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.790
<v Speaker 5>Few places don't have to pay the state taxes.</v>

1149
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:12.070
<v Speaker 5>That's 10% so if you live,</v>

1150
00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:13.480
<v Speaker 5>if say if you make a nice living,</v>

1151
00:34:13.481 --> 00:34:14.480
<v Speaker 5>you know you make a,</v>

1152
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.420
<v Speaker 5>let's go to a hundred grand a year because it's easy.</v>

1153
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.010
<v Speaker 5>You make $100,000 a year,</v>

1154
00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:20.770
<v Speaker 5>you're given $10,000 to state of California.</v>

1155
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.470
<v Speaker 5>So you're paying $10,000 just to live here.</v>

1156
00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:27.220
<v Speaker 5>So you imagine if you rent was 1000 bucks and then on top of that you pay</v>

1157
00:34:27.221 --> 00:34:29.110
<v Speaker 5>another thousand bucks to the state.</v>

1158
00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.910
<v Speaker 5>That is what your doing.</v>

1159
00:34:30.911 --> 00:34:34.660
<v Speaker 5>If you live in California or if you live in a place that has state taxes,</v>

1160
00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:37.570
<v Speaker 5>like how does Washington state survive?</v>

1161
00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.640
<v Speaker 5>How come they don't have to steal my money?</v>

1162
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:40.380
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

1163
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 5>What's going on here?</v>

1164
00:34:41.501 --> 00:34:45.910
<v Speaker 5>That Vegas doesn't need that 10% what's going on here that Texas has figured out</v>

1165
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.900
<v Speaker 5>how to fucking stay afloat without stealing money from the people that live</v>

1166
00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:50.081
<v Speaker 5>there?</v>

1167
00:34:50.081 --> 00:34:52.030
<v Speaker 5>Like what does that state tax,</v>

1168
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.250
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't everybody gets a piece of what?</v>

1169
00:34:54.251 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 5>So you can hire more people to do a shitty job of running things and you and</v>

1170
00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:03.370
<v Speaker 5>just keep putting jobs on the books to eat up tax revenue.</v>

1171
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 5>We got it.</v>

1172
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.410
<v Speaker 5>100,000 jobs,</v>

1173
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.030
<v Speaker 5>you should be fired.</v>

1174
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.240
<v Speaker 5>The government should be fired for creating any jobs.</v>

1175
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.490
<v Speaker 5>If you creating more jobs and you already have,</v>

1176
00:35:12.491 --> 00:35:13.720
<v Speaker 5>that means there's more government,</v>

1177
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.880
<v Speaker 5>more government should mean you're fired.</v>

1178
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.840
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking up.</v>

1179
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.100
<v Speaker 5>We don't need more government.</v>

1180
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.820
<v Speaker 5>Need less people telling you what to do and less shit that's illegal.</v>

1181
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:27.180
<v Speaker 5>That would smooth things out for so many people and let drugs be legal.</v>

1182
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:28.771
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

1183
00:35:28.771 --> 00:35:29.860
<v Speaker 5>I balance your economy.</v>

1184
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.270
<v Speaker 5>It's done so over.</v>

1185
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:31.840
<v Speaker 5>I still,</v>

1186
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1187
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:32.810
<v Speaker 6>think Obama,</v>

1188
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1189
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 6>the other day I was,</v>

1190
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.760
<v Speaker 6>I was in Venice beach getting lunch and I got a beer and a burger and enjoyed</v>

1191
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 6>something that's known to the state of California to have medicinal benefit.</v>

1192
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 6>And I looked up in the,</v>

1193
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1194
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.461
<v Speaker 6>whenever this place was,</v>

1195
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:48.280
<v Speaker 6>this restaurant and right over the door was the picture of Obama from his Hawaii</v>

1196
00:35:48.281 --> 00:35:48.631
<v Speaker 6>days.</v>

1197
00:35:48.631 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 6>He had the hat on and he was smoking a Doobie and for like a half a second,</v>

1198
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:53.581
<v Speaker 6>I thought,</v>

1199
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:54.600
<v Speaker 6>that's my guy right there.</v>

1200
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 6>That's 2008 campaign trail Obama.</v>

1201
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:58.230
<v Speaker 6>And then of course,</v>

1202
00:35:58.231 --> 00:35:58.951
<v Speaker 6>that's not what we got.</v>

1203
00:35:58.951 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 6>We got smart Bush.</v>

1204
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:00.421
<v Speaker 6>Instead,</v>

1205
00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:05.190
<v Speaker 6>we got somebody who can like come onto the tonight show or the view or something</v>

1206
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 6>and just have the host eating out of his hand by the end of the interview.</v>

1207
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 6>So he's much smarter and more eloquent,</v>

1208
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 6>but it's still doing a lot of the crazy shit that Bush was doing.</v>

1209
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.530
<v Speaker 6>And I think that he could still,</v>

1210
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:17.520
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1211
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.180
<v Speaker 6>kind of like,</v>

1212
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.140
<v Speaker 6>what's the word I'm looking for?</v>

1213
00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:19.411
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1214
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:20.244
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1215
00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.030
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1216
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 6>come out ahead and like still come across as a good president.</v>

1217
00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 6>If you were to just legalize weed at the federal level,</v>

1218
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 6>I think most people be like,</v>

1219
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:27.961
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1220
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:28.201
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1221
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:31.980
<v Speaker 6>He actually did something meaningful that will be around 50 years from now.</v>

1222
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.001
<v Speaker 6>And it's not just like,</v>

1223
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:33.601
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to tax,</v>

1224
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:36.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to find the shit out of you if you don't sign up for my healthcare</v>

1225
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.661
<v Speaker 6>website.</v>

1226
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1227
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.771
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1228
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:40.590
<v Speaker 6>I've done more drone strikes than any other president in history.</v>

1229
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.680
<v Speaker 6>I've allowed NSA programs to expand and set almost nothing in response if you</v>

1230
00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:45.820
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>

1231
00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 6>even with all that shit,</v>

1232
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:47.940
<v Speaker 6>which I think is awful.</v>

1233
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 6>Legalize weed at the federal level and I would rate him as a good president.</v>

1234
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.023
<v Speaker 7>You're hilarious.</v>

1235
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:54.771
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

1236
00:36:54.771 --> 00:36:56.150
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that that's a joint.</v>

1237
00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.530
<v Speaker 7>I think that picture is a cigarette.</v>

1238
00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.880
<v Speaker 7>I've looked at it many times.</v>

1239
00:36:58.881 --> 00:37:00.530
<v Speaker 7>I've studied it like this approved or film.</v>

1240
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.440
<v Speaker 7>Let's look at it quite closely.</v>

1241
00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.040
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever noticed this when you're high,</v>

1242
00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:07.930
<v Speaker 7>like everything seems to be a reminder that your high no,</v>

1243
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.640
<v Speaker 7>because I've been getting high longer than you son.</v>

1244
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.360
<v Speaker 7>I never hold a cigarette like that.</v>

1245
00:37:14.361 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 7>He's really enjoying it.</v>

1246
00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.840
<v Speaker 7>It made them slow closing on that bitch.</v>

1247
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.820
<v Speaker 7>Let's get a CSI on this one.</v>

1248
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.340
<v Speaker 7>Look how closer.</v>

1249
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.740
<v Speaker 7>Look how it's not like,</v>

1250
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.720
<v Speaker 7>like it's looks squished and stuff and was a roll joints.</v>

1251
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.970
<v Speaker 7>Get the smoke signature and know what?</v>

1252
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.450
<v Speaker 7>Here's a,</v>

1253
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.283
<v Speaker 7>here's another,</v>

1254
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.640
<v Speaker 7>here's another uh,</v>

1255
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:32.420
<v Speaker 7>point.</v>

1256
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.080
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1257
00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.140
<v Speaker 7>look how far down he's already smoking it.</v>

1258
00:37:36.141 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 7>He would basically be in the filter.</v>

1259
00:37:37.641 --> 00:37:38.510
<v Speaker 7>If it was a cigarette.</v>

1260
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:38.900
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>

1261
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.550
<v Speaker 7>100%.</v>

1262
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.020
<v Speaker 7>Unless he wrote his own cigarette.</v>

1263
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.100
<v Speaker 7>He's a cowboy.</v>

1264
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.980
<v Speaker 7>I know dudes who do that rolled menthols.</v>

1265
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.600
<v Speaker 7>Oh wait,</v>

1266
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:48.560
<v Speaker 7>a black joke.</v>

1267
00:37:48.561 --> 00:37:49.394
<v Speaker 7>You fuck.</v>

1268
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.740
<v Speaker 7>How dare you?</v>

1269
00:37:51.741 --> 00:37:53.510
<v Speaker 7>He's the commander in chief.</v>

1270
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.250
<v Speaker 7>You're a man.</v>

1271
00:37:55.251 --> 00:37:56.084
<v Speaker 7>Boy.</v>

1272
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.800
<v Speaker 7>He was the commander in chief.</v>

1273
00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.360
<v Speaker 7>You son of a bitch.</v>

1274
00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.440
<v Speaker 7>What is wrong?</v>

1275
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.011
<v Speaker 7>Does he smoke?</v>

1276
00:38:01.011 --> 00:38:03.110
<v Speaker 7>Menthols cause he used to smoke.</v>

1277
00:38:03.111 --> 00:38:03.320
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1278
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.300
<v Speaker 7>I think Michelle made him quit cigarettes.</v>

1279
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.960
<v Speaker 7>When you're the goddamn president you can't smoke anymore cause it's the</v>

1280
00:38:08.961 --> 00:38:11.810
<v Speaker 7>stupidest thing people do you think he does?</v>

1281
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:12.351
<v Speaker 7>Fuck yeah,</v>

1282
00:38:12.351 --> 00:38:14.030
<v Speaker 7>he was smoking in office.</v>

1283
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.301
<v Speaker 7>His,</v>

1284
00:38:14.301 --> 00:38:17.450
<v Speaker 7>at least his first term and that job is so stressful.</v>

1285
00:38:17.451 --> 00:38:19.400
<v Speaker 7>There's no way you're quitting smoking while you're a precedent.</v>

1286
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:19.821
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1287
00:38:19.821 --> 00:38:20.511
<v Speaker 7>you could quit.</v>

1288
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:23.510
<v Speaker 7>You can quit if you really want it to seem funny to think about him having a</v>

1289
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:26.500
<v Speaker 7>window open in the Oval Office just puffing.</v>

1290
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.550
<v Speaker 7>Let me think of just the amount of stress that he's going through anyway.</v>

1291
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.230
<v Speaker 7>Your cigarettes are not going to relieve that.</v>

1292
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 7>We kind of stress you must be going through be the goddamn president mean your</v>

1293
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:37.240
<v Speaker 7>hair goes white.</v>

1294
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1295
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:42.070
<v Speaker 7>well that's why I try not to be super anti Obama because once he's gone in two</v>

1296
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 7>years it's going to be somebody else and like 98% of the shit we're complaining</v>

1297
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:46.731
<v Speaker 7>about right now,</v>

1298
00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 7>it will still exist.</v>

1299
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.980
<v Speaker 7>I quit smoking because of Michelle Sweetie,</v>

1300
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 7>six years.</v>

1301
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.560
<v Speaker 7>They do seem like a nice Kabul,</v>

1302
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.390
<v Speaker 7>like they're really do seem like they're like each other.</v>

1303
00:38:55.391 --> 00:38:55.631
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1304
00:38:55.631 --> 00:38:55.930
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1305
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.250
<v Speaker 7>People were good at bullshitting,</v>

1306
00:38:57.251 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 7>but well it conservatives attack her for uh,</v>

1307
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 7>promoting eating like healthy eating habits.</v>

1308
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:03.521
<v Speaker 7>And I'm like,</v>

1309
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.400
<v Speaker 7>of all the things of all the things for a first lady to be doing,</v>

1310
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 7>I think this is the best use of big government.</v>

1311
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.890
<v Speaker 7>Like let's encourage people to eat healthy.</v>

1312
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 7>It's much better than spying on everybody.</v>

1313
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:14.434
<v Speaker 7>I don't think we should.</v>

1314
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.350
<v Speaker 7>She grew a garden at the White House growing vegetables and shit.</v>

1316
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:17.541
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1317
00:39:17.541 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 7>Sustainability and making your own food.</v>

1318
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:20.284
<v Speaker 7>That's good stuff.</v>

1319
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.540
<v Speaker 7>I don't think anybody can be a good president.</v>

1321
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 7>I think the machine behind government is too fucking big.</v>

1322
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:29.460
<v Speaker 7>It's like what we were talking about about corporations and you know,</v>

1323
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:29.840
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1324
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.220
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1325
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.320
<v Speaker 7>the constant need for,</v>

1326
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.720
<v Speaker 7>we were actually talking about it before the podcast about the,</v>

1327
00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:35.290
<v Speaker 7>the infinite growth paradigm.</v>

1328
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 7>The Peter Joseph always talks about these corporations need to constantly keep</v>

1329
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 7>growing and that's really not possible.</v>

1330
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Speaker 7>It's really not possible.</v>

1331
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.900
<v Speaker 7>And that they,</v>

1332
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.261
<v Speaker 7>when,</v>

1333
00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:49.261
<v Speaker 7>when a corporation starts acting like that sort of money generating machine,</v>

1334
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 7>and that's the bottom line is it always has to continue to generate money no</v>

1335
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:53.050
<v Speaker 7>matter what they come up with.</v>

1336
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:54.340
<v Speaker 7>All sorts of compromises,</v>

1337
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.600
<v Speaker 7>compromise of ethics,</v>

1338
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 7>compromises of morals,</v>

1339
00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:02.160
<v Speaker 7>just so that they can figure out a way to continue to raise that bottom line,</v>

1340
00:40:02.321 --> 00:40:03.430
<v Speaker 7>keep that money coming in.</v>

1341
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.740
<v Speaker 7>And I think essentially the government at one,</v>

1342
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 7>at a certain point becomes that,</v>

1343
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's what Eisenhower warned about when he was leaving office,</v>

1344
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 7>the military industrial complex taking over.</v>

1345
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 7>And even if it's not the direct reason why something happens,</v>

1346
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.980
<v Speaker 7>even if it wasn't a financial reason why something,</v>

1347
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:21.671
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1348
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:21.971
<v Speaker 7>why,</v>

1349
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:23.650
<v Speaker 7>why there is an a military action,</v>

1350
00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:28.651
<v Speaker 7>why we go to war once we're there and the money is pouring in to these</v>

1351
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:29.740
<v Speaker 7>contractors,</v>

1352
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.250
<v Speaker 7>the money is pouring into weapons manufacturers,</v>

1353
00:40:33.251 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 7>the money is pouring in the cutting that money off and to having a</v>

1354
00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 7>justification,</v>

1355
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.880
<v Speaker 7>you're going to get resistance and they get resistance from incredibly powerful</v>

1356
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:47.881
<v Speaker 7>people with incredibly influential ties that have a lot of fucking money.</v>

1357
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 7>And that is a fact.</v>

1358
00:40:49.691 --> 00:40:50.890
<v Speaker 7>And that's unavoidable.</v>

1359
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:52.630
<v Speaker 7>And that's just mathematics,</v>

1360
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 7>human nature one oh one.</v>

1361
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 7>It's real simple.</v>

1362
00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:56.830
<v Speaker 7>We're greedy bitches.</v>

1363
00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.510
<v Speaker 7>And that's why I'm excited about digital money because I,</v>

1364
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.110
<v Speaker 7>I honestly agree with you that this structure like is not going to change.</v>

1365
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.430
<v Speaker 7>It's because of what you just said,</v>

1366
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 7>that these powerful people want their budgets to remain at least where they are</v>

1367
00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:14.410
<v Speaker 7>and probably much larger in the future because they have people on their payroll</v>

1368
00:41:14.411 --> 00:41:16.090
<v Speaker 7>and they want to keep those TSA jobs.</v>

1369
00:41:16.091 --> 00:41:19.180
<v Speaker 7>They want to keep those NSA analyst job and want to buy a weekend home.</v>

1370
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.470
<v Speaker 7>So it's all,</v>

1371
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.980
<v Speaker 7>I think it's like 80% about money and uh,</v>

1372
00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 7>all this shit is funded because the government is printing it's own money and</v>

1373
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 7>then that's what we use as currency.</v>

1374
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 7>And I really don't think that so that if the issue is structural and not</v>

1375
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.671
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

1376
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:35.061
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

1377
00:41:35.061 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 3>like Obama's not responsible for all the problems in this country because a lot</v>

1378
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 3>of this shit started in a bush.</v>

1379
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it started under Clinton.</v>

1380
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.380
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it started under Reagan.</v>

1381
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it started 30 years ago.</v>

1382
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.713
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1383
00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1384
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 3>if it's not personality driven,</v>

1385
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:48.380
<v Speaker 3>the problem and it's just structured,</v>

1386
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 3>driven,</v>

1387
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 3>the only way you'll see change is to change the structure itself.</v>

1388
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:57.610
<v Speaker 3>And as new people come into government that that same structure is going to keep</v>

1389
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.720
<v Speaker 3>it staying the same form.</v>

1390
00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:01.490
<v Speaker 3>It's going to destroy them as well because,</v>

1391
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1392
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 3>who did I,</v>

1393
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:03.741
<v Speaker 3>they get sucked into it.</v>

1394
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Like the wolf of Wall Street guy.</v>

1395
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1396
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 3>We'll just become a part of it.</v>

1397
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Even if you become a congressman,</v>

1398
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 3>like you're not getting on the important committees,</v>

1399
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.070
<v Speaker 3>you're just sitting in the back and you have one vote out of like 450 fucking</v>

1400
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:13.430
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1401
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 3>So you get on TV and you get to have a moral voice.</v>

1402
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 3>But in terms of changing the direction the government goes,</v>

1403
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 3>you don't have much say and how many people in Congress are actually like legit</v>

1404
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:25.130
<v Speaker 3>young people that we can relate to?</v>

1405
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I can name two and then there's Ron Wyden who's older but still to me seems like</v>

1406
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 3>he's an honest guy.</v>

1407
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 3>So I can think of three people between the Congress and Senate who I would trust</v>

1408
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 3>to actually represent,</v>

1409
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1410
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.300
<v Speaker 3>like everyday people's interests.</v>

1411
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it's even necessary to have a government that established and</v>

1412
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 3>set up the way we have it today with representatives when there's the,</v>

1413
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.530
<v Speaker 3>the access to communication is so instantaneous.</v>

1414
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like the whole idea of having a senator or having a congress from having a</v>

1415
00:42:53.121 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 3>representative is like,</v>

1416
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:59.410
<v Speaker 3>there was no way for the people to just go and individually talk and give their</v>

1417
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:00.680
<v Speaker 3>opinions on things.</v>

1418
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 3>There was no way.</v>

1419
00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:03.140
<v Speaker 3>There's too many fucking people.</v>

1420
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1421
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 3>and they're too far apart from each other.</v>

1422
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 3>It would take,</v>

1423
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:06.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1424
00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:07.690
<v Speaker 3>when the country was established,</v>

1425
00:43:07.691 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 3>you got to literally ride an animal across the country.</v>

1426
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1427
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the dumbest fucking idea.</v>

1428
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if today everyone outlawed cars?</v>

1429
00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:15.950
<v Speaker 3>We ought to ride horses.</v>

1430
00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:16.240
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

1431
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:16.740
<v Speaker 3>how would,</v>

1432
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.690
<v Speaker 3>and there was no more internet.</v>

1433
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.390
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck would you ever pass a law?</v>

1434
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 3>How the,</v>

1435
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.651
<v Speaker 3>how would you ever,</v>

1436
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:21.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1437
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 3>state laws,</v>

1438
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 3>how would you ever deal with the federal government's influence on it would be</v>

1439
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:28.520
<v Speaker 3>so baffling.</v>

1440
00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 3>But I think the founding fathers,</v>

1441
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1442
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.600
<v Speaker 3>we always assumed that I representative democracy was put in a place because of</v>

1443
00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:37.940
<v Speaker 3>the technical limitations that is just like you just said,</v>

1444
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to get everybody to d DC to tally up where their votes would</v>

1445
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:41.810
<v Speaker 3>lie.</v>

1446
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.000
<v Speaker 3>So instead we use representatives and we send them,</v>

1447
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1448
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.650
<v Speaker 3>And we assume that that's the only reason why they chose this structure.</v>

1449
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.551
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think it is,</v>

1450
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I think part of it is that they were terrified of dumb people.</v>

1451
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 3>They were actually worried about mob rule because they'd seen that happen in</v>

1452
00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:55.844
<v Speaker 3>other governments.</v>

1453
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.990
<v Speaker 3>And you see it happened today,</v>

1454
00:43:56.991 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 3>like Reddit,</v>

1455
00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.880
<v Speaker 3>95% of the time is on top of it's shit and is a great source of information.</v>

1456
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.730
<v Speaker 3>What about the 5% of the time where they,</v>

1457
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.610
<v Speaker 3>they find the wrong fucking suspect for the Boston bombing and that shit goes to</v>

1458
00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 3>the front page and some guy's life is ruined for the next six months or possibly</v>

1459
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:11.571
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

1460
00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:11.721
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1461
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:14.030
<v Speaker 3>he's never going to able to get a job because you Google that name.</v>

1462
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.640
<v Speaker 3>First thing you see is Boston bombing suspect.</v>

1463
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Even if he's cleared,</v>

1464
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to hire that person.</v>

1465
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:24.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's a case where like the crowd mind fucks up and if we give everybody</v>

1466
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.870
<v Speaker 3>instant access to that to real say in government,</v>

1467
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.360
<v Speaker 3>first of all I think it's a good idea cause I think overall,</v>

1468
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1469
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 3>like the good wins out over the bullshit.</v>

1470
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 7>But I'm just trying to give an example of I think why they chose that.</v>

1471
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 7>A representative system.</v>

1472
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 7>I think you're probably right.</v>

1473
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 7>I think that's definitely a valid point is that there are dumb people and they</v>

1474
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:45.410
<v Speaker 7>can gather together and it gets fucking terrifying when you're just dealing with</v>

1475
00:44:45.411 --> 00:44:46.410
<v Speaker 7>the one person,</v>

1476
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:47.244
<v Speaker 7>one vote.</v>

1477
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.330
<v Speaker 7>Sort of a paradigm.</v>

1478
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1479
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1480
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 7>did you see what's going on in reddit where people are being outed as a being</v>

1481
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:58.230
<v Speaker 7>paid posters and paid shills to post in these conspiracy theories sites?</v>

1482
00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.161
<v Speaker 7>I didn't see that.</v>

1483
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 7>What I saw recently is that the technology subreddit,</v>

1484
00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 7>which is one of the most popular,</v>

1485
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.890
<v Speaker 7>is using a bot to automatically filter out posts.</v>

1486
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 7>And somebody did research and posted the keywords that this Bot is filtering and</v>

1487
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 7>it's like serious thought control.</v>

1488
00:45:13.831 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 7>Like you're not allowed to publish a headline that has the word Tesla in it.</v>

1489
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:16.961
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1490
00:45:16.961 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 7>like the electric car company not allowed to have the word bitcoin not allowed</v>

1491
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:21.660
<v Speaker 7>to have the word.</v>

1492
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:21.790
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1493
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:22.680
<v Speaker 7>NSA,</v>

1494
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 7>Keith Alexander,</v>

1495
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:25.880
<v Speaker 7>you got to look this thing up like it's,</v>

1496
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:26.641
<v Speaker 7>wait a minute,</v>

1497
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 7>that's crazy.</v>

1498
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:28.580
<v Speaker 7>This is read it.</v>

1499
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 7>This is the technology subright it's this big controversy now because people are</v>

1500
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:32.310
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1501
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 7>well this is fucking retarded.</v>

1502
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 7>How could they stop that?</v>

1503
00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:36.390
<v Speaker 7>Are they trying to prevent advertising?</v>

1504
00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:37.410
<v Speaker 7>Like what are they trying to do?</v>

1505
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 7>I think the original intent was to not have the whole page filled with like</v>

1506
00:45:42.481 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 7>basically the same story.</v>

1507
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 7>I think if there's a big NSA revelation,</v>

1508
00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 7>you have 10 articles and it's all the same content,</v>

1509
00:45:48.301 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 7>but just like different people saying the same thing.</v>

1510
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 7>I think that was the original template.</v>

1511
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 7>It's also like why don't you let read it?</v>

1512
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:56.071
<v Speaker 7>Do read it.</v>

1513
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 7>Like the whole point is a good content gets upvoted.</v>

1514
00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.820
<v Speaker 7>If people aren't interested,</v>

1515
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 7>they'll get rid of it on their own.</v>

1516
00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 7>So you don't have,</v>

1517
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 7>it really strikes me.</v>

1518
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:03.151
<v Speaker 7>Is that Brian,</v>

1519
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:03.984
<v Speaker 7>what do you got there?</v>

1520
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.120
<v Speaker 7>Just showing why shown desk quads read it.</v>

1521
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:06.610
<v Speaker 7>I want to know who,</v>

1522
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.200
<v Speaker 7>see what he's talking about it and knowing what the technology subreddit type in</v>

1523
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.030
<v Speaker 7>type in reddit and daily dot.</v>

1524
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.200
<v Speaker 7>And the article should come up.</v>

1525
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.123
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1526
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.093
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

1527
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:17.461
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

1528
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:18.294
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1529
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 7>but it's troubling because I use very try use that as a major source of news and</v>

1530
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure a lot of people do now.</v>

1531
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.150
<v Speaker 7>The is,</v>

1532
00:46:25.151 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 7>is Tesla such a popular subject that they had to do that.</v>

1533
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.971
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1534
00:46:29.971 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 7>how many different articles are written about Tesla is that they had to use that</v>

1535
00:46:33.781 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 7>word.</v>

1536
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:34.800
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1537
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.380
<v Speaker 7>the other issue is like if that's the people are interested in this week,</v>

1538
00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:38.850
<v Speaker 7>why don't you let that rise to the top?</v>

1539
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:42.090
<v Speaker 7>Like who the fuck are you to create this false structure?</v>

1540
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 7>Like you're not allowed to talk about the NSA.</v>

1541
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:46.410
<v Speaker 7>Well that affects every facet of people's technology right now.</v>

1542
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.251
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

1543
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:47.581
<v Speaker 7>like it's,</v>

1544
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 7>it's huge.</v>

1545
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.470
<v Speaker 7>That's insane mood.</v>

1546
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.210
<v Speaker 7>If some new news comes out,</v>

1547
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.510
<v Speaker 7>it has to do with the Teslin NSA and you can't,</v>

1548
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 7>you literally can't make the post.</v>

1549
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.080
<v Speaker 7>I want people to see this article.</v>

1550
00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:00.870
<v Speaker 7>So they just know that I'm not like making it up,</v>

1551
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 7>but to call,</v>

1552
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 7>they give me the title of what it is.</v>

1553
00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1554
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.550
<v Speaker 7>it was an article in the daily dot.</v>

1555
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.820
<v Speaker 7>And it was like reddit technology subreddit something.</v>

1556
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:12.220
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1557
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.370
<v Speaker 7>I'm just googling daily.</v>

1558

<v Speaker 7>Dot.</v>

1559

<v Speaker 7>Red.</v>

1560
00:47:15.051 --> 00:47:18.800
<v Speaker 7>It's mods or censoring dozens of words from our technology.</v>

1561
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:19.330
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

1562
00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:19.691
<v Speaker 7>that's the,</v>

1563
00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:20.040
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1564
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 7>say what you want about Reddit's technology.</v>

1565
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:22.561
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1566
00:47:22.561 --> 00:47:25.110
<v Speaker 7>one of the popular forums,</v>

1567
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:25.430
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

1568
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.571
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

1569
00:47:25.571 --> 00:47:25.870
<v Speaker 7>blah.</v>

1570
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.150
<v Speaker 7>One of its most popular forums.</v>

1571
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 7>Just don't say Nsa net neutrality,</v>

1572
00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:31.330
<v Speaker 7>Comcast,</v>

1573
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.261
<v Speaker 7>bitcoin,</v>

1574
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:37.261
<v Speaker 7>or any of the roughly 50 other words that will secretly get your post deleted.</v>

1575
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>

1576
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 7>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1577
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 7>There's a bot in our slash technology ready to delete any so called</v>

1578
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.630
<v Speaker 7>controversial headline.</v>

1579
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 7>You try to submit.</v>

1580
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 7>That's unbelievable.</v>

1581
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 7>A headline about net neutrality gets deleted.</v>

1582
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 7>That's insane.</v>

1583
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:54.581
<v Speaker 7>And July read it.</v>

1584
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.001
<v Speaker 7>Dropped too.</v>

1585
00:47:55.001 --> 00:48:00.001
<v Speaker 7>Controversial subreddits are atheism and our politics from being automatic</v>

1586
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 7>automatic subscriptions for new users to see that.</v>

1587
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 7>So it kind of Orwellian too.</v>

1588
00:48:04.901 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1589
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 7>why is politics controversial?</v>

1590
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.900
<v Speaker 7>That's a big part of why people visit sites like Reddit is to see what's</v>

1591
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 7>happening in the political world.</v>

1592
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:13.541
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1593
00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:14.020
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1594
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.130
<v Speaker 7>you just had Alexis on,</v>

1595
00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:15.964
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1596
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1597
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.210
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you could email him and try to get him to fix technology.</v>

1598
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:19.991
<v Speaker 7>Maybe I could.</v>

1599
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:20.531
<v Speaker 7>I will try,</v>

1600
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:23.530
<v Speaker 7>but I don't think he's involved in the day to day anymore.</v>

1601
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 7>What I understand this is not like Reddit's staff doing this since these mods</v>

1602
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:28.180
<v Speaker 7>who are volunteers.</v>

1603
00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:29.350
<v Speaker 7>And once you become a mod,</v>

1604
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 7>it's very hard to get rid of you.</v>

1605
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 7>And there's like no accountability.</v>

1606
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:32.351
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1607
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:33.820
<v Speaker 7>we don't know who these fucking people are.</v>

1608
00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:35.500
<v Speaker 7>All we know is the actions they take.</v>

1609
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:36.190
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1610
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.761
<v Speaker 7>We don't like,</v>

1611
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:37.121
<v Speaker 7>honestly,</v>

1612
00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:41.260
<v Speaker 7>like how do we know that a technology mod is not some shill for the fossil fuel</v>

1613
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:43.600
<v Speaker 7>industry who just doesn't want to see Tesla rise to the top?</v>

1614
00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:44.434
<v Speaker 7>We don't know that.</v>

1615
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:45.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1616
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:45.701
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1617
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:46.300
<v Speaker 7>I'm uh,</v>

1618
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 7>emailing him right now to ask him what the hell this is.</v>

1619
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:49.841
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1620
00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1621
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1622
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.040
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense why they would do that.</v>

1623
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:54.221
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1624
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 7>why would you have knit net neutrality?</v>

1625
00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:57.791
<v Speaker 7>What are you doing,</v>

1626
00:48:57.791 --> 00:48:58.410
<v Speaker 7>dude?</v>

1627
00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.390
<v Speaker 7>It's going to have to type all the keywords into it post and try to make a</v>

1628
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:02.350
<v Speaker 7>thread and see what happens.</v>

1629
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.010
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1630
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:03.461
<v Speaker 7>can you like,</v>

1631
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:05.330
<v Speaker 7>can you buy a new Tesla with bitcoin?</v>

1632
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:06.693
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1633
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.970
<v Speaker 9>With the coins tower seven</v>

1634
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.373
<v Speaker 7>tower stuff.</v>

1635
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:21.420
<v Speaker 7>That's how you make sure that your conversation is always logged by the NSA.</v>

1636
00:49:21.421 --> 00:49:23.040
<v Speaker 7>Just close it with tower seven.</v>

1637
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:25.763
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1638
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.061

1639
00:49:27.061 --> 00:49:27.894
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1640
00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 7>People love that one tower staff.</v>

1641
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:30.160
<v Speaker 7>It's a juicy one.</v>

1642
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.940
<v Speaker 7>Any conspiracy theorists that doesn't have an opinion about tower seven,</v>

1643
00:49:32.941 --> 00:49:34.050
<v Speaker 7>it's not worth his salt.</v>

1644
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.030
<v Speaker 7>You got to have an opinion.</v>

1645
00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.021
<v Speaker 7>But Eddie Bravo.</v>

1646
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:40.680
<v Speaker 7>We'll fucking hold you down until you tell him that that tower seven was a</v>

1647
00:49:40.681 --> 00:49:42.960
<v Speaker 7>demolition and we'll fucking hold you down.</v>

1648

1650
00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:45.391
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1651
00:49:45.391 --> 00:49:46.680
<v Speaker 7>You would if you had to guess.</v>

1652
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:47.641
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1653
00:49:47.641 --> 00:49:48.950
<v Speaker 7>But if your life depended on it,</v>

1654
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:49.890
<v Speaker 7>does it?</v>

1655
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:50.723
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1656
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.110
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1660
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:56.483
<v Speaker 7>Did it work?</v>

1661
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.593
<v Speaker 7>It seems like it worked.</v>

1662
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 7>It went up.</v>

1663
00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:58.771
<v Speaker 7>We'll see.</v>

1671
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.160

1672
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.080
<v Speaker 7>It said you're already submitted it.</v>

1673
00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:11.670
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it's already been submitted.</v>

1674
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:12.960
<v Speaker 7>What did you double summit?</v>

1675
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.201
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1676
00:50:13.201 --> 00:50:14.300
<v Speaker 7>I just put it in cause they ask,</v>

1677
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:14.581
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1678

<v Speaker 7>you have to put a link down so I didn't know what to link it to.</v>

1679
00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:18.350
<v Speaker 7>I'll put it link to your website and see what,</v>

1680
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.770
<v Speaker 7>don't do that again.</v>

1681
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.650
<v Speaker 7>Trouble look into your own websites.</v>

1682
00:50:22.651 --> 00:50:24.690
<v Speaker 7>Do or are you looking at Lincoln,</v>

1683

1684
00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.360
<v Speaker 3>and not doing it anymore.</v>

1685
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would email and Alexis or onion and get to the bar.</v>

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 3>He was cool.</v>

1687
00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1688
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Interesting story.</v>

1689
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.123
<v Speaker 3>Cool Dude.</v>

1690
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because he's um,</v>

1691
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to have guys like that who are willing to speak out for</v>

1692
00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 3>things that are really important instead of just taking the money and being</v>

1693
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:44.691
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1694
00:50:44.691 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to go fuck hot models and live on,</v>

1695
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1696
00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:52.930
<v Speaker 3>like he definitely doesn't have to be the one telling us about SISPA and soap</v>

1697
00:50:52.931 --> 00:50:55.550
<v Speaker 3>and all this stuff and fight for the future.</v>

1698
00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:56.630
<v Speaker 3>I think that's his organization.</v>

1699
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:01.170
<v Speaker 3>He's a young idealist who's really smart and he figured out a way to make a</v>

1700
00:51:01.171 --> 00:51:02.090
<v Speaker 3>shitload of money,</v>

1701
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:03.920
<v Speaker 3>came up with a cool thing and you know,</v>

1702
00:51:03.921 --> 00:51:07.220
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of continuing along that same trajectory.</v>

1703
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.761
<v Speaker 3>And people,</v>

1704
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:09.350
<v Speaker 3>people like me definitely noticed that.</v>

1705
00:51:09.351 --> 00:51:09.891
<v Speaker 3>Like if he,</v>

1706
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure in 10 years he's going to be doing even bigger stuff.</v>

1707
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:17.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think will respect the fact that he spoke out when a lot of cowards that</v>

1708
00:51:17.871 --> 00:51:18.704
<v Speaker 3>companies like,</v>

1709
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1710
00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to alienate myself with companies like big tech companies.</v>

1711
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 3>They're are not saying shit and we know this is wrong,</v>

1712
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:24.980
<v Speaker 3>so why don't you say something?</v>

1713
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.631
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

1714
00:51:25.631 --> 00:51:29.110
<v Speaker 5>and we find out that they cooperated with the NSA and gave him back doors to</v>

1715
00:51:29.111 --> 00:51:31.150
<v Speaker 5>technology and software and it's,</v>

1716
00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:31.691
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

1717
00:51:31.691 --> 00:51:33.760
<v Speaker 5>very frustrating because you want to think about,</v>

1718
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:38.650
<v Speaker 5>I think that one of the unique aspects of technology is the morality that sort</v>

1719
00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:41.410
<v Speaker 5>of inherently goes with superintelligent people.</v>

1720
00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:45.400
<v Speaker 5>That there's so much goddamn money in technology that people,</v>

1721
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:45.790
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1722
00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:45.941
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1723
00:51:45.941 --> 00:51:46.121
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1724
00:51:46.121 --> 00:51:46.301
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1725
00:51:46.301 --> 00:51:46.451
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1726
00:51:46.451 --> 00:51:46.691
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1727
00:51:46.691 --> 00:51:48.400
<v Speaker 5>let's not be as greedy.</v>

1728
00:51:48.401 --> 00:51:49.510
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to be as greedy.</v>

1729
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.310
<v Speaker 5>We make so much goddamn money.</v>

1730
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.080
<v Speaker 5>But think about how much money Google makes.</v>

1731
00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:54.250
<v Speaker 5>What's their motto?</v>

1732
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.390
<v Speaker 5>Don't be evil.</v>

1733
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:56.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

1734
00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:01.500
<v Speaker 5>that's like a really good model for a giant multibillion dollar corporation and</v>

1735
00:52:02.201 --> 00:52:04.900
<v Speaker 5>that's not something that existed anywhere else.</v>

1736
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Like it didn't exist with clothing.</v>

1737
00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.780
<v Speaker 5>It didn't exist with giant corporations that were involved in natural resources.</v>

1738
00:52:10.781 --> 00:52:12.010
<v Speaker 5>You never hear that.</v>

1739
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:16.420
<v Speaker 5>You never hear that kind of a model motto attached to a gas company.</v>

1740
00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.350
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

1741
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.390
<v Speaker 5>gas companies make more money than anybody.</v>

1742
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:22.090
<v Speaker 5>This new technology and the new,</v>

1743
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.120
<v Speaker 5>the new money that's coming out of technology is generated by intensely creative</v>

1744
00:52:28.121 --> 00:52:32.110
<v Speaker 5>and intelligent people and I think what we're seeing from those people as</v>

1745
00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:36.490
<v Speaker 5>opposed to just money grubbers people that tried to like something that's not as</v>

1746
00:52:36.491 --> 00:52:41.491
<v Speaker 5>complex as technology sort of doesn't have the same thought process behind it.</v>

1747
00:52:42.881 --> 00:52:43.360
<v Speaker 5>There's not,</v>

1748
00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.360
<v Speaker 5>there's not as much introspective thinking,</v>

1749
00:52:46.361 --> 00:52:49.120
<v Speaker 5>there's not as much ethical calculations.</v>

1750
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:54.070
<v Speaker 5>It's a different way of looking at the world that I think is being presented by</v>

1751
00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:59.071
<v Speaker 5>tech companies that in my opinion is it's very promising because I think it</v>

1752
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:01.600
<v Speaker 5>gives you a lot of hope for the future.</v>

1753
00:53:01.601 --> 00:53:05.800
<v Speaker 5>When you see like this is a trend is a very obvious trend in my opinion,</v>

1754
00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:06.730
<v Speaker 5>that these,</v>

1755
00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:10.450
<v Speaker 5>these guys are more ethical and more moral and more conscious.</v>

1756
00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.800
<v Speaker 5>It's more globally conscious.</v>

1757
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:13.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a more optimistic view of the world.</v>

1758
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:18.820
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you're a recent person entering the workforce for the first time</v>

1759
00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 3>and you're looking at jobs online,</v>

1760
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:25.290
<v Speaker 3>really hold out and don't go for the shitty defense contractor that you know is</v>

1761
00:53:25.291 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 3>doing evil stuff.</v>

1762
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Go instead for the company that is creating cool apps or you know,</v>

1763
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.390
<v Speaker 2>creating new efficiencies and payments or whatever it is that you're interested</v>

1764
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1765
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Do that instead because technology,</v>

1766
00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:37.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1767
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.730
<v Speaker 2>can go on so many different directions.</v>

1768
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be the person creating the marketing for the next like fucking</v>

1769
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 2>range of drones.</v>

1770
00:53:42.661 --> 00:53:44.880
<v Speaker 2>You want to be the person working at Google or uh,</v>

1771
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.680
<v Speaker 2>or even Microsoft and just creating better search because even things like that</v>

1772
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:54.090
<v Speaker 2>create more of a positive impact on humanity than I think almost anything else.</v>

1773
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the rest of the world is slowly but surely forcing America to</v>

1774
00:53:59.161 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 2>catch the fuck up on a lot of our archaic shit like Canada,</v>

1775
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Canada just released all limitations on prostitution.</v>

1776
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.251
<v Speaker 2>They just said,</v>

1777
00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:09.084
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

1778
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

1779
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Is that like the Rob Ford Act of 2014 you know,</v>

1780
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:13.734
<v Speaker 2>that's crap.</v>

1781
00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 2>The cracks now,</v>

1782
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:17.550
<v Speaker 2>legal American smoke at an office and still stay there.</v>

1783
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.810
<v Speaker 2>He's a phenomenal being.</v>

1784
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I was watching some of his fat guy that does blow.</v>

1785
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:22.830
<v Speaker 2>What's phenomenal about that?</v>

1786
00:54:22.831 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 2>And he became mayor of Toronto.</v>

1787
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1788
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.070
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1789
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:26.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1790
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:28.110
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that he's still mayor.</v>

1791
00:54:28.111 --> 00:54:28.771
<v Speaker 2>That's don't,</v>

1792
00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:32.580
<v Speaker 2>don't you have to do debates or something like they don't realize that he's</v>

1793
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.020
<v Speaker 2>crazy right away.</v>

1794
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:34.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1795
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:35.730
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck that Bush get in office?</v>

1796
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.211
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1797
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 2>People like people that are like them.</v>

1798
00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:40.320
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fat coke heads out there in Toronto,</v>

1799
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1800
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.310
<v Speaker 2>So they're there,</v>

1801
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.001
<v Speaker 2>but there's not,</v>

1802
00:54:42.001 --> 00:54:42.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1803
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Toronto's an amazing spot.</v>

1804
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:44.910
<v Speaker 2>It's really powerful.</v>

1805
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:45.511
<v Speaker 2>A financial,</v>

1806
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't that up to get us pulled down from youtube.</v>

1807
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Every time we put a youtube clip up these days,</v>

1808
00:54:50.581 --> 00:54:51.780
<v Speaker 2>we're getting fucking pulled down.</v>

1809
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:53.430
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing that's cool about the,</v>

1810
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:53.641
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1811
00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 2>the tech world is that they're very,</v>

1812
00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:56.124
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1813
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.140
<v Speaker 2>they hold nothing sacred.</v>

1814
00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 2>So in the 90s,</v>

1815
00:54:59.611 --> 00:54:59.821
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1816
00:54:59.821 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna reinvent communication.</v>

1817
00:55:01.411 --> 00:55:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And they did that with email and instant messenger and then all the more</v>

1818
00:55:05.401 --> 00:55:09.270
<v Speaker 2>advanced shit that came after like social media and now they've turned their</v>

1819
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:10.560
<v Speaker 2>eyes to money and they're like,</v>

1820
00:55:10.561 --> 00:55:11.430
<v Speaker 2>we're going to reinvent money,</v>

1821
00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 2>were no longer happy with a massaging the balls of these credit card companies</v>

1822
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.340
<v Speaker 2>and getting a small fee in return.</v>

1823
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 2>We want to own the whole process from start to finish.</v>

1824
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And we want it to be faster.</v>

1825
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.470
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to get clearance from credit card companies before we change our</v>

1826
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:28.800
<v Speaker 2>marketing or our design and we just wouldn't have total freedom.</v>

1827
00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:29.041
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1828
00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:29.880
<v Speaker 2>it's the same with like,</v>

1829
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1830
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 2>with what Google does,</v>

1831
00:55:32.341 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 2>they don't really ask for permission before indexing your site.</v>

1832
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.640
<v Speaker 2>They just do it right.</v>

1833
00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:39.390
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a really positive force in the world.</v>

1834
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Like a who is,</v>

1835
00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.140
<v Speaker 2>it says like do it and then ask permission later.</v>

1836
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Like obviously that um,</v>

1837
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.850
<v Speaker 2>it's some like business guru,</v>

1838
00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:49.140
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was,</v>

1839
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:51.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's either like Branson or somebody like that.</v>

1840
00:55:51.751 --> 00:55:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I just read it recently.</v>

1841
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.053
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1842
00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.030
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's a great mindset and it's so much better than the government</v>

1843
00:55:57.031 --> 00:55:59.700
<v Speaker 2>mindset of are you following all the regulations?</v>

1844
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Like it was never supposed to be the American way that the first thing you think</v>

1845
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 2>about is what is the government going to think.</v>

1846
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.880
<v Speaker 2>It's better to ask for forgiveness or beg for forgiveness than to ask for</v>

1847
00:56:08.881 --> 00:56:09.714
<v Speaker 2>permission.</v>

1848
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.673
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1849
00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1850
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's all well and good except for environmental concerns.</v>

1851
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:15.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1852
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1853
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I totally,</v>

1854
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.850
<v Speaker 2>the real issue is,</v>

1855
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1856
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:22.530
<v Speaker 2>when people do things and they don't ask and then you deal with the cleanup.</v>

1857
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:23.461
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1858
00:56:23.461 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>we agree</v>

1859
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 6>as a society to play this game where the individual can be enriched if you're</v>

1860
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 6>smart.</v>

1861
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 6>And that game is capitalism and we continue to play it because it's more</v>

1862
00:56:30.911 --> 00:56:32.110
<v Speaker 6>efficient than anything else.</v>

1863
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.530
<v Speaker 6>But I think you do need to have referees who say,</v>

1864
00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:35.831
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1865
00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 6>so we're playing this game where you can make a lot of money if you do something</v>

1866
00:56:38.531 --> 00:56:39.970
<v Speaker 6>that's more efficient than anybody else.</v>

1867
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 6>So you do it cooler,</v>

1868
00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 6>you do it faster.</v>

1869
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 6>But if you're fucking up a shared resource,</v>

1870
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 6>then that's what the government steps in and tells you,</v>

1871
00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 6>you can't do this and you have to pay this and you have to fix this because,</v>

1872
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.453
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1873
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.910
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1874
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:53.920
<v Speaker 6>the environment is not owned by corporations.</v>

1875
00:56:53.921 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 6>It's actually owned by citizens of the United States and it's owned by citizens</v>

1876
00:56:56.861 --> 00:56:57.530
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

1877
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 6>of a whatever country you happen to be in,</v>

1878
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:00.670
<v Speaker 6>like your land is your land.</v>

1879
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 6>And we all have the shared air.</v>

1880
00:57:02.801 --> 00:57:03.940
<v Speaker 6>We all have shared oceans.</v>

1881
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 6>Like what happens in Japan with their fucked up nuclear reactors affects the</v>

1882
00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 6>Sushi here in Los Angeles,</v>

1883
00:57:08.921 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 6>at least in theory.</v>

1884
00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 6>So we have to have a more global mindset.</v>

1885
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:13.750
<v Speaker 6>I know net right now just by saying global mindset,</v>

1886
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.570
<v Speaker 6>they're at least 10 people saying that I'm like a Bilderberg,</v>

1887
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 6>a one world order shill or something,</v>

1888
00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 6>but really like it's fucking stupid to not go more global when everything</v>

1889
00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:23.674
<v Speaker 6>already is.</v>

1890
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:25.720
<v Speaker 6>It's like right now we're already global society,</v>

1891
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 6>but we allow corporations to take advantage of the loopholes and pretend like</v>

1892
00:57:29.351 --> 00:57:30.220
<v Speaker 6>we're not global.</v>

1893
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 6>Why don't we get rid of that?</v>

1894
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:32.471
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1895
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:32.771
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1896
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:37.771
<v Speaker 5>I think that if the Internet continues its path right now,</v>

1897
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:42.420
<v Speaker 5>the path that we're on right now of the distribution of information,</v>

1898
00:57:42.421 --> 00:57:43.960
<v Speaker 5>of connecting everybody together,</v>

1899
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.650
<v Speaker 5>it's going to see more and more ridiculous that there's nations.</v>

1900
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:51.220
<v Speaker 5>It's going to see more and more ridiculous that there's places that are lines in</v>

1901
00:57:51.221 --> 00:57:52.660
<v Speaker 5>the dirt that you can't cross through.</v>

1902
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:53.231
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1903
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:54.070
<v Speaker 5>it's just weird.</v>

1904
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.000
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

1905
00:57:55.001 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird concept.</v>

1906
00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:56.891
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

1907
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:59.140
<v Speaker 5>If there was fences over each state,</v>

1908
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 5>that would be intolerable.</v>

1909
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1910
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.790
<v Speaker 5>But that's not much different than fences over countries.</v>

1911
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:07.720
<v Speaker 5>We just decide that it's different and I think that as we connect with each</v>

1912
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 5>other more and more in the idea of nations become more and more ridiculous,</v>

1913
00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 5>then the ideas of,</v>

1914
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.910
<v Speaker 5>oh like this place owns the resources.</v>

1915
00:58:15.911 --> 00:58:16.960
<v Speaker 5>Like if Ohio,</v>

1916
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Speaker 5>we had all pay Ohio because that's where all the water came from.</v>

1917
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:20.974
<v Speaker 5>But like what?</v>

1918
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 5>Like [inaudible] just cause you're in the right patch of dirt,</v>

1919
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 5>you don't want the water from Ohio.</v>

1920
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.700
<v Speaker 5>He probably gets Badwater herpes water.</v>

1921
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.513
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1922
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:31.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1923
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:32.350
<v Speaker 5>You've done tests.</v>

1924
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.713
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1925
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1926
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.190
<v Speaker 5>I think that what we're,</v>

1927
00:58:36.191 --> 00:58:38.170
<v Speaker 5>we're saying makes sense.</v>

1928
00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.560
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately like from an objective standpoint,</v>

1929
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.830
<v Speaker 5>it's just that the system that's in place is not an objective system.</v>

1930
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 5>It's not a rational system.</v>

1931
00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 5>It's a system that runs on momentum.</v>

1932
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:52.680
<v Speaker 6>Well that that's again why the digital money thing I think is the first step and</v>

1933
00:58:52.681 --> 00:58:56.460
<v Speaker 6>actually changing this system because the structure will stay the same.</v>

1934
00:58:56.461 --> 00:58:59.070
<v Speaker 6>If we continue to do all the same stuff 100 years from now,</v>

1935
00:58:59.071 --> 00:59:03.470
<v Speaker 6>we'll still have countries and passports and drones and all the rest of this</v>

1936
00:59:03.471 --> 00:59:03.691
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

1937
00:59:03.691 --> 00:59:07.350
<v Speaker 6>The only way is to like rethink really fundamental parts of what we're doing.</v>

1938
00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:09.170
<v Speaker 6>And if we do that it,</v>

1939
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:13.170
<v Speaker 6>it just changes where the money comes from and it reallocates it to better</v>

1940
00:59:13.171 --> 00:59:13.561
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1941
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:17.940
<v Speaker 6>I think that individuals are better deciders of how to spend money then a</v>

1942
00:59:17.941 --> 00:59:18.840
<v Speaker 6>government agency.</v>

1943
00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:19.711
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1944
00:59:19.711 --> 00:59:20.544
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>

1945
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:20.990
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1946
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.520
<v Speaker 5>I think the government agencies,</v>

1947
00:59:22.521 --> 00:59:25.850
<v Speaker 5>the problem with them is that it's just a bunch of people,</v>

1948
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1949
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:26.451
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1950
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:28.940
<v Speaker 5>the prop calling something to government then giving it power.</v>

1951
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 5>You just giving power to people over people and there are certain point time</v>

1952
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 5>people need kind of figure out what they want to give other people power over.</v>

1953
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.031
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1954
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 5>do you want to give people power over your sex life?</v>

1955
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to give people power over your diet?</v>

1956
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 5>When New York comes along and says,</v>

1957
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 5>you can't have big gulps anymore,</v>

1958
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 5>and everybody just goes,</v>

1959
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:47.721
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1960
00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:48.171
<v Speaker 5>well hey,</v>

1961
00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:49.010
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

1962
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.761
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1963
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 5>you can't tell me what kind of soda I can drink dummy.</v>

1964
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:55.820
<v Speaker 5>If I want to drink a 35 ounce soda or whatever the hell it is.</v>

1965
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 5>Why do you care?</v>

1966
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:58.550
<v Speaker 5>I buy a 30 ounce soda.</v>

1967
00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 5>How about I go to the store and I get a one leader?</v>

1968
01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.130
<v Speaker 5>I get a big giant one liter bottle and I drank it.</v>

1969
01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:04.964
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

1970
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.090
<v Speaker 5>You can't tell me what to eat or what to drink.</v>

1971
01:00:07.091 --> 01:00:07.420
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

1972
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 5>what kind of nonsense is that?</v>

1973
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:10.010
<v Speaker 5>Have you covered all the bases?</v>

1974
01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:12.050
<v Speaker 5>If you solved all the burglaries,</v>

1975
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 5>have you solved all the rape cases?</v>

1976
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:14.241
<v Speaker 5>If it didn't,</v>

1977
01:00:14.241 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 5>then shut the fuck up and leave the soda alone.</v>

1978
01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:16.950
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1979
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:19.810
<v Speaker 6>that's my issue with the whole healthcare.gov thing too,</v>

1980
01:00:19.811 --> 01:00:20.380
<v Speaker 6>is like,</v>

1981
01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:20.741
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1982
01:00:20.741 --> 01:00:21.760
<v Speaker 6>so if it's so good,</v>

1983
01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:24.820
<v Speaker 6>people should want to sign up for it and you should incentivize them.</v>

1984
01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.070
<v Speaker 6>You should advertise it as you're doing,</v>

1985
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:29.500
<v Speaker 6>but you shouldn't make it a requirement in the,</v>

1986
01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:30.041
<v Speaker 6>it shouldn't be like,</v>

1987
01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:32.080
<v Speaker 6>we're going to find the shit out of you if you don't sign up.</v>

1988
01:00:32.081 --> 01:00:32.920
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>

1989
01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:34.660
<v Speaker 6>every year the fine gets bigger.</v>

1990
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.100
<v Speaker 6>That's like some kind of harassment,</v>

1991
01:00:36.101 --> 01:00:37.030
<v Speaker 6>psychological shit,</v>

1992
01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:37.181
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1993
01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:38.440
<v Speaker 6>Like 1% this year,</v>

1994
01:00:38.441 --> 01:00:39.460
<v Speaker 6>2% next year.</v>

1995
01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:40.300
<v Speaker 6>Like are you a child?</v>

1996
01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:40.481
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1997
01:00:40.481 --> 01:00:41.231
<v Speaker 6>like what is that?</v>

1998
01:00:41.231 --> 01:00:42.760
<v Speaker 6>It should be totally voluntary.</v>

1999
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.571
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2000
01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:44.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2001
01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:44.811
<v Speaker 6>I got my,</v>

2002
01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:45.340
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2003
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.900
<v Speaker 6>I got my foot infected recently.</v>

2004
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.850
<v Speaker 6>I had a blister and got infected.</v>

2005
01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:49.901
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2006
01:00:49.901 --> 01:00:54.901
<v Speaker 6>I went to one of those walking clinics and it was $79 for the visit and I didn't</v>

2007
01:00:55.331 --> 01:00:55.961
<v Speaker 6>see a doctor.</v>

2008
01:00:55.961 --> 01:00:57.070
<v Speaker 6>It was like an RN or something.</v>

2009
01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.350
<v Speaker 6>Cause for just the gross for some dudes,</v>

2010
01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:00.460
<v Speaker 6>gross foot blister,</v>

2011
01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:01.950
<v Speaker 6>you don't need a neurosurgeon,</v>

2012
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:02.890
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to pay a lot of money.</v>

2013
01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:05.020
<v Speaker 6>She looked at it and about 30 seconds she goes,</v>

2014
01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:05.291
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2015
01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:06.550
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to prescribe you Catholics.</v>

2016
01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:07.571
<v Speaker 6>She prescribes it.</v>

2017
01:01:07.571 --> 01:01:08.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm taking it every six hours.</v>

2018
01:01:08.951 --> 01:01:12.460
<v Speaker 6>My infection has gone now and just have to take for the next few days as a</v>

2019
01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:13.294
<v Speaker 6>preventative thing.</v>

2020
01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.313
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2021
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.350
<v Speaker 6>that prescription with no insurance was $20.</v>

2022
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.450
<v Speaker 6>So my whole visit was $100.</v>

2023
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.640
<v Speaker 6>I didn't cost taxpayers anything.</v>

2024
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.780
<v Speaker 6>I didn't cost,</v>

2025
01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.673
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2026
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:24.461
<v Speaker 6>myself,</v>

2027
01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:26.020
<v Speaker 6>anything beyond that hundred dollar visit.</v>

2028
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:27.041
<v Speaker 6>Why can't we do that?</v>

2029
01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:28.420
<v Speaker 6>Why can't it just be a product you buy?</v>

2030
01:01:28.421 --> 01:01:29.200
<v Speaker 6>Like anything else?</v>

2031
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:29.321
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2032
01:01:29.321 --> 01:01:32.320
<v Speaker 5>don't you think that what happens is exactly what we're talking about before</v>

2033
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.110
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a corporation is trying to make a shitload of money.</v>

2034
01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:37.570
<v Speaker 5>They pay a lot of money to get a politician into office.</v>

2035
01:01:37.571 --> 01:01:38.410
<v Speaker 5>The lobby,</v>

2036
01:01:38.411 --> 01:01:39.880
<v Speaker 5>the special interest groups,</v>

2037
01:01:39.881 --> 01:01:41.080
<v Speaker 5>finance campaigns,</v>

2038
01:01:41.081 --> 01:01:41.920
<v Speaker 5>they get them in,</v>

2039
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:42.401
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2040
01:01:42.401 --> 01:01:43.450
<v Speaker 5>he's our guy now.</v>

2041
01:01:43.451 --> 01:01:44.560
<v Speaker 5>He wants to do Obamacare.</v>

2042
01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:45.040
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2043
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.730
<v Speaker 5>let's attach this fucking compassionate care act or whatever the hell you want</v>

2044
01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:49.350
<v Speaker 5>to call it.</v>

2045
01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:50.183
<v Speaker 5>Name it name.</v>

2046
01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:50.650
<v Speaker 5>We're gonna.</v>

2047
01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:52.300
<v Speaker 5>We're gonna make more money this way.</v>

2048
01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.010
<v Speaker 5>This way we're going to force people to buy way.</v>

2049
01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:54.221
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2050
01:01:54.221 --> 01:01:56.340
<v Speaker 5>we're going to have more of a subscription in my more of this</v>

2051
01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.041
<v Speaker 6>dumb people out there.</v>

2052
01:01:58.041 --> 01:02:01.430
<v Speaker 6>Wonder why the insurance companies were so supportive of what was supposed to be</v>

2053
01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 6>a huge reform of their industry.</v>

2054
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 6>It's because in exchange,</v>

2055
01:02:04.161 --> 01:02:04.731
<v Speaker 6>Obama is like,</v>

2056
01:02:04.731 --> 01:02:08.300
<v Speaker 6>you're going to have a captive audience of every single citizen is now required</v>

2057
01:02:08.301 --> 01:02:09.200
<v Speaker 6>to buy your product.</v>

2058
01:02:09.201 --> 01:02:09.411
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2059
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:12.980
<v Speaker 6>what do you think would happen to the price of iPhones if you were required by</v>

2060
01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:14.870
<v Speaker 6>law to have one on you at all times?</v>

2061
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:17.330
<v Speaker 5>The opposite is socialized medicine.</v>

2062
01:02:17.331 --> 01:02:19.160
<v Speaker 5>It's is it's like a disgusting,</v>

2063
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 5>like sort of a twist on that system.</v>

2064
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:25.230
<v Speaker 5>Like the idea that the government or that the people's taxes,</v>

2065
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 5>like all the money that we pay in California,</v>

2066
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:28.410
<v Speaker 5>this 10% tax thing,</v>

2067
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.393
<v Speaker 5>state tax,</v>

2068
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.490
<v Speaker 5>if that went to pre health care,</v>

2069
01:02:31.491 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 5>I would be super supportive of it if we found out that the reason why California</v>

2070
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 5>pay state taxes is that everybody who lives in state tax in California rather</v>

2071
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 5>has free health care.</v>

2072
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:40.891
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

2073
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:42.060
<v Speaker 5>that's fantastic.</v>

2074
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 5>I'd be happy to give up a sizeable chunk of my income if I knew that people were</v>

2075
01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:47.230
<v Speaker 5>being taken</v>

2076
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.771
<v Speaker 2>are on every,</v>

2077
01:02:47.771 --> 01:02:48.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

2078
01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:50.680
<v Speaker 2>everybody graduates from high school and they're not a retard.</v>

2079
01:02:50.681 --> 01:02:51.341
<v Speaker 2>When they graduate,</v>

2080
01:02:51.341 --> 01:02:53.110
<v Speaker 2>they know something about the political world.</v>

2081
01:02:53.111 --> 01:02:54.010
<v Speaker 2>They know something about,</v>

2082
01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:55.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2083
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>they take a psychology class.</v>

2084
01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.940
<v Speaker 2>They don't become some psycho shooter.</v>

2085
01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>They understand things about their own psychology.</v>

2086
01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I would be in favor of that.</v>

2087
01:03:01.571 --> 01:03:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd be in favor of school system.</v>

2088
01:03:02.891 --> 01:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not completely broken.</v>

2089
01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:04.481
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2090
01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.314
<v Speaker 2>it's also</v>

2091
01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:08.170
<v Speaker 5>cool system that's manageable as far as the numbers.</v>

2092
01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.020
<v Speaker 5>When you're a teacher and you've got 40 kids in your class,</v>

2093
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:13.570
<v Speaker 5>there's no way you can give them individual attention.</v>

2094
01:03:13.571 --> 01:03:14.470
<v Speaker 5>There's no way.</v>

2095
01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.513
<v Speaker 5>Our class</v>

2096
01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>rethink keeping 40,</v>

2097
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2098
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.360
<v Speaker 2>hormonally charged kids in a room for eight hours a day sitting in chairs.</v>

2099
01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:24.910
<v Speaker 2>We've got to rethink that whole paradigm cause you could do is everybody has an</v>

2100
01:03:24.911 --> 01:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Ipad,</v>

2101
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.750
<v Speaker 2>you read that day's assignment and once a week you all meet up at a fucking</v>

2102
01:03:28.751 --> 01:03:29.584
<v Speaker 2>Starbucks.</v>

2103
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>And if you have any questions than the person who's like your ra or ta or</v>

2104
01:03:33.491 --> 01:03:34.030
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2105
01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:34.241
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2106
01:03:34.241 --> 01:03:34.601
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2107
01:03:34.601 --> 01:03:34.811
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2108
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>here's how you solve this one.</v>

2109
01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:40.120
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of it could be collaborative online and not have a school where</v>

2110
01:03:40.121 --> 01:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>they show up at school,</v>

2111
01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.400
<v Speaker 2>basically just not have a school.</v>

2112
01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:42.751
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

2113
01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2114
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.930
<v Speaker 2>you limit the risk of some psycho coming to the school and blowing people away.</v>

2115
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.640
<v Speaker 2>You limit the cost and you could still have like a school,</v>

2116
01:03:49.641 --> 01:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>you can still have like a gym and a shared area for people to hang out and</v>

2117
01:03:52.931 --> 01:03:53.764
<v Speaker 2>discuss stuff.</v>

2118
01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:56.440
<v Speaker 2>But why do you need to trap people in a building eight hours a day?</v>

2119
01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:57.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2120
01:03:57.371 --> 01:03:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

2121
01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:58.930
<v Speaker 5>point in some ways,</v>

2122
01:03:58.931 --> 01:04:02.440
<v Speaker 5>but in other ways that's like a really valuable time for learning human</v>

2123
01:04:02.441 --> 01:04:03.240
<v Speaker 5>interaction.</v>

2124
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:03.541
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2125
01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:03.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2126
01:04:03.901 --> 01:04:06.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think people are already like,</v>

2127
01:04:06.031 --> 01:04:06.864
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2128
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Asperger's as burglary enough without,</v>

2129
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:10.861
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2130
01:04:10.861 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Speaker 2>with x boxes and internet connections.</v>

2131
01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:14.730
<v Speaker 2>You'd never have to go outside and interact with people.</v>

2132
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Amazon prime,</v>

2133
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:16.620
<v Speaker 2>you just shit delivered.</v>

2134
01:04:16.621 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 2>We kind of want to keep people as connected as possible.</v>

2135
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Now that that's a valid point and a,</v>

2136
01:04:21.421 --> 01:04:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of,</v>

2137
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:22.920
<v Speaker 2>when they're young,</v>

2138
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.820
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking out loud,</v>

2139
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:24.840
<v Speaker 5>but there's,</v>

2140
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.720
<v Speaker 5>there's some validation to it too.</v>

2141
01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:27.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2142
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.440
<v Speaker 5>I think the idea isn't that it would necessarily keep people from interacting</v>

2143
01:04:33.591 --> 01:04:34.160
<v Speaker 5>with each other.</v>

2144
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.160
<v Speaker 5>What it would do is keep people from being forced to be slaves to a system stuck</v>

2145
01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:42.080
<v Speaker 5>in a box learning 50 in a class,</v>

2146
01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:43.850
<v Speaker 5>one unmotivated teacher.</v>

2147
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.830
<v Speaker 5>Totally ineffective way of going about it.</v>

2148
01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.120
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

2149
01:04:47.121 --> 01:04:47.361
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2150
01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:50.540
<v Speaker 5>the big thing about school is that social interaction.</v>

2151
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:52.250
<v Speaker 5>It's where you learn how to talk to girls.</v>

2152
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.140
<v Speaker 5>It's where you weren't learning clicks.</v>

2153
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.430
<v Speaker 5>It's where you learn,</v>

2154
01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:55.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2155
01:04:55.970 --> 01:05:00.050
<v Speaker 5>how to deal with negative and positive influences.</v>

2156
01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.790
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot to be learned in school other than just the stuff that they cheat</v>

2157
01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:06.620
<v Speaker 5>you just interacting with each other.</v>

2158
01:05:06.621 --> 01:05:06.690
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2159
01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:07.580
<v Speaker 5>forms the basis,</v>

2160
01:05:07.581 --> 01:05:11.120
<v Speaker 5>like the framework of how we interact when we get into the workplace.</v>

2161
01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:11.601
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2162
01:05:11.601 --> 01:05:11.931
<v Speaker 5>And you need,</v>

2163
01:05:11.931 --> 01:05:13.760
<v Speaker 5>your brain needs that development.</v>

2164
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:14.310
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2165
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:14.681
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

2166
01:05:14.681 --> 01:05:15.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2167
01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you're dealing with wild people.</v>

2168
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 5>Just wild</v>

2169
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>people that have never,</v>

2170
01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to have to try to hire those people and get them to be in</v>

2171
01:05:23.141 --> 01:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>your cubicle all day.</v>

2172
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cat that hasn't been domesticated.</v>

2173
01:05:26.171 --> 01:05:26.951
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2174
01:05:26.951 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>You ever have a feral cat?</v>

2175
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.440
<v Speaker 1>You ever have a feral cat?</v>

2176
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.161
<v Speaker 1>I've never had one,</v>

2177
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 1>but I've interacted with them before and they just do whatever they want.</v>

2178
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2179
01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I had a feral cat I couldn't eat.</v>

2180
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I was the only one who could pick him up if anybody else tried to pick them up.</v>

2181
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Even if I picked on beat.</v>

2182
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2183
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.821
<v Speaker 1>And then I pick him up.</v>

2184
01:05:40.821 --> 01:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>But he would relax once I,</v>

2185
01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>once I started petting me per like crazy,</v>

2186
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>like you're not trying to kill him,</v>

2187
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.600
<v Speaker 1>but he was a constant freak out.</v>

2188
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2189
01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:52.070
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get a little bit of that mingling and there's that.</v>

2190
01:05:52.071 --> 01:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>It also not gonna be able to pick out the psychosis is easy if you're not</v>

2191
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:57.940
<v Speaker 1>constantly like looking at like Billy's bringing skin cats to school.</v>

2192
01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm maybe we should sit down with his fucking parents and find out what's</v>

2193
01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:01.474
<v Speaker 1>going on with Billy.</v>

2194
01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2195
01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.970
<v Speaker 1>see it common well here,</v>

2196
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:09.030
<v Speaker 1>there was this story recently of some guy who shot up a synagogue I think and</v>

2197
01:06:09.541 --> 01:06:11.370
<v Speaker 1>the most recent guy and I said,</v>

2198
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2199
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I read the,</v>

2200
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:16.990
<v Speaker 1>I read the article and it was like he had been saying for awhile like I want to</v>

2201
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 1>kill Jews and if somebody is literally thinking the same things as Hitler,</v>

2202
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.540
<v Speaker 1>like maybe,</v>

2203
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:25.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe somebody should take note of that and bring that guy in for a</v>

2204
01:06:25.331 --> 01:06:26.590
<v Speaker 1>psychological evaluation.</v>

2205
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.590
<v Speaker 1>You have a little sit down with homeboy and find out how serious he is about</v>

2206
01:06:29.591 --> 01:06:30.424
<v Speaker 1>this project.</v>

2207
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2208
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And since the NSA has already logging in large stuff,</v>

2209
01:06:32.861 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe you check his credit card records that he just bide gone last week.</v>

2210
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:38.560
<v Speaker 1>You know like then you have correlation and that's where I think this stuff</v>

2211
01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 1>could actually be useful instead of just expensive bullshit.</v>

2212
01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:42.161
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>

2213
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:42.911
<v Speaker 1>He's maxed out.</v>

2214
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:45.160
<v Speaker 1>He bought 300 copies of mine count.</v>

2215
01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Might want to pay him a visit.</v>

2217
01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Might want to sit down and talk about why it needs all that ammo.</v>

2218
01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.053
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

2219
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh there's no way they can keep track.</v>

2220
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:57.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about people monitoring people's cell phones and shit and all</v>

2221
01:06:57.611 --> 01:06:58.390
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

2222
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 1>The idea that they're all there.</v>

2223
01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:02.650
<v Speaker 1>There's someone assigned to David Seaman listening to every call.</v>

2224
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.820
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

2225
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2226
01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:06.880
<v Speaker 1>it's truly hilarious cause the amount of data you're talking about,</v>

2227
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking staggering for one person.</v>

2228
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Even how fast we browse the Internet now.</v>

2229
01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll be on a website for about eight seconds,</v>

2230
01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:15.130
<v Speaker 1>like click like seven other tabs.</v>

2231
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2232
01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2233
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:16.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of data.</v>

2234
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It's too much.</v>

2235
01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.080
<v Speaker 1>If you look at your own history and you're trying to look at your own history</v>

2236
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:22.920
<v Speaker 1>cause you're trying to look for a website that you saw that you forgot to book</v>

2237
01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:23.500
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

2238
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.710
<v Speaker 1>you go through your own history like Ah,</v>

2239
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:31.570
<v Speaker 1>so much the amount of shit that we're exposed to today as opposed to our</v>

2240
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:34.270
<v Speaker 1>grandparents is just unbelievable.</v>

2241
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable for the mind.</v>

2242
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see if they could go back in time and take a a guy from the 19</v>

2243
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:45.571
<v Speaker 1>hundreds like 1919 take him and put electrodes on his brain and find out like</v>

2244
01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:47.110
<v Speaker 1>what kind of,</v>

2245
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.690
<v Speaker 1>what gets stimulated during a regular day,</v>

2246
01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.670
<v Speaker 1>regular eight hour day.</v>

2247
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 1>And then take a guy from 2014 in Manhattan,</v>

2248
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:55.720
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

2249
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2250
01:07:56.051 --> 01:07:59.950
<v Speaker 1>same program running on his brain and find out what's going on in his brain.</v>

2251
01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I bet one of them looks like a firefly buzzing around a campfire and the other</v>

2252
01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 1>one looks like a fireworks display,</v>

2253
01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>like the grand finale at Disneyland.</v>

2254
01:08:08.970 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Just don't judge,</v>

2255
01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>don't judge on the amount of information,</v>

2256
01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 1>just slamming into your fucking synapses.</v>

2257
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just we're not designed for this man were not designed.</v>

2258
01:08:18.831 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So I think part of what we're doing when we're trying to manage civilization is</v>

2259
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:23.350
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2260
01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:28.350
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to catch up to all this shit that's happened that's been erupting</v>

2261
01:08:29.181 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>all around us.</v>

2262
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:30.381
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

2263
01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>give that and then then there's this and then fuck and ha ha ha.</v>

2264
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.580
<v Speaker 6>Well the,</v>

2265
01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.990
<v Speaker 6>that's how the government's been responding to bitcoin recently.</v>

2266
01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:39.824
<v Speaker 6>It's like a,</v>

2267
01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.170
<v Speaker 6>if you look at an Internet meme of a dumb dog,</v>

2268
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:47.230
<v Speaker 6>like some dumb oblivious dog governments and like some of these big vested banks</v>

2269
01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:50.810
<v Speaker 6>that have been around forever are on the railroad tracks.</v>

2270
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.950
<v Speaker 6>This dumb ass dog looking at a train coming in their direction and they're like,</v>

2271
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.690
<v Speaker 6>is this something that's going to affect me?</v>

2272
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.070
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2273
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:58.010
<v Speaker 6>and it's not just any train.</v>

2274
01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking bullet train moving at 350 miles an hour.</v>

2275
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:02.420
<v Speaker 6>And whenever that train hits the dog,</v>

2276
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:03.770
<v Speaker 6>it's not even going to feel it.</v>

2277
01:09:03.771 --> 01:09:07.340
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be just an explosion of disgusting flesh and for,</v>

2278
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 6>but that's what they're at right now is a combination of curiosity,</v>

2279
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.290
<v Speaker 6>a bit of animosity and like,</v>

2280
01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:13.910
<v Speaker 6>how is this going to affect us?</v>

2281
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.380
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2282
01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:17.240
<v Speaker 6>it's like it'd be like record companies looking at Napster and going,</v>

2283
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 6>this is interesting.</v>

2284
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.450
<v Speaker 6>Is this going to affect our bottom line at all?</v>

2285
01:09:20.530 --> 01:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>What's also the,</v>

2286
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.880
<v Speaker 1>the just the sheer amount of different things that you would have to pay</v>

2287
01:09:24.881 --> 01:09:25.451
<v Speaker 1>attention to,</v>

2288
01:09:25.451 --> 01:09:26.650
<v Speaker 1>to truly manage.</v>

2289
01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea of being a president in 1919 was a really rational idea that you</v>

2291
01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>could have a guy who had managed our budget and the military and this guy</v>

2292
01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:38.320
<v Speaker 1>assigned to defense,</v>

2293
01:09:38.321 --> 01:09:39.220
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

2294
01:09:39.221 --> 01:09:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2295
01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.860
<v Speaker 1>but in 2014 good God damn luck.</v>

2296
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:46.240
<v Speaker 1>There's too many things.</v>

2297
01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:50.860
<v Speaker 1>There's no way any one person has their finger on the pulse of all these things.</v>

2298
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:52.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone says to you,</v>

2299
01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.040
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2300
01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.110
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about what's going on at the Bundy ranch?</v>

2301
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2302
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know,</v>

2303
01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.150
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on at the Bundy ranch?</v>

2304
01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't know.</v>

2305
01:09:59.260 --> 01:09:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

2306
01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:00.251
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2307
01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you fucking Shill,</v>

2308
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:01.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2309
01:10:01.611 --> 01:10:04.340
<v Speaker 1>like you can't know everything there.</v>

2310
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Every day there's a hundred new stories that have huge implications to our</v>

2311
01:10:10.811 --> 01:10:11.441
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

2312
01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:12.251
<v Speaker 1>to our world,</v>

2313
01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:13.840
<v Speaker 1>to the way we progress.</v>

2314
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Like where are we going in the future?</v>

2315
01:10:15.431 --> 01:10:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be affected by these events,</v>

2316
01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.220
<v Speaker 1>by these decisions,</v>

2317
01:10:18.221 --> 01:10:19.210
<v Speaker 1>by these technologies?</v>

2318
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Every day there's a hundred of them.</v>

2319
01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:24.580
<v Speaker 1>And every day everyone has to try to pay attention to as many of them as you</v>

2320
01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:25.210
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2321
01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And there's a new hundred tomorrow.</v>

2322
01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:27.543
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

2323
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2324
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:28.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2325
01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:29.680
<v Speaker 1>and it's exponential.</v>

2326
01:10:29.681 --> 01:10:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So a year from now,</v>

2327
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:32.740
<v Speaker 1>10 years from now,</v>

2328
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.360
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be unrecognizable.</v>

2329
01:10:34.361 --> 01:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be so much information coming at you on a daily basis and the</v>

2330
01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:40.060
<v Speaker 1>changes will be so rapid.</v>

2331
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:42.610
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unpredictable when you,</v>

2332
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.310
<v Speaker 1>when we try to look at the idea of exponential growth.</v>

2333
01:10:45.311 --> 01:10:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I talked to Ray Kurzweil about that and he was talking to me about the</v>

2334
01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:50.080
<v Speaker 1>criticisms that he's,</v>

2335
01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:50.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2336
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.860
<v Speaker 1>he's been given about this idea of the singularity,</v>

2337
01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:54.431
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2338
01:10:54.431 --> 01:10:54.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2339
01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.960
<v Speaker 1>technological singularity that there's going to be some sort of a technology</v>

2340
01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:03.670
<v Speaker 1>that's so groundbreaking that it changes humanity in reality as we know it and</v>

2341
01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:05.020
<v Speaker 1>it's probably right around the corner.</v>

2342
01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that actually.</v>

2343
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I agree with it too and I'm too stupid to understand all of it.</v>

2344
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.230
<v Speaker 1>But when he describes it,</v>

2345
01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.880
<v Speaker 1>when he describes exponential,</v>

2346
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:15.600
<v Speaker 1>then you really wrap your head around it like that.</v>

2347
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that it took a hundred years to make,</v>

2348
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2349
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.340
<v Speaker 1>this machine after that machine was made.</v>

2350
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>What matters is once a technology is born,</v>

2351
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>then technology's branch off of that at an incredibly rapid rate.</v>

2352
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 1>And as new technologies come in,</v>

2353
01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it makes it easier for new innovation to be established as well.</v>

2354
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And then it just swarms and it gets this incredible frenzy where it's</v>

2355
01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable as far as like how fast it's going to go.</v>

2356
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks it's like 20,</v>

2357
01:11:49.951 --> 01:11:50.784
<v Speaker 1>49.</v>

2358
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what his opinion is.</v>

2359
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 1>His opinion and his studying all of these different graphs and looking at the</v>

2360
01:11:56.671 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 1>exponential growth of technology is trying to figure out like when it's all</v>

2361
01:12:00.571 --> 01:12:01.590
<v Speaker 1>going to come to a head.</v>

2362
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>But even he's his guessing.</v>

2363
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:03.961
<v Speaker 1>No one really knows.</v>

2364
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:07.590
<v Speaker 1>There might be some new thing that comes out next month at of Finland that no</v>

2365
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:08.401
<v Speaker 1>one saw coming.</v>

2366
01:12:08.401 --> 01:12:10.500
<v Speaker 1>That changes a whole fucking ball of wax.</v>

2367
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2368
01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.040
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird</v>

2369
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.760
<v Speaker 2>I think about too because it's like if you have this truly artificially</v>

2370
01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:17.660
<v Speaker 2>intelligent thing,</v>

2371
01:12:17.661 --> 01:12:20.750
<v Speaker 2>they can access all the world's information like we can with Google,</v>

2372
01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:21.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2373
01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.740
<v Speaker 2>and it can make its own decisions and has its own kind of sovereignty,</v>

2374
01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.740
<v Speaker 2>then it doesn't have sexual motivation.</v>

2375
01:12:27.741 --> 01:12:30.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's not even necessarily interested in looking good or making money.</v>

2376
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have like mortality motivation cause it,</v>

2377
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:35.990
<v Speaker 2>if it backs up it's intelligence,</v>

2378
01:12:35.991 --> 01:12:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I could probably live forever.</v>

2379
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2380
01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.830
<v Speaker 2>So what motivates it to do anything?</v>

2381
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2382
01:12:40.591 --> 01:12:41.730
<v Speaker 1>there's no motivation.</v>

2383
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.630
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting thing.</v>

2384
01:12:42.631 --> 01:12:46.440
<v Speaker 1>People are worried that robots will take over and artificial intelligence will</v>

2385
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:46.860
<v Speaker 1>dominate it.</v>

2386
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.660
<v Speaker 2>It might just be a command line and like you type anything into it and it tells</v>

2387
01:12:49.661 --> 01:12:51.490
<v Speaker 2>you the answer or how it helps you out,</v>

2388
01:12:51.491 --> 01:12:55.660
<v Speaker 2>but it has just no interest in either harming humanity or helping us</v>

2389
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:58.190
<v Speaker 1>unless it's a program that way.</v>

2390
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:59.331
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>

2391
01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:04.331
<v Speaker 1>the real issue with artificial intelligence is if someone is so compelled to</v>

2392
01:13:05.031 --> 01:13:09.260
<v Speaker 1>create an artificial human being and gives us all of the components that a human</v>

2393
01:13:09.261 --> 01:13:09.801
<v Speaker 1>being has,</v>

2394
01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:11.090
<v Speaker 1>all the flaws as well,</v>

2395
01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.500
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

2396
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:13.880
<v Speaker 1>all the jealousy,</v>

2397
01:13:13.881 --> 01:13:15.050
<v Speaker 1>all the nonsense,</v>

2398
01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:15.913
<v Speaker 1>that'd be very bad.</v>

2399
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:16.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2400
01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:17.480
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have that,</v>

2401
01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:19.250
<v Speaker 1>then are they not a psychopath?</v>

2402
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

2403
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2404
01:13:20.811 --> 01:13:24.770
<v Speaker 1>are you creating a complete psycho with no remorse and no compassion?</v>

2405
01:13:24.771 --> 01:13:28.100
<v Speaker 1>If you create an artificial person that's ruthlessly intelligent,</v>

2406
01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:32.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's not concerned whatsoever about pain and suffering and what if it's so</v>

2407
01:13:32.361 --> 01:13:33.770
<v Speaker 1>smart that it recognizes,</v>

2408
01:13:33.771 --> 01:13:33.981
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2409
01:13:33.981 --> 01:13:34.670
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2410
01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:36.210
<v Speaker 1>people don't live forever anyway.</v>

2411
01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a moot point.</v>

2412
01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Like they're gonna die of old age,</v>

2413
01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:41.810
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the worst ways to go.</v>

2414
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:43.790
<v Speaker 1>The last few years of your life,</v>

2415
01:13:43.791 --> 01:13:48.100
<v Speaker 1>your body's going to break down to the point you were ready to die because it's</v>

2416
01:13:48.101 --> 01:13:49.550
<v Speaker 1>sucks to be alive.</v>

2417
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Like what's better that or we just eat them and use them for fuel to make a much</v>

2418
01:13:54.891 --> 01:13:56.420
<v Speaker 1>better race of robot,</v>

2419
01:13:56.421 --> 01:13:58.790
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligent things that don't get jealous.</v>

2420
01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.940
<v Speaker 1>The matrix basically if that,</v>

2421
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:02.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2422
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2423
01:14:03.711 --> 01:14:08.711
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're probably at least on the verge of a new member of our that</v>

2424
01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to consider at the least if not our overlords.</v>

2425
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.553
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

2426
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>this idea of artificial intelligence is completely unavoidable.</v>

2427
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just as unavoidable as the moment that the guy figured out a wagon wheel</v>

2428
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:27.640
<v Speaker 1>and the other guy figured out an engine and he started going,</v>

2429
01:14:27.641 --> 01:14:28.474
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

2430
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.493
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

2431
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:30.603
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

2432
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>If we put that in there and get something to make those things,</v>

2433
01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.260
<v Speaker 1>how would you get the wheels to spin?</v>

2434
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2435
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>we need like a thing they're like connects to the,</v>

2436
01:14:38.201 --> 01:14:40.960
<v Speaker 1>and the injury was the engine making fire.</v>

2437
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2438
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:42.131
<v Speaker 1>Burns shit.</v>

2439
01:14:42.131 --> 01:14:42.800
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get it bro.</v>

2440
01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.633
<v Speaker 1>Cause Burns gas.</v>

2441
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So we got to get a tank that holds the gas.</v>

2442
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.690
<v Speaker 1>It's inevitable.</v>

2443
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It was just a matter of time before someone pieced all those things together.</v>

2444
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.820
<v Speaker 1>When you're dealing with artificial intelligence,</v>

2445
01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:52.960
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

2446
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean even as simplistic form of it,</v>

2447
01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:55.864
<v Speaker 1>like Siri,</v>

2448
01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Siri's a form of artificial intelligence.</v>

2449
01:14:57.971 --> 01:14:58.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a database.</v>

2450
01:14:58.811 --> 01:14:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2451
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it asks you ask it questions,</v>

2452
01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:02.380
<v Speaker 1>it provides you with the answers.</v>

2453
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:04.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a form of something.</v>

2454
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Doing some calculations.</v>

2455
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:11.170
<v Speaker 1>When that starts becoming more and more complex and then they decide,</v>

2456
01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:11.920
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2457
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 1>we want to recreate a human being.</v>

2458
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's recreate memories.</v>

2459
01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:16.960
<v Speaker 1>We're going to program memories.</v>

2460
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take someone's,</v>

2461
01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2462
01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:19.870
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take.</v>

2463
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 1>What we did is we decided to take memories,</v>

2464
01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.300
<v Speaker 1>generic memories from happy people,</v>

2465
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:30.660
<v Speaker 1>ages one through 60 and just create a 60 year old professor,</v>

2466
01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:36.040
<v Speaker 1>an artificial guy who's lived a long life of wisdom and we're going to have him</v>

2467
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 1>interact with people just to blow their fucking minds.</v>

2468
01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:38.711
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile,</v>

2469
01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:38.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2470
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:39.641
<v Speaker 1>someone tells him,</v>

2471
01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you know that they made you just a week ago and he starts crying.</v>

2472
01:15:42.641 --> 01:15:43.480
<v Speaker 1>What about my children?</v>

2473
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.351
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist.</v>

2474
01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:45.184
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2475
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Where'd my daughter was at her wedding.</v>

2476
01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:47.921
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen.</v>

2477
01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:48.641
<v Speaker 1>It never happened.</v>

2478
01:15:48.641 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 1>You're a week old.</v>

2479
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2480
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:54.070
<v Speaker 1>we watched some fake 60 year old cry and then cut his throat.</v>

2481
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:54.911
<v Speaker 1>He reaches in,</v>

2482
01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:57.780
<v Speaker 1>grabs on those straight razors from dollar shave done.</v>

2483
01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Fucking pointless because he realizes it sparks come flying out and then he</v>

2484
01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:04.780
<v Speaker 1>really freaks out and somebody goes,</v>

2485
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.651
<v Speaker 1>there's no blood.</v>

2486
01:16:05.651 --> 01:16:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Somebody posts that article of the technology subreddit,</v>

2487
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's instantly a removed and someone comes in and kicks his head off and</v>

2488
01:16:11.591 --> 01:16:12.071
<v Speaker 1>yells out.</v>

2489
01:16:12.071 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Worldstar Worldstar in technology,</v>

2490
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:15.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2491
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 1>shows that as well.</v>

2492
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes the number one video the internet ever sees ever.</v>

2493
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes into porn robot porn with a sliced neck.</v>

2494
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is Dick never goes soft as a fucking robot.</v>

2495
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Once he learns he's a robot,</v>

2496
01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:31.540
<v Speaker 1>he just presses the dick hard button and it just goes,</v>

2497
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a real,</v>

2498
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:39.640
<v Speaker 1>real concern at a certain point in time that we're going to create an artificial</v>

2499
01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 1>thing that thanks for retarded.</v>

2500
01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:45.640
<v Speaker 1>If it's really doing your calculations and realizing like how ridiculous we are.</v>

2502
01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:48.560
<v Speaker 2>And it also might eliminate us because it goes,</v>

2503
01:16:48.561 --> 01:16:49.394
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2504
01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:52.760
<v Speaker 2>if humans are allowed to continue surviving,</v>

2505
01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:56.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a nonzero chance that they will eventually wipe us out.</v>

2506
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.940
<v Speaker 2>They'll either destroy the earth where they will for some reason,</v>

2507
01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.980
<v Speaker 2>decided to turn us off at some point.</v>

2508
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:04.850
<v Speaker 2>And so because there's that non zero chance that they will eliminate us,</v>

2509
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:08.180
<v Speaker 2>we have to eliminate them first and then you get like a Battlestar Galactica</v>

2510
01:17:08.181 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing where they actually want</v>

2511
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 7>to kill humans just because they essentially live forever.</v>

2512
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2513
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.130
<v Speaker 7>there's no time constraints,</v>

2514
01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:18.710
<v Speaker 7>so they don't want a situation where an 500 years,</v>

2515
01:17:18.711 --> 01:17:21.680
<v Speaker 7>we're so advanced that we were advanced,</v>

2516
01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:24.270
<v Speaker 7>that we decided that artificial intelligence is evil for some reason,</v>

2517
01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:26.930
<v Speaker 7>that we have some new religious leader and we turned it off.</v>

2518
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.101
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2519
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 7>the followers of Ted Kaczynski,</v>

2520
01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 7>that's what it's going to be.</v>

2521
01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be the unibomber followers who said he's ahead of his time.</v>

2522
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.761
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2523
01:17:34.761 --> 01:17:36.020
<v Speaker 7>that's what [inaudible] thought.</v>

2524
01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:38.000
<v Speaker 7>He thought that technology was our enemy.</v>

2525
01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:39.410
<v Speaker 7>It was the enemy of the human race.</v>

2526
01:17:39.411 --> 01:17:44.411
<v Speaker 7>And he was trying to actively stop technology by attacking and killing the</v>

2527
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:47.300
<v Speaker 7>people that were responsible for innovation.</v>

2528
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:47.961
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2529
01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:52.961
<v Speaker 7>it's a really crazy thought that may be in his wacky LSD mind that he had a</v>

2530
01:17:55.041 --> 01:18:00.041
<v Speaker 7>point that he really saw it all common and he saw he extrapolated the future and</v>

2531
01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:00.441
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>

2532
01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:01.274
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>

2533
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 7>we keep going along at this same rate.</v>

2534
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.420
<v Speaker 7>There's not going to be any apple pie.</v>

2535
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 7>That's not going to be any Norman Rockwell paintings.</v>

2536
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:08.900
<v Speaker 7>I think he was just a crazy person.</v>

2537
01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 7>And I think a lot of crazy people,</v>

2538
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:10.851
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2539
01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:13.070
<v Speaker 7>can see like a very small part of the picture.</v>

2540
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.000
<v Speaker 7>And that's why they're crazy.</v>

2541
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:15.080
<v Speaker 7>They can see the little bit,</v>

2542
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:16.910
<v Speaker 7>they can't see the whole fucking thing.</v>

2543
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.870
<v Speaker 7>If they could see that,</v>

2544
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.100
<v Speaker 7>they would be much less worried.</v>

2545
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.200
<v Speaker 7>Do you know he was a part of the Harvard Lsd Studies,</v>

2546
01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:22.010
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2547
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.260
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2548
01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.093
<v Speaker 7>I did not know that.</v>

2549
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:24.580
<v Speaker 7>You should look into it.</v>

2550
01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.413
<v Speaker 7>It's a fascinating,</v>

2551
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:27.080
<v Speaker 7>there's a documentary called the net.</v>

2552
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.780
<v Speaker 7>It's a foreign documentary in subtitles,</v>

2553
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:30.261
<v Speaker 7>the net.</v>

2554
01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:30.950
<v Speaker 7>It's all,</v>

2555
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:31.280
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2556
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.030
<v Speaker 7>documenting Ted Kaczynski.</v>

2557
01:18:33.031 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 7>He's part in the Harvard LSD studies where they just dose the shit out of kids</v>

2558
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:39.410
<v Speaker 7>and found out what it did for them.</v>

2559
01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.690
<v Speaker 7>He went to Berkeley after that,</v>

2560
01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 7>taught at Berkeley and used all of his money to fucking build this cabin in the</v>

2561
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:49.860
<v Speaker 7>woods and then plot his war against civilization and,</v>

2562
01:18:49.861 --> 01:18:50.694
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>

2563
01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2564
01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:52.250
<v Speaker 7>and innovation.</v>

2565
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.880
<v Speaker 7>Don't put that up.</v>

2566
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.713
<v Speaker 7>Don't put that up.</v>

2567
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:54.201
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

2568
01:18:54.201 --> 01:18:54.760
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>

2569
01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.160
<v Speaker 7>don't put any more videos up unless I ask you to because these videos are</v>

2570
01:18:58.161 --> 01:18:59.420
<v Speaker 7>getting us pulled off of Youtube.</v>

2571
01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.470
<v Speaker 7>Movie preview won't do it.</v>

2572
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.440
<v Speaker 7>I don't know about that man.</v>

2573
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.651
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2574
01:19:02.651 --> 01:19:03.590
<v Speaker 7>it's really annoying.</v>

2575
01:19:03.591 --> 01:19:07.370
<v Speaker 7>Lately we're getting like half of the videos we put up,</v>

2576
01:19:07.371 --> 01:19:09.230
<v Speaker 7>we get a something on youtube.</v>

2577
01:19:09.231 --> 01:19:10.400
<v Speaker 7>It says we shouldn't have it up.</v>

2578
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:14.060
<v Speaker 7>It's the dispute if to do a fair use thing.</v>

2579
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 7>And we were talking about before,</v>

2580
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:18.920
<v Speaker 7>you were talking about trolls that do that to videos.</v>

2581
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:19.161
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2582
01:19:19.161 --> 01:19:19.701
<v Speaker 7>Contents,</v>

2583
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:20.240
<v Speaker 7>roles.</v>

2584
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.020
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2585
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.800
<v Speaker 7>they go through youtube videos and they'll tag stuff is being their copyright,</v>

2586
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:25.634
<v Speaker 7>their property.</v>

2587
01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:29.600
<v Speaker 7>Even if it's just the video that I made in my apartment where the background is</v>

2588
01:19:29.601 --> 01:19:30.434
<v Speaker 7>my couch.</v>

2589
01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.310
<v Speaker 7>All of the words are my own words coming out of my own mouth for courted by me,</v>

2590
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:35.780
<v Speaker 7>and this is what I sent to youtube.</v>

2591
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.660
<v Speaker 7>Every time I get one of these complaints from these uh,</v>

2592
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:38.930
<v Speaker 7>content troll companies,</v>

2593
01:19:38.931 --> 01:19:39.560
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

2594
01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:42.740
<v Speaker 7>how is it physically possible that they own any of this content?</v>

2595
01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2596
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.550
<v Speaker 7>And what do they respond to you?</v>

2597
01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.010
<v Speaker 7>They always end up reversing it,</v>

2598
01:19:46.011 --> 01:19:47.660
<v Speaker 7>but it takes me time to do that.</v>

2599
01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:50.480
<v Speaker 7>And what they're hoping is that a certain percentage of people won't take the</v>

2600
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:53.090
<v Speaker 7>time and then they make a small amount of money off your videos.</v>

2601
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.200
<v Speaker 7>That's fascinating.</v>

2602
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:54.680
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2603
01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.610
<v Speaker 7>That's really fascinating that someone's decided to be that much of a cunt,</v>

2604
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:01.370
<v Speaker 7>that they're going to pretend that you and your in your,</v>

2605
01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.230
<v Speaker 7>your office or wherever you're doing this thing that you somehow or another or</v>

2606
01:20:06.231 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 7>stealing their work.</v>

2607
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.393
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2608
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.380
<v Speaker 7>That's amazing.</v>

2609
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:11.420
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2610
01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.550
<v Speaker 7>I'm using English words and I think they probably use English words,</v>

2611
01:20:14.551 --> 01:20:16.710
<v Speaker 7>so it must be a copyright infringement.</v>

2612
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.981
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2613
01:20:16.981 --> 01:20:17.820
<v Speaker 7>that's amazing.</v>

2614
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing that they think that they can do that or that they think that</v>

2615
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:22.560
<v Speaker 7>somehow or another that's justified.</v>

2616
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.890
<v Speaker 7>Do you think they're randomly selecting people or they're purposely finding</v>

2617
01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:27.600
<v Speaker 7>people that have high number of videos?</v>

2618
01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 7>High number of use.</v>

2619
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.070
<v Speaker 7>If I were to say anything and just be complete speculation,</v>

2620
01:20:32.071 --> 01:20:33.450
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what they're going for,</v>

2621
01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:35.430
<v Speaker 7>but maybe it's like an algorithm,</v>

2622
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:39.120
<v Speaker 7>like maybe it's a Bot that searches out things and it's a moneymaking Bot.</v>

2623
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2624
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:42.180
<v Speaker 7>I'm always fascinated by when you go to a website and you're entering in</v>

2625
01:20:42.181 --> 01:20:42.761
<v Speaker 7>information,</v>

2626
01:20:42.761 --> 01:20:45.990
<v Speaker 7>they give you that weird scrambled letter thing that you have to decipher,</v>

2627
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:47.480
<v Speaker 7>oh the capture scan.</v>

2628
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:49.740
<v Speaker 7>This is the best way you have to do this.</v>

2629
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:50.760
<v Speaker 7>And My,</v>

2630
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.241
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

2631
01:20:51.241 --> 01:20:54.390
<v Speaker 7>sometimes it's like tests that test the whole bunch.</v>

2632
01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:58.020
<v Speaker 7>Like when they crammed the letters together and I guess I'm not human cause I</v>

2633
01:20:58.021 --> 01:20:59.430
<v Speaker 7>didn't pass your fucking test.</v>

2634
01:20:59.431 --> 01:20:59.700
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

2635
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.990
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes it's a real,</v>

2636
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:02.880
<v Speaker 7>it's a real calculation.</v>

2637
01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.230
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a cue.</v>

2638
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.840
<v Speaker 7>What that is that a g or a fucking Q?</v>

2639
01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:11.100
<v Speaker 7>What is that weird ass thing that doesn't look like a font?</v>

2640
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.593
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

2641
01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 7>I think when they just ask questions like,</v>

2642
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:14.611
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2643
01:21:14.611 --> 01:21:17.300
<v Speaker 7>what was the first president of the United States or something like that that,</v>

2644
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.810
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2645
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:18.030
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2646
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.360
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

2647
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.290
<v Speaker 7>that's a lot smarter.</v>

2648
01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:20.010
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 7>But if you're a Google type database or you can have the algorithm go to Google</v>

2650
01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:26.310
<v Speaker 7>and answer the question,</v>

2651
01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 7>like if you say something into Google,</v>

2652
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:30.150
<v Speaker 7>it has it in a 10th of a second.</v>

2653
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:33.930
<v Speaker 7>So if you have a direct connection and so it could get,</v>

2654
01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:35.910
<v Speaker 7>just get the answer and answer for,</v>

2655
01:21:35.911 --> 01:21:38.580
<v Speaker 7>you would look at the text and then have former response.</v>

2656
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.420
<v Speaker 7>You can,</v>

2657
01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:39.631
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2658
01:21:39.631 --> 01:21:42.780
<v Speaker 7>you could ask a Google search engine a question,</v>

2659
01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:45.450
<v Speaker 7>it'll take you to wiki answers and then boom.</v>

2660
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:48.540
<v Speaker 7>So all we'd have to do is just print that.</v>

2661
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2662
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 7>But then it would be like,</v>

2663
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 7>it wouldn't be a one word answer.</v>

2664
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.051
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

2665
01:21:52.051 --> 01:21:52.510
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2666
01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:52.880
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2667
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:53.430
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2668
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:54.240
<v Speaker 7>like it would be,</v>

2669
01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.590
<v Speaker 7>would it be who was the first president?</v>

2670
01:21:55.591 --> 01:21:56.101
<v Speaker 7>United States.</v>

2671
01:21:56.101 --> 01:21:56.934
<v Speaker 7>George Washington.</v>

2672
01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.330
<v Speaker 7>But if we're were to search,</v>

2674
01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:01.260
<v Speaker 7>Google would probably be like,</v>

2675
01:22:01.261 --> 01:22:02.690
<v Speaker 7>George Washington is a,</v>

2676
01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:02.911
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2677
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:04.980
<v Speaker 7>it wouldn't know to just stop,</v>

2678
01:22:04.981 --> 01:22:05.460
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>

2679
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.293
<v Speaker 7>Maybe,</v>

2680
01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.320
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

2681
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.220
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember that thing?</v>

2682
01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:13.170
<v Speaker 7>Wolfram Alpha that they were doing a long time ago at any math search engine or</v>

2683
01:22:13.171 --> 01:22:13.650
<v Speaker 7>something?</v>

2684
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:13.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2685
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.191
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2686
01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:15.300
<v Speaker 7>it was a search engine,</v>

2687
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.100
<v Speaker 7>like an academic search search engine,</v>

2688
01:22:17.101 --> 01:22:20.970
<v Speaker 7>and I think the idea was to have a total complete human database.</v>

2689
01:22:20.971 --> 01:22:21.804
<v Speaker 7>Siri,</v>

2690
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:22.530
<v Speaker 7>that's what it is.</v>

2691
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:23.420
<v Speaker 7>It becomes Siri.</v>

2692
01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:23.641
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2693
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:28.641
<v Speaker 7>They use the technology for Siri works eight out of 10 times only.</v>

2694
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:29.910
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2695
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:30.743
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't it?</v>

2696
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:31.261
<v Speaker 7>I find,</v>

2697
01:22:31.261 --> 01:22:32.190
<v Speaker 7>I don't use it that often,</v>

2698
01:22:32.191 --> 01:22:33.390
<v Speaker 7>but I find it to be pretty accurate,</v>

2699
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:36.050
<v Speaker 7>but I mean even good now is eight out of 10 right?</v>

2700
01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.520
<v Speaker 7>Two out of 10 it depends.</v>

2701
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:38.363
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible].</v>

2702
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.660
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

2703
01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.301
<v Speaker 7>let's find out.</v>

2704
01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:39.961
<v Speaker 7>Let's Google this.</v>

2705
01:22:39.961 --> 01:22:41.550
<v Speaker 7>How often does Siri work?</v>

2706
01:22:41.551 --> 01:22:42.171
<v Speaker 7>Let's just say that.</v>

2707
01:22:42.171 --> 01:22:42.811
<v Speaker 7>And they remember when,</v>

2708
01:22:42.811 --> 01:22:43.621
<v Speaker 7>they don't want to say Siri,</v>

2709
01:22:43.621 --> 01:22:44.260
<v Speaker 7>the porn star,</v>

2710
01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 7>because he's a porn star name.</v>

2711
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:46.110
<v Speaker 7>Siri.</v>

2712
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:49.710
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember when they were like cheesy infomercials on about that software</v>

2713
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:54.090
<v Speaker 7>product where you'd put on the microphone and instead of typing it would read</v>

2714
01:22:54.091 --> 01:22:56.670
<v Speaker 7>your words and you'd be able to type a document that way?</v>

2715
01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:57.780
<v Speaker 7>Say that again.</v>

2716
01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:58.230
<v Speaker 7>What is it?</v>

2717
01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:00.900
<v Speaker 7>There used to be infomercials for this software where you'd put on the</v>

2718
01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:02.460
<v Speaker 7>microphone and instead of typing,</v>

2719
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.390
<v Speaker 7>dragging,</v>

2720
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 7>dragging like speech recognition and then it was so clunky</v>

2721
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:10.480
<v Speaker 5>that what we have now is ridiculously better than like anything that I think</v>

2722
01:23:10.481 --> 01:23:11.314
<v Speaker 5>they expect it.</v>

2723
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.861
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2724
01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:12.611
<v Speaker 5>Well I'm,</v>

2725
01:23:12.611 --> 01:23:15.310
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend who used to write all of his books with that.</v>

2726
01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:16.130
<v Speaker 5>He used to,</v>

2727
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.341
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2728
01:23:16.341 --> 01:23:19.810
<v Speaker 5>he's put headphones on and walk around his apartment years ago and he actually</v>

2729
01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:23.860
<v Speaker 5>used windows because the windows version of dragon was way better than the Mac</v>

2730
01:23:23.861 --> 01:23:24.251
<v Speaker 5>version.</v>

2731
01:23:24.251 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 5>That was a very reason why he did it.</v>

2732
01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 5>He did all of his writing through rants and then he would go back over it and</v>

2733
01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 5>then edit it and try to figure it out.</v>

2734
01:23:30.941 --> 01:23:31.331
<v Speaker 5>But it was like,</v>

2735
01:23:31.331 --> 01:23:33.950
<v Speaker 5>to capture my words is,</v>

2736
01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.890
<v Speaker 5>is accurately with my fingers.</v>

2737
01:23:35.891 --> 01:23:36.460
<v Speaker 5>Like I just,</v>

2738
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 5>I can't type that fast.</v>

2739
01:23:37.571 --> 01:23:40.900
<v Speaker 5>There's no way it felt like there was something missing in the flow of his</v>

2740
01:23:40.901 --> 01:23:41.734
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>

2741
01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.900
<v Speaker 5>I've always had the opposite opinion.</v>

2742
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:46.810
<v Speaker 5>I think that I write better because,</v>

2743
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:47.703
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2744
01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.900
<v Speaker 5>when I actually physically use the keyboard,</v>

2745
01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 5>because I am giving a lot of thought and consideration to each one of these</v>

2746
01:23:53.771 --> 01:23:58.771
<v Speaker 5>words because it takes me a lot longer to type out the word consideration than</v>

2747
01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 5>it does to have that concept in my mind.</v>

2748
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 5>That concept in my mind goes in and out and there's,</v>

2749
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:08.500
<v Speaker 5>there's both like the rants that you would come up with an a podcast,</v>

2750
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:09.460
<v Speaker 5>you probably would never,</v>

2751
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:15.150
<v Speaker 5>you'd never write that way because you're in sort of this frantic flowing thing</v>

2752
01:24:15.531 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 5>where one idea feeds into the next and this steam behind them.</v>

2753
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 5>But when you're writing and you're really considering every single sentence and</v>

2754
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:26.110
<v Speaker 5>going back over it and going back over the is,</v>

2755
01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:27.290
<v Speaker 5>that's the best way to phrase this.</v>

2756
01:24:27.291 --> 01:24:28.124
<v Speaker 5>Like a Hemingway,</v>

2757
01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:30.040
<v Speaker 5>is this as concise as possible?</v>

2758
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:31.000
<v Speaker 5>Could I go shorter?</v>

2759
01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:31.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2760
01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:31.550
<v Speaker 5>Is it,</v>

2761
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 5>there's a way to put more flare to it.</v>

2762
01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:34.720
<v Speaker 5>There's a way to,</v>

2763
01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:35.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2764
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.420
<v Speaker 5>give it a better feeling.</v>

2765
01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:39.580
<v Speaker 5>Like what's the impact that I'm going to get from reading?</v>

2766
01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:43.300
<v Speaker 5>This is a way to enhance that in some way,</v>

2767
01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 5>that extra consideration.</v>

2768
01:24:44.711 --> 01:24:45.610
<v Speaker 5>I think is good.</v>

2769
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not that you can't do that in the editing process though,</v>

2770
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.790
<v Speaker 5>but for me it's silence is how I write best.</v>

2771
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:53.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to even hear my own voice.</v>

2772
01:24:53.261 --> 01:24:55.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear shit most of the time.</v>

2773
01:24:55.271 --> 01:24:58.360
<v Speaker 5>Don't listen to music unless there's are a rare moment.</v>

2774
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.200
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that you could just talk a whole email and absolutely have it be</v>

2775
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:05.884
<v Speaker 5>perfect,</v>

2776
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:07.480
<v Speaker 5>that's really compelling.</v>

2777
01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 5>Like it was like day to day tasks that weren't like creative.</v>

2778
01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:12.100
<v Speaker 5>It's so good.</v>

2779
01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:13.990
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to check it before you send it to your boss.</v>

2780
01:25:13.991 --> 01:25:14.140
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2781
01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:14.321
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2782
01:25:14.321 --> 01:25:16.780
<v Speaker 5>Dave is 1230 on Wednesday.</v>

2783
01:25:16.781 --> 01:25:18.790
<v Speaker 5>Okay for a podcast question mark,</v>

2784
01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:19.510
<v Speaker 5>send,</v>

2785
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.901
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2786
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:20.480
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

2787
01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.360
<v Speaker 5>Takes five seconds.</v>

2788
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:24.220
<v Speaker 5>I do that all the time with text messaging.</v>

2789
01:25:24.221 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

2790
01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.040
<v Speaker 5>one of the things about androids is,</v>

2791
01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2792
01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:27.911
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2793
01:25:27.911 --> 01:25:28.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2794
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.870
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2795
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 5>they're Google voice software that they use for analyzing,</v>

2796
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:34.264
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2797
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:35.141
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2798
01:25:35.141 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 5>analyzing your texts.</v>

2799
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 5>Like if I send you a text,</v>

2800
01:25:37.331 --> 01:25:38.380
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking incredible.</v>

2801
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:39.191
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>

2802
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:40.024
<v Speaker 5>really accurate.</v>

2803
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.450
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

2804
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:41.680
<v Speaker 5>It's really accurate.</v>

2805
01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:42.820
<v Speaker 5>It's really fast.</v>

2806
01:25:42.821 --> 01:25:45.520
<v Speaker 5>It picks it up as you're talking and you could see the,</v>

2807
01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 5>the letters for me.</v>

2808
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 5>And that's just on a cell phone.</v>

2809
01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:51.250
<v Speaker 5>They're also not shitheads about accepting stuff into their APP store.</v>

2810
01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 5>So much more open environment.</v>

2811
01:25:53.770 --> 01:25:54.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2812
01:25:54.071 --> 01:25:55.600
<v Speaker 5>Despite what everybody's been telling me,</v>

2813
01:25:55.601 --> 01:25:55.991
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2814
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:59.410
<v Speaker 5>there are no bitcoin applications available for the iPhone.</v>

2815
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.410
<v Speaker 5>You may have a bitcoin application for the iPhone,</v>

2816
01:26:02.411 --> 01:26:03.890
<v Speaker 5>but you cannot new ones.</v>

2817
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.180
<v Speaker 7>That's what people are saying,</v>

2818
01:26:05.181 --> 01:26:05.280
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2819
01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:05.381
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2820
01:26:05.381 --> 01:26:06.160
<v Speaker 7>I have a big coin.</v>

2821
01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 7>If you don't know what you're talking about.</v>

2822
01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:07.271
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2823
01:26:07.271 --> 01:26:07.761
<v Speaker 7>and then two,</v>

2824
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:09.150
<v Speaker 7>because you already downloaded,</v>

2825
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:11.270
<v Speaker 7>they're trying to download one right now.</v>

2826
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.260
<v Speaker 7>You're not gonna be able to get it.</v>

2827
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 7>There are apps that will show you the price and stuff,</v>

2828
01:26:14.121 --> 01:26:17.090
<v Speaker 7>but there aren't apps that will allow you to send or receive bitcoins.</v>

2829
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 7>That's fascinating.</v>

2830
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:18.913
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2831
01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.481
<v Speaker 7>that's a weird thing.</v>

2832
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2833
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:24.980
<v Speaker 7>is there any rational explanation for why apple is chosen to do that?</v>

2834
01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.090
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

2835
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:28.130
<v Speaker 7>I mean there are two reasons.</v>

2836
01:26:28.131 --> 01:26:31.520
<v Speaker 7>One is that they make a tremendous amount of money from saving your credit card</v>

2837
01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 7>info and then every time you decide you want to buy a song or you want to buy an</v>

2838
01:26:35.631 --> 01:26:35.841
<v Speaker 7>APP,</v>

2839
01:26:35.841 --> 01:26:37.010
<v Speaker 7>it goes through their system.</v>

2840
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:40.230
<v Speaker 7>And I think they're worried that if they open up the flood gates to Bitcoin,</v>

2841
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 7>they lose that 30% that they're making.</v>

2842
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:43.790
<v Speaker 7>That's a very good point.</v>

2843
01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.530
<v Speaker 7>So that even think of that because apple is,</v>

2844
01:26:45.531 --> 01:26:47.830
<v Speaker 7>that's a huge part of their businesses that I didn't get store.</v>

2845
01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:47.990
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2846
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 7>They give APP developers I believe 70% and they take 30 and with bitcoin they be</v>

2847
01:26:52.311 --> 01:26:53.144
<v Speaker 7>getting like nothing.</v>

2848
01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:57.650
<v Speaker 7>That is a very good point in a very likely reason.</v>

2849
01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:58.910
<v Speaker 7>That's a very likely motivation.</v>

2850
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.200
<v Speaker 2>The other reason is just they're worried about legal shit.</v>

2851
01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2852
01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.280
<v Speaker 2>but that's not so much concerned because if a company like apple wants to do</v>

2853
01:27:05.281 --> 01:27:05.701
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2854
01:27:05.701 --> 01:27:06.360
<v Speaker 2>they do it.</v>

2855
01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.260
<v Speaker 2>They always have,</v>

2856
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:07.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2857
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:08.730
<v Speaker 2>the ability to,</v>

2858
01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:09.690
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2859
01:27:09.690 --> 01:27:11.400
<v Speaker 7>Remain compliant and that's what they would do.</v>

2860
01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:12.900
<v Speaker 7>That's a really good point,</v>

2861
01:27:12.901 --> 01:27:13.081
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2862
01:27:13.081 --> 01:27:13.861
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even think of that,</v>

2863
01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:15.060
<v Speaker 7>but I bet you're dead right.</v>

2864
01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:17.310
<v Speaker 7>With their iTunes store for movies,</v>

2865
01:27:17.311 --> 01:27:19.080
<v Speaker 7>the iTunes store for music,</v>

2866
01:27:19.081 --> 01:27:23.250
<v Speaker 7>that's probably a considerable chunk of revenue that could very well be swept</v>

2867
01:27:23.251 --> 01:27:24.150
<v Speaker 7>away with bitcoin.</v>

2868
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:28.530
<v Speaker 7>If someone came up with an application that allowed artists to sell their music</v>

2869
01:27:28.531 --> 01:27:30.210
<v Speaker 7>directly with bit coin,</v>

2870
01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:35.690
<v Speaker 7>no iTunes and then someone ma manages a another application that ports it into</v>

2871
01:27:36.901 --> 01:27:38.010
<v Speaker 7>into iTunes.</v>

2872
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Well we're going to,</v>

2873
01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see some really weird stuff in the next couple of years.</v>

2874
01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:45.440
<v Speaker 2>We're going to see banks where it's just a bunch of bitcoin users funding the</v>

2875
01:27:45.441 --> 01:27:49.100
<v Speaker 2>bank and then the bank decides who to loan money to and so then like you'll have</v>

2876
01:27:49.101 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 2>a situation where instead of going to chase or wells Fargo,</v>

2877
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:55.370
<v Speaker 2>you'll just go to like the guide on the street who owns his own community bank</v>

2878
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:59.240
<v Speaker 2>and there'll be run by bitcoin so you know that the money he claims he has is</v>

2879
01:27:59.241 --> 01:28:00.800
<v Speaker 2>actually there because you can verify it.</v>

2880
01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 2>It's getting the picture in five years is going to look so weird compared to</v>

2881
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:05.954
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2882
01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:10.220
<v Speaker 2>The idea of driving up to an ATM machine in five years is going to be the same</v>

2883
01:28:10.221 --> 01:28:12.590
<v Speaker 2>as walking into a blockbuster and picking up a VHS tape.</v>

2884
01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:14.060
<v Speaker 2>It's just not going to be something people need to do.</v>

2885
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:18.230
<v Speaker 7>So you think that all money will be digital currency in a certain amount of</v>

2886
01:28:18.231 --> 01:28:19.064
<v Speaker 7>time?</v>

2887
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:19.993
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2888
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:20.530
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2889
01:28:20.530 --> 01:28:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I realize it's a kind of a bold prediction,</v>

2890
01:28:22.271 --> 01:28:25.660
<v Speaker 2>but you get to a point where there's no turning back and it's the same with,</v>

2891
01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:26.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2892
01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:30.700
<v Speaker 2>how many people own analogue TV still for a while it was kind of like 20% owned</v>

2893
01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:35.050
<v Speaker 2>flat screen HDTV is 80% still had the old tubes.</v>

2894
01:28:35.051 --> 01:28:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2895
01:28:35.650 --> 01:28:37.300
<v Speaker 2>And then slowly over time,</v>

2896
01:28:37.301 --> 01:28:37.781
<v Speaker 2>more and more,</v>

2897
01:28:37.781 --> 01:28:40.420
<v Speaker 2>your friends got the flat screens until eventually,</v>

2898
01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:44.410
<v Speaker 2>even your friends who don't have any money and are not up on tech trends,</v>

2899
01:28:44.411 --> 01:28:46.420
<v Speaker 2>you walk into their house and it's a brand new Samsung.</v>

2900
01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:47.283
<v Speaker 2>What happened there?</v>

2901
01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Analog always loses out to digital.</v>

2902
01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:51.190
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be the trend in anything.</v>

2903
01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:51.661
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2904
01:28:51.661 --> 01:28:54.660
<v Speaker 7>innovation always stumps out the old stupid shit.</v>

2905
01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:54.931
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2906
01:28:54.931 --> 01:28:55.471
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2907
01:28:55.471 --> 01:28:57.490
<v Speaker 7>I can't guarantee the bitcoin will be the first one.</v>

2908
01:28:57.491 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 7>And in fact it's possible that it won't be the one that that takes off finally,</v>

2909
01:29:01.531 --> 01:29:02.364
<v Speaker 7>because</v>

2910
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 2>if you look at operating systems,</v>

2911
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:08.811
<v Speaker 2>it was xerox labs created one of the first visual operating systems and Steve</v>

2912
01:29:09.601 --> 01:29:12.950
<v Speaker 2>jobs was taking a tour of the Xerox Park because they had told him like,</v>

2913
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:13.621
<v Speaker 2>you get to check this out,</v>

2914
01:29:13.621 --> 01:29:14.191
<v Speaker 2>it's really cool.</v>

2915
01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:15.024
<v Speaker 2>It's up your alley.</v>

2916
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.910
<v Speaker 2>He saw that took one look at it and it was like,</v>

2917
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:19.590
<v Speaker 2>this is what I should be doing at apple.</v>

2918
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Took that idea,</v>

2919
01:29:20.851 --> 01:29:23.280
<v Speaker 2>made the visual Apple Macintosh,</v>

2920
01:29:23.281 --> 01:29:24.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it was,</v>

2921
01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>the opera graphic user interface,</v>

2922
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what they invented,</v>

2923
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:32.070
<v Speaker 2>invented the point and click the trash bin and dragging files instead of a</v>

2924
01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:32.904
<v Speaker 2>command line.</v>

2925
01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:33.241
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2926
01:29:33.241 --> 01:29:34.410
<v Speaker 2>but even apple wasn't.</v>

2927
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:35.760
<v Speaker 2>So that was the second generation.</v>

2928
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Even that wasn't the one that took off because apple for a long time was only</v>

2929
01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:42.240
<v Speaker 2>used by a subset of designers and writers and stuff.</v>

2930
01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:43.500
<v Speaker 2>It was actually windows.</v>

2931
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It was the third one where Bill Gates saw,</v>

2932
01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:46.711
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2933
01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:49.230
<v Speaker 2>with Steve jobs had done and he goes,</v>

2934
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.280
<v Speaker 2>we got to make windows,</v>

2935
01:29:50.281 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 2>we'll make it a little bit cheaper and make it a little bit simpler for people</v>

2936
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:52.800
<v Speaker 2>to use.</v>

2937
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have to be as beautiful,</v>

2938
01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.530
<v Speaker 2>but we're going for the mass market.</v>

2939
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's the one that took off and I think be the same situation with this,</v>

2940
01:29:59.551 --> 01:30:03.240
<v Speaker 2>where bitcoin blazed the trail and maybe it'll always have a place in the same</v>

2941
01:30:03.241 --> 01:30:06.660
<v Speaker 2>way that apple is always had a place and now it's a very big place.</v>

2942
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:10.590
<v Speaker 2>So we'll have like multiple alternative currencies to choose from.</v>

2943
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:10.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2944
01:30:10.951 --> 01:30:11.910
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be really weird.</v>

2945
01:30:11.911 --> 01:30:14.400
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have like three or four currencies and you're going to use them</v>

2946
01:30:14.401 --> 01:30:15.150
<v Speaker 2>for different things.</v>

2947
01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're tipping,</v>

2948
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:17.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're tipping a podcast,</v>

2949
01:30:17.971 --> 01:30:20.910
<v Speaker 2>you might use a bitcoin,</v>

2950
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.080
<v Speaker 2>but if you're at a strip club,</v>

2951
01:30:22.081 --> 01:30:24.480
<v Speaker 2>you might use some other coin for some other reason.</v>

2952
01:30:24.481 --> 01:30:26.130
<v Speaker 2>And you know what someone's got to do though.</v>

2953
01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Someone's got to make it treason.</v>

2954
01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.270
<v Speaker 2>If you interfere with this,</v>

2955
01:30:30.271 --> 01:30:34.470
<v Speaker 2>like if you try to sabotage these digital currencies and stop innovation because</v>

2956
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:34.890
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2957
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you're worried that your whatever company you're doing,</v>

2958
01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:41.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever thing you're doing is going to somehow or another be impacted by it</v>

2959
01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:42.290
<v Speaker 2>should be treasonous.</v>

2960
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:45.000
<v Speaker 2>They like the idea that you could come in like they're,</v>

2961
01:30:45.001 --> 01:30:49.410
<v Speaker 2>and I've government agents that are coming in and sabotaging bitcoin buying and</v>

2962
01:30:49.411 --> 01:30:51.660
<v Speaker 2>selling and stealing the IRS.</v>

2963
01:30:51.661 --> 01:30:53.460
<v Speaker 2>The IRS has already ruled that it's property.</v>

2964
01:30:53.461 --> 01:30:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So if you have any government agency that tries to damage the,</v>

2965
01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:58.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2966
01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.093
<v Speaker 2>the network,</v>

2967
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.590
<v Speaker 2>then you're damaging your own citizens property.</v>

2968
01:31:01.591 --> 01:31:02.311
<v Speaker 2>And that is illegal.</v>

2969
01:31:02.311 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the most basic tenants of American capitalism is we protect</v>

2970
01:31:06.571 --> 01:31:07.470
<v Speaker 2>property rights here.</v>

2971
01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Like it might not happen in countries in South America that you get a new</v>

2972
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:10.914
<v Speaker 2>dictator,</v>

2973
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:12.540
<v Speaker 2>everybody's property gets taken over.</v>

2974
01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:13.860
<v Speaker 2>That's not what America does.</v>

2975
01:31:13.861 --> 01:31:15.570
<v Speaker 2>We actually respect property rights.</v>

2976
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's very strange to me that we would have people even think about</v>

2977
01:31:19.890 --> 01:31:20.723
<v Speaker 2>challenging that.</v>

2978
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:21.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2979
01:31:21.031 --> 01:31:21.721
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

2980
01:31:21.721 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 2>then what's going on with this mount Gox thing and that means is a giant grand</v>

2981
01:31:25.381 --> 01:31:28.560
<v Speaker 2>theft took place for $300 million in property was stolen.</v>

2982
01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:28.971
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

2983
01:31:28.971 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 2>that was a fat dumb ass who programmed his site and the wrong language and got a</v>

2984
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:36.210
<v Speaker 2>lot of market share because he was one of the first people there.</v>

2985
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:37.430
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2986
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.290
<v Speaker 2>if you look at just traditional money,</v>

2987
01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:41.640
<v Speaker 2>US dollars in euros,</v>

2988
01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:43.050
<v Speaker 2>it attracts a lot of criminals,</v>

2989
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:43.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2990
01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.600
<v Speaker 2>surprise when you're dealing with billions of dollars.</v>

2991
01:31:45.601 --> 01:31:47.340
<v Speaker 2>The kinds of people who are attracted to that,</v>

2992
01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.660
<v Speaker 2>some of them are honest,</v>

2993
01:31:48.661 --> 01:31:49.560
<v Speaker 2>some of them are not.</v>

2994
01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.290
<v Speaker 2>And how many failures have we had within the dollar?</v>

2995
01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:53.220
<v Speaker 2>We had a,</v>

2996
01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:53.571
<v Speaker 2>what was it,</v>

2997
01:31:53.571 --> 01:31:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Lehman Brothers went under,</v>

2998
01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:58.860
<v Speaker 2>bear Stearns had to be bought out by chase for like pennies on the dollar or</v>

2999
01:31:58.861 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>like two bucks a share or something.</v>

3000
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.390
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3001
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:05.590
<v Speaker 2>we had Bernie made off like scams related to money or nothing new and that's not</v>

3002
01:32:05.591 --> 01:32:06.550
<v Speaker 2>going to go away with bitcoin.</v>

3003
01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:09.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just that now we're going to have a little bit more accountability.</v>

3004
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:14.400
<v Speaker 2>And I personally just like to see these old fucks in Davos.</v>

3005
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I like to see them sweat a little bit for the first time because they have given</v>

3006
01:32:19.151 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 2>my generation more than a trillion dollars of student loan debt that we can't</v>

3007
01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:23.170
<v Speaker 2>pay off.</v>

3008
01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:23.831
<v Speaker 2>And when I say we,</v>

3009
01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about everybody.</v>

3010
01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any student loan debt,</v>

3011
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>but they've done that.</v>

3012
01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:31.810
<v Speaker 2>We're all pretty much indentured servants to the Zombie banks,</v>

3013
01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>which if you look into them as people like Matt Taibbi had done their semi</v>

3014
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:36.211
<v Speaker 2>insolvent,</v>

3015
01:32:36.211 --> 01:32:37.570
<v Speaker 2>they are corrupt to the core,</v>

3016
01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.970
<v Speaker 2>they are politically entrenched and they're not efficient.</v>

3017
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:40.691
<v Speaker 2>That's what bothers me.</v>

3018
01:32:40.691 --> 01:32:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Like all the other shit is all well and good.</v>

3019
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just not efficient.</v>

3020
01:32:43.901 --> 01:32:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to be in credit cards,</v>

3021
01:32:45.641 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I had a credit card website where it would rank deals for people and I honestly</v>

3022
01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:52.810
<v Speaker 2>believe that the time that plastic is the best way to buy things more efficient</v>

3023
01:32:52.811 --> 01:32:53.291
<v Speaker 2>than cash.</v>

3024
01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:54.130
<v Speaker 2>You have a record of it.</v>

3025
01:32:54.131 --> 01:32:54.551
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

3026
01:32:54.551 --> 01:32:57.460
<v Speaker 2>come tax time what you spent on business stuff.</v>

3027
01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:58.780
<v Speaker 2>When this came around,</v>

3028
01:32:58.781 --> 01:33:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I instantly realized,</v>

3029
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh okay,</v>

3030
01:33:00.911 --> 01:33:02.110
<v Speaker 2>credit cards days are numbered.</v>

3031
01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:03.350
<v Speaker 2>It might not be an,</v>

3032
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3033
01:33:03.761 --> 01:33:04.451
<v Speaker 2>it might take a year,</v>

3034
01:33:04.451 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 2>it might take five years,</v>

3035
01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:06.124
<v Speaker 2>but they're done.</v>

3036
01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:07.490
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3037
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:07.791
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3038
01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:08.250
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3039
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:08.870
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3040
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:10.970
<v Speaker 5>digital currency without a doubt,</v>

3041
01:33:10.971 --> 01:33:12.200
<v Speaker 5>threatens the paradigm.</v>

3042
01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:12.401
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

3043
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:13.440
<v Speaker 5>it threatens the,</v>

3044
01:33:13.441 --> 01:33:14.960
<v Speaker 5>the situation that they have,</v>

3045
01:33:14.961 --> 01:33:15.091
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3046
01:33:15.091 --> 01:33:16.220
<v Speaker 5>the strangle hold they have.</v>

3047
01:33:16.221 --> 01:33:20.360
<v Speaker 5>And once you see companies like tiger direct starting to sell computers and</v>

3048
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:23.140
<v Speaker 5>different Vegas casinos are starting to accept it,</v>

3049
01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:25.280
<v Speaker 5>overstocks a huge company and they accept it.</v>

3050
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:25.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3051
01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.420
<v Speaker 5>It's going to get weird.</v>

3052
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:27.590
<v Speaker 5>It's going to get real weird.</v>

3053
01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:27.911
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3054
01:33:27.911 --> 01:33:32.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm really curious to see what happens and really curious to see what the blow</v>

3055
01:33:32.091 --> 01:33:33.140
<v Speaker 5>back is going to be.</v>

3056
01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:38.170
<v Speaker 5>What sort of federal attack on a bitcoin and you have a really good point that</v>

3057
01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:42.740
<v Speaker 5>there's always been corruption as far as regular money goes,</v>

3058
01:33:42.741 --> 01:33:43.640
<v Speaker 5>far as accepted,</v>

3059
01:33:43.641 --> 01:33:44.720
<v Speaker 5>conventional money goes.</v>

3060
01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:46.830
<v Speaker 5>There's always been massive amounts of corruption.</v>

3061
01:33:46.831 --> 01:33:49.550
<v Speaker 5>There's always been massive amounts of theft was always been problems,</v>

3062
01:33:49.670 --> 01:33:51.950
<v Speaker 5>but no one has said we can't have money anymore.</v>

3063
01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.180
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's corrupt.</v>

3064
01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:54.380
<v Speaker 5>Bernie Madoff fucked it up.</v>

3065
01:33:54.381 --> 01:33:55.030
<v Speaker 5>No more money.</v>

3066
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3067
01:33:55.181 --> 01:33:55.751
<v Speaker 2>How many people,</v>

3068
01:33:55.751 --> 01:33:56.021
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3069
01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:56.741
<v Speaker 2>Rubber checks.</v>

3070
01:33:56.741 --> 01:33:58.620
<v Speaker 2>That's something that never happens with bitcoin.</v>

3071
01:33:58.630 --> 01:34:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't send you a rubber Bitcoin,</v>

3072
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't send you a fake bitcoin.</v>

3073
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:03.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a real good point.</v>

3074
01:34:03.761 --> 01:34:04.600
<v Speaker 2>And so like just,</v>

3075
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 2>if you ignore all the political implications and that's all you focus on,</v>

3076
01:34:08.591 --> 01:34:11.680
<v Speaker 2>like do you want to have a technology where there's a really good chance of</v>

3077
01:34:11.681 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 2>chargeback fraud,</v>

3078
01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:15.670
<v Speaker 2>which is the case with credit cards or a rubber check with checks.</v>

3079
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3080
01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>do you want that or do you want the thing where there's zero chance of that</v>

3081
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 2>consumers eventually,</v>

3082
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when it's going to happen.</v>

3083
01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 2>It might not even be this year.</v>

3084
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Consumers over time,</v>

3085
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 2>once they tire of the propaganda they're seeing on TV,</v>

3086
01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:28.331
<v Speaker 2>we'll go,</v>

3087
01:34:28.331 --> 01:34:28.721
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

3088
01:34:28.721 --> 01:34:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I want the one where it's 100% certain,</v>

3089
01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the one where I don't know what the fuck's happening</v>

3090
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.971
<v Speaker 5>three days.</v>

3091
01:34:32.971 --> 01:34:33.601
<v Speaker 5>So this is Mt.</v>

3092
01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:38.400
<v Speaker 5>Gox guy fucked up and courted coded his site and a shitty way when all that</v>

3093
01:34:38.401 --> 01:34:39.420
<v Speaker 5>money's gone,</v>

3094
01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:41.640
<v Speaker 5>all that $300 million in Bitcoin is gone.</v>

3095
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:44.520
<v Speaker 5>Our people investigating that like it's a crime.</v>

3096
01:34:44.521 --> 01:34:46.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean are they should be.</v>

3097
01:34:46.110 --> 01:34:46.741
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they are.</v>

3098
01:34:46.741 --> 01:34:49.230
<v Speaker 5>I think the US wants to drag his ass over here.</v>

3099
01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:50.280
<v Speaker 5>Is he an American?</v>

3100
01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.360
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3101
01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:51.840
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

3102
01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:52.441
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno what he is.</v>

3103
01:34:52.441 --> 01:34:54.090
<v Speaker 5>I know his company was based in Japan.</v>

3104
01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:56.040
<v Speaker 5>It looks like he's an American.</v>

3105
01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:56.330
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't,</v>

3106
01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:57.180
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't look Asian.</v>

3107
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3108
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3109
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.830
<v Speaker 5>the Mt Gox thing though is if,</v>

3110
01:35:00.831 --> 01:35:01.131
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3111
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:02.480
<v Speaker 5>if that is property,</v>

3112
01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:05.000
<v Speaker 5>that's a huge piece of theft.</v>

3113
01:35:05.001 --> 01:35:07.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean it should be something that prosecutors go after.</v>

3114
01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Is it one of those gray areas where he's looking around going,</v>

3115
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:11.780
<v Speaker 5>what's a crime taking place here?</v>

3116
01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:12.041
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3117
01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to go after him.</v>

3118
01:35:13.181 --> 01:35:18.181
<v Speaker 2>I think that he's going to be one of the examples that the government makes is</v>

3119
01:35:18.881 --> 01:35:19.031
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3120
01:35:19.031 --> 01:35:19.811
<v Speaker 2>you can't do this.</v>

3121
01:35:19.811 --> 01:35:20.561
<v Speaker 2>This is fucked up.</v>

3122
01:35:20.561 --> 01:35:23.230
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it because there's actually a lot of money,</v>

3123
01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3124
01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.380
<v Speaker 2>that's supposed to go into bitcoin over the summer.</v>

3125
01:35:26.410 --> 01:35:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Institutional money.</v>

3126
01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:30.850
<v Speaker 2>When a second market comes online,</v>

3127
01:35:30.851 --> 01:35:35.620
<v Speaker 2>which is supposed to be like the first really credible exchange that big banks</v>

3128
01:35:35.621 --> 01:35:36.850
<v Speaker 2>would be comfortable using.</v>

3129
01:35:37.150 --> 01:35:38.020
<v Speaker 2>But here's a big,</v>

3130
01:35:38.021 --> 01:35:38.351
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

3131
01:35:38.351 --> 01:35:39.184
<v Speaker 2>stupid head.</v>

3132
01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:42.490
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he ate some bitcoins and all the big crazy</v>

3133
01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:43.980
<v Speaker 5>$300 million in bitcoins.</v>

3134
01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:45.610
<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

3135
01:35:45.610 --> 01:35:50.080
<v Speaker 5>Gox is set to liquidate as court denies rehabilitation,</v>

3136
01:35:50.081 --> 01:35:51.070
<v Speaker 5>so they're going to liquidate.</v>

3137
01:35:51.071 --> 01:35:52.210
<v Speaker 5>Now what does that mean?</v>

3138
01:35:52.570 --> 01:35:53.900
<v Speaker 5>Once the world's biggest beer?</v>

3139
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.880
<v Speaker 5>This is seven hours ago.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This came out once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

3142
01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:03.550
<v Speaker 5>Gox is likely to be liquidated after a Tokyo court dismissed the companies bid</v>

3143
01:36:03.551 --> 01:36:05.140
<v Speaker 5>to resuscitate it's business.</v>

3149
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:26.770
<v Speaker 5>Aki Kobiashi said in a settlement,</v>

3150
01:36:27.190 --> 01:36:29.080
<v Speaker 5>a statement published on the Mt.</v>

3151
01:36:29.081 --> 01:36:29.710
<v Speaker 5>Gox Whiteside.</v>

3152
01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:31.150
<v Speaker 5>Look at that big fat stupid head.</v>

3153
01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.040
<v Speaker 5>He looks so dumb too.</v>

3154
01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:35.380
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't just look like a an overweight guy.</v>

3155
01:36:35.381 --> 01:36:36.490
<v Speaker 5>He looks like a dunce.</v>

3156
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:37.383
<v Speaker 5>Nice hair.</v>

3157
01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:38.950
<v Speaker 5>Bad.</v>

3158
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:39.091
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3159
01:36:39.091 --> 01:36:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean he'd racy jumped from what magic the gathering to managing one of the</v>

3160
01:36:43.381 --> 01:36:46.440
<v Speaker 2>most high traffic exchanges in the world.</v>

3161
01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:46.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3162
01:36:46.781 --> 01:36:48.660
<v Speaker 2>What does that guy going to do for a job after this?</v>

3163
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3164
01:36:48.991 --> 01:36:49.950
<v Speaker 2>if he has any money at all,</v>

3165
01:36:49.951 --> 01:36:51.810
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna find it and go give me that pitch.</v>

3166
01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Fucking my bitcoins.</v>

3167
01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:53.973
<v Speaker 2>Smack him in the head.</v>

3168
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3169
01:36:54.181 --> 01:36:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he has a lot of people who are not happy with them.</v>

3170
01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.020
<v Speaker 2>You better stay over there man.</v>

3171
01:36:58.050 --> 01:36:58.591
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3172
01:36:58.591 --> 01:37:02.430
<v Speaker 2>a all my kind of political rabble rousing about how bitcoin will change the</v>

3173
01:37:02.431 --> 01:37:03.001
<v Speaker 2>landscape.</v>

3174
01:37:03.001 --> 01:37:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I just want to put in a um,</v>

3175
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:11.100
<v Speaker 2>kind of disclaimer that in five years you might still see chase and bank of</v>

3176
01:37:11.101 --> 01:37:13.980
<v Speaker 2>America because there's a chance that if they see it taking off fast enough,</v>

3177
01:37:13.981 --> 01:37:17.850
<v Speaker 2>they'll adopt it because for them it's just the new payment technology like they</v>

3178
01:37:17.851 --> 01:37:19.140
<v Speaker 2>use visa and mastercard.</v>

3179
01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:23.790
<v Speaker 2>They could just as easily issue a bitcoin debit card and base it off of that</v>

3180
01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:26.940
<v Speaker 2>network and find a way to make money off of it by providing people,</v>

3181
01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:27.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3182
01:37:27.121 --> 01:37:29.220
<v Speaker 2>the security of your not dealing with some fat ass.</v>

3183
01:37:29.221 --> 01:37:29.731
<v Speaker 2>In Japan,</v>

3184
01:37:29.731 --> 01:37:31.440
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with Bank of America,</v>

3185
01:37:31.441 --> 01:37:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with chase.</v>

3186
01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:33.450
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>

3187
01:37:33.451 --> 01:37:37.830
<v Speaker 2>But one thing that's very clear is that it's going to be completely different</v>

3188
01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:38.020
<v Speaker 2>print</v>

3189
01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:38.853
<v Speaker 5>and a couple of years.</v>

3190
01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:39.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3191
01:37:39.851 --> 01:37:41.140
<v Speaker 5>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

3192
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.880
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating stuff,</v>

3193
01:37:42.881 --> 01:37:43.181
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3194
01:37:43.181 --> 01:37:47.740
<v Speaker 5>This is such an interesting time to be alive because there's so much going on</v>

3195
01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.580
<v Speaker 5>and there's so much change and there's so many people that are wondering like,</v>

3196
01:37:51.581 --> 01:37:52.840
<v Speaker 5>which way is it going to go?</v>

3197
01:37:52.841 --> 01:37:55.030
<v Speaker 5>And people that are looking at it in a negative way,</v>

3198
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.150
<v Speaker 5>people that are looking at it,</v>

3199
01:37:56.151 --> 01:37:56.984
<v Speaker 5>it promising,</v>

3200
01:37:57.630 --> 01:37:57.961
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3201
01:37:57.961 --> 01:37:58.330
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3202
01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:00.190
<v Speaker 2>well what's really cool to think about if you look at,</v>

3203
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:00.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3204
01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:04.480
<v Speaker 2>where a lot of the money came from in Silicon Valley for these really innovative</v>

3205
01:38:04.481 --> 01:38:05.710
<v Speaker 2>companies we're seeing today,</v>

3206
01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.960
<v Speaker 2>it started with paypal where Peter Teal and a Ilan mosque,</v>

3207
01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I think a couple of other guys,</v>

3208
01:38:12.341 --> 01:38:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Max something made billions of dollars off of their paypal venture because</v>

3209
01:38:17.081 --> 01:38:20.680
<v Speaker 2>paypal was at the time a challenge to the status quo.</v>

3210
01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:21.311
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3211
01:38:21.311 --> 01:38:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you don't need an expensive merchant.</v>

3212
01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3213
01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:24.221
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3214
01:38:24.221 --> 01:38:26.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever that thing was that merchants had to have,</v>

3215
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:27.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3216
01:38:27.010 --> 01:38:28.330
<v Speaker 2>to process credit cards,</v>

3217
01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:29.600
<v Speaker 2>a merchant account,</v>

3218
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.433
<v Speaker 2>you don't need that.</v>

3219
01:38:30.610 --> 01:38:33.340
<v Speaker 2>All you need is an email address and we verify some stuff,</v>

3220
01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:34.360
<v Speaker 2>link it to your bank account,</v>

3221
01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:36.640
<v Speaker 2>and now you have a form of digital money.</v>

3222
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.451
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3223
01:38:37.451 --> 01:38:37.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3224
01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:38.920
<v Speaker 2>that was 15 years ago.</v>

3225
01:38:38.921 --> 01:38:40.840
<v Speaker 2>So we're overdue for kind of a new,</v>

3226
01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:43.240
<v Speaker 2>a challenge to the status quo.</v>

3227
01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.550
<v Speaker 2>And my point is that when paypal happened,</v>

3228
01:38:45.551 --> 01:38:49.090
<v Speaker 2>it made a lot of people rich and that money ended up getting invested in things</v>

3229
01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:50.500
<v Speaker 2>that have nothing to do with currency.</v>

3230
01:38:50.501 --> 01:38:55.501
<v Speaker 2>It was invested in a Tesla and space x and all these next generation companies.</v>

3231
01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.850
<v Speaker 2>And we will probably see the same thing.</v>

3232
01:38:57.851 --> 01:39:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll see people get rich off of this and then that money,</v>

3233
01:39:00.431 --> 01:39:05.080
<v Speaker 2>since they're young and not compromise old people will go into really bizarre</v>

3234
01:39:05.081 --> 01:39:07.690
<v Speaker 2>things where the dividend is just going to be massive.</v>

3235
01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3236
01:39:08.650 --> 01:39:10.120
<v Speaker 2>what I was getting at is that</v>

3237
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:13.910
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of folks that look at the possibilities in the future and look at</v>

3238
01:39:13.911 --> 01:39:14.251
<v Speaker 5>all and they,</v>

3239
01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:15.620
<v Speaker 5>they see only negative.</v>

3240
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:17.450
<v Speaker 5>And as a very unfortunate,</v>

3241
01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.313
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

3242
01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.180
<v Speaker 5>that was our friend Michael Rupert,</v>

3243
01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:21.020
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3244
01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.000
<v Speaker 5>who he,</v>

3245
01:39:23.001 --> 01:39:23.834
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3246
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:27.680
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another a couple of days ago committed suicide,</v>

3247
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3248
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:29.180
<v Speaker 5>by a gunshot.</v>

3249
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:30.223
<v Speaker 5>Allegedly.</v>

3250
01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:30.440
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

3251
01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's a lot of people out there think he was murdered.</v>

3252
01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:33.560
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3253
01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.450
<v Speaker 5>there always is going to be on those things.</v>

3254
01:39:35.451 --> 01:39:36.980
<v Speaker 5>But I know he wasn't a happy guy.</v>

3255
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.731
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3256
01:39:37.731 --> 01:39:38.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3257
01:39:38.150 --> 01:39:40.220
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the way he looked at the world,</v>

3258
01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:41.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean everything he saw,</v>

3259
01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.220
<v Speaker 5>he saw that movie collapse.</v>

3260
01:39:43.221 --> 01:39:44.090
<v Speaker 5>It's him sitting there,</v>

3261
01:39:44.091 --> 01:39:44.930
<v Speaker 5>chain smoking,</v>

3262
01:39:44.931 --> 01:39:45.980
<v Speaker 5>talking about the end.</v>

3263
01:39:46.190 --> 01:39:49.610
<v Speaker 5>And it's incredibly compelling cause he was a very articulate guy.</v>

3264
01:39:49.611 --> 01:39:50.480
<v Speaker 5>He was very,</v>

3265
01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.100
<v Speaker 5>he was very believable.</v>

3266
01:39:52.101 --> 01:39:53.150
<v Speaker 5>He was charismatic,</v>

3267
01:39:53.151 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 5>he was passionate and he knew a lot of things.</v>

3268
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.990
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3269
01:39:56.990 --> 01:40:00.920
<v Speaker 5>his version was the sky is falling and you know,</v>

3270
01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.060
<v Speaker 5>he's wrong about a lot of things.</v>

3271
01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:03.530
<v Speaker 5>He was wrong about a lot of predictions.</v>

3272
01:40:03.531 --> 01:40:07.910
<v Speaker 5>He was wrong about a lot of his thoughts on peak oil and a lot of other things</v>

3273
01:40:07.911 --> 01:40:09.980
<v Speaker 5>that he thought were going to come to a conclusion in our,</v>

3274
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.551
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3275
01:40:10.551 --> 01:40:13.580
<v Speaker 5>in just the last decade and just fuck everything up.</v>

3276
01:40:13.581 --> 01:40:14.414
<v Speaker 5>And it didn't happen.</v>

3277
01:40:14.710 --> 01:40:15.080
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3278
01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.500
<v Speaker 5>I found out about him from a book that he had put out.</v>

3279
01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:19.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3280
01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.040
<v Speaker 5>crossing the Rubicon is a long time ago and it was all about same sort of thing.</v>

3281
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

3282
01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:25.521
<v Speaker 5>it's always,</v>

3283
01:40:25.521 --> 01:40:26.480
<v Speaker 5>it was always negative.</v>

3284
01:40:26.481 --> 01:40:31.481
<v Speaker 5>It was always doom and it was always gloom and he wasn't well the last few years</v>

3285
01:40:31.761 --> 01:40:36.050
<v Speaker 5>of his life and apparently decided to end it on his own terms.</v>

3286
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:37.041
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3287
01:40:37.041 --> 01:40:37.874
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3288
01:40:38.150 --> 01:40:39.080
<v Speaker 5>it's unfortunate.</v>

3289
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:40.190
<v Speaker 5>I really liked that guy.</v>

3290
01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:41.420
<v Speaker 5>He was a sweetie.</v>

3291
01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:44.300
<v Speaker 5>He was a really cool guy to be around who's fun and it was warm.</v>

3292
01:40:44.301 --> 01:40:45.134
<v Speaker 5>It's friendly,</v>

3293
01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:46.820
<v Speaker 5>like the hug people.</v>

3294
01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:47.181
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

3295
01:40:47.181 --> 01:40:48.950
<v Speaker 5>it was a real nice guy to be around.</v>

3296
01:40:48.951 --> 01:40:49.401
<v Speaker 5>It was unfair.</v>

3297
01:40:49.401 --> 01:40:49.641
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3298
01:40:49.641 --> 01:40:51.320
<v Speaker 5>I enjoyed doing podcasts with him too.</v>

3299
01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:52.453
<v Speaker 5>He was a,</v>

3300
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy to him,</v>

3301
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:55.840
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see the doom and gloom.</v>

3302
01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:59.560
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see that side of the way he did and I didn't agree with them on things,</v>

3303
01:40:59.561 --> 01:41:03.250
<v Speaker 5>but he was a very pleasant guy to be around and I'm going to miss him.</v>

3304
01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.433
<v Speaker 5>Sucks.</v>

3305
01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:07.120
<v Speaker 5>Sorry to hear about that.</v>

3306
01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:07.570
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

3307
01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:07.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3308
01:41:07.841 --> 01:41:09.520
<v Speaker 5>it sucks when people look,</v>

3309
01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:10.661
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3310
01:41:10.661 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3311
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:15.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what sucks more going on when you're miserable as fuck or ending it</v>

3312
01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:16.950
<v Speaker 2>and your own shirt,</v>

3313
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:19.770
<v Speaker 2>you should always go on because the circumstances always change.</v>

3314
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:20.821
<v Speaker 2>So Ab,</v>

3315
01:41:20.821 --> 01:41:22.380
<v Speaker 2>but hunter s Thompson was done.</v>

3316
01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing about that guy.</v>

3317
01:41:24.031 --> 01:41:25.020
<v Speaker 2>A lot of his issue,</v>

3318
01:41:25.021 --> 01:41:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it was physical pain and that's different.</v>

3319
01:41:26.791 --> 01:41:27.624
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the,</v>

3320
01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:28.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3321
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:32.340
<v Speaker 2>not that I have any say of what people do or really even care,</v>

3322
01:41:32.341 --> 01:41:33.620
<v Speaker 2>but that's one of the,</v>

3323
01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:34.560
<v Speaker 2>for me morally,</v>

3324
01:41:34.561 --> 01:41:36.810
<v Speaker 2>it's where I think that suicide is okay.</v>

3325
01:41:36.811 --> 01:41:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're in so much pain and you've pursued every avenue and modern</v>

3326
01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:44.580
<v Speaker 2>medicine can't help you reduce that pain and it's physical pain rather than just</v>

3327
01:41:44.581 --> 01:41:45.414
<v Speaker 2>mental pain,</v>

3328
01:41:46.170 --> 01:41:47.820
<v Speaker 2>then I don't really have a problem with.</v>

3329
01:41:47.821 --> 01:41:48.151
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

3330
01:41:48.151 --> 01:41:49.170
<v Speaker 2>and even in Switzerland now,</v>

3331
01:41:49.171 --> 01:41:53.070
<v Speaker 2>there some kind of assisted suicide program and I think we gotta be humane.</v>

3332
01:41:53.071 --> 01:41:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Like if we put down an animal because it's in a lot of pain,</v>

3333
01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:57.840
<v Speaker 2>why can't we let an old guy do the same thing?</v>

3334
01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:58.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3335
01:41:58.491 --> 01:41:59.600
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubt about it.</v>

3336
01:41:59.601 --> 01:42:03.680
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely a time where you should be able to end it on your own terms.</v>

3337
01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Why should someone have to like choke on their own blood until their lungs fill</v>

3338
01:42:09.441 --> 01:42:10.130
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

3339
01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Let people die with dignity.</v>

3340
01:42:11.331 --> 01:42:11.541
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3341
01:42:11.541 --> 01:42:14.840
<v Speaker 2>like at a certain point like if the cancer treatment failed or whatever it is,</v>

3342
01:42:15.650 --> 01:42:16.730
<v Speaker 2>give that person a choice.</v>

3343
01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:18.660
<v Speaker 5>I agree and it's another thing we're,</v>

3344
01:42:18.661 --> 01:42:20.820
<v Speaker 5>why should someone be able to tell you what to do?</v>

3345
01:42:20.821 --> 01:42:22.740
<v Speaker 5>Y I mean the idea that it's illegal.</v>

3346
01:42:22.741 --> 01:42:23.580
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious anyway.</v>

3347
01:42:23.581 --> 01:42:25.500
<v Speaker 5>You're going gonna lock him in jail after he kills himself.</v>

3348
01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:26.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's stupid.</v>

3349
01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.890
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid to make suicide illegal.</v>

3350
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:33.720
<v Speaker 5>We need way more mental health counseling everywhere.</v>

3351
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:38.870
<v Speaker 5>We need a lot more thought into whatever it is.</v>

3352
01:42:39.211 --> 01:42:42.660
<v Speaker 5>It's wrong with people that causes them to be massively depressed.</v>

3353
01:42:42.661 --> 01:42:45.900
<v Speaker 5>A lot more thought into is it just the way we live our lives?</v>

3354
01:42:45.901 --> 01:42:50.901
<v Speaker 5>Is it just the idea of s sitting in some fucking office doing some mundane job</v>

3355
01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:57.291
<v Speaker 5>that you hate being stuck in this traffic where you feel completely out of</v>

3356
01:42:57.451 --> 01:42:57.871
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>

3357
01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.910
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any control over your environment.</v>

3358
01:42:59.911 --> 01:43:03.390
<v Speaker 5>Just stuck and this massive people who are also doing the same thing.</v>

3359
01:43:03.391 --> 01:43:05.430
<v Speaker 5>And you look around and no one seems to be happy.</v>

3360
01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Is it just that,</v>

3361
01:43:06.511 --> 01:43:07.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3362
01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.280
<v Speaker 5>is that something we need to fix?</v>

3363
01:43:08.281 --> 01:43:09.600
<v Speaker 5>Is the idea of cities are,</v>

3364
01:43:09.601 --> 01:43:14.601
<v Speaker 5>these are these ridiculous ideas that we should abandon condensed humans to a</v>

3365
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.800
<v Speaker 5>neatly packed area?</v>

3366
01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Does that make us crazy?</v>

3367
01:43:18.241 --> 01:43:19.800
<v Speaker 5>Are we even designed for it?</v>

3368
01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.960
<v Speaker 5>There's all these things it needs to be considered.</v>

3369
01:43:22.410 --> 01:43:26.550
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of what we're doing is not well thought out.</v>

3370
01:43:26.630 --> 01:43:29.070
<v Speaker 5>It was a lot of what we're doing in society that's not,</v>

3371
01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.200
<v Speaker 5>not the most intelligent,</v>

3372
01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.191
<v Speaker 5>innovative,</v>

3373
01:43:32.191 --> 01:43:33.660
<v Speaker 5>creative way to go about it.</v>

3374
01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3375
01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:35.981
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3376
01:43:35.981 --> 01:43:36.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3377
01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.241
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>

3378
01:43:37.241 --> 01:43:40.390
<v Speaker 2>but I think that a lot of these problems have always been a part of the human</v>

3379
01:43:40.391 --> 01:43:44.410
<v Speaker 2>experience and we just have to learn how to deal with it and get each other</v>

3380
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:44.950
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

3381
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:45.391
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't,</v>

3382
01:43:45.391 --> 01:43:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the Pr,</v>

3383
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I used to think like,</v>

3384
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3385
01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.190
<v Speaker 2>if I want to be happier,</v>

3386
01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I have to just reduce the amount of stress in my life,</v>

3387
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.180
<v Speaker 2>but things I'm doing I enjoy doing.</v>

3388
01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:54.410
<v Speaker 2>And as a byproduct,</v>

3389
01:43:54.411 --> 01:43:55.041
<v Speaker 2>they're stress.</v>

3390
01:43:55.041 --> 01:43:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3391
01:43:55.230 --> 01:43:55.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3392
01:43:55.581 --> 01:43:58.760
<v Speaker 2>like I enjoy putting out controversial articles that make people think about</v>

3393
01:43:58.761 --> 01:43:59.360
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3394
01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 2>The result of that is somebody in the comments section calls me up cock sucker,</v>

3395
01:44:02.271 --> 01:44:02.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3396
01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:03.920
<v Speaker 2>like that's how it goes.</v>

3397
01:44:03.921 --> 01:44:06.740
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not willing to not write the article because of the stress.</v>

3398
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:07.431
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3399
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:07.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3400
01:44:07.761 --> 01:44:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that instead of eliminating all the problems,</v>

3401
01:44:09.801 --> 01:44:13.430
<v Speaker 2>we just have to be there for each other and a lot of people feel isolated.</v>

3402
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:14.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's where you get these,</v>

3403
01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:15.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3404
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 2>tragedies is people no longer have anybody else to do the feedback loop because</v>

3405
01:44:19.701 --> 01:44:20.361
<v Speaker 2>a lot of shit is like,</v>

3406
01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:20.940
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>

3407
01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about that guy,</v>

3408
01:44:22.251 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to speak as if I do.</v>

3409
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 2>But if he had somebody who could tell him,</v>

3410
01:44:26.811 --> 01:44:26.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3411
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:27.231
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3412
01:44:27.231 --> 01:44:28.700
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible what you're saying about the government.</v>

3413
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:33.920
<v Speaker 2>But 2000 years ago they were crucifying people and now they just drag activists</v>

3414
01:44:33.921 --> 01:44:34.790
<v Speaker 2>through the court system.</v>

3415
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:36.470
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that's a good thing.</v>

3416
01:44:36.471 --> 01:44:38.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to put people in jail and bullshit charges.</v>

3417
01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit better than crucifying people you don't like.</v>

3418
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.910
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the trend that humanities on,</v>

3419
01:44:44.150 --> 01:44:45.290
<v Speaker 2>it's an improving trend.</v>

3420
01:44:45.291 --> 01:44:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible not to see that like the mouth and model of human behavior and</v>

3421
01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 2>human existence has been proven false.</v>

3422
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get higher population,</v>

3423
01:44:53.811 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 2>you don't get people starving and destruction.</v>

3424
01:44:56.601 --> 01:45:00.140
<v Speaker 2>You get more innovation because there are more minds coming together and you get</v>

3425
01:45:00.141 --> 01:45:02.990
<v Speaker 2>things that you didn't even think were possible.</v>

3426
01:45:02.991 --> 01:45:03.824
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>

3427
01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:08.570
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a serious food crisis in the first world anyways because we've</v>

3428
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.610
<v Speaker 2>always been able to scale the technology.</v>

3429
01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:13.970
<v Speaker 2>We have more people and then we get better at farming and then we have more</v>

3430
01:45:13.971 --> 01:45:17.030
<v Speaker 2>people and they create more innovation which leads to better farming and so on.</v>

3431
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:18.141
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3432
01:45:18.141 --> 01:45:18.341
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3433
01:45:18.341 --> 01:45:19.550
<v Speaker 5>I completely agree.</v>

3434
01:45:19.551 --> 01:45:22.970
<v Speaker 5>I hate that Malthusian that's great word by the way.</v>

3435
01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.081
<v Speaker 5>I hate,</v>

3436
01:45:24.081 --> 01:45:25.370
<v Speaker 5>I hate that approach.</v>

3437
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.570
<v Speaker 5>It's lazy.</v>

3438
01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:26.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3439
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:28.970
<v Speaker 5>I think if you really do objective,</v>

3440
01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:29.661
<v Speaker 5>we look at it,</v>

3441
01:45:29.661 --> 01:45:32.690
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of good shit about human beings today.</v>

3442
01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:32.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3443
01:45:32.901 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the best times ever to be alive.</v>

3444
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.320
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly scary.</v>

3445
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.690
<v Speaker 5>There's certainly we're,</v>

3446
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:40.520
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of potential for disaster.</v>

3447
01:45:40.521 --> 01:45:44.060
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of potential for catastrophe that's manmade man created,</v>

3448
01:45:44.061 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 5>whether it's nuclear or war or whatever it is.</v>

3449
01:45:48.150 --> 01:45:49.400
<v Speaker 5>It could be po</v>

3450
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:50.060
<v Speaker 2>terror.</v>

3451
01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on one of your podcasts recently where you said that the</v>

3452
01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Fukushima response,</v>

3453
01:45:55.131 --> 01:45:56.660
<v Speaker 2>they covered it up like a little child.</v>

3454
01:45:56.661 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 2>He had done something wrong.</v>

3455
01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:57.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3456
01:45:57.981 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 2>they swept it under the rug.</v>

3457
01:45:59.001 --> 01:45:59.620
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

3458
01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:00.710
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do.</v>

3459
01:46:00.711 --> 01:46:02.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing with the BP oil spill.</v>

3460
01:46:02.811 --> 01:46:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Like when that happened,</v>

3461
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:08.420
<v Speaker 2>we just watched it like a kid watching the milk falling off of a table after you</v>

3462
01:46:08.421 --> 01:46:09.320
<v Speaker 2>spill your cereal,</v>

3463
01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.400
<v Speaker 2>how long do we fucking watch that thing on CNN and nobody really did anything.</v>

3464
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:17.240
<v Speaker 2>And then finally they came in and like tried to clamp it and took days and</v>

3465
01:46:17.241 --> 01:46:18.380
<v Speaker 2>you're just watching it spill out.</v>

3466
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:20.720
<v Speaker 2>They should have imploded that thing on day one,</v>

3467
01:46:20.721 --> 01:46:22.790
<v Speaker 2>which they didn't want to do cause they would have lost a lot of revenue.</v>

3468
01:46:23.010 --> 01:46:23.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3469
01:46:23.401 --> 01:46:24.710
<v Speaker 5>they probably should have fit.</v>

3470
01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.340
<v Speaker 5>Well they wanted to launch on nuke at it.</v>

3471
01:46:26.341 --> 01:46:26.611
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3472
01:46:26.611 --> 01:46:27.960
<v Speaker 5>And just blow the whole thing up.</v>

3473
01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:32.430
<v Speaker 5>Another bad idea because the idea wasn't that one of the ideas of blowing it up</v>

3474
01:46:32.490 --> 01:46:34.950
<v Speaker 5>that way it would seal the well somehow or another.</v>

3475
01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:35.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3476
01:46:35.181 --> 01:46:38.450
<v Speaker 2>there's also like there are all these beautiful parts of the world that have</v>

3477
01:46:38.451 --> 01:46:41.690
<v Speaker 2>been radiated from our nuclear tests.</v>

3478
01:46:41.691 --> 01:46:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Back when we didn't know what we were doing,</v>

3479
01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:45.800
<v Speaker 2>it was like the French military in the u s military.</v>

3480
01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:47.840
<v Speaker 2>We're just picking beautiful deserted islands,</v>

3481
01:46:47.841 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>which today would be worth know today</v>

3482
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.080
<v Speaker 1>would be the places that Richard Branson hangs out in.</v>

3483
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.410
<v Speaker 1>But instead they're just these desolate test sites.</v>

3484
01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It's so gross and dumb that we did that in the first place.</v>

3485
01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that animated Gif of all of the nuclear explosions that have</v>

3486
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:04.200
<v Speaker 1>gone off in the world?</v>

3487
01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3488
01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:05.461
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3489
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Last time you showed me,</v>

3490
01:47:06.721 --> 01:47:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I think population population,</v>

3491
01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:10.410
<v Speaker 1>all the numbers coming in.</v>

3492
01:47:10.411 --> 01:47:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty crazy.</v>

3493
01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:12.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy thing to see like,</v>

3494
01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:14.160
<v Speaker 1>and the little flags behind them.</v>

3495
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:15.690
<v Speaker 1>How many people being born?</v>

3496
01:47:15.691 --> 01:47:15.991
<v Speaker 1>Britain,</v>

3497
01:47:15.991 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

3498
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:17.333
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

3499
01:47:18.190 --> 01:47:22.860
<v Speaker 1>the bombs being blown up since the 1940s to the present.</v>

3500
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.570
<v Speaker 1>All the nuclear test.</v>

3501
01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3502
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I was thought there was like four or five,</v>

3503
01:47:29.761 --> 01:47:32.880
<v Speaker 1>like how many times do we need to blow these fucking things up before we realize</v>

3504
01:47:32.881 --> 01:47:35.120
<v Speaker 1>what they do now there's a lot.</v>

3505
01:47:35.250 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 1>What are they learning?</v>

3506
01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Can you just model this on a computer?</v>

3507
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Even 50 years ago they had computers and you can go,</v>

3508
01:47:39.961 --> 01:47:40.111
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3509
01:47:40.111 --> 01:47:40.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3510
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:42.060
<v Speaker 1>so this rocket's moving at this speed.</v>

3511

3512
01:47:44.221 --> 01:47:46.860
<v Speaker 1>We don't actually have to launch the rocket to figure out if it's gonna work or</v>

3650
01:51:30.851 --> 01:51:35.851
<v Speaker 1>it gets to 1032 nuclear explosions just from the Unites States of America.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

3654
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:43.623
<v Speaker 1>what does that look?</v>

3655
01:51:44.010 --> 01:51:44.843
<v Speaker 1>What fucking</v>

3656
01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:46.890
<v Speaker 9>great.</v>

3657
01:51:46.890 --> 01:51:47.723
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

3658
01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.440
<v Speaker 1>France has a lot of nuclear explosions.</v>

3659
01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Is that France?</v>

3660
01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:52.711
<v Speaker 1>What is the blue?</v>

3661
01:51:52.711 --> 01:51:53.544
<v Speaker 1>White and red?</v>

3662
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:54.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3663
01:51:55.130 --> 01:51:59.340
<v Speaker 1>We supposed to know that is that Mexico is for Jesus Christ.</v>

3664
01:51:59.341 --> 01:52:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Mexico has four for China's 45 who's the one on the far left?</v>

3665
01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Some hippie thing.</v>

3666
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Moon and a star.</v>

3667
01:52:06.301 --> 01:52:07.134
<v Speaker 1>Green and white.</v>

3668
01:52:07.190 --> 01:52:08.490
<v Speaker 1>That's like an Arab country.</v>

3669
01:52:08.491 --> 01:52:09.324
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3670
01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.111
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3671
01:52:10.111 --> 01:52:10.944
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

3672
01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.120
<v Speaker 1>India and Pakistan.</v>

3673
01:52:12.121 --> 01:52:12.751
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

3674
01:52:12.751 --> 01:52:16.260
<v Speaker 1>India has for Pakistan as to Jesus Christ.</v>

3675
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:16.980
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

3676
01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It's really scary is how much was on our side of the coast.</v>

3677
01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3678
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:21.223
<v Speaker 1>like I don't even,</v>

3679
01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:21.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3680
01:52:21.451 --> 01:52:22.650
<v Speaker 1>we're nuclear cannot be good.</v>

3681
01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:23.963
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's great.</v>

3682
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why California is awesome.</v>

3683
01:52:25.810 --> 01:52:29.070
<v Speaker 1>What does it found out that like a little bit of radiation is fucking super good</v>

3684
01:52:29.071 --> 01:52:31.170
<v Speaker 1>for you and it makes really smart people get it.</v>

3685
01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And the lack of the lack of nuclear radiation that they have and like New Jersey</v>

3686
01:52:36.841 --> 01:52:37.950
<v Speaker 1>is what's the real problem?</v>

3687
01:52:38.370 --> 01:52:41.420
<v Speaker 1>They need to detonate a couple nukes in New Jersey and fucking straightened</v>

3688
01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:42.090
<v Speaker 1>everybody out.</v>

3689
01:52:42.090 --> 01:52:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3690
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:43.223
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3691
01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.153
<v Speaker 1>now we get it.</v>

3692
01:52:44.370 --> 01:52:45.170
<v Speaker 1>We just need a little,</v>

3693
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:45.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3694
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

3695
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:47.360
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of radiation in the air.</v>

3696
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.460
<v Speaker 5>I used to think that maybe cigarettes were probably,</v>

3697
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:50.870
<v Speaker 5>I was when I was competing,</v>

3698
01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:54.290
<v Speaker 5>I think that cigarettes may be like a workout for your lungs,</v>

3699
01:52:54.650 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 5>that if you could,</v>

3700
01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:57.530
<v Speaker 5>if you could lift a little weights with your lungs,</v>

3701
01:52:57.531 --> 01:53:01.310
<v Speaker 5>but like if he smoked cigarettes that your lungs and have to like fight against</v>

3702
01:53:01.311 --> 01:53:01.790
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3703
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:02.650
<v Speaker 5>the cigarette smoke.</v>

3704
01:53:02.651 --> 01:53:05.300
<v Speaker 5>And it'd be like lifting weights to dumbest idea I've ever had,</v>

3705
01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:10.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's not too far off from those like air trainers like those,</v>

3706
01:53:10.041 --> 01:53:10.311
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3707
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:11.930
<v Speaker 5>those oxygen things where they,</v>

3708
01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:15.860
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to suck on those like boss route and had that air trainer h two</v>

3709
01:53:15.861 --> 01:53:16.400
<v Speaker 5>o trainer.</v>

3710
01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 5>It's your air intake,</v>

3711
01:53:17.331 --> 01:53:17.720
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3712
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:17.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3713
01:53:17.871 --> 01:53:21.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't think those work man is a guy who a mock them.</v>

3714
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3715
01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.750
<v Speaker 5>but then I saw hypoxia,</v>

3716
01:53:23.751 --> 01:53:26.300
<v Speaker 5>like there was a Victor Conte video on Hypoxia,</v>

3717
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:27.350
<v Speaker 5>which is real similar.</v>

3718
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 5>They do doing like heavy a high endurance training,</v>

3719
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:33.260
<v Speaker 5>high intensity and Durrance training and they do it with like restricted</v>

3720
01:53:33.261 --> 01:53:33.621
<v Speaker 5>breathing.</v>

3721
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:35.480
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know who was right about that.</v>

3722
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:38.510
<v Speaker 5>Altitude is supposed to be where it's at,</v>

3723
01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:41.060
<v Speaker 5>like sleeping in the altitude,</v>

3724
01:53:41.061 --> 01:53:41.510
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3725
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:46.090
<v Speaker 5>but working out in an area where it's got plenty of oxygen so that,</v>

3726
01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.240
<v Speaker 5>that seems contrary to me because the idea is that not restrict your oxygen</v>

3727
01:53:50.241 --> 01:53:51.800
<v Speaker 5>intake while you're exercising,</v>

3728
01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:53.660
<v Speaker 5>but restricting it while you're resting.</v>

3729
01:53:53.690 --> 01:53:54.860
<v Speaker 5>That's what's supposed to be good.</v>

3730
01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.390
<v Speaker 5>Your body realizes like,</v>

3731
01:53:56.391 --> 01:53:56.601
<v Speaker 5>bitch,</v>

3732
01:53:56.601 --> 01:53:57.740
<v Speaker 5>we ain't going to the air up here.</v>

3733
01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:00.410
<v Speaker 5>And then it starts pumping out all these extra blood cells.</v>

3734
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3735
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.450
<v Speaker 3>You see the article that uh,</v>

3736
01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:05.390
<v Speaker 3>they found a way to inject oxygen into somebody's body.</v>

3737
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3738
01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Keeps you from drowning for like 20 seconds.</v>

3739
01:54:08.211 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

3740
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3741
01:54:09.201 --> 01:54:09.891
<v Speaker 3>That's for now.</v>

3742
01:54:09.891 --> 01:54:10.790
<v Speaker 3>It's 20 seconds.</v>

3743
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what it's going to be?</v>

3744
01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:13.190
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like the abyss.</v>

3745
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking that we're going to have the abyss suits where it fills up</v>

3746
01:54:15.621 --> 01:54:17.720
<v Speaker 3>with liquid and we can go down to the bottom.</v>

3747
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:19.880
<v Speaker 3>That movie kicked ass until the very end.</v>

3748
01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:20.991
<v Speaker 3>The very end.</v>

3749
01:54:20.991 --> 01:54:24.020
<v Speaker 3>They ruined the whole mood when you see what the thing looks like.</v>

3750
01:54:24.210 --> 01:54:25.110
<v Speaker 3>But space ship.</v>

3751
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh Yup.</v>

3752
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Dumb fucking toys.</v>

3753
01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Irs thing that comes out of the water and you're like,</v>

3754
01:54:30.831 --> 01:54:31.664
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3755
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:33.140
<v Speaker 3>That's not a spaceship.</v>

3756
01:54:33.170 --> 01:54:36.170
<v Speaker 3>That's why I liked the movies where the director has disciplined to leave it to</v>

3757
01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:37.004
<v Speaker 3>your imagination.</v>

3758
01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.110
<v Speaker 3>It's hard though.</v>

3759
01:54:38.110 --> 01:54:38.750
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

3760
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:39.583
<v Speaker 3>people are dumb.</v>

3761
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:39.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3762
01:54:39.941 --> 01:54:40.880
<v Speaker 3>we're rolling through the whole,</v>

3763
01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:44.090
<v Speaker 5>I move that land on the moon where you are even know.</v>

3764
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:47.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean was there a Werewolf I didn't even get a good book to have.</v>

3765
01:54:47.871 --> 01:54:50.180
<v Speaker 5>It won't be able to see what it is.</v>

3766
01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Well that's like Jj Abrams.</v>

3767
01:54:51.411 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he's always like a smoke moms.</v>

3768
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:57.140
<v Speaker 3>He's got you like right on the edge of your seat and then you never get the</v>

3769
01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:58.153
<v Speaker 3>final.</v>

3770
01:54:58.610 --> 01:55:01.010
<v Speaker 3>You just want to know what he could make up anything.</v>

3771
01:55:01.011 --> 01:55:01.761
<v Speaker 3>You just want to know.</v>

3772
01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:04.040
<v Speaker 3>You want to have some kind of certainty and he doesn't give you that.</v>

3773
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:04.821
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3774
01:55:04.821 --> 01:55:06.140
<v Speaker 3>he gave me a smoke monster though.</v>

3775
01:55:06.141 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 3>He can go fuck himself with that fucking smoke monster.</v>

3776
01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Did you say that?</v>

3777
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:11.660
<v Speaker 3>That today in California,</v>

3778
01:55:11.661 --> 01:55:13.040
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure out if they want to make,</v>

3779
01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:13.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3780
01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.310
<v Speaker 3>the gray wolf and endangered specie in California.</v>

3781
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know there was great.</v>

3782
01:55:17.301 --> 01:55:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Wilson,</v>

3783
01:55:17.630 --> 01:55:18.370
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

3784
01:55:18.370 --> 01:55:18.911
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3785
01:55:18.911 --> 01:55:19.570
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3786
01:55:19.570 --> 01:55:20.720
<v Speaker 5>Gray Wolf's.</v>

3787
01:55:22.170 --> 01:55:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Here's the issue with wolves,</v>

3788
01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:25.030
<v Speaker 5>and this is something that Steve,</v>

3789
01:55:25.031 --> 01:55:26.200
<v Speaker 5>a Rinella brought up.</v>

3790
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:27.850
<v Speaker 5>They're exactly the same.</v>

3791
01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.440
<v Speaker 5>Like wolves everywhere.</v>

3792
01:55:29.441 --> 01:55:31.390
<v Speaker 5>It's all this one species of wolf,</v>

3793
01:55:32.110 --> 01:55:34.510
<v Speaker 5>but that's the same with humans.</v>

3794
01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.330
<v Speaker 5>And some wolves are bigger,</v>

3795
01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:39.310
<v Speaker 5>just like some humans are bigger.</v>

3796
01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:41.740
<v Speaker 5>If you brought a bunch of Germans,</v>

3797
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:44.280
<v Speaker 5>big giant German</v>

3798
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:44.671
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3799
01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.890
<v Speaker 1>and then imported them into Japan,</v>

3800
01:55:46.891 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 1>they started dominating and people said,</v>

3801
01:55:48.751 --> 01:55:48.871
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3802
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:49.081
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3803
01:55:49.081 --> 01:55:50.250
<v Speaker 1>it's the same species.</v>

3804
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:52.410
<v Speaker 1>We just brought people from another place.</v>

3805
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

3806
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:54.563
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3807
01:55:54.570 --> 01:55:54.781
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3808
01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:59.781
<v Speaker 1>You're changing the environment by bringing in these much larger versions of</v>

3809
01:56:00.031 --> 01:56:04.230
<v Speaker 1>what used to exist here and the wolves that you're seeing in like Yellowstone,</v>

3810
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:05.760
<v Speaker 1>these reintroduced wolves,</v>

3811
01:56:05.970 --> 01:56:09.660
<v Speaker 1>they're from Canada and they're big.</v>

3812
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:12.060
<v Speaker 1>They're like 150 plus pounds.</v>

3813
01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Big But polite.</v>

3814
01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:13.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3815
01:56:13.690 --> 01:56:14.523
<v Speaker 1>they're rude.</v>

3816
01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 1>They kill a lot of animals.</v>

3817
01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.161
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3818
01:56:17.161 --> 01:56:19.260
<v Speaker 1>the wolves that used to be in North America,</v>

3819
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:20.130
<v Speaker 1>we're smaller.</v>

3820
01:56:20.490 --> 01:56:20.761
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3821
01:56:20.761 --> 01:56:22.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing that happens in,</v>

3822
01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:22.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3823
01:56:22.801 --> 01:56:23.634
<v Speaker 1>with um,</v>

3824
01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:28.050
<v Speaker 1>mammals and it has to do with the amount of cold these mammals have to</v>

3825
01:56:28.051 --> 01:56:28.884
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3826
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:31.050
<v Speaker 1>And the more cold they have to experience,</v>

3827
01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the larger their body sizes.</v>

3828
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.300
<v Speaker 1>That's why polar bears are so fucking big and you go to like d dear is a perfect</v>

3829
01:56:39.301 --> 01:56:40.080
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

3830
01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Deer in Mexico have much smaller bodies.</v>

3831
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Then deer in Canada,</v>

3832
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:45.960
<v Speaker 1>deer and Canada,</v>

3833
01:56:45.961 --> 01:56:50.100
<v Speaker 1>like in Alberta and all these Saskatchewan giant deer,</v>

3834
01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:51.960
<v Speaker 1>the 300 plus pounds,</v>

3835
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.370
<v Speaker 1>some of the big males,</v>

3836
01:56:53.371 --> 01:56:54.204
<v Speaker 1>the big bucks.</v>

3837
01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:58.050
<v Speaker 1>But if you take a deer that's the same age and it's in Mexico,</v>

3838
01:56:58.200 --> 01:56:59.610
<v Speaker 1>it might only be a hundred pounds.</v>

3839
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:01.800
<v Speaker 1>So the further north you go,</v>

3840
01:57:01.801 --> 01:57:05.550
<v Speaker 1>the more the animal needs to generate heat from body mass.</v>

3841
01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's why whales are so big because they go so deep that they're in</v>

3842
01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:09.990
<v Speaker 1>a super cold,</v>

3843
01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:11.640
<v Speaker 1>like barely freezing kind of thing.</v>

3844
01:57:11.641 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3845
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:12.691
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

3846
01:57:12.691 --> 01:57:13.524
<v Speaker 1>It's a mammal.</v>

3847
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:14.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3848
01:57:14.011 --> 01:57:17.490
<v Speaker 1>this is something that they've attributed to this reason why grizzly bears and</v>

3849
01:57:17.491 --> 01:57:18.690
<v Speaker 1>polar bears are so big.</v>

3850
01:57:18.691 --> 01:57:19.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like as you get north,</v>

3851
01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:23.730
<v Speaker 1>the the same species of animal tends to be larger.</v>

3852
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Pretty fascinating stuff,</v>

3853
01:57:25.231 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3854
01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Pretty fascinating and completely make sense with these Canadian wolves because</v>

3855
01:57:29.521 --> 01:57:30.630
<v Speaker 1>their biggest fuck.</v>

3856
01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the American wolves were smaller.</v>

3857
01:57:32.970 --> 01:57:33.990
<v Speaker 1>They just were always like,</v>

3858
01:57:33.991 --> 01:57:34.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3859
01:57:34.201 --> 01:57:35.340
<v Speaker 1>60 70 pounds,</v>

3860
01:57:35.341 --> 01:57:35.671
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3861
01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:40.320
<v Speaker 1>So when they brought over these big ass fucking wolves from Canada and they have</v>

3862
01:57:40.321 --> 01:57:41.670
<v Speaker 1>that DNA in them,</v>

3863
01:57:41.710 --> 01:57:43.680
<v Speaker 1>the big Ass Wolf Dna,</v>

3864
01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:48.740
<v Speaker 1>these just decimating elk and deer populations in an areas where they're at and</v>

3865
01:57:48.931 --> 01:57:52.540
<v Speaker 1>they've re-instituted hunting on them now that,</v>

3866
01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:55.980
<v Speaker 1>so they brought them in and now they've got hunting and trapping and people in</v>

3867
01:57:55.981 --> 01:58:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Alaska and a lot of parts of North America where they have a lot of wolves.</v>

3868
01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.760
<v Speaker 1>They have wolf season now you can go hunting wolves.</v>

3869
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I could never shoot something that's a dog.</v>

3870
01:58:05.210 --> 01:58:06.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3871
01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.010
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go whoa.</v>

3872
01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes you could.</v>

3873
01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I could do a bear.</v>

3874
01:58:09.151 --> 01:58:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I could do almost anything else.</v>

3875
01:58:10.621 --> 01:58:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Can't do a dog.</v>

3876
01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't do a dog if it was coming after you eat your family.</v>

3877
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:15.870
<v Speaker 1>If I had to,</v>

3878
01:58:15.871 --> 01:58:16.704
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3879
01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:17.971
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

3880
01:58:17.971 --> 01:58:22.350
<v Speaker 1>if you were a rancher and you watched a super PAC like they've had in Siberia,</v>

3881
01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Siberia hasn't legitimate wolf problem and Siberia at one point in time,</v>

3882
01:58:27.570 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you know the story of World War One,</v>

3883
01:58:29.011 --> 01:58:30.090
<v Speaker 1>the wolf a thing,</v>

3884
01:58:30.690 --> 01:58:31.890
<v Speaker 1>the Germans and the Russians,</v>

3885
01:58:32.610 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 1>they call us a cease fire.</v>

3886
01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Wolves caused a cease fire because so many of the soldiers were getting killed</v>

3887
01:58:38.011 --> 01:58:38.844
<v Speaker 1>by wolves.</v>

3888
01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:39.361
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

3889
01:58:39.361 --> 01:58:39.571
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3890
01:58:39.571 --> 01:58:39.781
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3891
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:39.991
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3892
01:58:39.991 --> 01:58:40.171
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3893
01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:40.500
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>

3894
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 1>They ran into a super PAC and while they were,</v>

3895
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:46.240
<v Speaker 1>the two armies were connecting with each other while they were exchanging,</v>

3896
01:58:46.241 --> 01:58:47.530
<v Speaker 1>they would send out like scouts,</v>

3897
01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:51.520
<v Speaker 1>scouts get eaten by wolves and so they would find like these bodies like,</v>

3898
01:58:51.521 --> 01:58:51.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3899
01:58:51.731 --> 01:58:53.980
<v Speaker 1>with their boots on and the a foot and the boot,</v>

3900
01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:54.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3901
01:58:54.521 --> 01:58:54.880
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

3902
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 1>everything else is just smashed and destroyed and they realize there's these big</v>

3903
01:58:58.541 --> 01:59:00.250
<v Speaker 1>ass wolf bill wolf type stuff.</v>

3904
01:59:00.251 --> 01:59:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3905
01:59:00.730 --> 01:59:04.090
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating because they actually had a meeting and they,</v>

3906
01:59:04.091 --> 01:59:04.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3907
01:59:04.331 --> 01:59:04.601
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

3908
01:59:04.601 --> 01:59:04.811
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3909
01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:06.490
<v Speaker 1>let's truce ceasefire.</v>

3910
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's go kill these fucking wolves.</v>

3911
01:59:07.781 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll go back to killing each other.</v>

3912
01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.090
<v Speaker 1>So they had a cease fire,</v>

3913
01:59:10.091 --> 01:59:11.980
<v Speaker 1>killed all the walls and then went back to war.</v>

3914
01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:14.740
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3915
01:59:14.890 --> 01:59:15.290
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3916
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but that can happen with wolves.</v>

3917
01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Wolves can develop super pacs and a in Siberia they started taking out horses</v>

3918
01:59:22.631 --> 01:59:27.631
<v Speaker 1>and farm animals and they would go a hundred wolf strong and just invade a farm</v>

3919
01:59:27.731 --> 01:59:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and good fucking luck stomp.</v>

3920
01:59:28.871 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3921
01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:33.490
<v Speaker 1>they figured out a way to get over the fences and then they would just go crazy.</v>

3922
01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:34.810
<v Speaker 1>When things get collaborative,</v>

3923
01:59:34.811 --> 01:59:35.770
<v Speaker 1>you get a lot more power.</v>

3924
01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:36.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like the same as dolphins.</v>

3925
01:59:36.851 --> 01:59:40.450
<v Speaker 1>One Dolphin can't do anything but a whole pack of them can kill a shark,</v>

3926
01:59:40.451 --> 01:59:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3927
01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:41.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3928
01:59:41.411 --> 01:59:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Well dolphins are really good at at least fucking sharks up.</v>

3929
01:59:43.930 --> 01:59:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Orchids kill sharks on irregular orchids.</v>

3930
01:59:46.001 --> 01:59:46.571
<v Speaker 1>They're so smart.</v>

3931
01:59:46.571 --> 01:59:48.490
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to kill sharks the easy way.</v>

3932
01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

3933
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:50.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3934
01:59:50.101 --> 01:59:51.790
<v Speaker 1>they can communicate with each other and talk.</v>

3935
01:59:51.791 --> 01:59:52.690
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what they're saying,</v>

3936
01:59:52.691 --> 01:59:53.590
<v Speaker 1>but we know they're talking,</v>

3937
01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:54.640
<v Speaker 1>they figured it out.</v>

3938
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:57.760
<v Speaker 1>How to pass the knowledge from generation to generation that the way to kill a</v>

3939
01:59:57.761 --> 01:59:58.900
<v Speaker 1>shark is you bite it.</v>

3940
01:59:59.170 --> 02:00:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And then you flip it upside down when you flip a shark upside down were like</v>

3941
02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>really old designs.</v>

3942
02:00:04.690 --> 02:00:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Their designs suck.</v>

3943
02:00:06.490 --> 02:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like God got to them and it was like he wasn't really good at making shit.</v>

3944
02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like old cars like try driving like a 1970,</v>

3945
02:00:15.930 --> 02:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you know Plymouth,</v>

3946
02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>their suspensions,</v>

3947
02:00:18.370 --> 02:00:19.151
<v Speaker 1>dog shit,</v>

3948
02:00:19.151 --> 02:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>their breaks suck.</v>

3949
02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>No seatbelts.</v>

3950
02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Steering is so vague.</v>

3951
02:00:23.381 --> 02:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what it's transmitted.</v>

3952
02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Their dog shit cars.</v>

3953
02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what a shark is.</v>

3954
02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>The dog shit animal.</v>

3955
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Like the design was terrible.</v>

3956
02:00:31.601 --> 02:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>They have to keep moving and if you flip them upside down,</v>

3957
02:00:34.361 --> 02:00:35.194
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

3958
02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:35.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3959
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:36.970
<v Speaker 1>they just bunk out and die.</v>

3960
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.260
<v Speaker 1>So the org has grab them.</v>

3961
02:00:38.261 --> 02:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I just flip them upside down and hold on in women's around them and then they</v>

3962
02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>eat them.</v>

3963
02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>That's such a sign of intelligence that they found the cheat code to killing a</v>

3964
02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>what would be their biggest predator?</v>

3965
02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:47.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3966
02:00:47.201 --> 02:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

3967
02:00:47.770 --> 02:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>well that is the only Predator that they would have.</v>

3968
02:00:51.190 --> 02:00:51.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3969
02:00:51.491 --> 02:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>they would have to worry about them around.</v>

3970
02:00:53.141 --> 02:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>They're small,</v>

3971
02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>they're cubs,</v>

3972
02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.313
<v Speaker 1>the babies.</v>

3973
02:00:56.410 --> 02:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3974
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3975
02:00:57.370 --> 02:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>an Orca is like way smarter and more powerful than shark shark is just an idiot.</v>

3976
02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:04.280
<v Speaker 1>So the arc is the ORC is basically like a human being.</v>

3977
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.931
<v Speaker 1>The shark,</v>

3978
02:01:04.931 --> 02:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the shark is almost like a biological robot in the same way that spiders are</v>

3979
02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3980
02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3981
02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>of any animal.</v>

3982
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Spiders are the only one where I got curious and research them online.</v>

3983
02:01:15.461 --> 02:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And the more I read,</v>

3984
02:01:16.661 --> 02:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>the less I liked them because normally like no matter what it is like,</v>

3985
02:01:19.211 --> 02:01:19.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

3986
02:01:19.631 --> 02:01:20.261
<v Speaker 1>they can do that.</v>

3987
02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:21.070
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

3988
02:01:21.070 --> 02:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>And I got to the point where it was a video and it was the mating ritual of</v>

3989
02:01:24.971 --> 02:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>jumping spiders and it's these,</v>

3990
02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>it first I was like,</v>

3991
02:01:28.301 --> 02:01:28.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

3992
02:01:28.661 --> 02:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I am going to like spiders because what they do to attract each other as the</v>

3993
02:01:31.301 --> 02:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>male like pounds his,</v>

3994
02:01:32.891 --> 02:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3995
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>legs on the ground and the sound vibrations,</v>

3996
02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I guess stimulate the female in some way and pull that.</v>

3997
02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3998
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3999
02:01:39.630 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4000
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.930
<v Speaker 2>so what happened in the video though is like,</v>

4001
02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:42.741
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4002
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>if I'm remembering correctly,</v>

4003
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>the male jumping spider,</v>

4004
02:01:45.291 --> 02:01:48.140
<v Speaker 2>it looks like he's going to get some and they zoom in on his eyes and you're</v>

4005
02:01:48.141 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4006
02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:48.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4007
02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:50.360
<v Speaker 2>like if the spider could be happy,</v>

4008
02:01:50.361 --> 02:01:51.470
<v Speaker 2>this spider is probably happy,</v>

4009
02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:51.711
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4010
02:01:51.711 --> 02:01:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4011
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:55.040
<v Speaker 2>and then it looks like the female was about to get mounted,</v>

4012
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:57.050
<v Speaker 2>which it takes a big fucking bite out and like,</v>

4013
02:01:57.051 --> 02:01:57.680
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

4014
02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:01.700
<v Speaker 2>And then just jumps off and he jumps off in the other direction and you can see</v>

4015
02:02:01.701 --> 02:02:02.840
<v Speaker 2>the guts and like,</v>

4016
02:02:02.841 --> 02:02:03.141
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

4017
02:02:03.141 --> 02:02:03.974
<v Speaker 2>Fuck spiders,</v>

4018
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:05.090
<v Speaker 2>zero respect.</v>

4019
02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Because I was starting to think like,</v>

4020
02:02:06.351 --> 02:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't kill spiders.</v>

4021
02:02:07.431 --> 02:02:08.420
<v Speaker 2>If I see them in my apartment,</v>

4022
02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I should leave them alone or let them take the time to let them out.</v>

4023
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:12.051
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

4024
02:02:12.051 --> 02:02:12.884
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4025
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.823
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

4026
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>we'll get these little bastards.</v>

4027
02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:16.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4028
02:02:16.711 --> 02:02:17.544
<v Speaker 1>they're evil.</v>

4029
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>They have no morals.</v>

4030
02:02:19.770 --> 02:02:20.401
<v Speaker 1>The robots,</v>

4031
02:02:20.401 --> 02:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how to seek out protein.</v>

4032
02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:24.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4033
02:02:24.271 --> 02:02:25.104
<v Speaker 1>And they have venom.</v>

4034
02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:25.981
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

4035
02:02:25.981 --> 02:02:26.311
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

4036
02:02:26.311 --> 02:02:27.144
<v Speaker 1>they're creepy.</v>

4037
02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:27.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4038
02:02:27.361 --> 02:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>just the idea of black widows,</v>

4039
02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>a Saml necrosis is such a dick move.</v>

4040
02:02:32.041 --> 02:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not bad enough that you love to bite.</v>

4041
02:02:33.601 --> 02:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>You got to like the whole thing's got to rot out over time and some of them can</v>

4042
02:02:37.891 --> 02:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>kill a person pretty easy.</v>

4043
02:02:39.991 --> 02:02:40.411
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

4044
02:02:40.411 --> 02:02:43.150
<v Speaker 1>there's certain spiders like um,</v>

4045
02:02:43.650 --> 02:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>those brown recluses that just do unbelievable damage with one of their stings.</v>

4046
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:52.100
<v Speaker 2>If you want to never go into the woods again or ever leave your apartment,</v>

4047
02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.320
<v Speaker 2>just do a Google image search for reckless</v>

4048
02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:55.263
<v Speaker 1>bites.</v>

4049
02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:55.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4050
02:02:55.631 --> 02:02:56.464
<v Speaker 1>they're horrible.</v>

4051
02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>The necrosis aspect of it is one of the grossest things.</v>

4052
02:02:59.470 --> 02:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>It just causes all the flesh to die around the wound.</v>

4053
02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4054
02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Oof.</v>

4055
02:03:04.190 --> 02:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4056
02:03:04.570 --> 02:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>This is the one that I saw because I didn't,</v>

4057
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember there being captions,</v>

4058
02:03:07.391 --> 02:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same idea cause this is what they do to attract each other,</v>

4059
02:03:11.411 --> 02:03:14.740
<v Speaker 2>but there's a good chance whenever they do this ritual that the female will</v>

4060
02:03:14.741 --> 02:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>choose to eat the mail.</v>

4061
02:03:15.730 --> 02:03:17.530
<v Speaker 2>And that right there is a sign of insanity to me.</v>

4062
02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I think emails larger all the time.</v>

4063
02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:23.660
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fuck you and show you a good time with his leg dance and you tear</v>

4064
02:03:23.661 --> 02:03:24.494
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

4065
02:03:24.590 --> 02:03:25.580
<v Speaker 1>his abdomen out.</v>

4066
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:26.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4067
02:03:26.151 --> 02:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>the matriarchal society,</v>

4068
02:03:27.691 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like common in bugs.</v>

4069
02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:30.920
<v Speaker 1>It's in ants.</v>

4070
02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:32.060
<v Speaker 1>You know an answer.</v>

4071
02:03:32.630 --> 02:03:35.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of female ants that the queen,</v>

4072
02:03:35.001 --> 02:03:35.900
<v Speaker 1>they kill the,</v>

4073
02:03:35.901 --> 02:03:36.021
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4074
02:03:36.021 --> 02:03:38.240
<v Speaker 1>the males and they deal with the way they breathe with them.</v>

4075
02:03:38.241 --> 02:03:39.440
<v Speaker 1>They cut his wings off,</v>

4076
02:03:39.441 --> 02:03:43.610
<v Speaker 1>they cut his legs off and they take them into the hive and breed with them</v>

4077
02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:44.120
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4078
02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

4079
02:03:44.530 --> 02:03:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even look as a jumping spider.</v>

4080
02:03:46.890 --> 02:03:48.710
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look real horrible.</v>

4081
02:03:49.590 --> 02:03:51.320
<v Speaker 1>So strange looking.</v>

4082
02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:52.830
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a meme.</v>

4083
02:03:52.831 --> 02:03:54.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like misunderstood spider.</v>

4084
02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:55.590
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4085
02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:56.933
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

4086
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.781
<v Speaker 2>oh great,</v>

4087
02:03:57.781 --> 02:03:58.561
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing over there?</v>

4088
02:03:58.561 --> 02:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4089
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:59.021
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4090
02:03:59.021 --> 02:03:59.470
<v Speaker 2>you bitch.</v>

4091
02:03:59.470 --> 02:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>You just sprayed me and his eyes.</v>

4092
02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>What a creepy fucking bug.</v>

4093
02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

4094
02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>The same world that evolved,</v>

4095
02:04:07.001 --> 02:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>that thing also evolved us.</v>

4096
02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I watched a video the day,</v>

4097
02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know kingsnakes were so gangster because you know,</v>

4098
02:04:13.481 --> 02:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>king snakes have no venom.</v>

4099
02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>So I always thought like,</v>

4100
02:04:17.111 --> 02:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>king snakes are just like gardens next.</v>

4101
02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:19.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

4102
02:04:19.841 --> 02:04:20.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4103
02:04:20.081 --> 02:04:20.760
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4104
02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>King snakes eat rattlesnakes hole.</v>

4105
02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You got to pull up a video of a king snake eating a rattlesnake.</v>

4106
02:04:27.550 --> 02:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I had no fucking idea.</v>

4107
02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Kingsnakes have a certain protein in their body that diffuses rattlesnake venom</v>

4108
02:04:33.371 --> 02:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>and makes them immune to it.</v>

4109
02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a Predator's Predator right there.</v>

4110
02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have teeth,</v>

4111
02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>but they just dash onto a fucking rattlesnake.</v>

4112
02:04:40.770 --> 02:04:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Get Ahold of that bitch,</v>

4113
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>screw them up tight and start swallowing them whole headfirst.</v>

4114
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>They get ahold of him so fast.</v>

4115
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.470
<v Speaker 1>The rattlesnake doesn't even have a chance to bite him.</v>

4116
02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Clamp a hold of his head and just stretch their mouth out.</v>

4117
02:04:52.410 --> 02:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4118
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean the difference being like Joey Diaz eating you like not that much</v>

4119
02:04:58.621 --> 02:04:59.640
<v Speaker 1>difference in size,</v>

4120
02:04:59.641 --> 02:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>like not enough where you would go.</v>

4121
02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:03.840
<v Speaker 1>How is Joey get David Semen in his whole body?</v>

4122
02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:05.473
<v Speaker 1>A book.</v>

4123
02:05:05.670 --> 02:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>But this is like a choice meal for the kingsnakes.</v>

4124
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:09.383
<v Speaker 1>The Joey snake.</v>

4125
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:09.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4126
02:05:09.601 --> 02:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Look at this snake.</v>

4127
02:05:10.471 --> 02:05:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean evil looking motherfucker,</v>

4128
02:05:11.850 --> 02:05:13.260
<v Speaker 1>but look at that evil fucker.</v>

4129
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:13.921
<v Speaker 1>You would think.</v>

4130
02:05:13.921 --> 02:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Now the rattlesnake is a big fat,</v>

4131
02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>evil look and snake.</v>

4132
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be the key Predator here and this king snake doesn't know what the</v>

4133
02:05:21.991 --> 02:05:22.824
<v Speaker 1>hell he's doing.</v>

4134
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

4135
02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:24.420
<v Speaker 1>he's going near that rattlesnake.</v>

4136
02:05:24.421 --> 02:05:27.870
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get killed and eaten and no,</v>

4137
02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:30.360
<v Speaker 1>the rattlesnake eats a bunch of pussy mice.</v>

4138
02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>This is why you can't expect perfection in government does.</v>

4139
02:05:33.271 --> 02:05:34.290
<v Speaker 1>This is the alternative.</v>

4140
02:05:34.291 --> 02:05:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Look at this like rose,</v>

4141
02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 1>like we should get back to nature.</v>

4142
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>We should be more in touch.</v>

4143
02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking awful.</v>

4144
02:05:39.181 --> 02:05:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Like it's good that we broke free.</v>

4145
02:05:40.530 --> 02:05:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Nature's ruthless.</v>

4146
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get back to nature because nature does give no fucks about</v>

4147
02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:46.861
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

4148
02:05:46.861 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Look at this,</v>

4149
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:48.413
<v Speaker 1>look at this thing.</v>

4150
02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It gets up to the rattlesnake and it's like,</v>

4151
02:05:50.521 --> 02:05:51.354
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

4152

<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>

4153
02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:54.301
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4154
02:05:54.301 --> 02:05:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I've got a question for you.</v>

4155
02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4156
02:05:56.070 --> 02:05:57.540
<v Speaker 1>do you mind if I get your fucking ass hole?</v>

4157
02:05:58.050 --> 02:05:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

4158
02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Clamps a hold of it and runs with it.</v>

4159
02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Drags his big fat rattlesnakes.</v>

4160
02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the size of it.</v>

4161
02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Look at the width of the rattlesnake and look at the width of its body.</v>

4162
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:09.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the same size.</v>

4163
02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>

4164
02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's swallowing something that's the same size.</v>

4165
02:06:13.851 --> 02:06:14.684
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

4166
02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 1>That's ambition.</v>

4167
02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It's ruthless.</v>

4168
02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:18.601
<v Speaker 1>It's nature,</v>

4169
02:06:18.601 --> 02:06:19.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4170
02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4171
02:06:19.450 --> 02:06:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Nature's that evil fucking cunt.</v>

4172
02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.770
<v Speaker 1>While we're on the topic of snakes.</v>

4173
02:06:22.771 --> 02:06:27.771
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that youtube video where the snake charmer is charming the Cobra</v>

4174
02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:32.340
<v Speaker 1>and then gets right up to it and kisses it on the head and then backs away?</v>

4175
02:06:32.670 --> 02:06:33.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4176
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:35.430
<v Speaker 1>You gotta watch this cause it's like inspirational.</v>

4177
02:06:35.550 --> 02:06:35.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4178
02:06:35.761 --> 02:06:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but you know they take the teeth out of those things.</v>

4179
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

4180
02:06:38.341 --> 02:06:40.980
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't care if it bites him up the same.</v>

4181
02:06:40.981 --> 02:06:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You've got to do it with a live one.</v>

4182
02:06:42.630 --> 02:06:43.830
<v Speaker 1>There's cool videos of like,</v>

4183
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:48.070
<v Speaker 1>like these really dangerous scary like snakes with babies in the,</v>

4184
02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like wrapping around the baby and trying to bite the baby's face</v>

4185
02:06:51.111 --> 02:06:53.610
<v Speaker 1>that they tap the baby's forehead with her nose,</v>

4186
02:06:53.611 --> 02:06:55.920
<v Speaker 1>with their teeth don't come out because they had him removed.</v>

4187
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:56.761
<v Speaker 1>That's not right.</v>

4188
02:06:56.761 --> 02:06:57.594
<v Speaker 1>I'm in fair.</v>

4189
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm in favor of a fair fight.</v>

4190
02:07:00.150 --> 02:07:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Fuck a fair fight,</v>

02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:04.680
<v Speaker 1>There was a fair fight.</v>

4194
02:07:04.681 --> 02:07:06.090
<v Speaker 1>You would never get a cheeseburger.</v>

4195
02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that if there's fair fights you lose every time,</v>

4196
02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:11.940
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get meat from a bowl.</v>

4197
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:13.650
<v Speaker 1>How even you going to get close?</v>

4198
02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:17.070
<v Speaker 1>What's the fair fight fair fight means for every one of them we kill.</v>

4199
02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:18.120
<v Speaker 1>They kill one of us.</v>

4200
02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

4201

<v Speaker 1>We would lay off stake a long time ago you were talking with,</v>

4202
02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:26.370
<v Speaker 1>with great passion about your cheeseburger and a beer you had.</v>

4203
02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Those don't exist.</v>

4209
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>This is like the real life Xbox right here.</v>

4210
02:07:40.421 --> 02:07:42.220
<v Speaker 1>This is how it is in some parts of the world.</v>

4211
02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4212
02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:43.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4213
02:07:43.511 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Look how horrible this is though.</v>

4214
02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:46.420
<v Speaker 1>This fucking poor baby.</v>

4215
02:07:46.421 --> 02:07:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Like it's getting tapped on the head that things trying to kill him.</v>

4216

4217
02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it actually kills that baby.</v>

4218
02:07:54.311 --> 02:07:54.731

<v Speaker 1>Poke it in the eye.</v>

4224
02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Just observes him afterwards like,</v>

02:08:13.821 --> 02:08:17.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's cool at all because I mean that's still got it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Snake charmer fucking parents.</v>

4269
02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:13.450
<v Speaker 1>David [inaudible]</v>

4270
02:09:13.450 --> 02:09:13.981
<v Speaker 6>thinking about it.</v>

4271
02:09:13.981 --> 02:09:14.814
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

4272
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.571
<v Speaker 6>David,</v>

4273
02:09:15.571 --> 02:09:16.620
<v Speaker 6>are you gonna have a baby someday?</v>

4274
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:17.783
<v Speaker 6>Do you want a baby?</v>

4275
02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:19.231
<v Speaker 6>I want kids.</v>

4276
02:09:19.231 --> 02:09:20.064
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to baby.</v>

4277
02:09:20.130 --> 02:09:20.401
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4278
02:09:20.401 --> 02:09:20.851
<v Speaker 6>like Ah,</v>

4279
02:09:20.851 --> 02:09:22.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to like doesn't work though.</v>

4280
02:09:22.590 --> 02:09:24.000
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to deal with the baby phase,</v>

4281
02:09:24.001 --> 02:09:24.781
<v Speaker 6>but that's not what I want.</v>

4282
02:09:24.781 --> 02:09:26.220
<v Speaker 6>I want like the foster dad,</v>

4283
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:27.060
<v Speaker 6>big brother,</v>

4284
02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:31.260
<v Speaker 6>but I want it to be biologically related to me cause I think that this sounds</v>

4285
02:09:31.261 --> 02:09:32.880
<v Speaker 6>really selfish and like full of Shit.</v>

4286
02:09:32.881 --> 02:09:37.680
<v Speaker 6>But I think that one of the only ways that we gain in mortality is the fact that</v>

4287
02:09:37.681 --> 02:09:39.930
<v Speaker 6>we're allowing part of us to carry on.</v>

4288
02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:41.520
<v Speaker 6>And I think it's really cool to think about like,</v>

4289
02:09:41.550 --> 02:09:41.701
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4290
02:09:41.701 --> 02:09:46.701
<v Speaker 6>I'm part my dad and he's parked his grandfather and that this is the way that we</v>

4291
02:09:48.330 --> 02:09:49.560
<v Speaker 6>communicate through thousands.</v>

4292
02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Severes do you think that that's all I'm going to go away when there's real</v>

4293
02:09:52.611 --> 02:09:53.780
<v Speaker 1>genetic manipulation?</v>

4294
02:09:54.110 --> 02:09:54.943
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

4295
02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:55.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4296
02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:59.510
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about creating an artificial human being that one day there's</v>

4297
02:09:59.511 --> 02:10:02.600
<v Speaker 1>going to be when if pal tro is going to like design a child.</v>

4298
02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.010
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about artificial human beings.</v>

4299
02:10:07.011 --> 02:10:09.800
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the ability to duplicate everything.</v>

4300
02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:11.720
<v Speaker 1>When we were talking about that the old man,</v>

4301
02:10:11.721 --> 02:10:15.210
<v Speaker 1>the 60 year old man who didn't realize that he never lived a life and then he,</v>

4302
02:10:15.230 --> 02:10:17.330
<v Speaker 1>they implanted all these memories in him and he starts crying.</v>

4303
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:18.530
<v Speaker 1>He was like blade runner,</v>

4304
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:22.790
<v Speaker 1>like a replicant Jack like Rutger Hauer like the end when he's just,</v>

4305
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:27.020
<v Speaker 1>he's really almost human and so human that he actually lets Harrison Ford</v>

4306
02:10:27.021 --> 02:10:27.740
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

4307
02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:32.150
<v Speaker 1>He said he's got compassion and he is calculating and totally and when you get</v>

4308
02:10:32.151 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>to that point and then</v>

4309
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.030
<v Speaker 7>you get to the point where you were able to manipulate genetics and you say,</v>

4310
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.571
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4311
02:10:38.571 --> 02:10:38.841
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

4312
02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:39.081
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4313
02:10:39.081 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 7>I'm just going to stick with the genetics I've got.</v>

4314
02:10:41.271 --> 02:10:42.104
<v Speaker 7>I mean I'm not,</v>

4315
02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:43.460
<v Speaker 7>I'm not a,</v>

4316
02:10:43.461 --> 02:10:47.220
<v Speaker 7>you don't need to make anything any better and everyone around you is he man,</v>

4317
02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 7>everyone around you is God damn Madonna's everyone around you is Michael Jordan</v>

4318
02:10:51.561 --> 02:10:52.281
<v Speaker 7>in his prime.</v>

4319
02:10:52.281 --> 02:10:55.760
<v Speaker 7>Everyone around you is his giant super athlete and you just decide,</v>

4320
02:10:55.761 --> 02:10:58.340
<v Speaker 7>I just like being me normal.</v>

4321
02:10:58.341 --> 02:10:59.460
<v Speaker 7>Me and we were,</v>

4322
02:10:59.570 --> 02:11:03.170
<v Speaker 7>our society breaks down between mods and regs,</v>

4323
02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:07.400
<v Speaker 7>like no more racism now it's mods and regs Gatica kind of situation.</v>

4324
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:08.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4325
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:09.410
<v Speaker 7>like a second.</v>

4326
02:11:09.850 --> 02:11:14.210
<v Speaker 7>It's second tier citizen if you're not biologically perfect.</v>

4327
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:15.740
<v Speaker 7>Well it's those,</v>

4328
02:11:15.741 --> 02:11:20.741
<v Speaker 7>there's some things that people had contemplated or thought may be the case</v>

4329
02:11:20.781 --> 02:11:24.140
<v Speaker 7>someday in the future that have turned out to be real of great example.</v>

4330
02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:26.180
<v Speaker 7>We were talking about this yesterday was Ed TV,</v>

4331
02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:30.440
<v Speaker 7>that Matthew mcconaughey movie where he played a guy where they just followed a</v>

4332
02:11:30.441 --> 02:11:33.770
<v Speaker 7>regular camera and it was a show Truman show kind of know,</v>

4333
02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:35.080
<v Speaker 7>but it was a real show.</v>

4334
02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:38.560
<v Speaker 7>He knew about the Truman show was the fact that he didn't know about the talent</v>

4335
02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:39.290
<v Speaker 7>show,</v>

4336
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:43.820
<v Speaker 7>but that a real show was based on this guy's life.</v>

4337
02:11:43.821 --> 02:11:46.450
<v Speaker 7>Just him living his life and everybody wanted to know what he was going to do.</v>

4338
02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:47.360
<v Speaker 7>You got to marry the girl,</v>

4339
02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:48.440
<v Speaker 7>you're going to get the job,</v>

4340
02:11:48.590 --> 02:11:49.191
<v Speaker 7>like what's going to end?</v>

4341
02:11:49.191 --> 02:11:52.550
<v Speaker 7>They're following him around with a camera and he becomes famous for no reason.</v>

4342
02:11:52.551 --> 02:11:54.650
<v Speaker 7>And then he realized how crazy is and the end,</v>

4343
02:11:54.651 --> 02:11:57.350
<v Speaker 7>there's supposed to be some sort of a lesson that we learned.</v>

4344
02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:58.820
<v Speaker 7>Nobody thought that would ever,</v>

4345
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.680
<v Speaker 7>that you couldn't make that movie today.</v>

4346
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:01.041
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

4347
02:12:01.041 --> 02:12:04.370
<v Speaker 7>Because that movie is just a reality show and no one's going to buy a movie</v>

4348
02:12:04.371 --> 02:12:06.380
<v Speaker 7>about a reality show that's stupid.</v>

4349
02:12:06.650 --> 02:12:07.130
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

4350
02:12:07.130 --> 02:12:07.480
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

4351
02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:09.320
<v Speaker 7>it's like it's some strange thing.</v>

4352
02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:09.460
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4353
02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:10.850
<v Speaker 7>you've got Kim Kardashian,</v>

4354
02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.150
<v Speaker 7>who's the most famous woman on the planet earth.</v>

4355
02:12:14.630 --> 02:12:16.250
<v Speaker 7>She is at TV.</v>

4356
02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:17.720
<v Speaker 7>I mean now it's real.</v>

4357
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:21.350
<v Speaker 7>So things like Gatica science fiction,</v>

4358
02:12:21.351 --> 02:12:21.741
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>

4359
02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:22.461
<v Speaker 7>Craziness.</v>

4360
02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:26.660
<v Speaker 7>Genetically Modified human beings to see the the the modified ones versus the</v>

4361
02:12:26.661 --> 02:12:31.250
<v Speaker 7>non modified ones and the elitism of the separation because of resources.</v>

4362
02:12:31.251 --> 02:12:34.730
<v Speaker 7>The people that can afford to be perfect and then the rest of the dregs of</v>

4363
02:12:34.731 --> 02:12:35.301
<v Speaker 7>society,</v>

4364
02:12:35.301 --> 02:12:39.530
<v Speaker 7>they're out there banging at the door trying to get into the fucking spaceship.</v>

4365
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:41.790
<v Speaker 7>That's all coming,</v>

4366
02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:42.210
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4367
02:12:42.210 --> 02:12:42.590
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

4368
02:12:42.590 --> 02:12:43.550
<v Speaker 7>it's going to happen.</v>

4369
02:12:43.551 --> 02:12:43.880
<v Speaker 7>If,</v>

4370
02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 7>if we stay alive,</v>

4371
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:46.310
<v Speaker 7>it's going to happen.</v>

4372
02:12:46.311 --> 02:12:47.660
<v Speaker 7>There's going to be perfect people.</v>

4373
02:12:47.690 --> 02:12:48.920
<v Speaker 7>If you don't have enough bitcoins,</v>

4374
02:12:48.921 --> 02:12:51.510
<v Speaker 7>you don't get into this space spaceship to Mars via.</v>

4375
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:55.520
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting how like the founding fathers didn't address stuff like digital</v>

4376
02:12:55.521 --> 02:12:59.270
<v Speaker 7>privacy or where your metadata should be stored because they could not picture</v>

4377
02:12:59.271 --> 02:12:59.360
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

4378
02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:03.430
<v Speaker 7>They had no idea what a smartphone was and that was only a few hundred years or</v>

4379
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:04.131
<v Speaker 7>less than that.</v>

4380
02:13:04.131 --> 02:13:04.911
<v Speaker 7>Clinton could have been,</v>

4381
02:13:04.911 --> 02:13:07.730
<v Speaker 7>could have saw it coming and so no one saw it coming.</v>

4382
02:13:07.731 --> 02:13:08.630
<v Speaker 7>We're also talking about like,</v>

4383
02:13:08.631 --> 02:13:09.650
<v Speaker 7>well who owns space?</v>

4384
02:13:09.651 --> 02:13:11.720
<v Speaker 7>Who owns the minerals that are on Mars?</v>

4385
02:13:11.721 --> 02:13:14.690
<v Speaker 7>These will be ridiculous questions a couple of hundred years ago and I think at</v>

4386
02:13:14.691 --> 02:13:16.100
<v Speaker 7>the same way it's going to be like,</v>

4387
02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:16.251
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

4388
02:13:16.251 --> 02:13:20.840
<v Speaker 7>should we have fully automated police officer's like should we have the century</v>

4389
02:13:20.841 --> 02:13:21.860
<v Speaker 7>in this from uh,</v>

4390
02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:25.010
<v Speaker 7>whatever they were the Cylon centurions should we have those things walking our</v>

4391
02:13:25.011 --> 02:13:26.120
<v Speaker 7>streets and that's,</v>

4392
02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:28.070
<v Speaker 7>those are going to be issues in the next 20 years,</v>

4393
02:13:28.071 --> 02:13:29.120
<v Speaker 7>not the next hundred years.</v>

4394
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.601
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4395
02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:29.930
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

4396
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:34.930
<v Speaker 7>that's a really point about trying to figure out who owns the natural resources</v>

4397
02:13:36.121 --> 02:13:39.510
<v Speaker 7>in space because that's probably going to be,</v>

4398
02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:40.830
<v Speaker 7>we might even have space wars.</v>

4399
02:13:40.831 --> 02:13:42.450
<v Speaker 7>If you think about why humans fight,</v>

4400
02:13:42.451 --> 02:13:44.130
<v Speaker 7>it's mostly for resources.</v>

4401
02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.210
<v Speaker 7>I could totally see like China and the u s duking it out in some kind of</v>

4402
02:13:48.211 --> 02:13:52.710
<v Speaker 7>interstellar that could you imagine like if they found that there was a,</v>

4403
02:13:52.711 --> 02:13:53.100
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4404
02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:58.100
<v Speaker 7>an asteroid or something and it has,</v>

4405
02:13:58.620 --> 02:13:59.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4406
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:04.220
<v Speaker 7>fucking hundred trillion dollars where the oil in it or diamonds or what have</v>

4407
02:14:04.471 --> 02:14:04.681
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

4408
02:14:04.681 --> 02:14:08.760
<v Speaker 7>and you could get there in a day's time and then Russia says were gone and the</v>

4409
02:14:08.761 --> 02:14:09.151
<v Speaker 7>United States,</v>

4410
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:10.350
<v Speaker 7>it was fuck you were going.</v>

4411
02:14:10.590 --> 02:14:12.120
<v Speaker 7>And they tried to Duke it out over who?</v>

4412
02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:12.380
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

4413
02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:13.740
<v Speaker 7>they've got to have space wars.</v>

4414
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:17.550
<v Speaker 7>They're flying around shooting rockets at each other in space,</v>

4415
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:19.290
<v Speaker 7>laser beams and shit.</v>

4416
02:14:20.010 --> 02:14:20.940
<v Speaker 7>Death Rays,</v>

4417
02:14:20.970 --> 02:14:21.840
<v Speaker 7>Star Wars,</v>

4418
02:14:21.841 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4419
02:14:22.110 --> 02:14:22.311
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4420
02:14:22.311 --> 02:14:27.311
<v Speaker 7>the actual military program being used like satellites shooting at space</v>

4421
02:14:27.331 --> 02:14:28.860
<v Speaker 7>shuttles where they're on their way.</v>

4422
02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:31.290
<v Speaker 7>This asteroid to get diamonds,</v>

4423
02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:32.280
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be crazy.</v>

4424
02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:35.850
<v Speaker 7>And also a space right now is still mostly government sponsored.</v>

4425
02:14:35.850 --> 02:14:37.950
<v Speaker 7>So they think of a specific mission,</v>

4426
02:14:37.951 --> 02:14:38.850
<v Speaker 7>like let's go to Mars,</v>

4427
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:39.381
<v Speaker 7>had photographs,</v>

4428
02:14:39.381 --> 02:14:41.160
<v Speaker 7>some shit and send back the photos.</v>

4429
02:14:41.610 --> 02:14:42.660
<v Speaker 7>And then once that's done,</v>

4430
02:14:42.661 --> 02:14:43.500
<v Speaker 7>the mission's over.</v>

4431
02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:44.940
<v Speaker 7>But once we get true,</v>

4432
02:14:44.941 --> 02:14:45.774
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4433
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:47.460
<v Speaker 7>I hate to sound like I'm,</v>

4434
02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:49.360
<v Speaker 7>what's the word?</v>

4435
02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:52.170
<v Speaker 7>But once we get like free market enterprise and space,</v>

4436
02:14:52.171 --> 02:14:53.310
<v Speaker 7>as cheesy as that sounds,</v>

4437
02:14:53.311 --> 02:14:55.080
<v Speaker 7>we're like the motivation never stops.</v>

4438
02:14:55.081 --> 02:14:56.490
<v Speaker 7>The mission never stops the mission.</v>

4439
02:14:56.491 --> 02:14:59.040
<v Speaker 7>As we got to go further and find more resources.</v>

4440
02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:02.210
<v Speaker 7>Once we do that we're going to explore such a large part of,</v>

4441
02:15:02.530 --> 02:15:05.610
<v Speaker 7>of space because the money aspect is finally there.</v>

4442
02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:08.340
<v Speaker 7>Your rise before it's just like we'll do this because we have to do it.</v>

4443
02:15:08.341 --> 02:15:09.300
<v Speaker 7>We have to beat Russia,</v>

4444
02:15:09.450 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 7>but then we're coming home.</v>

4445
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.831
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>

4446
02:15:10.831 --> 02:15:13.110
<v Speaker 7>Wasn't that like the premise of the movie alien?</v>

4447
02:15:13.111 --> 02:15:14.610
<v Speaker 7>Weren't they totally releasing?</v>

4448
02:15:14.611 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 7>I think really Scott has the most accurate picture of what the future will look</v>

4449
02:15:18.271 --> 02:15:18.450
<v Speaker 7>like.</v>

4450
02:15:18.450 --> 02:15:19.740
<v Speaker 7>It's not going to be utopian.</v>

4451
02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:21.320
<v Speaker 7>It's not going to be completely awful.</v>

4452
02:15:21.321 --> 02:15:23.940
<v Speaker 7>It's just going to be powerful space mining companies.</v>

4453
02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:24.810
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4454
02:15:24.810 --> 02:15:27.930
<v Speaker 7>give us the motivation to create really fast spaceships cause we got to get out</v>

4455
02:15:27.931 --> 02:15:31.980
<v Speaker 7>there faster to beat other companies and once he had the same competitive drive</v>

4456
02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 7>that makes your phone so good and you know,</v>

4457
02:15:34.291 --> 02:15:35.520
<v Speaker 7>makes all this shit possible,</v>

4458
02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:36.481
<v Speaker 7>get that in space.</v>

4459
02:15:36.481 --> 02:15:37.620
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be completely insane.</v>

4460
02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:38.221
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4461
02:15:38.221 --> 02:15:39.031
<v Speaker 7>no shit.</v>

4462
02:15:39.031 --> 02:15:39.271
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4463
02:15:39.271 --> 02:15:41.310
<v Speaker 7>That's really what's going to propel space travel.</v>

4464
02:15:41.490 --> 02:15:45.000
<v Speaker 7>They figure out a way to make trillions of dollars by mining asteroids and</v>

4465
02:15:45.001 --> 02:15:46.020
<v Speaker 7>things along those lines.</v>

4466
02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:46.950
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

4467
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:47.170
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4468
02:15:47.170 --> 02:15:51.630
<v Speaker 7>the really Scott versions of alien too with like the most likely scenario of</v>

4469
02:15:51.631 --> 02:15:54.270
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck would happen if something got to us.</v>

4470
02:15:54.271 --> 02:15:57.030
<v Speaker 7>Like something that breeds as quickly as a disease,</v>

4471
02:15:57.330 --> 02:16:00.210
<v Speaker 7>something that grows to a gigantic size really quickly.</v>

4472
02:16:00.211 --> 02:16:05.211
<v Speaker 7>Like all of our biological limitations that we sort of put on bodies and aliens</v>

4473
02:16:05.341 --> 02:16:05.960
<v Speaker 7>and what,</v>

4474
02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:06.220
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>

4475
02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:08.760
<v Speaker 7>what would a body looked like if it came from space?</v>

4476
02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:10.620
<v Speaker 7>It probably looked like a fucking spider.</v>

4477
02:16:10.621 --> 02:16:11.401
<v Speaker 7>Like alien.</v>

4478
02:16:11.401 --> 02:16:12.091
<v Speaker 7>What is alien?</v>

4479
02:16:12.091 --> 02:16:15.660
<v Speaker 7>It's a giant spider and they can't reason with that thing and tell it like,</v>

4480
02:16:15.661 --> 02:16:17.970
<v Speaker 7>don't be a Predator and eat everybody on the space ship.</v>

4481
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.200
<v Speaker 7>It's the same as like a,</v>

4482
02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:20.700
<v Speaker 7>you talking about sharks.</v>

4483
02:16:20.701 --> 02:16:23.520
<v Speaker 7>That's something that was developed in the same system as us.</v>

4484
02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 7>And we can't even convince a shark not to eat us.</v>

4485
02:16:26.371 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 7>Think about when you're facing the thing with the mouth coming out of it,</v>

4486
02:16:29.741 --> 02:16:29.851
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4487
02:16:29.851 --> 02:16:30.280
<v Speaker 7>the multiple</v>

4488
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:31.113
<v Speaker 2>mouths,</v>

4489
02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.800
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be no way to stop,</v>

4490
02:16:32.801 --> 02:16:33.251
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4491
02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:34.084
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4492
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:36.070
<v Speaker 2>what was the other movie that was kind of like that?</v>

4493
02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4494
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:37.720
<v Speaker 2>with Harrison Ford,</v>

4495
02:16:37.721 --> 02:16:38.950
<v Speaker 2>that movie that came out recently,</v>

4496
02:16:39.510 --> 02:16:40.120
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

4497
02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:41.330
<v Speaker 2>and there's gamers game yet.</v>

4498
02:16:41.331 --> 02:16:41.861
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that.</v>

4499
02:16:41.861 --> 02:16:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Was that any good?</v>

4500
02:16:42.550 --> 02:16:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was pretty good.</v>

4501
02:16:43.770 --> 02:16:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4502
02:16:44.350 --> 02:16:48.640
<v Speaker 2>But they go after this like insect race and it's hard for them to communicate</v>

4503
02:16:48.641 --> 02:16:49.960
<v Speaker 2>and figure out what that race,</v>

4504
02:16:49.961 --> 02:16:52.180
<v Speaker 2>his intentions are because they're so alien,</v>

4505
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:52.661
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4506
02:16:52.661 --> 02:16:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're talking to like human sized ants basically.</v>

4507
02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4508
02:16:56.541 --> 02:16:57.410
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

4509
02:16:57.530 --> 02:17:00.200
<v Speaker 1>We can't even figure out what the fuck orchids are saying.</v>

4510
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And you swim on top of them.</v>

4511
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They ride those motherfuckers and we can't figure out what they're saying.</v>

4512
02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:05.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4513
02:17:05.871 --> 02:17:07.340
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what dolphins are saying.</v>

4514
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:08.960
<v Speaker 1>They know when they're upset.</v>

4515
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.823
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

4516
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

4517
02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:10.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4518
02:17:10.610 --> 02:17:11.720
<v Speaker 1>they know when they're happy,</v>

4519
02:17:12.470 --> 02:17:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but they're here and we've been studying them for decades.</v>

4520
02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:17.030
<v Speaker 1>We don't know shit.</v>

4521
02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:17.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4522
02:17:17.631 --> 02:17:22.631
<v Speaker 1>there's no like dolphin decoder device where we are and it comes out like,</v>

4523
02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:24.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4524
02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:24.421
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4525
02:17:24.421 --> 02:17:25.254
<v Speaker 2>Google text.</v>

4526
02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:27.300
<v Speaker 2>David Brennan has this really interesting idea.</v>

4527
02:17:27.301 --> 02:17:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I think he calls it uplifting and it's,</v>

4528
02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he actually believes this or if it was like something he wrote</v>

4529
02:17:32.461 --> 02:17:33.360
<v Speaker 2>in a science fiction book,</v>

4530
02:17:33.361 --> 02:17:37.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really cool idea and it's that at some point we're going to look to</v>

4531
02:17:37.261 --> 02:17:39.780
<v Speaker 2>other species on the earth that we find to be interesting,</v>

4532
02:17:39.781 --> 02:17:42.420
<v Speaker 2>probably dogs and dolphins and stuff and we're like,</v>

4533
02:17:42.421 --> 02:17:43.081
<v Speaker 2>we're going to upgrade.</v>

4534
02:17:43.081 --> 02:17:45.990
<v Speaker 2>You were going to figure out a way for us to communicate directly because you're</v>

4535
02:17:45.991 --> 02:17:48.390
<v Speaker 2>very similar to us and you probably have a,</v>

4536
02:17:48.510 --> 02:17:48.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4537
02:17:48.711 --> 02:17:51.060
<v Speaker 2>a perspective that's different from the human perspective,</v>

4538
02:17:51.061 --> 02:17:53.070
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to elevate them to our level.</v>

4539
02:17:53.370 --> 02:17:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Whereas right now they're kind of like savages.</v>

4540
02:17:55.830 --> 02:18:00.830
<v Speaker 2>We're going to bring them into modern society and kind of coexist with these</v>

4541
02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:03.810
<v Speaker 2>other species in a way that we've never done before.</v>

4542
02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:04.913
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4543
02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Well that is what they,</v>

4544
02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:08.960
<v Speaker 2>when you get to the real nutty people,</v>

4545
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:11.410
<v Speaker 1>thank that human beings were engineered by aliens.</v>

4546
02:18:11.590 --> 02:18:14.410
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially the premise of the last one.</v>

4547
02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Promethium yeah,</v>

4548
02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:17.020
<v Speaker 1>the engineer,</v>

4549
02:18:17.050 --> 02:18:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you know that is the premise.</v>

4550
02:18:18.821 --> 02:18:23.821
<v Speaker 1>The premise is that human beings were in some way or form designed by something</v>

4551
02:18:24.281 --> 02:18:25.120
<v Speaker 1>more intelligent.</v>

4552
02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:26.960
<v Speaker 2>They decided to bring us up a little bit.</v>

4553
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:28.250
<v Speaker 2>That engineer was such a Dick.</v>

4554
02:18:28.251 --> 02:18:31.600
<v Speaker 2>It's smart enough to create the human race but just flips out and starts like</v>

4555
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:32.421
<v Speaker 2>killing people.</v>

4556
02:18:32.421 --> 02:18:33.254
<v Speaker 2>Stupid movie.</v>

4557
02:18:33.510 --> 02:18:34.400
<v Speaker 2>That movie sucked.</v>

4558
02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:35.481
<v Speaker 2>It was cool.</v>

4559
02:18:35.481 --> 02:18:36.051
<v Speaker 2>It was okay.</v>

4560
02:18:36.051 --> 02:18:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm science fiction,</v>

4561
02:18:36.981 --> 02:18:37.461
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

4562
02:18:37.461 --> 02:18:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy those movies.</v>

4563
02:18:38.541 --> 02:18:39.374
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

4564
02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:41.390
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

4565
02:18:41.390 --> 02:18:44.060
<v Speaker 1>the first one was so god damn good.</v>

4566
02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:49.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the second one was pretty fucking good and the third one was not very</v>

4567
02:18:49.191 --> 02:18:49.960
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

4568
02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:52.010
<v Speaker 1>And then the fourth one was not good.</v>

4569
02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:53.660
<v Speaker 1>And then this one was,</v>

4570
02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:55.350
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

4571
02:18:55.640 --> 02:18:56.900
<v Speaker 1>he spent a lot of money on this.</v>

4572
02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Did you talk to any geeks need to talk to Geeks,</v>

4573
02:19:00.050 --> 02:19:03.560
<v Speaker 1>get a real fucking science fiction geek and ask him what's wrong with this</v>

4574
02:19:03.561 --> 02:19:04.190
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

4575
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And he'll tell you like,</v>

4576
02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:06.830
<v Speaker 1>why is he freaking out?</v>

4577
02:19:06.831 --> 02:19:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Why is this super smart giant dude roiling out</v>

4578
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and they have this huge like hologram version of the universe.</v>

4579
02:19:15.851 --> 02:19:17.050
<v Speaker 1>They have to like see it all.</v>

4580
02:19:17.051 --> 02:19:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I can three dimensional flying through space.</v>

4581
02:19:19.631 --> 02:19:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that just because you wanted to use that technology,</v>

4582
02:19:21.441 --> 02:19:24.220
<v Speaker 1>but that's an inefficient way of mapping out the unit.</v>

4583
02:19:24.250 --> 02:19:26.510
<v Speaker 1>The Universe is infinite.</v>

4584
02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>We can have an infinite</v>

4585
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.660
<v Speaker 5>map up there and the fucking sky.</v>

4586
02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:31.790
<v Speaker 5>He would just have a tablet and hit earth done.</v>

4587
02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:32.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4588
02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:33.130
<v Speaker 5>No need for all this stuff.</v>

4589
02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:33.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4590
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

4591
02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:34.573
<v Speaker 5>Take me to Miami.</v>

4592
02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:35.413
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

4593
02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.640
<v Speaker 6>Did you watch the blood moon?</v>

4594
02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:38.860
<v Speaker 6>That was a true,</v>

4595
02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:39.071
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4596
02:19:39.071 --> 02:19:39.610
<v Speaker 5>It was weird.</v>

4597
02:19:39.610 --> 02:19:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4598
02:19:39.970 --> 02:19:40.900
<v Speaker 5>How often does that happen?</v>

4599
02:19:41.350 --> 02:19:44.560
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know exactly what the blood moon is that just the regular clips?</v>

4600
02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:45.410
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

4601
02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:46.350
<v Speaker 6>it's an eclipse,</v>

4602
02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:49.120
<v Speaker 6>but there's something that happens where it looks red for will kill.</v>

4603
02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:51.370
<v Speaker 6>Let's find out three or four years.</v>

4604
02:19:51.371 --> 02:19:52.031
<v Speaker 6>There's an eclipse,</v>

4605
02:19:52.031 --> 02:19:53.410
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not sure about the blood moon part,</v>

4606
02:19:53.411 --> 02:19:58.060
<v Speaker 6>but the weird thing is when it got to that orange ish reddish phase,</v>

4607
02:19:58.210 --> 02:20:01.900
<v Speaker 6>it literally looked like somebody just throw a ball and it was just floating</v>

4608
02:20:01.901 --> 02:20:04.300
<v Speaker 6>there like it didn't look like the moon because the lighting,</v>

4609
02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:05.860
<v Speaker 6>especially when it started hitting the,</v>

4610
02:20:05.861 --> 02:20:07.420
<v Speaker 6>the left side really make,</v>

4611
02:20:07.450 --> 02:20:09.670
<v Speaker 6>you never saw lighting come from the bottom.</v>

4612
02:20:09.671 --> 02:20:12.910
<v Speaker 6>Like that just made the whole moon look fake as fuck.</v>

4613
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4614
02:20:13.241 --> 02:20:18.241
<v Speaker 5>There's a cool thing on CNN where they have all the various images of it and</v>

4615
02:20:19.481 --> 02:20:23.620
<v Speaker 5>they have some people did like time lapses and it's an interesting and the time</v>

4616
02:20:23.621 --> 02:20:26.830
<v Speaker 5>lapse you see like when it's in certain parts of the sky,</v>

4617
02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:31.270
<v Speaker 5>it's totally white and then it gets to one small segment of the sky where</v>

4618
02:20:31.271 --> 02:20:35.650
<v Speaker 5>there's some sort of a reflection or something and that is what's causing it.</v>

4619
02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:40.680
<v Speaker 5>If rain clouds rain or clouds obscured your lunar experience,</v>

4620
02:20:40.701 --> 02:20:41.411
<v Speaker 5>don't fret.</v>

4621
02:20:41.411 --> 02:20:46.150
<v Speaker 5>This episode is one of the first four consecutive total lunar eclipse is known</v>

4622
02:20:46.151 --> 02:20:51.130
<v Speaker 5>as a Tetrad that will occur in a six month interval,</v>

4623
02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:51.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4624
02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:55.150
<v Speaker 5>until September of 2015 wow.</v>

4625
02:20:55.330 --> 02:20:56.470
<v Speaker 5>Unlike solar eclipses,</v>

4626
02:20:56.770 --> 02:21:00.460
<v Speaker 5>lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye and don't require special</v>

4627
02:21:00.461 --> 02:21:01.294
<v Speaker 5>filters,</v>

4628
02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:03.520
<v Speaker 5>so it's a part of the eclipse,</v>

4629
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:04.660
<v Speaker 5>a process</v>

4630
02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:09.180
<v Speaker 6>that right there when you saw that chartering photo part happened,</v>

4631
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.540
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

4632
02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:09.811
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

4633
02:21:09.811 --> 02:21:10.830
<v Speaker 6>this is not the moon.</v>

4634
02:21:10.831 --> 02:21:12.060
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is this thing?</v>

4635
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:13.363
<v Speaker 6>It's creepy.</v>

4636
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:16.050
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like it's a semi-transparent.</v>

4637
02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:16.943
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty cool.</v>

4638
02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:17.941
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>

4639
02:21:17.941 --> 02:21:22.941
<v Speaker 5>a guy has this really wacky youtube page that I just found out about and it's</v>

4640
02:21:23.041 --> 02:21:26.310
<v Speaker 5>interesting when you go to someone's youtube page and you find out that they</v>

4641
02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:26.521
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

4642
02:21:26.521 --> 02:21:29.910
<v Speaker 5>like every video has like 2 million plus views.</v>

4643
02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:30.181
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4644
02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:30.961
<v Speaker 5>this is nuts.</v>

4645
02:21:30.961 --> 02:21:34.080
<v Speaker 5>This guy's insane amount of views and it's sort of a science based one.</v>

4646
02:21:34.081 --> 02:21:37.020
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of cool that it has so many views because it's a really intelligent</v>

4647
02:21:37.050 --> 02:21:37.883
<v Speaker 5>youtube page.</v>

4648
02:21:38.250 --> 02:21:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Someone was asking me to have the guy on the podcast and I had never heard of</v>

4649
02:21:41.311 --> 02:21:41.551
<v Speaker 5>the guy,</v>

4650
02:21:41.551 --> 02:21:42.301
<v Speaker 5>so I go to his page.</v>

4651
02:21:42.301 --> 02:21:42.571
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4652
02:21:42.571 --> 02:21:43.400
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

4653
02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4654
02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:44.850
<v Speaker 5>One of them was,</v>

4655
02:21:44.851 --> 02:21:49.851
<v Speaker 5>what if the moon was a giant disco ball and what if the moon was a disco ball</v>

4656
02:21:50.131 --> 02:21:52.650
<v Speaker 5>and it was only 300 miles from the earth's surface?</v>

4657
02:21:52.651 --> 02:21:54.960
<v Speaker 5>It was like floating right about what would it look like?</v>

4658
02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:58.590
<v Speaker 5>So they did this animated thing of what the moon would look like.</v>

4659
02:21:58.591 --> 02:22:01.470
<v Speaker 5>As a typical Paul that's 300 miles away,</v>

4660
02:22:01.471 --> 02:22:02.610
<v Speaker 5>it's insane.</v>

4661
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:04.860
<v Speaker 5>We've fills up the whole night sky.</v>

4662
02:22:04.861 --> 02:22:08.100
<v Speaker 5>Like you realize how big the moon really is and you're like,</v>

4663
02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:09.810
<v Speaker 5>oh my God.</v>

4664
02:22:09.930 --> 02:22:13.710
<v Speaker 5>Like when you see this graphic representation of it filling up the night sky.</v>

4665
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:16.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a really cool idea that they try to do that.</v>

4666
02:22:16.591 --> 02:22:17.241
<v Speaker 5>I mean it wouldn't,</v>

4667
02:22:17.241 --> 02:22:18.074
<v Speaker 5>I don't put it up,</v>

4668
02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:21.330
<v Speaker 5>Christ go over this.</v>

4669
02:22:21.331 --> 02:22:22.410
<v Speaker 5>How many times we have to go over this.</v>

4670
02:22:22.690 --> 02:22:23.220
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4671
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:24.360
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>

4672
02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:25.230
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4673
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 5>the size of</v>

4674
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.580
<v Speaker 1>it though,</v>

4675
02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:30.420
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to the earth and you really get an idea of the one quarter of</v>

4676
02:22:30.421 --> 02:22:32.670
<v Speaker 1>the size of the earth.</v>

4677
02:22:32.671 --> 02:22:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how big the moon actually is.</v>

4678
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:35.580
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the way the fuck up.</v>

4679
02:22:35.581 --> 02:22:36.690
<v Speaker 1>There's this little tiny thing,</v>

4680
02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:38.580
<v Speaker 1>but if it was floating in our sky,</v>

4681
02:22:38.610 --> 02:22:40.960
<v Speaker 1>it would literally take up the entire night's guy that,</v>

4682
02:22:40.961 --> 02:22:41.731
<v Speaker 1>that space show.</v>

4683
02:22:41.731 --> 02:22:41.941
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

4684
02:22:41.941 --> 02:22:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm so addicted to cosmos,</v>

4685
02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:43.981
<v Speaker 1>Cosmos.</v>

4686
02:22:43.981 --> 02:22:44.540
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

4687
02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:45.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so awesome.</v>

4688
02:22:46.050 --> 02:22:46.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4689
02:22:46.231 --> 02:22:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Seth Mcfarlane's a bad motherfucker and Neil degrasse Tyson is also a bad</v>

4690
02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:52.380
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker is he'll be on,</v>

4691
02:22:52.381 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I'll get them on this month.</v>

4692
02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:55.313
<v Speaker 1>He's around.</v>

4693
02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:56.190
<v Speaker 1>He's just back and forth.</v>

4694
02:22:56.191 --> 02:22:57.210
<v Speaker 1>We've been emailing each other.</v>

4695
02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:57.540
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4696
02:22:57.540 --> 02:22:58.560
<v Speaker 1>he's busy as fuck.</v>

4697
02:22:58.920 --> 02:22:59.641
<v Speaker 1>I hope it does.</v>

4698
02:22:59.641 --> 02:22:59.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4699
02:22:59.941 --> 02:23:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the ratings are of it,</v>

4700
02:23:01.381 --> 02:23:01.860
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

4701
02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering why I was watching it.</v>

4702
02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything</v>

4703
02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:04.391
<v Speaker 3>good?</v>

4704
02:23:04.391 --> 02:23:04.961
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

4705
02:23:04.961 --> 02:23:07.690
<v Speaker 3>And what's really cool is that it's on like Hulu and stuff like that so you can</v>

4706
02:23:07.691 --> 02:23:08.740
<v Speaker 3>just watch it straight up.</v>

4707
02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Got to cross,</v>

4708
02:23:10.331 --> 02:23:12.070
<v Speaker 3>cross promoted with like duck hunter.</v>

4709
02:23:13.570 --> 02:23:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh there's some stupid fucking shows on discovery channel man.</v>

4710
02:23:17.551 --> 02:23:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I went to discovery the other day and I was like,</v>

4711
02:23:19.381 --> 02:23:20.740
<v Speaker 1>how did discovery becomes</v>

4712
02:23:20.810 --> 02:23:21.380
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

4713
02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:21.830
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>

4714
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:24.200
<v Speaker 3>The TLC is now like nothing to do with learning.</v>

4715
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.740
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4716
02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:25.650
<v Speaker 3>it's the uh,</v>

4717
02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:27.710
<v Speaker 3>honey booboo channel now.</v>

4718
02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>And discovery has these shows that have nothing to do with discovering anything.</v>

4719
02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Now if you want what discovery used to be,</v>

4720
02:23:36.411 --> 02:23:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you got to head over to science channel and then you get how,</v>

4721
02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:39.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4722
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:43.160
<v Speaker 3>how it's made is one of my favorite shows to watch wall show while I'm enjoying</v>

4723
02:23:43.161 --> 02:23:46.180
<v Speaker 3>a certain substances because it gives,</v>

4724
02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:48.530
<v Speaker 3>it gives you an appreciation for everything.</v>

4725
02:23:48.531 --> 02:23:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Like something boring.</v>

4726
02:23:49.371 --> 02:23:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Like this bottle of water becomes fascinating.</v>

4727
02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:52.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4728
02:23:52.131 --> 02:23:53.750
<v Speaker 3>How it's made is a really cool show.</v>

4729
02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:55.400
<v Speaker 3>It's disturbing though.</v>

4730
02:23:55.401 --> 02:23:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Looking at,</v>

4731
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:57.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a new show on,</v>

4732
02:23:57.721 --> 02:23:58.554
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4733
02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:00.030
<v Speaker 1>on discovery.</v>

4734
02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You remember that video that we played at Ted Nugent and this guy,</v>

4735
02:24:03.151 --> 02:24:05.940
<v Speaker 1>pig man shooting a pigs from a helicopter,</v>

4736
02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:08.730
<v Speaker 1>just machine gunning pigs out of a helicopter.</v>

4737
02:24:08.731 --> 02:24:10.140
<v Speaker 1>These wild feral pigs,</v>

4738
02:24:10.141 --> 02:24:12.300
<v Speaker 1>they have to eradicate from a lot of these Texas farms.</v>

4739
02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Well now he's got his own show.</v>

4740
02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Pig Man has his own show.</v>

4741
02:24:15.241 --> 02:24:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's called boss hog and on boss Hog,</v>

4742
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:19.500
<v Speaker 1>he's a running around.</v>

4743
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:24.210
<v Speaker 1>He owns a barbecue place that cooks up these pigs that he shoots and him and his</v>

4744
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:26.460
<v Speaker 1>dad run around shooting pigs.</v>

4745
02:24:26.461 --> 02:24:29.720
<v Speaker 1>And then they have a lot of fake scenarios that take place because they're,</v>

4746
02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:32.580
<v Speaker 1>they're obviously artificially scripted scenarios,</v>

4747
02:24:32.581 --> 02:24:32.760
<v Speaker 1>arrows.</v>

4748
02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:33.580
<v Speaker 3>And because that shows,</v>

4749
02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:36.400
<v Speaker 3>it shows you that we're animals still and we're starting to accept that.</v>

4750
02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is entirely bad that we're going to stupid or programming</v>

4751
02:24:40.031 --> 02:24:41.590
<v Speaker 3>because you're not stupid or,</v>

4752
02:24:41.591 --> 02:24:45.610
<v Speaker 3>but things that have the discovery channel to do the science because we're like,</v>

4753
02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:45.911
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4754
02:24:45.911 --> 02:24:47.010
<v Speaker 3>we like to watch people hunt.</v>

4755
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:49.300
<v Speaker 3>We like to watch people negotiate.</v>

4756
02:24:49.301 --> 02:24:50.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's pawn stars.</v>

4757
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

4758
02:24:51.450 --> 02:24:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4759
02:24:51.610 --> 02:24:55.270
<v Speaker 3>we're just interested in seeing other humans do all these things that we have to</v>

4760
02:24:55.271 --> 02:24:56.104
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

4761
02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:59.470
<v Speaker 3>but their logo has a fucking planet in it.</v>

4762
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:01.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4763
02:25:01.391 --> 02:25:02.620
<v Speaker 3>the discovery channel,</v>

4764
02:25:02.621 --> 02:25:03.790
<v Speaker 3>it's like you thinking about like,</v>

4765
02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:04.031
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4766
02:25:04.031 --> 02:25:06.490
<v Speaker 3>we're going to watch a documentary around polar bears.</v>

4767
02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4768
02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:08.740
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see leopard seals.</v>

4769
02:25:08.770 --> 02:25:08.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4770
02:25:08.951 --> 02:25:10.580
<v Speaker 3>You're not as second to discover anything.</v>

4771
02:25:10.850 --> 02:25:12.700
<v Speaker 3>Discover the back of a fucking pawn shop.</v>

4772
02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you that.</v>

4773
02:25:14.470 --> 02:25:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I made some barbecue.</v>

4774
02:25:15.980 --> 02:25:16.813
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

4775
02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:18.600
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna sell moonshot.</v>

4776
02:25:18.610 --> 02:25:19.361
<v Speaker 3>We're crazy.</v>

4777
02:25:19.361 --> 02:25:20.920
<v Speaker 3>That cop doesn't even see the camera.</v>

4778
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.950
<v Speaker 3>Look out one normal.</v>

4779
02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Jakks well,</v>

4780
02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:23.710
<v Speaker 3>it's the truck.</v>

4781
02:25:23.711 --> 02:25:24.460
<v Speaker 3>What's in the truck?</v>

4782
02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Why is there a camera pointed at you in a fucking crew?</v>

4783
02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Why is your microphones on everybody?</v>

4784
02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:30.280
<v Speaker 3>How about that question?</v>

4785
02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:31.930
<v Speaker 3>That Mermaid Shit.</v>

4786
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.800
<v Speaker 3>All that up.</v>

4787
02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:34.150
<v Speaker 3>That's like creepy videos.</v>

4788
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:35.051
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example.</v>

4789
02:25:35.051 --> 02:25:39.460
<v Speaker 3>That animal planet made a fake fucking show on mermaids.</v>

4790
02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:40.473
<v Speaker 3>Like a fake.</v>

4791
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Who pretended that there were real mermaids and they knew they were trolling the</v>

4792
02:25:44.381 --> 02:25:45.214
<v Speaker 3>whole time.</v>

4793
02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:45.740
<v Speaker 3>You want me?</v>

4794
02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Tommy's sent me fucking tweets through thrown real mermaids.</v>

4795
02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:50.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4796
02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:50.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4797
02:25:50.861 --> 02:25:51.694
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

4798
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:51.941
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4799
02:25:51.941 --> 02:25:53.140
<v Speaker 1>they didn't find real mermaids.</v>

4800
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:55.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm about to actually cancel my cable this week.</v>

4801
02:25:55.881 --> 02:25:56.360
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

4802
02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:57.560
<v Speaker 3>I think I've got Internet.</v>

4803
02:25:58.070 --> 02:26:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to just do a soft cancel where I act like I don't have it and I</v>

4804
02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:03.590
<v Speaker 3>just go on Netflix.</v>

4805
02:26:03.591 --> 02:26:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Go on Hulu.</v>

4806
02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Hulu is the best man between</v>

4807
02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Netflix and Amazon video.</v>

4808
02:26:09.441 --> 02:26:12.760
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to really have cable except for like when there's a live event</v>

4809
02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:13.970
<v Speaker 3>that you can just get a,</v>

4810
02:26:13.971 --> 02:26:15.050
<v Speaker 3>I think you can pay,</v>

4811
02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:16.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4812
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.920
<v Speaker 3>so kind of small fee for CNN live and then you're good.</v>

4813
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:19.430
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4814
02:26:19.430 --> 02:26:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4815
02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:20.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4816
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to recommend bit torrent,</v>

4817
02:26:22.221 --> 02:26:23.054
<v Speaker 3>but you're all,</v>

4818
02:26:24.530 --> 02:26:29.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a way to get things and the most bit torrented show ever in the history</v>

4819
02:26:30.051 --> 02:26:32.990
<v Speaker 1>of bit torrent is the most recent episode of game of Thrones.</v>

4820
02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4821
02:26:33.890 --> 02:26:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4822
02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:38.510
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit torrent by some insane number.</v>

4823
02:26:38.511 --> 02:26:43.511
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 200,000 different people had it available for downloading,</v>

4824
02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:45.740
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing.</v>

4825
02:26:45.770 --> 02:26:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

4826
02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:51.400
<v Speaker 1>The winner for the largest bit torrent swarm ever 193,000 pirates simultaneously</v>

4827
02:26:53.721 --> 02:26:55.980
<v Speaker 1>sharing the same file.</v>

4828
02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:01.280
<v Speaker 3>I love the language that we use for the swarm of pirates is the biggest ever had</v>

4829
02:27:01.281 --> 02:27:05.030
<v Speaker 3>eye patches and hooks it fucking beat their keyboard with the hook.</v>

4830
02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Actually never use that anymore.</v>

4831
02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:07.633
<v Speaker 3>I stopped it.</v>

4832
02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:08.750
<v Speaker 3>I used to too scary,</v>

4833
02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:10.073
<v Speaker 1>too dangerous.</v>

4834
02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Too many people just getting the fuck suit out of him for for seeding.</v>

4835
02:27:15.061 --> 02:27:16.930
<v Speaker 1>You know you have it up there and you know you're,</v>

4836
02:27:17.490 --> 02:27:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4837
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:22.650
<v Speaker 1>having people and then they fucking send software that infects your computer and</v>

4838
02:27:22.651 --> 02:27:24.270
<v Speaker 1>now you don't even know that you're hacked.</v>

4839
02:27:24.271 --> 02:27:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's just crazy.</v>

4840
02:27:26.071 --> 02:27:26.271
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

4841
02:27:26.271 --> 02:27:28.590
<v Speaker 1>the fees that some people like some housewife,</v>

4842
02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you owe us $1 million.</v>

4843
02:27:29.731 --> 02:27:32.330
<v Speaker 1>What the,</v>

4844
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:35.250
<v Speaker 1>the nonsense behind it ones and Zeros.</v>

4845
02:27:35.251 --> 02:27:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

4846
02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if game of Thrones does anything about this,</v>

4847
02:27:38.431 --> 02:27:38.911
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

4848
02:27:38.911 --> 02:27:40.050
<v Speaker 1>if they'd go after it,</v>

4849
02:27:40.051 --> 02:27:41.640
<v Speaker 1>if they try to stop it.</v>

4850
02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Definitely during an August earnings call with investors,</v>

4851
02:27:46.261 --> 02:27:51.261
<v Speaker 1>Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes bragged about the shows of massive piracy levels.</v>

4852
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:53.551
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

4853
02:27:53.551 --> 02:27:54.660
<v Speaker 1>if you go around the world,</v>

4854
02:27:54.690 --> 02:27:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

4855
02:27:55.951 --> 02:27:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world.</v>

4856
02:27:58.291 --> 02:27:59.100
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

4857
02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:00.390
<v Speaker 1>now that's better than an Emmy.</v>

4858
02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4859
02:28:01.050 --> 02:28:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4860
02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:01.851
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

4861
02:28:01.851 --> 02:28:02.661
<v Speaker 3>that's a good attitude.</v>

4862
02:28:02.661 --> 02:28:03.494
<v Speaker 3>It's really enlightened.</v>

4863
02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

4864
02:28:04.010 --> 02:28:05.480
<v Speaker 3>That is a good attitude because look,</v>

4865
02:28:05.540 --> 02:28:07.850
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to stop people from watching it.</v>

4866
02:28:07.970 --> 02:28:09.470
<v Speaker 3>And it does expose your,</v>

4867
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:10.490
<v Speaker 3>if people like it,</v>

4868
02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:12.890
<v Speaker 3>they will go pay money for the movie version.</v>

4869
02:28:12.891 --> 02:28:15.860
<v Speaker 3>They will pay money for the book that you get some kind of royalty on.</v>

4870
02:28:15.861 --> 02:28:16.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4871
02:28:16.011 --> 02:28:17.420
<v Speaker 3>like there's ways to make money.</v>

4872
02:28:18.420 --> 02:28:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4873
02:28:18.810 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 1>HBO CEO doesn't care that you are sharing your HBO.</v>

4874
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:24.020
<v Speaker 1>What's his password?</v>

4875
02:28:24.021 --> 02:28:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Then I watched his HBO go,</v>

4876
02:28:26.370 --> 02:28:28.310
<v Speaker 1>we're in the business of creating addicts.</v>

4877
02:28:28.311 --> 02:28:28.970
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

4878
02:28:28.970 --> 02:28:29.421
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4879
02:28:29.421 --> 02:28:31.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a great attitude.</v>

4880
02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:32.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a great attitude.</v>

4881
02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:33.141
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>

4882
02:28:33.141 --> 02:28:34.520
<v Speaker 1>if people can afford HBO,</v>

4883
02:28:34.521 --> 02:28:35.490
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get HBO,</v>

4884
02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:35.931
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4885
02:28:35.931 --> 02:28:36.681
<v Speaker 1>If you can afford it,</v>

4886
02:28:36.681 --> 02:28:37.251
<v Speaker 1>and if you can't,</v>

4887
02:28:37.251 --> 02:28:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get it.</v>

4888
02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:40.690
<v Speaker 1>So like this idea that you're stopping people,</v>

4889
02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:42.230
<v Speaker 1>you're stealing money,</v>

4890
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:47.650
<v Speaker 1>are they really or are they simply getting something and enjoying it that they</v>

4891
02:28:48.051 --> 02:28:49.530
<v Speaker 1>would've never been able to afford?</v>

4892
02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:51.080
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a bunch of people that,</v>

4893
02:28:51.081 --> 02:28:51.411
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4894
02:28:51.411 --> 02:28:53.000
<v Speaker 1>they would have been forced to pay for it,</v>

4895
02:28:53.450 --> 02:28:55.430
<v Speaker 1>but I bet it evens itself out.</v>

4896
02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:55.881
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

4897
02:28:55.881 --> 02:28:56.511
<v Speaker 1>In a long run,</v>

4898
02:28:56.511 --> 02:29:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it kind of evens itself out one way or another because people are going to get</v>

4899
02:29:00.351 --> 02:29:01.184
<v Speaker 1>HBO.</v>

4900
02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.680
<v Speaker 1>The music business got fucked.</v>

4901
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:04.791
<v Speaker 1>The music business,</v>

4902
02:29:04.791 --> 02:29:05.510
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>

4903
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:06.530
<v Speaker 1>that shit disappeared.</v>

4904
02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:08.150
<v Speaker 2>They went the dumb way.</v>

4905
02:29:08.151 --> 02:29:08.600
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>

4906
02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:09.433
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

4907
02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:12.080
<v Speaker 2>I swear this is the last time I mentioned digital money,</v>

4908
02:29:12.081 --> 02:29:15.500
<v Speaker 2>but banks have an opportunity to not do the exact same thing that record</v>

4909
02:29:15.501 --> 02:29:16.700
<v Speaker 2>companies did was like,</v>

4910
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:17.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

4911
02:29:17.061 --> 02:29:18.530
<v Speaker 2>we got to fight this tooth and nail.</v>

4912
02:29:18.890 --> 02:29:22.730
<v Speaker 2>All it leads to is better technology and the second version you can't fight.</v>

4913
02:29:22.731 --> 02:29:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the first version you can and it doesn't stop human behavior.</v>

4914
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you irrelevant.</v>

4915
02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:27.221
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4916
02:29:27.221 --> 02:29:28.600
<v Speaker 1>If they brought you into a meeting,</v>

4917
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:31.000
<v Speaker 1>say like Bank of America says David Seaman,</v>

4918
02:29:31.001 --> 02:29:31.781
<v Speaker 1>we liked the way you think.</v>

4919
02:29:31.781 --> 02:29:33.460
<v Speaker 1>We heard you on the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

4920
02:29:33.461 --> 02:29:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You've got some great ideas.</v>

4921
02:29:34.421 --> 02:29:35.051
<v Speaker 1>What should we do?</v>

4922
02:29:35.051 --> 02:29:36.340
<v Speaker 1>What should we do is digital?</v>

4923
02:29:36.341 --> 02:29:36.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4924
02:29:36.551 --> 02:29:36.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4925
02:29:36.701 --> 02:29:36.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4926
02:29:36.851 --> 02:29:37.091
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4927
02:29:37.091 --> 02:29:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have email.</v>

4928
02:29:38.140 --> 02:29:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4929
02:29:38.970 --> 02:29:39.803
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4930
02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4931
02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I got to go like to go duck hunting on the weekends.</v>

4932
02:29:42.011 --> 02:29:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4933
02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:43.430
<v Speaker 1>What should I do?</v>

4934
02:29:43.430 --> 02:29:44.211
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple.</v>

4935
02:29:44.211 --> 02:29:45.044
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

4936
02:29:45.050 --> 02:29:46.730
<v Speaker 2>if somebody called me in for a meeting like that,</v>

4937
02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:47.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4938
02:29:47.931 --> 02:29:50.990
<v Speaker 2>it all comes down to game theory and it's like we have this thing in the middle</v>

4939
02:29:50.991 --> 02:29:55.400
<v Speaker 2>of the table that everybody wants and at the earliest adopters would benefit</v>

4940
02:29:55.401 --> 02:29:55.970
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

4941
02:29:55.970 --> 02:29:58.790
<v Speaker 2>So you as bank of America or you as chase,</v>

4942
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you want to be the first one new adopt this because you're going to gain so much</v>

4943
02:30:02.541 --> 02:30:06.740
<v Speaker 2>market share so fast that it's going to fuck all your competitors and people</v>

4944
02:30:06.741 --> 02:30:11.000
<v Speaker 2>right now are desperate for a bit coin service they can trust and is as Shitty</v>

4945
02:30:11.001 --> 02:30:11.834
<v Speaker 2>as these banks are.</v>

4946
02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:17.020
<v Speaker 2>The Bank of America brand name has a lot more trust then that Guy Karplus.</v>

4947
02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:17.451
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4948
02:30:17.451 --> 02:30:19.790
<v Speaker 2>So like between those two organizations,</v>

4949
02:30:19.791 --> 02:30:22.580
<v Speaker 2>who would I prefer to have my bitcoin with or who would rather,</v>

4950
02:30:22.581 --> 02:30:23.780
<v Speaker 2>who would I prefer to buy it with?</v>

4951
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Definitely the bank that's down the street and that I know has,</v>

4952
02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:29.150
<v Speaker 2>you know whatever market cap they have,</v>

4953
02:30:29.151 --> 02:30:31.760
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of money and I know they're not going under tomorrow.</v>

4954
02:30:31.970 --> 02:30:36.740
<v Speaker 2>So I would say ignore all the political rabble rousing and all the bold</v>

4955
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:38.690
<v Speaker 2>predictions people like me are making,</v>

4956
02:30:38.691 --> 02:30:40.670
<v Speaker 2>which will probably not come true.</v>

4957
02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.230
<v Speaker 2>And instead look at this as just the better technology and you as a bank,</v>

4958
02:30:45.231 --> 02:30:48.320
<v Speaker 2>you want to implement better technologies cause it means lower fraud,</v>

4959
02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:49.581
<v Speaker 2>less expense,</v>

4960
02:30:49.581 --> 02:30:51.650
<v Speaker 2>more possibility for profit and innovation.</v>

4961
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Go fucking do it and do it before chased us.</v>

4962
02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:57.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good piece of advice right there.</v>

4963
02:30:57.071 --> 02:30:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I like to rephrase that too,</v>

4964
02:30:58.511 --> 02:30:59.750
<v Speaker 1>that there is an uh,</v>

4965
02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:01.390
<v Speaker 1>you've built up a name,</v>

4966
02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:03.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of trust in your name and you can monopolize it.</v>

4967
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:05.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is what people want now.</v>

4968
02:31:05.711 --> 02:31:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you didn't decide it and maybe it's to your short term disadvantage,</v>

4969
02:31:09.341 --> 02:31:11.050
<v Speaker 2>but people want something and that's a good thing.</v>

4970
02:31:11.051 --> 02:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a,</v>

4971
02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:15.670
<v Speaker 2>you remember the social network where the one guy wanted him to put ads all over</v>

4972
02:31:15.671 --> 02:31:16.361
<v Speaker 2>the site and he's like,</v>

4973
02:31:16.361 --> 02:31:16.691
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4974
02:31:16.691 --> 02:31:17.710
<v Speaker 2>like we don't know what this is,</v>

4975
02:31:17.711 --> 02:31:21.300
<v Speaker 2>but we know it's cool right now and banks have not done anything cool in a very</v>

4976
02:31:21.301 --> 02:31:24.690
<v Speaker 2>long time and the young people are really disenfranchised.</v>

4977
02:31:24.691 --> 02:31:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I hate most banks and it's because they've been so bad and they just do a bad</v>

4978
02:31:28.261 --> 02:31:29.400
<v Speaker 2>job with what they do.</v>

4979
02:31:29.730 --> 02:31:30.990
<v Speaker 2>If you modernize a little bit,</v>

4980
02:31:30.991 --> 02:31:34.020
<v Speaker 2>you might get the 20 and 30 somethings to put their money back in your bank,</v>

4981
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:35.430
<v Speaker 2>you might make a lot of money.</v>

4982
02:31:35.730 --> 02:31:37.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good point,</v>

4983
02:31:37.051 --> 02:31:37.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4984
02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:41.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good point and it's also about addressing the inevitability of</v>

4985
02:31:41.101 --> 02:31:42.510
<v Speaker 1>what's going on like,</v>

4986
02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but they would look at it in terms of maybe they have their finger on the</v>

4987
02:31:46.111 --> 02:31:46.591
<v Speaker 1>trigger that,</v>

4988
02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:48.810
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to press it too soon and fucked themselves.</v>

4989
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you heard that like a RJ Reynolds had the patents for several</v>

4990
02:31:54.451 --> 02:31:58.200
<v Speaker 1>different strains of marijuana and they had labels printed up ready to go.</v>

4991
02:31:58.201 --> 02:31:59.820
<v Speaker 1>That was always one of those urban myths,</v>

4992
02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:00.451
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4993
02:32:00.451 --> 02:32:04.380
<v Speaker 1>But the idea was that they don't want to come out with it too soon because of</v>

4994
02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.820
<v Speaker 1>marijuana does become legal.</v>

4995
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:08.820
<v Speaker 1>They want to be able to jump on it and be able to sell.</v>

4996
02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:09.380
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

4997
02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:10.950
<v Speaker 6>that's the pope called gold.</v>

4998
02:32:11.050 --> 02:32:12.100
<v Speaker 2>That's weakness right there.</v>

4999
02:32:12.101 --> 02:32:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Because we never control when things happen,</v>

5000
02:32:14.111 --> 02:32:15.580
<v Speaker 2>but we control how we respond.</v>

5001
02:32:15.730 --> 02:32:20.730
<v Speaker 2>And I think Amazon is run by a brilliant guy and I think their failure to accept</v>

5002
02:32:20.951 --> 02:32:25.030
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is one of their first really big fuckups because overstock is a big</v>

5003
02:32:25.031 --> 02:32:25.780
<v Speaker 2>company too.</v>

5004
02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:28.600
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to get a lot bigger because now there's that loyalty there.</v>

5005
02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Before I didn't care about overstock at all.</v>

5006
02:32:30.371 --> 02:32:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5007
02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I would never mention them on a show like yours.</v>

5008
02:32:32.410 --> 02:32:33.041
<v Speaker 2>Overstock,</v>

5009
02:32:33.041 --> 02:32:34.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like some bullshit ecommerce site.</v>

5010
02:32:35.470 --> 02:32:36.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a ecommerce site.</v>

5011
02:32:36.730 --> 02:32:38.830
<v Speaker 2>And up until recently I would not care at all.</v>

5012
02:32:38.831 --> 02:32:39.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5013
02:32:39.011 --> 02:32:40.960
<v Speaker 2>who cares about this second tier e commerce site?</v>

5014
02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:41.861
<v Speaker 2>But now to me,</v>

5015
02:32:41.861 --> 02:32:43.570
<v Speaker 2>they're like the new Amazon cause they get it.</v>

5016
02:32:43.571 --> 02:32:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And so I can see them,</v>

5017
02:32:45.250 --> 02:32:45.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5018
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:48.280
<v Speaker 2>gaining what Amazon would have if they had jumped in.</v>

5019
02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:49.530
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference?</v>

5020
02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:50.170
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

5021
02:32:50.170 --> 02:32:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware of.</v>

5022
02:32:51.121 --> 02:32:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Overstock?</v>

5023
02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:52.291
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5024
02:32:52.291 --> 02:32:53.200
<v Speaker 6>it's just you.</v>

5025
02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:53.880
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what it is?</v>

5026
02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:55.950
<v Speaker 6>Brian overstock the big,</v>

5027
02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:56.320
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

5028
02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:56.850
<v Speaker 6>what is it?</v>

5029
02:32:56.850 --> 02:32:57.780
<v Speaker 6>The ads you see much.</v>

5030
02:32:58.620 --> 02:32:59.550
<v Speaker 6>What is overstock?</v>

5031
02:32:59.570 --> 02:32:59.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5032
02:32:59.910 --> 02:33:00.743
<v Speaker 6>it's uh,</v>

5033
02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:03.540
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty much where they take older stuff where they have too much like a</v>

5034
02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:04.140
<v Speaker 6>iPads.</v>

5035
02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:04.471
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5036
02:33:04.471 --> 02:33:05.670
<v Speaker 6>They bought too many iPads.</v>

5037
02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:07.380
<v Speaker 6>There is a new iPad about to come out.</v>

5038
02:33:07.500 --> 02:33:08.430
<v Speaker 6>So overstock,</v>

5039
02:33:08.431 --> 02:33:11.520
<v Speaker 6>we'll buy all those old iPads for a cheaper price,</v>

5040
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.971
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5041
02:33:11.971 --> 02:33:13.050
<v Speaker 6>cause there's too much stock.</v>

5042
02:33:13.051 --> 02:33:13.884
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not selling.</v>

5043
02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:14.511
<v Speaker 6>Oh I see.</v>

5044
02:33:14.511 --> 02:33:16.200
<v Speaker 6>So it's kind of like Ross for electronics.</v>

5045
02:33:16.201 --> 02:33:16.921
<v Speaker 6>You get new.</v>

5046
02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:17.910
<v Speaker 6>Anything new there?</v>

5047
02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:18.091
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5048
02:33:18.091 --> 02:33:18.841
<v Speaker 6>you can get new stuff.</v>

5049
02:33:18.841 --> 02:33:19.291
<v Speaker 6>Pasta.</v>

5050
02:33:19.291 --> 02:33:20.041
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of it,</v>

5051
02:33:20.041 --> 02:33:21.660
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's at least the original,</v>

5052
02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:22.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5053
02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:24.720
<v Speaker 6>how it started off was always like too much stuff.</v>

5054
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:26.023
<v Speaker 6>That's nice.</v>

5055
02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the way that they started and took off was that they offer</v>

5056
02:33:28.941 --> 02:33:31.000
<v Speaker 2>cheaper stuff because it was literally overstock.</v>

5057
02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:32.580
<v Speaker 2>But now you can get pretty much anything.</v>

5058
02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So what's the difference between their model of business and Amazon's you think</v>

5059
02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:39.210
<v Speaker 1>their model of business is superior?</v>

5060
02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5061
02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:42.310
<v Speaker 2>I just think the CEO is able to,</v>

5062
02:33:42.470 --> 02:33:45.400
<v Speaker 2>to look into the future better than what Amazon is doing because Amazon is</v>

5063
02:33:45.401 --> 02:33:46.300
<v Speaker 2>playing it safe.</v>

5064
02:33:46.330 --> 02:33:47.163
<v Speaker 2>And if you're,</v>

5065
02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:48.580
<v Speaker 2>if you're that kind of company,</v>

5066
02:33:48.581 --> 02:33:49.690
<v Speaker 2>you can't afford to play it safe.</v>

5067
02:33:49.691 --> 02:33:52.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why Google is doing so well is they go like,</v>

5068
02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:55.750
<v Speaker 2>we'll spend a lot of money on crazy stuff that will not work out.</v>

5069
02:33:56.050 --> 02:33:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay because one of those crazy things might be our next major</v>

5070
02:33:59.831 --> 02:34:00.521
<v Speaker 2>revenue stream.</v>

5071
02:34:00.521 --> 02:34:01.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's happened several times.</v>

5072
02:34:01.601 --> 02:34:01.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5073
02:34:01.810 --> 02:34:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Gmail started is we're just going to offer free email and see where it goes.</v>

5074
02:34:05.170 --> 02:34:05.351
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

5075
02:34:05.351 --> 02:34:06.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge source of revenue.</v>

5076
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:07.691
<v Speaker 1>Give an example,</v>

5077
02:34:07.691 --> 02:34:07.771
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5078
02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

5079
02:34:09.161 --> 02:34:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Like how are they,</v>

5080
02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:11.740
<v Speaker 1>how are they doing?</v>

5081
02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:14.590
<v Speaker 1>How are they doing it smarter ways and what does Amazon doing it where they're</v>

5082
02:34:14.591 --> 02:34:15.270
<v Speaker 1>playing it?</v>

5083
02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.511
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5084
02:34:15.511 --> 02:34:18.000
<v Speaker 2>it have been doing overstock bitcoin.</v>

5085
02:34:18.430 --> 02:34:19.031
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5086
02:34:19.031 --> 02:34:21.320
<v Speaker 3>so Amazon CEO just said that,</v>

5087
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:22.181
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>

5088
02:34:22.181 --> 02:34:22.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5089
02:34:22.690 --> 02:34:25.750
<v Speaker 3>reason why he doesn't do bitcoins because there's not enough need for it.</v>

5090
02:34:25.810 --> 02:34:26.643
<v Speaker 3>And I guess,</v>

5091
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:27.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5092
02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:28.780
<v Speaker 3>incorporating bitcoin into,</v>

5093
02:34:28.781 --> 02:34:30.070
<v Speaker 3>it's probably gonna cost a lot of money.</v>

5094
02:34:30.071 --> 02:34:30.591
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a good,</v>

5095
02:34:30.591 --> 02:34:31.151
<v Speaker 3>this big deal.</v>

5096
02:34:31.151 --> 02:34:31.291
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

5097
02:34:31.291 --> 02:34:33.430
<v Speaker 3>but he's saying there's not enough demand for it.</v>

5098
02:34:33.970 --> 02:34:35.170
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk to,</v>

02:35:59.050 --> 02:35:59.883
<v Speaker 3>Difficult,</v>

5171
02:36:28.631 --> 02:36:29.560
<v Speaker 3>be like the spider video.</v>

5172
02:36:29.770 --> 02:36:31.840
<v Speaker 3>That's what you get in Miami is there's something,</v>

5173
02:36:32.210 --> 02:36:32.651
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5174
02:36:32.651 --> 02:36:35.650
<v Speaker 3>about the culture there where it's like kind of fun the shoot down guys and</v>

5175
02:36:35.651 --> 02:36:35.861
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

5176
02:36:35.861 --> 02:36:38.290
<v Speaker 3>like everybody just treats people like people and I like,</v>

5177
02:36:38.291 --> 02:36:38.620
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5178
02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:39.490
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things.</v>

5179
02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5180
02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:40.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5181
02:36:40.541 --> 02:36:43.870
<v Speaker 3>The fun shooting down guys thing like this is a sport.</v>

5182
02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:45.070
<v Speaker 3>There is a thrill to it.</v>

5183
02:36:45.071 --> 02:36:48.220
<v Speaker 3>They get all dressed up and you're like Horny as fuck and they just shoot you</v>

5184
02:36:48.221 --> 02:36:51.820
<v Speaker 3>down in front of everybody and you don't see that happening as much out here.</v>

5185
02:36:51.821 --> 02:36:53.530
<v Speaker 3>And I think maybe it's just the culture.</v>

5186
02:36:53.531 --> 02:36:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's the weed,</v>

5187
02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:55.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

5188
02:36:55.180 --> 02:36:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a reflection of David seaman getting a little bit of Internet</v>

5189
02:36:59.051 --> 02:36:59.561
<v Speaker 3>celebrity,</v>

02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:14.950
<v Speaker 3>It was intense.</v>

5199
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 3>You want to give a shout out to Joe's</v>

5202
02:37:21.390 --> 02:37:21.831
<v Speaker 1>That's Prince.</v>

5203
02:37:21.831 --> 02:37:22.390
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

5204
02:37:22.390 --> 02:37:22.731
<v Speaker 1>Who is that?</v>

5205
02:37:22.731 --> 02:37:23.750
<v Speaker 1>A Siamese or something.</v>

5206
02:37:24.050 --> 02:37:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a rag doll.</v>

5207
02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Ragdoll rag doll cat is a,</v>

5208
02:37:27.201 --> 02:37:27.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5209
02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:29.240
<v Speaker 1>there were like real sweet,</v>

5210
02:37:29.241 --> 02:37:30.074
<v Speaker 1>like you pick them up,</v>

5211
02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:31.310
<v Speaker 1>they go limp.</v>

5212
02:37:31.370 --> 02:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>They kind of go rag doll on you.</v>

5213
02:37:33.021 --> 02:37:34.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea behind,</v>

5214
02:37:34.041 --> 02:37:34.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5215
02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:34.911
<v Speaker 1>the name.</v>

5216
02:37:34.911 --> 02:37:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's awesome.</v>

5217
02:37:36.810 --> 02:37:37.643
<v Speaker 1>Cool cat.</v>

5218
02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

5219
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5220
02:37:38.510 --> 02:37:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Well I started letting them outside recently.</v>

5221
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I used to worry about them because there's hawks in the neighborhood and owls.</v>

5222
02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Owls are a big one,</v>

5223
02:37:44.930 --> 02:37:45.770
<v Speaker 1>especially at night.</v>

5224
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Owls kill cats all the time and uh,</v>

5225
02:37:48.350 --> 02:37:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you really have to watch it because there's an owl that lives in my neighborhood</v>

5226
02:37:51.231 --> 02:37:52.850
<v Speaker 1>and he's fucking huge.</v>

5227
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really big.</v>

5228
02:37:54.021 --> 02:37:54.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5229
02:37:54.261 --> 02:37:54.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>

5230
02:37:54.921 --> 02:37:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a body of it is like that big.</v>

5231
02:37:57.111 --> 02:37:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Apply your hunting skills and get rid of that threat.</v>

5232
02:37:59.390 --> 02:37:59.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5233
02:37:59.811 --> 02:38:00.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

5234
02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:01.011
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

5235
02:38:01.011 --> 02:38:01.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5236
02:38:01.341 --> 02:38:02.210
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do that.</v>

5237
02:38:02.211 --> 02:38:03.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

5238
02:38:03.470 --> 02:38:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I was a really necessary,</v>

5239
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:07.100
<v Speaker 1>they keep the rat population down.</v>

5240
02:38:07.250 --> 02:38:07.551
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

5241
02:38:07.551 --> 02:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>if you kill an hour,</v>

5242
02:38:08.250 --> 02:38:11.480
<v Speaker 1>the Illuminati will probably come after you because of Moloch the owl.</v>

5243
02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I was in Bohemian Grove,</v>

5244
02:38:13.671 --> 02:38:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I saw Moloch</v>

5245
02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:15.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5246
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:15.850
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

5247
02:38:15.850 --> 02:38:17.130
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about Bohemian Grove,</v>

5248
02:38:17.131 --> 02:38:18.150
<v Speaker 2>not knowing much about it,</v>

5249
02:38:18.151 --> 02:38:19.590
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a billionaire,</v>

5250
02:38:19.591 --> 02:38:22.410
<v Speaker 2>there are very few people that you can relate to who aren't immediately like</v>

5251
02:38:22.650 --> 02:38:23.430
<v Speaker 2>immediately like a,</v>

5252
02:38:23.430 --> 02:38:24.450
<v Speaker 2>here's my job resume.</v>

5253
02:38:24.451 --> 02:38:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Like what can you do for me?</v>

5254
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:27.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a very weird situation to be in,</v>

5255
02:38:27.391 --> 02:38:31.530
<v Speaker 2>so you don't want people scamming you and you want to talk business and you want</v>

5256
02:38:31.531 --> 02:38:32.610
<v Speaker 2>to also relax.</v>

5257
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5258
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Aren't you going to meet somewhere and like talk some shit out and nonpublic</v>

5259
02:38:36.390 --> 02:38:37.223
<v Speaker 2>place?</v>

5260
02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:37.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5261
02:38:37.551 --> 02:38:38.381
<v Speaker 1>With an owl.</v>

5262
02:38:38.381 --> 02:38:39.950
<v Speaker 1>God mask on and fucking,</v>

5263
02:38:40.050 --> 02:38:40.883
<v Speaker 1>and maybe,</v>

5264
02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:42.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe you all just out on a dog.</v>

5265
02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:43.913
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you all,</v>

5266
02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:46.370
<v Speaker 1>how do you have a pet out?</v>

5267
02:38:46.390 --> 02:38:48.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird half an hour as a pet.</v>

5268
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:50.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

5269
02:38:50.211 --> 02:38:50.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5270
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:52.010
<v Speaker 1>The owl that's in my neighborhood,</v>

5271
02:38:52.011 --> 02:38:52.611
<v Speaker 1>no bullshit.</v>

5272
02:38:52.611 --> 02:38:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Twice as big as that goddamn thing.</v>

5273
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.980
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

5274
02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:57.320
<v Speaker 1>It's sat on my back fence the other day.</v>

5275
02:38:57.321 --> 02:38:57.981
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it,</v>

5276
02:38:57.981 --> 02:38:58.341
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5277
02:38:58.341 --> 02:38:59.480
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

5278
02:38:59.510 --> 02:39:00.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a surveillance devices.</v>

5279
02:39:00.711 --> 02:39:02.300
<v Speaker 1>We probably weighs 30 pounds.</v>

5280
02:39:02.301 --> 02:39:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking huge.</v>

5281
02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And I saw one of them with a flow.</v>

5282
02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:08.060
<v Speaker 1>It was flying with a rabbit in its claws.</v>

5283
02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5284
02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I was watching some prehistoric shit.</v>

5285
02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.190
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird flying,</v>

5286
02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:14.450
<v Speaker 1>holding onto a rabbit.</v>

5287
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

5288
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:18.283
<v Speaker 1>give a hoot.</v>

5289
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:19.483
<v Speaker 1>Don't pull it.</v>

5290
02:39:20.410 --> 02:39:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Birds are weird because they're definitely smart.</v>

5291
02:39:23.250 --> 02:39:24.083
<v Speaker 2>There are lizards.</v>

5292
02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:24.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5293
02:39:24.581 --> 02:39:26.800
<v Speaker 2>They lacked the any kind of uh,</v>

5294
02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:28.540
<v Speaker 2>relate-ability like a dog.</v>

5295
02:39:28.570 --> 02:39:29.530
<v Speaker 2>It understands you.</v>

5296
02:39:29.531 --> 02:39:30.370
<v Speaker 2>You understand it.</v>

5297
02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:31.271
<v Speaker 2>A bird.</v>

5298
02:39:31.271 --> 02:39:31.481
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

5299
02:39:31.481 --> 02:39:32.590
<v Speaker 2>what is this thing thinking?</v>

5300
02:39:32.650 --> 02:39:33.011
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5301
02:39:33.011 --> 02:39:33.844
<v Speaker 2>it's smart</v>

5302
02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:34.350
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

5303
02:39:34.350 --> 02:39:35.610
<v Speaker 1>They have intelligence.</v>

5304
02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:38.220
<v Speaker 1>We'll crows have unbelievable intelligence.</v>

5305
02:39:38.221 --> 02:39:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I know you've seen some of those videos were crows problem solve and use tools</v>

5306
02:39:42.690 --> 02:39:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and not just use tools,</v>

5307
02:39:43.831 --> 02:39:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but use multiple step tools,</v>

5308
02:39:45.721 --> 02:39:47.820
<v Speaker 1>like one tool to get to another tool.</v>

5309
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.830
<v Speaker 1>They use that tool to get to a third tool.</v>

5310
02:39:49.831 --> 02:39:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Then you that tool to get to meet.</v>

5311
02:39:51.810 --> 02:39:52.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5312

<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>

5313
02:39:52.981 --> 02:39:53.401
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen,</v>

5314
02:39:53.401 --> 02:39:54.450
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen any of these videos.</v>

5315
02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:55.020
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5316
02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:56.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to watch one.</v>

5317
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It'll fucking blow you away.</v>

5318
02:39:58.440 --> 02:39:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Can we get,</v>

5319
02:39:59.010 --> 02:40:01.440
<v Speaker 1>we can't get pulled from youtube by using a youtube clip,</v>

5320
02:40:01.441 --> 02:40:02.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5321
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:03.060
<v Speaker 1>That we can't get.</v>

5322

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5325
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:11.910
<v Speaker 1>see if you can find just one clip on cro intelligence.</v>

5326
02:40:11.911 --> 02:40:13.020
<v Speaker 1>We've had this on the podcast,</v>

5327
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's so fascinating.</v>

5328
02:40:14.821 --> 02:40:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I watched that shit over and over again and then we'll get the fuck outta here.</v>

5330
02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:23.420
<v Speaker 1>cro intelligence,</v>

5331
02:40:23.421 --> 02:40:25.260
<v Speaker 1>using problem solving tools.</v>

5332
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Just Google all that shit.</v>

5333
02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Crozer apparently as smart if not smarter than chimpanzees.</v>

5334
02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:33.970
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>

5335
02:40:33.971 --> 02:40:36.550
<v Speaker 1>It has such a small brain compared to the chimp brain.</v>

5336
02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:37.533
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5337
02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Remember you went for 12 years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But watch this year put to give it some volume.</v>

5342
02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:51.511
<v Speaker 9>Not very much.</v>

5343
02:40:51.511 --> 02:40:52.344
<v Speaker 9>Fine.</v>

5344
02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5345
02:40:54.430 --> 02:40:55.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

5346
02:40:55.091 --> 02:40:55.750
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

5347
02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:56.583
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5348
02:40:58.030 --> 02:40:59.050
<v Speaker 1>This is not on,</v>

5349
02:40:59.110 --> 02:40:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

5350
02:40:59.770 --> 02:41:00.603
<v Speaker 1>There is volume.</v>

5351
02:41:02.980 --> 02:41:04.000
<v Speaker 1>This cro,</v>

5352
02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:09.210
<v Speaker 1>so it takes this one twig and then makes these socks,</v>

5353
02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:14.280
<v Speaker 1>this second twig to go over to this thing and pull this meat towards it.</v>

5354
02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5355
02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:17.553
<v Speaker 1>And then eats it.</v>

5356
02:41:17.770 --> 02:41:20.140
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely like monkey intelligence.</v>

5357
02:41:20.141 --> 02:41:25.141
<v Speaker 1>So it took one twig to get to a second twig and then took that second twig and</v>

5358
02:41:25.151 --> 02:41:25.440
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

5359
02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean it couldn't reach the first twig without using or the second trig without</v>

5360
02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:31.040
<v Speaker 1>using the first wig is unbelievable.</v>

5361
02:41:31.041 --> 02:41:33.040
<v Speaker 1>There's thinking ahead use of tools.</v>

5362
02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:34.330
<v Speaker 1>That's just two.</v>

5363
02:41:34.450 --> 02:41:36.970
<v Speaker 1>There's one that where it shows three different steps,</v>

5364
02:41:36.971 --> 02:41:39.580
<v Speaker 1>like uses one tool to get to a second tool to get to a second.</v>

5365
02:41:39.581 --> 02:41:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Too bad they're so ugly.</v>

5366
02:41:40.651 --> 02:41:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Or people would have them as pets.</v>

5367
02:41:42.130 --> 02:41:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Why don't think they would tolerate you?</v>

5368
02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

5369
02:41:44.490 --> 02:41:44.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5370
02:41:44.711 --> 02:41:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I think they're wild.</v>

5371
02:41:46.030 --> 02:41:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I think there's certain animals you just not going to figure out.</v>

5372
02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5373
02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:49.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5374
02:41:49.241 --> 02:41:51.610
<v Speaker 1>they tried to tame zebras at one point in time.</v>

5375
02:41:51.611 --> 02:41:55.420
<v Speaker 1>All these assholes that moved to the Congo and built the states and tried to</v>

5376
02:41:55.421 --> 02:41:59.290
<v Speaker 1>fucking enslave people and run things in Africa and then I'll never worked.</v>

5377
02:41:59.530 --> 02:42:02.230
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they tried to do is they try to domesticate zebras.</v>

5378
02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:04.000
<v Speaker 1>He can't do it.</v>

5379
02:42:04.270 --> 02:42:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you domesticate a zebra?</v>

5380
02:42:05.621 --> 02:42:06.790
<v Speaker 1>They will tolerate.</v>

5381
02:42:06.791 --> 02:42:08.040
<v Speaker 1>So here's a five step.</v>

5382
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.341
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

5383
02:42:08.341 --> 02:42:08.801
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

5384
02:42:08.801 --> 02:42:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Watch it takes,</v>

5385
02:42:10.030 --> 02:42:10.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5386
02:42:10.181 --> 02:42:10.901
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible.</v>

5387
02:42:10.901 --> 02:42:13.990
<v Speaker 1>It takes one tool and then it goes over and can't get,</v>

5388
02:42:13.991 --> 02:42:16.240
<v Speaker 1>this tool is trying real hard to get this tool.</v>

5389
02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:16.730
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5390
02:42:16.730 --> 02:42:17.380
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

5391
02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:18.700
<v Speaker 1>let me see what the fuck we do here.</v>

5392
02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:21.970
<v Speaker 1>He gets a second tool.</v>

5393
02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5394
02:42:22.570 --> 02:42:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Uses that tool to go.</v>

5395
02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:26.500
<v Speaker 1>It tries to get the beat,</v>

5396
02:42:26.501 --> 02:42:27.190
<v Speaker 1>can't do it.</v>

5397
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Tried to get the third tool so it uses this one to get to this one.</v>

5398
02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Now he's got another tool then takes that fucking tool,</v>

5399
02:42:34.750 --> 02:42:35.890
<v Speaker 1>spins it around.</v>

5400
02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:39.760
<v Speaker 1>So the other part like the part that has like the little hook on the end of it,</v>

5401
02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:44.680
<v Speaker 1>he's like trying to get the meat,</v>

5402
02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:45.490
<v Speaker 1>can't get it.</v>

5403
02:42:45.490 --> 02:42:46.323
<v Speaker 1>Alrighty.</v>

5404
02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And there he goes.</v>

5405
02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:49.270
<v Speaker 1>That is true intelligence.</v>

5406
02:42:49.271 --> 02:42:51.640
<v Speaker 1>That's smarter than like 90% of the people I've dealt with.</v>

5407
02:42:51.641 --> 02:42:52.390
<v Speaker 1>The DMV.</v>

5408
02:42:52.390 --> 02:42:52.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5409
02:42:52.811 --> 02:42:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It's all of the people at the DMV.</v>

5410
02:42:54.281 --> 02:42:54.731
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

5411
02:42:54.731 --> 02:42:55.564
<v Speaker 1>I said it,</v>

5412
02:42:55.780 --> 02:42:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I can to see if your registration gets renewed on time.</v>

5413
02:42:58.720 --> 02:42:58.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5414
02:42:58.961 --> 02:43:00.430
<v Speaker 1>You put those people in that room,</v>

5415
02:43:00.431 --> 02:43:01.031
<v Speaker 1>would that crow,</v>

5416
02:43:01.031 --> 02:43:02.200
<v Speaker 1>the crow would figure that shit out.</v>

5417
02:43:02.201 --> 02:43:03.034
<v Speaker 1>Queer.</v>

5418
02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:05.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5419
02:43:05.081 --> 02:43:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how intelligence works and obviously they don't have a language,</v>

5420
02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:13.330
<v Speaker 1>so maybe they're not as hampered by a lot of and insecurities and a lot of weird</v>

5421
02:43:13.331 --> 02:43:17.470
<v Speaker 1>shit that the human brain harbors like maybe a lot of what runs us is just</v>

5422
02:43:17.471 --> 02:43:18.670
<v Speaker 1>nonsense and Hawaii.</v>

5423
02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:23.370
<v Speaker 2>How much time has everybody spent thinking about things that have never had like</v>

5424
02:43:23.371 --> 02:43:27.150
<v Speaker 2>not come to pass like fears that are just a waste of energy?</v>

5425
02:43:27.990 --> 02:43:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Probably a fuck load,</v>

5426
02:43:29.251 --> 02:43:29.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5427
02:43:29.431 --> 02:43:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5428
02:43:30.210 --> 02:43:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5429
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking about my own life and like it's always the thing that you're</v>

5430
02:43:33.151 --> 02:43:36.310
<v Speaker 2>not thinking about that ends up getting you like an asteroid.</v>

5431
02:43:36.370 --> 02:43:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5432
02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

5433
02:43:36.750 --> 02:43:37.300
<v Speaker 2>asteroids like,</v>

5434
02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:37.411
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5435
02:43:37.411 --> 02:43:38.610
<v Speaker 2>we didn't prepare for that one at all.</v>

5436
02:43:38.611 --> 02:43:39.301
<v Speaker 2>Or if Fukushima,</v>

5437
02:43:39.301 --> 02:43:40.350
<v Speaker 2>nobody was preparing for that.</v>

5438
02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:43.440
<v Speaker 1>David Moore do.</v>

5439
02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Can't end on doom and gloom.</v>

5440
02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:46.473
<v Speaker 1>Pretty smart.</v>

5441
02:43:47.140 --> 02:43:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Just Sheryl Crow is probably not as smart as a CHRO as far as like problem</v>

5442
02:43:52.481 --> 02:43:53.080
<v Speaker 1>solving.</v>

5443
02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:56.230
<v Speaker 1>If you got Sheryl Crow and the crow and neither one of them had any idea what</v>

5444
02:43:56.231 --> 02:43:58.750
<v Speaker 1>was going on that you made them do those two things,</v>

5445
02:44:00.770 --> 02:44:02.360
<v Speaker 2>we can end on a positive note.</v>

5446
02:44:02.361 --> 02:44:02.751
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

5447
02:44:02.751 --> 02:44:03.584
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5448
02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:05.780
<v Speaker 2>despite the minor negative stuff,</v>

5449
02:44:05.781 --> 02:44:06.890
<v Speaker 2>this has been really positive.</v>

5450
02:44:06.891 --> 02:44:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole financial system is going to change it the next five years and</v>

5451
02:44:10.101 --> 02:44:13.790
<v Speaker 2>it's going to swing in a direction where individuals have more power and banks</v>

5452
02:44:13.791 --> 02:44:14.331
<v Speaker 2>have less.</v>

5453
02:44:14.331 --> 02:44:14.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5454
02:44:14.541 --> 02:44:15.360
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

5455
02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:16.400
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool actually.</v>

5456
02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:20.810
<v Speaker 2>And I talked to Stefan Molyneux early this week and I asked him,</v>

5457
02:44:20.811 --> 02:44:21.021
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5458
02:44:21.021 --> 02:44:23.870
<v Speaker 2>am I diluted by telling people like this is going to change everything?</v>

5459
02:44:24.010 --> 02:44:24.321
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

5460
02:44:24.321 --> 02:44:24.501
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5461
02:44:24.501 --> 02:44:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's going to change a lot of stuff.</v>

5462
02:44:26.421 --> 02:44:30.350
<v Speaker 2>And he was telling me about how it's going to change politics in a big way</v>

5463
02:44:30.351 --> 02:44:31.184
<v Speaker 2>because you just,</v>

5464
02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:33.560
<v Speaker 2>you can't get bribes with bitcoin basically.</v>

5465
02:44:33.561 --> 02:44:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Like banks can't bribe you.</v>

5466
02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:36.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't bribe them back by,</v>

5467
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:37.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5468
02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:38.323
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5469
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:40.610
<v Speaker 2>propping them up the next time they need a bail out.</v>

5470
02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:45.050
<v Speaker 2>This whole thinking of like a bank just spends money and pretty much makes risky</v>

5471
02:44:45.051 --> 02:44:46.700
<v Speaker 2>bets and derivatives and stuff.</v>

5472
02:44:46.701 --> 02:44:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And then when those bets,</v>

5473
02:44:47.970 --> 02:44:48.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5474
02:44:48.410 --> 02:44:49.250
<v Speaker 2>go south,</v>

5475
02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:52.880
<v Speaker 2>they get a bail out from the government and get taxpayer money,</v>

5476
02:44:53.060 --> 02:44:54.580
<v Speaker 2>that craziness will go away.</v>

5477
02:44:54.581 --> 02:44:54.980
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be,</v>

5478
02:44:54.980 --> 02:44:55.131
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5479
02:44:55.131 --> 02:44:56.210
<v Speaker 2>how many bitcoins do you have?</v>

5480
02:44:56.240 --> 02:44:56.331
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5481
02:44:56.331 --> 02:44:56.541
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5482
02:44:56.541 --> 02:44:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

5483
02:44:56.930 --> 02:44:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

5484
02:44:57.350 --> 02:44:57.981
<v Speaker 2>So it's good.</v>

5485
02:44:57.981 --> 02:44:58.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5486
02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:01.450
<v Speaker 2>it actually goes back to ancient times where a,</v>

5487
02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:03.320
<v Speaker 2>in places like Mesopotamia,</v>

5488
02:45:04.010 --> 02:45:05.420
<v Speaker 2>when merchants would do business,</v>

5489
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:07.580
<v Speaker 2>they didn't need to chase or bank of America,</v>

5490
02:45:07.581 --> 02:45:08.840
<v Speaker 2>they just had like merchant ledgers,</v>

5491
02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:09.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5492
02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:09.171
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5493
02:45:09.171 --> 02:45:09.471
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

5494
02:45:09.471 --> 02:45:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I owe you 15 cattle.</v>

5495
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.863
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

5496
02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:14.030
<v Speaker 2>And you decide on a standard and you go with that.</v>

5497
02:45:14.270 --> 02:45:15.680
<v Speaker 2>And the whole world might do that now.</v>

5498
02:45:15.681 --> 02:45:16.700
<v Speaker 2>And it's happening already.</v>

5499
02:45:16.701 --> 02:45:17.780
<v Speaker 2>When I say it might happen,</v>

5500
02:45:18.170 --> 02:45:20.360
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why is at $500 each,</v>

5501
02:45:20.361 --> 02:45:23.480
<v Speaker 2>and that's because in China where they have a radically different government</v>

5502
02:45:23.481 --> 02:45:23.901
<v Speaker 2>from hours,</v>

5503
02:45:23.901 --> 02:45:24.890
<v Speaker 2>far more oppressive,</v>

5504
02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:26.450
<v Speaker 2>they don't speak the same language,</v>

5505
02:45:26.451 --> 02:45:27.560
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the same culture,</v>

5506
02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:30.140
<v Speaker 2>they're interested in the same currency and that's really cool.</v>

5507
02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And bitcoin,</v>

5508
02:45:31.771 --> 02:45:34.380
<v Speaker 1>is it more popular in any parts of the world besides America?</v>

5509
02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:35.590
<v Speaker 2>It's more popular in China,</v>

5510
02:45:35.591 --> 02:45:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

5511
02:45:36.010 --> 02:45:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I believe most of the,</v>

5512
02:45:37.390 --> 02:45:38.021
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong,</v>

5513
02:45:38.021 --> 02:45:40.060
<v Speaker 2>but I think most of the trading volume right now is in China.</v>

5514
02:45:40.390 --> 02:45:43.090
<v Speaker 2>But definitely most of the startups are in Silicon Valley.</v>

5515
02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Wonder what steps will ask,</v>

5516
02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:46.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5517
02:45:47.690 --> 02:45:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Antonopoulos next week,</v>

5518
02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:53.930
<v Speaker 1>what steps they've taken to ensure that the same jackals that have gotten a hold</v>

5519
02:45:53.931 --> 02:45:57.470
<v Speaker 1>of the financial system and twisted it into this weird cryptic world of</v>

5520
02:45:57.471 --> 02:45:59.990
<v Speaker 1>derivatives on the unexplainable things.</v>

5521
02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:05.440
<v Speaker 1>If they've done anything to prevent that from happening to things like Bitcoin,</v>

5522
02:46:05.980 --> 02:46:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if there's a way to corrupted or make it less fun,</v>

5523
02:46:09.741 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 2>they will</v>

5524
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:13.490
<v Speaker 3>do that or they will try for their own profit.</v>

5525
02:46:13.491 --> 02:46:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5526
02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:14.721
<v Speaker 3>All right man.</v>

5527
02:46:14.721 --> 02:46:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

5528
02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:16.400
<v Speaker 3>always fun talking to you.</v>

5529
02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

5530
02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:18.200
<v Speaker 3>We've got to do this more often,</v>

5531
02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:19.400
<v Speaker 3>which was always cool.</v>

5532
02:46:19.401 --> 02:46:20.234
<v Speaker 3>Shit to talk about.</v>

5533
02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:21.433
<v Speaker 3>Never run out.</v>

5534
02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:22.513
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

5535
02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:22.881
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

5536
02:46:22.881 --> 02:46:24.980
<v Speaker 3>we're at a strange time in life.</v>

5537
02:46:24.981 --> 02:46:25.270
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

5538
02:46:25.270 --> 02:46:25.910
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

5539
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:28.710
<v Speaker 3>we're right there at the peak of the weirdest way.</v>

5540
02:46:28.780 --> 02:46:32.330
<v Speaker 3>The world is RC negative because the technology thing like yeah,</v>

5541
02:46:32.331 --> 02:46:35.990
<v Speaker 3>it's bad at the NSA is collecting our stuff and I think that that system is</v>

5542
02:46:35.991 --> 02:46:37.280
<v Speaker 3>going to eat itself over time.</v>

5543
02:46:37.281 --> 02:46:42.281
<v Speaker 3>Like we have the FBI spying on the CIA and the NSA or rather the CIA.</v>

5544
02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:43.610
<v Speaker 3>So I fucked that up.</v>

5545
02:46:43.790 --> 02:46:47.270
<v Speaker 3>We have the FBI spying on the CIA and the CIA is spying on the Senate</v>

5546
02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:50.090
<v Speaker 3>intelligence committee that's supposed to be overseeing the CIA.</v>

5547
02:46:50.091 --> 02:46:52.520
<v Speaker 3>So all these people are spying on each other.</v>

5548
02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:53.181
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5549
02:46:53.181 --> 02:46:54.560
<v Speaker 3>stepping on each other's toes.</v>

5550
02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:57.500
<v Speaker 3>And I think eventually is going to happen is it's not people like you and me who</v>

5551
02:46:57.501 --> 02:46:58.370
<v Speaker 3>will demand reform.</v>

5552
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:59.990
<v Speaker 3>It's people in the Senate who were like,</v>

5553
02:47:00.020 --> 02:47:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't want my shit spied on anymore.</v>

5554
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:02.023
<v Speaker 3>This is not good.</v>

5555
02:47:02.090 --> 02:47:05.510
<v Speaker 3>And they're all going to agree like we need some kind of rollback that'll</v>

5556
02:47:05.511 --> 02:47:05.991
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

5557
02:47:05.991 --> 02:47:06.470
<v Speaker 3>And then we have,</v>

5558
02:47:06.470 --> 02:47:07.970
<v Speaker 3>we still have all this amazing technology.</v>

5559
02:47:07.971 --> 02:47:10.250
<v Speaker 3>It's moving faster than we can even think about.</v>

5560
02:47:10.700 --> 02:47:11.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

5561
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:12.440
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly good here,</v>

5562
