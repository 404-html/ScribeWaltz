00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tone,</v>

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.583
<v Speaker 1>tone down,</v>

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a toast to hugh hefner.</v>

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.613
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lost one of the Great Dick slingers </v>

5
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly did we lost him.</v>

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>He literally had a place where guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>could go to be latches.</v>

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could just go and you had a </v>

8
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:28.754
<v Speaker 1>mansion where everybody knew there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a bunch of hoes and that's </v>

9
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>why they went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.753
<v Speaker 1>They went there on purpose and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that were notorious for hanging </v>

11
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>around the mansion for going to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mansion parties.</v>

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went twice.</v>

13
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I went once for a marijuana policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>project thing.</v>

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the company that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it together.</v>

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.833
<v Speaker 1>A or a hosted something and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bands and stuff like that was kind of </v>

16
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fun.</v>

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And then the other time I went was for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear factor.</v>

18
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>We did something for fear factor with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the playboy playmates.</v>

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to meet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll.</v>

20
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I never met him in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

21
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

22
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.083
<v Speaker 1>I think by that time he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an old and I think he just wanted </v>

23
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>to chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>he was just kinda done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never went there.</v>

25
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get into girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to get me in and I guess they.</v>

26
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>They googled me and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I have enough credits.</v>

27
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

28
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.373
<v Speaker 1>sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it was I couldn't get in and she's </v>

29
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to look you up.</v>

30
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And she was nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they said no.</v>

31
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably two years ago.</v>

32
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

33
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.103
<v Speaker 1>I didn't qualify to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't qualify to go with his </v>

34
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:30.044
<v Speaker 1>fucking girls and fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have enough credits I guess </v>

35
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>sell or maybe they didn't have the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>credits or maybe they just didn't care,</v>

36
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>

37
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

38
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even that mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

39
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

40
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>How credits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gross.</v>

42
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said something like that,</v>

43
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:46.364
<v Speaker 1>but she was trying to be really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she was trying to let me down easy </v>

44
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>because she felt bad because we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends since you wanted to go,</v>

45
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>like you just don't qualify to come here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at these tits.</v>

46
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.763
<v Speaker 1>Just really hurtful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird place because it was </v>

47
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 1>super outdated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you heard about the grotto,</v>

48
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.933
<v Speaker 1>the grotto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to the grotto and has a phone </v>

49
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>from like the 19 seventies there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

50
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:05.834
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They left it like for probably for the </v>

51
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old school vibe I guess,</v>

52
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>or they just never updated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weirdly,</v>

53
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sold the place or it was for sale,</v>

54
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.243
<v Speaker 1>but one of the caveats of purchase was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had to live in the building </v>

55
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>until he died.</v>

56
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>But it was like some preposterous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money,</v>

58
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>like $200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars or something crazy.</v>

59
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the land is really valuable.</v>

60
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do at that now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they knock it down?</v>

61
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there no nostalgia to it?</v>

62
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Is it kind of died on the vine anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you fucking shit?</v>

63
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Well he has a son and his son probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherited it.</v>

64
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 1>His son I think was running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

65
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>They tried for awhile to have no nudity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

66
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fucking mechanic fucking thing</v>

67
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>with no cars in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to just read that shit?</v>

68
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.103
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a New York Times </v>

69
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>article with all ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you.</v>

70
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Where's the fucking intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation here?</v>

71
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really bad note.</v>

72
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Annuity is a terrible decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were always in this weird area,</v>

74
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Because Hugh hefner was like the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable pornographer like Larry Flynt</v>

76
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.753
<v Speaker 1>who did a lot for free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did a lot for exposing corrupt </v>

77
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would show vaginas and assholes</v>

78
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>and because of that he was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought as a gross guy.</v>

79
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well even their social commentary was.</v>

80
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one it ma.</v>

81
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Who is the feminist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gloria?</v>

82
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Gloria allred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

83
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I know and I think it was a gloria </v>
<v Speaker 1>steinem parody,</v>

84
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>her licking the girl's pussy that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>period blood.</v>

86
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.493
<v Speaker 1>It was like some fucking viral thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would do the most viable political </v>

87
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:48.244
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really showed his disdain of those </v>

88
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was great.</v>

89
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He's a crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still alive.</v>

90
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>That fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets shot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Seventy seven maybe.</v>

94
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Was it that lady?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was [inaudible] 76.</v>

95
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>He's still got a bunch of casinos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

97
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.210
<v Speaker 1>He still out there kicking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like who the hell is buying hustler?</v>

98
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I a lot.</v>

99
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you mentioned that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my manager got one today.</v>

100
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I haven't bought one in many years </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a.</v>

101
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:15.964
<v Speaker 1>I did an interview for them and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a really good interview and </v>

102
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>they quoted me accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm in December's Hustler,</v>

103
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>which is after today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

104
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.313
<v Speaker 1>So it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a hostel for the first time </v>

105
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>probably in 15 years today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What magazines do that or December comes</v>

106
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>out installed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

107
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we pretend it's like new cars.</v>

108
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have the fuck.</v>

109
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Is that even possible since 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys.</v>

110
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.863
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be something about the </v>

111
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:39.770
<v Speaker 1>anticipation of getting it.</v>

112
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.603
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like when a halloween movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't come out October 30th because </v>

113
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.743
<v Speaker 1>you're sick of Halloween by then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it comes out like you say September </v>

114
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>15th and then by the time Halloween </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes the movie's finished.</v>

115
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

116
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Halloween.</v>

117
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that makes sense because they're not</v>

118
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>pretending it's halloween.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a halloween movie.</v>

119
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.044
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're pretending that's a </v>

120
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>December issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not decided.</v>

121
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:00.394
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come out like way in advance </v>

123
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>usually a month of before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but December.</v>

124
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.203
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of the new car thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always weird because it's way </v>

125
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six months.</v>

126
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six,</v>

127
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.533
<v Speaker 1>six months before the year turns over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're already saying that it's a 2018 </v>

128
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it's 2017.</v>

129
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>April when you're talking about is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2018 model.</v>

130
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like tricks,</v>

131
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.044
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you buy something and it </v>

132
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>costs $9,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 make it $10.</v>

133
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

134
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 1>What does this penny stuff they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say under $10?</v>

135
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

136
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

137
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>It just looks better with the 99 then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ta.</v>

138
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does for dumb people.</v>

139
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

140
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're appealing to people's mind.</v>

141
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.823
<v Speaker 1>Like the little part of their mind is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to save a little better and </v>

142
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>better sound better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

143
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean comedians have addressed the gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for years.</v>

144
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>There was a book about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called predictably irrational.</v>

145
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>The hidden forces that shape our </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

146
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>That came out about</v>

147
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

148
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.663
<v Speaker 2>So it's playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing on the irrational thoughts that </v>

149
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.054
<v Speaker 2>we have about like specific anecdotes </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like say like a best buy ad and </v>

150
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.064
<v Speaker 2>why there's three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My washing machines and they're really </v>

151
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>trying to get you to buy the middle one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have two other priced ones goes</v>

152
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>into things just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All over different aspects of life.</v>

153
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.273
<v Speaker 2>You all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite ones are when you're in </v>

154
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Vegas and you see voted Best Buffet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best 10:00</v>

155
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 2>PM show like Pi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who who voted for the best buffet?</v>

156
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 2>They did vote on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

157
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have to leave the house?</v>

158
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:33.674
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to fucking buffet voters </v>

159
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 2>in 20 minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to miss the buffet vote.</v>

160
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.433
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is good buffets in bad </v>

161
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 2>buffet's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

162
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 2>where's a good buffet and big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever go to the buffets?</v>

163
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love a good buffet if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

164
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 2>The trophy is great rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

165
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 2>The Wynn hotel in Vegas has a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffet.</v>

166
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wind hotels,</v>

167
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 2>tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>

168
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 2>I've walked through it but I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed there.</v>

169
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a phenomenal hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very high end place.</v>

170
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>So it makes sense that their buffet </v>
<v Speaker 2>would kick ass in here in la.</v>

171
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 2>They have a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

172
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:03.464
<v Speaker 2>at the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the four seasons on Sundays as I </v>

173
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 2>might've said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delight to buffet.</v>

174
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

175
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I've done the four seasons in Maui and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a breakfast buffet.</v>

176
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a great way to get fat.</v>

177
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

178
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tremendous.</v>

179
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 2>They make you waffles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the waffle thing right there.</v>

180
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.173
<v Speaker 2>Something about someone making you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall when they pour the waffle stuff </v>

181
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 2>into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little press and put it down.</v>

182
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:26.271
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

183
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

184
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.323
<v Speaker 2>Have a waffle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking right now about </v>

185
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:29.954
<v Speaker 2>melting the butter on it and before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what I did last time I put peanut </v>

186
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 2>butter all over that motherfucker and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I put butter and then I put syrup.</v>

187
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt great for about 15 minutes and </v>

188
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 2>then afterwards I just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you feel fucking terrible.</v>

189
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much as you work out.</v>

190
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:49.274
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm surprised like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you burn through everything you </v>

191
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:51.651
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

192
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 2>but you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

193
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an insulin pump.</v>

194
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.633
<v Speaker 2>Your body just hits all that sugar into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your system and you bought us like what </v>

195
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.233
<v Speaker 2>the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually probably worse for me </v>

196
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 2>because I don't do it very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if your body gets used to sugar,</v>

197
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:07.814
<v Speaker 2>if you're drinking sugary sodas all day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're eating white bread all day </v>

198
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 2>and if your body gets used to processing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff,</v>

199
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 2>it has a better handle on what to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

200
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only gets it every few days.</v>

201
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.260
<v Speaker 2>So when it gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

202
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially like if I overload,</v>

203
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:24.284
<v Speaker 2>like get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a banana split or something like </v>

204
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Ah.</v>

205
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 2>You feel it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

206
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I worked hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bad in la though with food.</v>

207
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I fucking go out for Sushi and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

208
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:33.824
<v Speaker 2>that yogurt stop on Santa Monica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my favorite place in the world was </v>

209
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>then cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

210
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.030
<v Speaker 2>it's called the yogurts dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

211
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:39.864
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on Santa Monica and I been there </v>

212
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 2>for days where I've been in La for four </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

213
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.084
<v Speaker 2>I've been there four times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop shoveling that shit and </v>

214
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>it's my favorite fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so good?</v>

215
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

216
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I've had yogurt that was just as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

217
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:53.294
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd always felt right to go out for the </v>

218
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>best Sushi and then go</v>

219
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 3>down there and have some yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

222
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.110

<v Speaker 3>literally like a fucking fat girl.</v>

223
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 3>I got my ex girlfriend who's my best </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend and we went and got yogurt.</v>

224

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sad.</v>

225
00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 3>And we went and got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I treated myself to a little yogurt.</v>

226
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 3>I just go up and down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I Love Matt.</v>

240
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 3>We talked about the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love him too,</v>

241
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

242
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:43.944
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that and I know that it's a fun </v>

243
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Gig and I love doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of those things.</v>

244
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not about like feeling like I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>

245
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been blessed like show </v>
<v Speaker 3>business given me opportunities.</v>

246
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I've failed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not some unlucky guy who,</v>

247
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.860
<v Speaker 3>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't give me a shot.</v>

248
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 3>They give me a million shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about being annoyed at yourself for</v>

249
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not about like,</v>

250
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 3>I get a good apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make money.</v>

251
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.110
<v Speaker 3>I am very lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the rational,</v>

252
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 3>like when you're feeling down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like a rational thing.</v>

253
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

254
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 3>You can't turn it around with your mind.</v>

255
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too emotional.</v>

256
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 3>I react to emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the next day,</v>

257
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:16.704
<v Speaker 3>like I had a great week since then get </v>
<v Speaker 3>out because she and I talked and I </v>

258
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 3>realized I'm just being kind of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy girlfriends.</v>

259
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.081
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

260
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 3>But I'm also not cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how to not cheat so I'm</v>

261
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 3>not acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy man.</v>

262
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.953
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe part of your weirdnesses like </v>

263
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.083
<v Speaker 3>dealing with the fact that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing your normal behavior </v>

264
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 3>patterns?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

265
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:34.494
<v Speaker 3>it's giving up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's given you have a huge </v>

266
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.430
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I still,</v>

267
00:10:36.431 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 3>I still look at porn and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not acting out.</v>

268
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Not Having fucking girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The La is a deadly city for me.</v>

269
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Why do I come out here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got him fucking not deadly pussy.</v>

270
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes when I'm out here,</v>

271
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very fresh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very Naughty.</v>

272
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.413
<v Speaker 3>I behave better now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole ecosystem around that </v>

273
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There really is a lot of gals that are a</v>

274
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 3>little loose with the sex and they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to profit off of that.</v>

275
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.893
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't just have sex with some </v>

276
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.234
<v Speaker 3>men and not have to work a job and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them are literally just people I've </v>

277
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:12.624
<v Speaker 3>known for a lot like there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people you meet through the </v>

278
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 3>business and they're just as dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

279
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 3>And I mean for me because they'll do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

280
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.231
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>

281
00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>they liked the fact that I'm open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're like,</v>

282
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys think I'm crazy.</v>

283
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard just not to be unfaithful.</v>

284
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to not be fucking [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>fans are.</v>

285
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking about this for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would up and down.</v>

286
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:34.180
<v Speaker 3>I've had sad that I'm great and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

287
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a girlfriend in six years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm talking about it.</v>

288
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:38.320
<v Speaker 3>And then one fans like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we getting it?</v>

289
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 3>You're going to girl friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're 49,</v>

290
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 3>you're being normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

291
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking rotten toad.</v>

292
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Can I talk about my life being healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>for one week before fans get sick of it?</v>

293
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.133
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always going to get one person </v>

294
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:51.660
<v Speaker 3>who complains about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

295
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.250
<v Speaker 3>I can't really bother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

296
00:11:53.251 --> 00:11:54.084
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

297
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get that.</v>

298
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got a point two.</v>

299
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 2>It's probably annoying to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why he said it,</v>

300
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>but she or she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

301
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut her mouth.</v>

302
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Bitch.</v>

303
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I gave her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave her a sarcastic apology.</v>

304
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:10.211
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

305
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean to share something good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only keep it negative.</v>

306
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 2>And she actually went back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

307
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Like she believed the apology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

308
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

309
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.323
<v Speaker 2>there's a fake feud going on between me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ari and Bert Kreischer and Thompson </v>

310
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.723
<v Speaker 2>and people for whatever reason think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real and so they're getting mad </v>

311
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 2>that I'm airing out our dirty laundry in</v>
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>

312
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't be more obvious about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake it is.</v>

313
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I even wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good day sir,</v>

314
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 2>at the end of my letter with all caps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just.</v>

315
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 2>This is like a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pray for Joe.</v>

316
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 2>This is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer,</v>

317
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 2>our friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good friend.</v>

318
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Bert is a fucking raging alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He certainly,</v>

319
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 2>he drinks six doubles a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

320
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 2>he's drinking 12 drinks a night and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

321
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 2>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

322
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.534
<v Speaker 2>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

323
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is crazy.</v>

324
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

325
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.100
<v Speaker 2>So we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think you'd get sober?</v>

326
00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 2>He said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

327
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 2>So then someone said sober and run a </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon.</v>

328
00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop you guys.</v>

329
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 2>He's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

330
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burt likes to pretend he runs,</v>

331
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 2>but he really only runs on a treadmill </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

332
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:06.724
<v Speaker 2>that is not running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're lifting your legs up and the </v>

333
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 2>things coming towards you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same.</v>

334
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 2>So now we started running on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>railroad and he's like barely getting in</v>

335
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 2>a couple miles and he takes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks.</v>

336
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.683
<v Speaker 2>He's not running any fucking marathons </v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime soon and I'm certainly not </v>

337
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 2>saying that he could do one after a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

338
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we said,</v>

339
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:23.164
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about no drinking for the entire </v>

340
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 2>month of October and you got to do 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot yoga classes in a month,</v>

341
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking hardcore hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>

342
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I love hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really does.</v>

343
00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Where it really wipes you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wipes you out.</v>

344
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're not used to it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't drink enough water,</v>

345
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:41.014
<v Speaker 2>you've got to really be behind the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody agreed to that and then a </v>

346
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 2>couple of fucking days ago they started </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

347
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.410
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be totally sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No weed,</v>

348
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 2>no alcohol.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Today I went running to a podcast.</v>

440
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I like to smoke a little weed before </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

441
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 2>but nothing today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

443
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.120

<v Speaker 2>I think it would affect me differently.</v>

444
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever used you as a good example</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a guy like you?</v>

445
00:17:37.051 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>You function well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you smoke pot and you do Jujitsu.</v>

446
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.963
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't do that well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that do Jujitsu smoke </v>

447
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:43.790
<v Speaker 2>pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

448
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.623
<v Speaker 2>It's huge and the Jiu Jitsu community </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think like a lot of people </v>

449
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:47.744
<v Speaker 2>have a misconception of Jujitsu where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think of it as being a bunch of </v>

450
00:17:49.781 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

451
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.873
<v Speaker 1>really aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean guys that are like attacking each </v>

452
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.074
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more much more bunch of really </v>

453
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:58.794
<v Speaker 1>smart analytical stoner sensitive nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>type characters who are also like very </v>

454
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:04.644
<v Speaker 1>strong because they do Jujitsu all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time or if they lift weights and get in </v>

455
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 1>really good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those guys,</v>

456
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:09.924
<v Speaker 1>it's because of Jujitsu and then of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course there's people that come to it </v>

457
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 1>from like football or wrestling or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

458
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 1>They have a different attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times they fall into like a</v>

459
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu mindset which is a very relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly mindset.</v>

460
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:21.924
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu people are super friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very affectionate to like all the guys </v>

461
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:27.890
<v Speaker 1>that met very huggy and friendly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's A.</v>

462
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I have noticed a lot of combat athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like that,</v>

463
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.943
<v Speaker 1>but there's a gentleness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we see Bernard Hopkins I've talked </v>

464
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 1>to a lot and when you.</v>

465
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 1>He sits right next to you and literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a speed invade your space,</v>

466
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't feel menacing or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or weird.</v>

467
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>It feels like almost like he's just an </v>
<v Speaker 1>affectionate,</v>

468
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.583
<v Speaker 1>gentle guy until it's an odd feeling how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get energy from people and it just </v>

469
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>doesn't feel uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

470
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>you know where the garlic Bernard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so confident in himself.</v>

471
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't exude any insecurities or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiteness.</v>

472
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an all time great period.</v>

473
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.243
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a single human being that </v>

474
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:00.630
<v Speaker 1>knows boxing that would argue that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Hopkins is at an all time.</v>

475
00:19:00.631 --> 00:19:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he fought Tito Trinidad.</v>

476
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.023
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought Felix Trinidad and I believe </v>

477
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:07.164
<v Speaker 1>he was 36 at the time and Trinidad was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his prime and everybody really </v>

478
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>thought the Trinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to run them over and he beat</v>

479
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:13.884
<v Speaker 1>the fucking shit out of Trinidad and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a weird controversial fight because </v>

480
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.443
<v Speaker 1>he was in Puerto Rico and he took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rican flag and threw it on the </v>

481
00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 1>ground and everybody went crazy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to kill him.</v>

482
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to get inside Trinidad's head </v>

483
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>and get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them to try to brawl with him.</v>

484
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 1>And he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard picked him apart.</v>

485
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he picked him apart and fucked him up </v>

486
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.390
<v Speaker 1>and then years later when people wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>them off again,</v>

487
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:34.224
<v Speaker 1>he fought Kelly pavlick and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Kelly pavlock and knocked out </v>

488
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine Stewart and he was thought to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like the guy,</v>

489
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was like,</v>

490
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.294
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Pavlics gonna fuck up or an art </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopkins and Bernard Hopkins beat the </v>

491
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.653
<v Speaker 1>shit out of him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did finally knocked him his last </v>

492
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:51.330
<v Speaker 1>fight that will smith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was 51.</v>

493
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

494
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was either 50 or 51.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be 50.</v>

495
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had 40,</v>

496
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.073
<v Speaker 1>49 fights or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he wanted to fight when he was </v>

497
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:01.104
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to Fight Mayweather for his </v>

498
00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:04.254
<v Speaker 1>50th fight.</v>

499
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.093
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember him talking about that right </v>

500
00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:08.260
<v Speaker 1>before he turned 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking to her.</v>

501
00:20:08.261 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Would never fight him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so much bigger.</v>

502
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:10.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was talking about cutting </v>

503
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:13.950
<v Speaker 1>weight or maybe it was just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he talked about fighting floyd floyd</v>

504
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 1>coming up at him going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was Florida,</v>

505
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:17.904
<v Speaker 1>I'd say fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flight Pi did because he never </v>

506
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:20.574
<v Speaker 1>fought him about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that he was talking about </v>

507
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:23.040
<v Speaker 1>that when he was 49.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

508
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:25.280
<v Speaker 1>because floyd is a tiny man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

509
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean floyd is a natural 147 pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

510
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Like when he weighed in for the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>with conor,</v>

511
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 1>you weighed 1:49</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bernard was fighting one 75.</v>

512
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just so much larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he was talking about coming down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember the conversation,</v>

514
00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but obviously they would have had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a catch.</v>

515
00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he fought this guy,</v>

516
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:44.814
<v Speaker 1>Joe Smith Jr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a young guy who's a murderous and </v>

517
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 1>he just got fucked up and not through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ropes and he fell on his head.</v>

518
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

519
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 1>But he had such a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge bound to get,</v>

520
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to go down sooner or later.</v>

521
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.513
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

522
00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.480
<v Speaker 1>just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nice dude and uh,</v>

523
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.363
<v Speaker 1>I love guys like that who don't try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give off just that shitty energy and I </v>

524
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 1>don't think I've ever gotten that energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of fighters.</v>

525
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.893
<v Speaker 1>Well you won't get it off the successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones because to get successful you want </v>

526
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:15.691
<v Speaker 1>to have as few things that are in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that are cumbersome as possible.</v>

527
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.133
<v Speaker 1>Few Ego issues and a few distorted </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions of reality as possible in </v>

528
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 1>order to weave your way through to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

529
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

530
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's exceptions to that where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a phenomenal physical specimens</v>

531
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:32.194
<v Speaker 1>that are incredibly dedicated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with a lot of demons like Tyson </v>

532
00:21:35.051 --> 00:21:36.590
<v Speaker 1>in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:37.424
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if that would work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and may the same way it worked in </v>

534
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

535
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I just don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the variables and boxing,</v>

536
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 1>like with Tyson or an mma rather with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson in his prime,</v>

537
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.410
<v Speaker 1>he could just weighed towards God's Bob </v>
<v Speaker 1>and weave and throw bombs and,</v>

538
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.273
<v Speaker 1>and figure out a way to just smash them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just so much faster than </v>

539
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:55.234
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he hit so hard and they were afraid </v>

540
00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:57.634
<v Speaker 1>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

541
00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.863
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder if you're ever get to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of person dominate the way </v>

542
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Tyson did as a MMA fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just don't know.</v>

543
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.563
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never care what their face looks like </v>

544
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.720
<v Speaker 1>when they walk into the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

545
00:22:10.721 --> 00:22:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't watch videos,</v>

546
00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:12.431
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

547
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:13.264
<v Speaker 1>he looks frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've pointed it out and he chews </v>

548
00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:16.104
<v Speaker 1>gum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Annie's high steep and the Oj when he </v>

549
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 1>walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't look happier.</v>

550
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.673
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so calm.</v>

551
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Josie.</v>

552
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Aldo won't look the guy in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's terrified.</v>

553
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 1>He's just kind of looking down and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>humble,</v>

554
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of that stuff seems to work with </v>

555
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 1>those guys because every one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows there's so many ways to lose.</v>

556
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:30.394
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't seem to try that shit </v>

557
00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 1>with each other like boxers some guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

558
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It was a big thing with vandelay Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vandelay stair guys down big time,</v>

559
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mirko Cro.</v>

560
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Cop in him had the greatest stare down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of pride.</v>

561
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>They're just both staring at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was super intense.</v>

562
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I remember just like America when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about his stare,</v>

563
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 1>that's probably what every year he came </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to.</v>

564
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:55.681
<v Speaker 1>UFC was a 2008 when you were on our show</v>
<v Speaker 1>on k rock and you talking about this Guy</v>

565
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.703
<v Speaker 1>Mirko Cro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cop was coming over at his fucking and </v>

566
00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 1>we were watching his stare down.</v>

567
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Mirko versus vandal.</v>

568
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.513
<v Speaker 1>Vandal used to intimidate everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mirko was the head of an anti </v>

569
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 1>terrorist squadron and Croatia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't give a fuck.</v>

570
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And he was a world class kickbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

571
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:12.814
<v Speaker 1>look how fucking intense lately on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's completely unintimidated by that </v>

572
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 1>stare and he beat the holy shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angela.</v>

573
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy to really flatline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay head kicked him into a coma.</v>

574
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.711
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

575
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Just blam it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

576
00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the second time they fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time they fought was his first</v>

577
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:31.924
<v Speaker 1>mma fight and they had all these weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>wacky rules like there can only be on </v>

578
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:36.980
<v Speaker 1>the ground for 30 seconds and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand in the back backup,</v>

579
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

580
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate Mirko wasn't really doing mma.</v>

581
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've sort of training in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but vandelay was a champion.</v>

582
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jay was a world class fighter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had some sort of a weird </v>

583
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:53.090
<v Speaker 1>arrangement and the arrangement was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited amount of time on the ground and</v>

584
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other wacky rules in that first</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

585
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>It was a draw because if no one finished</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>

586
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>that was the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody finished.</v>

587
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:00.974
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided that it was going to be a </v>

588
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 1>draw and the rounds were with a 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute rounds.</v>

589
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Well back then they were 10 minute first</v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds and then you'd have a five minute</v>

590
00:24:08.431 --> 00:24:11.930
<v Speaker 1>second round in a five minute third </v>
<v Speaker 1>round if it was a championship fight.</v>

591
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 1>But I think with vander and him they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shortened the rounds as well.</v>

592
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the second time they fought,</v>

593
00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:21.284
<v Speaker 1>it was a legit pride mma fight and Mirko</v>
<v Speaker 1>had already fought a bunch of pride </v>

594
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:27.134
<v Speaker 1>fights and really got into the groove </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it become like one of the best </v>

595
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 1>heavyweights alive and he just beat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit out of band that way.</v>

596
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that stare down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really intense that,</v>

597
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.910
<v Speaker 1>that was an intimidating stare.</v>

598
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 1>That's Marco and his prime because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>

599
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 1>not moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

600
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:41.960
<v Speaker 1>But that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with the team,</v>

601
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.970
<v Speaker 1>you're the head of an anti terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

602
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got police group.</v>

603
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I guess there are police could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded more like a fucking,</v>

604
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.220
<v Speaker 1>like my niece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of it police.</v>

605
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.320
<v Speaker 1>But if you're like an antiterrorism cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the face you have.</v>

606
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:55.154
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get information out of </v>

607
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.414
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's most likely seen a lot of </v>

608
00:24:58.071 --> 00:24:59.450
<v Speaker 1>people die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think?</v>

609
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

610
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Croatia is a hard place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

611
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a hard man in a hard place.</v>

612
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And on top of being like a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

613
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best kickboxers alive before he </v>

614
00:25:12.301 --> 00:25:15.010
<v Speaker 1>wanted to mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

615
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was amazing.</v>

616
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 1>He was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very good as a kickboxer,</v>

617
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.833
<v Speaker 1>but really came into his own as a MMA </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter because his style of kickboxing </v>

618
00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 1>was unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely effective in mma because he was</v>

619
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 1>very explosive and fast.</v>

620
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guys would be like more,</v>

621
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.843
<v Speaker 1>there'd be more methodical or technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ernesto hoost or Peter or some of </v>

622
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:39.584
<v Speaker 1>these other guys that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would stand in front of guys more </v>

623
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 1>and just pick their shots better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mirko would just blast you with like one</v>

624
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 1>or one or two single shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was way more effective in mma.</v>

625
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the explosive really fast style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:54.580
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I would like to see a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

627
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.693
<v Speaker 1>a wonderboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his kickboxing fights and he was </v>

628
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:57.884
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like $57 a kickbox and I never watched </v>

629
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 1>him kickbox online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see them online.</v>

630
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I should do that online because God </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what I'm doing.</v>

631
00:26:04.761 --> 00:26:07.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not helping me getting off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

632
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying not to as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like there's so many fun things</v>

633
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:10.544
<v Speaker 1>to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been think jerking off during the </v>

634
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.543
<v Speaker 1>day because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so ritualistic for me that when I </v>

635
00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:17.110
<v Speaker 1>jerk off during the day I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

636
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:17.953
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be a person and I don't have to </v>

637
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 1>think about that for the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

638
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It really helps my day go much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

639
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever taught a meditating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you meditate at all?</v>

640
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it like,</v>

641
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:27.794
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

642
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.990
<v Speaker 1>before the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

643
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:29.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

644
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.770
<v Speaker 1>we started joe pointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

645
00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:31.604
<v Speaker 1>you always have an issue and he's right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like for me it will be an </v>

646
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:34.154
<v Speaker 1>itch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you were talking about some new </v>

647
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.280
<v Speaker 1>issue with my throat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had that for years.</v>

648
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Speaker 1>We're starting certain foods fucked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>up if that happens to me too though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we smoke too much weed before a show.</v>

651
00:26:44.681 --> 00:26:45.514
<v Speaker 1>I'll get Flemmi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a combination of many </v>

652
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:49.620
<v Speaker 1>coffee and eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the eggs,</v>

653
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:50.454
<v Speaker 1>I think do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to one of these alternative </v>

654
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:53.310
<v Speaker 1>doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe my,</v>

655
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my uh,</v>

656
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 1>adrenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adrenal glands were fucked up.</v>

657
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.443
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you got to cut out the eggs or cut </v>

658
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:00.940
<v Speaker 1>out the coffee and I can't stop with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>krave.</v>

659
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Fruit's good for before a show like </v>
<v Speaker 1>apples,</v>

660
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.880

<v Speaker 1>certain flux behind it.</v>

661
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.140
<v Speaker 1>I went around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one of those veggie thing,</v>

662
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.980

<v Speaker 1>splitly,</v>

663
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.823
<v Speaker 1>celery and a fucking vegetable just </v>
<v Speaker 1>blows because it just dominates the </v>

664
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 1>entire juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

665
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's great for cleaning out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your system isn't really good for you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>didn't give it to me.</v>

691
00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It literally stopped me from shitting.</v>

692
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Constipation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

693
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>

694
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

695
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

696
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:29.180
<v Speaker 1>isn't that a thing with like vicodin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those pain killers?</v>

697
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 1>It gives you constipation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

698
00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I've only taken vicodin once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I had my sinuses fixed,</v>

699
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 1>but the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that prep I took it.</v>

700
00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

701
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back and see the guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

702
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if I'm gonna to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and take that shit.</v>

703
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I just want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one point I was being crazy,</v>

704
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:43.974
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to make sure I don't get </v>

705
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:45.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

706
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather have some kind of a kid.</v>

707
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I knew I wouldn't be on it forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

708
00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:50.784
<v Speaker 1>while I'm fucking acting like an ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me at least one of the podcast </v>

709
00:28:55.411 --> 00:28:56.244
<v Speaker 1>episodes that I took the most amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat for early in the day was I did a </v>

710
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:00.084
<v Speaker 1>podcast with a guy named Peter Duesberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a biologist at the University of </v>

711
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.333
<v Speaker 1>California Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a very respected biologist </v>

712
00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>who's done a lot of great work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

713
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.763
<v Speaker 1>but he's got a very controversial take </v>
<v Speaker 1>on HIV and he does not believe that HIV </v>

714
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 1>causes AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that HIV is evidence of a weak</v>

715
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:19.014
<v Speaker 1>immune system.</v>

716
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks that when people have HIV,</v>

717
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it's because their immune system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised.</v>

718
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not that HIV compromises their </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system.</v>

719
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

720
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And he feels like all these people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are catching aids and getting,</v>

721
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:37.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>HIV,</v>

722
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:40.400
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is they're doing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of party drugs,</v>

723
00:29:40.401 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>they're doing emile and crystal</v>

724
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 2>meth and that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very prevalent inside the gay community,</v>

725
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay guys party a ton,</v>

726
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

727
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.833
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a lot of drugs and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>points to the high correlation between </v>

728
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>all these people doing these party drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and HIV.</v>

729
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.753
<v Speaker 2>His work is widely criticized amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate scientists and most people </v>

730
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 2>just do not agree with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said that the,</v>

731
00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:05.164
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the connection between HIV and AIDS is </v>

732
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.310
<v Speaker 2>rock solid and undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he thinks it's not in.</v>

733
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.600
<v Speaker 2>It's an boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did people get mad at me about that one?</v>

734
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.443
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking to this guy who's a </v>

735
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.740
<v Speaker 2>biologist at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

736
00:30:17.741 --> 00:30:18.311
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

737
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:23.311
<v Speaker 2>I'm figuring this guy's legit scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can't get funding for anything.</v>

738
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 2>He's essentially blackballed from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic community.</v>

739
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.220
<v Speaker 2>And it was really weird talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

740
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 2>has anybody debated you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

741
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one will debate me.</v>

742
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.051
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

743
00:30:33.051 --> 00:30:34.500
<v Speaker 2>is it almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

744
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.823
<v Speaker 2>what about Arthur Ashe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is he saying that a direct injection </v>

745
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 2>into the bloodstream will give it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

746
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:40.480
<v Speaker 2>How does he explain those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

747
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.213
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what Arthur Ashe was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he was saying essentially was </v>

748
00:30:44.261 --> 00:30:45.430
<v Speaker 2>that transfusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you got it.</v>

749
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.880
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about HIV was if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got HIV,</v>

750
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Arthur Ashe got a transfusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For what reason though?</v>

751
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

752
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had something wrong.</v>

753
00:30:55.181 --> 00:30:56.014
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When what he's saying is that when your </v>

754
00:30:57.971 --> 00:31:01.420
<v Speaker 2>immune system is compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when HIV shows itself that HIV is</v>

755
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:02.254
<v Speaker 2>a very weak virus and that it only shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the immune systems of people that </v>

756
00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:06.514
<v Speaker 2>are compromised and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he saying we all have it or you can </v>

757
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:11.831
<v Speaker 2>catch it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

758
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 2>he's not saying we all have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you saying you can catch it,</v>

759
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:15.454
<v Speaker 2>but he's saying the evidence of it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>only in people that have a weakened </v>

760
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:20.560
<v Speaker 2>immune system.</v>

761
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not something I believe in.</v>

762
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get mad at me because I'm white or</v>

763
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many.</v>

764
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a million different </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases of people who obviously were,</v>

765
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who got it in in very weird ways are </v>

766
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two blood transfusions or they were born</v>

767
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:35.320
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here it says,</v>

768
00:31:35.321 --> 00:31:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Arthur ash says he believed he </v>
<v Speaker 2>contracted HIV,</v>

769
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.873
<v Speaker 2>the virus that causes AIDS through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transfusion of tainted blood during his </v>

770
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 2>second round of heart bypass surgery in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1983.</v>

771
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:47.763
<v Speaker 2>First learned of his inspection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the other issue that I'm </v>

772
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.183
<v Speaker 2>Peter Duesberg was saying was that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were giving people when they first </v>

773
00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:55.324
<v Speaker 2>tested positive for HIV was act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That act is a medication they used to </v>

774
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:01.474
<v Speaker 2>use for chemotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they stopped using it for </v>

775
00:32:03.101 --> 00:32:03.934
<v Speaker 2>chemotherapy because it was killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people quicker than cancer was killing </v>

776
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

777
00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:08.464
<v Speaker 2>it was just a brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal drug and they had a bunch of it </v>

778
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.010
<v Speaker 2>in his mind.</v>

779
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.023
<v Speaker 2>They had a bunch of it laying around </v>
<v Speaker 2>after that and they decided to try to </v>

780
00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:18.600
<v Speaker 2>use it on aids patients and they started</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading re,</v>

781
00:32:18.601 --> 00:32:19.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

782
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reintroducing it and you wonder.</v>

783
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess the conspiracy thing is I take </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceuticals.</v>

784
00:32:24.021 --> 00:32:24.854
<v Speaker 2>We had all these drugs and they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of unneeded or do they think </v>

785
00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:27.874
<v Speaker 2>that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just trying to do something </v>

786
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

787
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 2>obviously it wasn't the smart thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do because they don't use it anymore and</v>

788
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 2>it didn't help people act did not help </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with aids.</v>

789
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who took azt died,</v>

790
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.270
<v Speaker 2>lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitload</v>

791
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 1>of them and aids back then was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially a death sentence,</v>

792
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:44.863
<v Speaker 1>but there was a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do anything that got aids that </v>

793
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 1>got HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never got aids.</v>

794
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:50.563
<v Speaker 1>They just took care of their body and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a holistic approach and using </v>

795
00:32:53.521 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

796
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's super controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anything else.</v>

797
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's people that get cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't die.</v>

798
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.540
<v Speaker 1>They get cured of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

799
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 1>But then there's people that get cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>at ravages are system and kills them.</v>

800
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 1>So Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

801
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:05.624
<v Speaker 1>he listened to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he didn't try like alternative </v>

802
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 1>met Steve Jobs should still be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

803
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 1>like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty curable form of cancer.</v>

804
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 1>You can get pancreatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

805
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:13.131
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he,</v>

806
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I thought his was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said a fairly curable one,</v>

807
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 1>that he had listened to his friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to go so holistic and they said if</v>

808
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 1>he had gone and just had it treated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably would've survived it.</v>

809
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:24.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those was probably a lot of that going </v>

810
00:33:25.551 --> 00:33:26.384
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a lot of fucking wacky </v>

811
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 1>people with their wacky ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 1>holistic medicine.</v>

812
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.003
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a guy do a ted talk on basically </v>

813
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:33.614
<v Speaker 1>saying like strawberries are really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they caused other anti </v>

814
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 1>angiogenesis or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about.</v>

815
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 1>It stops the production of new blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>vessels and that's what feeds cancer.</v>

816
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:45.644
<v Speaker 1>Like he had this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He literally had me convinced you could </v>

817
00:33:46.341 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 1>eat fucking strawberries and I kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer in large quantities.</v>

818
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 1>So I mean if you hear somebody talk who </v>
<v Speaker 1>really knows what they're talking about,</v>

819
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 1>even if they're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are convinced by.</v>

820
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like youtube videos,</v>

821
00:33:56.811 --> 00:33:57.644
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where people have wacky conspiracy </v>

822
00:33:58.371 --> 00:33:59.204
<v Speaker 1>theories as long as they speak with big </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and I say things in complete </v>

823
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 1>sentences and they sound articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to believe them.</v>

824
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that has been proven to be</v>

825
00:34:08.181 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 1>effective with cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some forms of cancer is ketogenic diets.</v>

826
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.143
<v Speaker 1>Diets where your fat based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you eat a lot of Avocados and </v>

827
00:34:16.311 --> 00:34:17.144
<v Speaker 1>coconut oil and your body Burns those </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than glucose and some cancers </v>

828
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.540
<v Speaker 1>feed off sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to starve them,</v>

829
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.643
<v Speaker 1>you go on a very low sugar diet and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very high fat diet and apparently </v>

830
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 1>there's real science that shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some benefits to that,</v>

831
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:37.790
<v Speaker 1>but so there's only certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancers,</v>

832
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of cancers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't affect at all.</v>

833
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Certain kinds of brain cancers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't affect it all.</v>

834
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.970
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the fuck you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better go to a doctor.</v>

835
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he can do both.</v>

836
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 1>We want it to go to the doctor and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that,</v>

837
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 1>like having another coddling under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hospital.</v>

838
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to choose what we about to say.</v>

839
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.173
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I just googled on the Steve Jobs </v>

840
00:34:54.861 --> 00:34:55.694
<v Speaker 1>thing is like both of you are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct from what I just found that he </v>

841
00:34:58.191 --> 00:34:59.024
<v Speaker 1>had pancreatic cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also could have been saved </v>

842
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:03.740
<v Speaker 1>potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the next thing also says that,</v>

843
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:05.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived for 20 years with it.</v>

844
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:06.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

845
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.390
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have chemo or radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

846
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:09.224
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swayze a pancreatic and died within 18 </v>

847
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:11.360
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

848
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:12.460
<v Speaker 1>they're saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

849
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

850
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.823
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the treatment killed him or are there </v>

851
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of pancreatic cancers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

852
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.313
<v Speaker 1>Lately it isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a Hodgkin's and non Hodgkin's </v>

853
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:22.214
<v Speaker 1>lymphoma one is worse than the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that bag up please Jesus Christ and </v>

854
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Lived for 20 years of this cancer.</v>

855
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 1>It seems he did not have chemotherapy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation treatment at all.</v>

856
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.270
<v Speaker 1>The Hollywood actors who's at answering </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

857
00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:37.710
<v Speaker 1>This is what is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bullshit?</v>

858
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way out,</v>

859
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.530
<v Speaker 1>go up there right there.</v>

860
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Walter Isaacson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's writing the Steve Jobs biography.</v>

861
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.163
<v Speaker 1>He told 60 minutes that Steve refused </v>
<v Speaker 1>what could have been potentially a </v>

862
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 1>lifesaving surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did have more than one surgery,</v>

863
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:51.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he have his liver replaced?</v>

864
00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I feel like he had a liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>transplant.</v>

865
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 1>What is it that makes a guy not want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery?</v>

866
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>That might work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do people become delusional in that</v>

867
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 1>they're that or are they afraid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery?</v>

868
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:04.344
<v Speaker 1>Are they willing to die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking Zappa hated going to the </v>

869
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:09.150
<v Speaker 1>doctor and he died lose he 56.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was wrong with Zappa when he.</v>

870
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It was a cancer I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just calling cancer or prostate.</v>

871
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.553
<v Speaker 1>The surgeon who gave Steve jobs a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>liver and two more years faces new </v>

872
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a 2013.</v>

873
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.480
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says he bought the Memphis House with</v>

874
00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 1>job convalesced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

875
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.800
<v Speaker 1>He later bought the Memphis House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bought the house where Steve Jobs was</v>

876
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:32.230
<v Speaker 1>living there.</v>

877
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.063
<v Speaker 1>They said the guy who was treating </v>
<v Speaker 1>George Harrison board on guitar to sign </v>

878
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>while he was in the fucking hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sign this real quick.</v>

879
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

880
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Revelation came with the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern transplant Mark Buba Bulls.</v>

881
00:36:44.241 --> 00:36:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Say that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peruse squeak per,</v>

882
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.280
<v Speaker 1>per uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight a rescue pressq ,</v>

883
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.770
<v Speaker 1>a Poreska Presca front page story.</v>

<v Speaker 1>S Q,</v>

885
00:36:57.691 --> 00:37:02.691
<v Speaker 1>u I n a front page story Thursday in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memphis commercial advocate piece paints</v>

886
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 1>a vivid picture of the life saving </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>

887
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:08.694
<v Speaker 1>although it takes most of the details </v>
<v Speaker 1>about jobs from the Walter Isaacson </v>

888
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:12.600
<v Speaker 1>biography and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

889
00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:12.961
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

890
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:13.790
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>

891
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.623
<v Speaker 1>what is the question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did jobs move to the top of the </v>

892
00:37:15.931 --> 00:37:16.741
<v Speaker 1>list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

893
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:17.574
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Frank Underwood and the </v>

894
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.500
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

895
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.990
<v Speaker 1>why don't we probably paid somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

896
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:24.800
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do you think he gets to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the list when you have $50,</v>

897
00:37:24.801 --> 00:37:27.990
<v Speaker 1>million dollars you can move around yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the way you are emailing is because</v>

898
00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:30.450
<v Speaker 1>of something you've invented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably get to the fucking top of</v>

899
00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:32.660
<v Speaker 1>the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fast wonder what killed his liver.</v>

900
00:37:32.661 --> 00:37:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it was medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like medication for.</v>

901
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.533
<v Speaker 1>I know a friend who just died from </v>
<v Speaker 1>pancreatic cancer and he had it for </v>

902
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 1>quite a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him.</v>

903
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I met him in 2014 and he already had it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just died.</v>

904
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.420
<v Speaker 1>It says he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refused.</v>

905
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.473
<v Speaker 1>Tim Cook's liver transplant offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he has the same rare blood type </v>

906
00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:55.861
<v Speaker 1>of Sim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

907
00:37:55.861 --> 00:37:56.694
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Cook would have given Steve Jobs or </v>

908
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.303
<v Speaker 1>a chunk of liver boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tense than anyone's ever taken </v>

<v Speaker 1>hospital where jobs received transplant </v>

918
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 1>was given $40,000,000</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess he was appreciated.</v>

921
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.213
<v Speaker 1>Let's look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get to the front of the </v>

922
00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the lines are supposed</v>

923
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:27.870
<v Speaker 1>to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair.</v>

924
00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:28.530
<v Speaker 1>You fucks.</v>

925
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.400
<v Speaker 1>This is a way to cut 40 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 million declan cut.</v>

926
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give some money to the hospital.</v>

927
00:38:33.001 --> 00:38:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going to save a shitload </v>
<v Speaker 1>of lives.</v>

928
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.810
<v Speaker 1>We went to before you came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are at my.</v>

929
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 1>My radio agent died of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like 64,</v>

930
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.773
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not that old and he had a cancer </v>

931
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 1>of the lymph nodes and he fucking was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a little bit better,</v>

932
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:46.774
<v Speaker 1>we thought and then went for surgery for</v>
<v Speaker 1>circulation between these people in </v>

933
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:52.900
<v Speaker 1>these super high stress jobs like </v>
<v Speaker 1>agents.</v>

934
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It can because I know stress by Bob was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not as stressed guy though,</v>

935
00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 1>unless he swallowed all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a very calm guy.</v>

936
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Like literally he was gentle and he gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bad news gently but firmly.</v>

937
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very,</v>

938
00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 1>very unique guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not stressed and less.</v>

939
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:11.560
<v Speaker 1>He swallowed it and never showed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

940
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 1>he seemed like a very zen guy.</v>

941
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was something with his,</v>

942
00:39:15.671 --> 00:39:16.504
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went in for a breathing thing and just </v>

943
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:18.034
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm definitely on the table and </v>

944
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

945
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.150
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was not that old.</v>

946
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was 64 when you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 49,</v>

947
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 1>so when you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 60 foil,</v>

948
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:26.790
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

949
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 1>a graspable age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like,</v>

950
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's so many different </v>

951
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.930
<v Speaker 1>factors that play into like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan,</v>

952
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.310
<v Speaker 1>the difference between lifespans today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life Spans 100 years ago,</v>

953
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.163
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously there's been some big </v>

954
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:41.404
<v Speaker 1>advances in medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder like how much our diet </v>

955
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 1>plays on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of cancer.</v>

956
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of a huge factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All his sugar,</v>

957
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 1>all the bullshit people eat all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>preservatives,</v>

958
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.380
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution.</v>

959
00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.010
<v Speaker 1>They say that just living in a city can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take up to 10 years off your life.</v>

960
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 1>That's also probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the air and it's probably,</v>

961
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the stress too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the city or just stressed.</v>

962
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure all that stuff goes into it.</v>

963
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.063
<v Speaker 1>I mean we try to avoid it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to eat healthy like grilled </v>

964
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fun one.</v>

965
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I never took into consideration until </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of years ago.</v>

966
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I read an article on the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brake dust.</v>

967
00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:19.323
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're around a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>population area and people constantly </v>

968
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:23.950
<v Speaker 1>hitting their brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

969
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're in traffic all the time,</v>

970
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.390
<v Speaker 1>those breaks when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.760
<v Speaker 1>you're cleaning your wheels and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that break shit all over your wheels.</v>

972
00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's in the air.</v>

973
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:34.923
<v Speaker 1>That black sooty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit gets in the air and if you're </v>

974
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:39.783
<v Speaker 1>in a place like say if you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan and you got like a second </v>

975
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 1>floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk up your windows open,</v>

976
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you're just taking in breakdown.</v>

977
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.200
<v Speaker 1>You're breathing that in all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll wipe it off your fucking furniture</v>

978
00:40:50.201 --> 00:40:50.740
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

979
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.750
<v Speaker 1>you'll see it on your table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that never,</v>

980
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.613
<v Speaker 1>no one ever thinks I'd be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never heard anyone discuss </v>

981
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:56.044
<v Speaker 1>brake dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is something that's all over the </v>

982
00:40:57.011 --> 00:40:59.710
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we find dust back there jamie.</v>

983
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that dust that we keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding back there?</v>

984
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.580
<v Speaker 1>It's all black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably just like La dirts because</v>

985
00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 1>it's dry and dusty around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's black that I see it in my house</v>

986
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean back there,</v>

987
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:16.490
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because we have a closed </v>
<v Speaker 1>garage door just comes in under the air.</v>

988
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 1>We have this workout equipment and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we wiped the workout equipment,</v>

989
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:24.010
<v Speaker 1>like if we go back there right now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put a wet paper towel to that,</v>

990
00:41:24.011 --> 00:41:26.680
<v Speaker 1>a reverse hyper machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top event,</v>

991
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.750
<v Speaker 1>it's all black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like black dust.</v>

992
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff behind that.</v>

993
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole warehouse back.</v>

994
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 1>As many times I've been this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was the entire room.</v>

995
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what a cool fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sectional that is dead.</v>

996
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a room back there and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another room behind it.</v>

997
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

998
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Scientists find new ways of freeways are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill you.</v>

999
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:49.250
<v Speaker 1>What is it saying that the thickening </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing twice,</v>

1000
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:52.700
<v Speaker 1>the average in people living within 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>meters of a freeway,</v>

1001
00:41:52.701 --> 00:41:53.534
<v Speaker 1>the connection between particulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter and artery thickening were </v>

1002
00:41:56.301 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 1>statistically significant for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

1003
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're talking about.</v>

1004
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:00.973
<v Speaker 1>That's brake dust and shit that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of exhaust pipes according to La </v>

1005
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.733
<v Speaker 1>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One point 5 million people live within </v>

1006
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 1>300 meters of a freeway and the La </v>
<v Speaker 1>Basin.</v>

1007
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:11.024
<v Speaker 1>Last year we found out the freeway </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution travels much further than </v>

1008
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much as 2000,</v>

1009
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:17.990
<v Speaker 1>500 meters from the source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all that,</v>

1010
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 1>so if you're now I wonder if it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same in Manhattan.</v>

1011
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1012
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe because Manhattan has already </v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

1013
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Have a lot less cars going by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and Manhattan than you do.</v>

1014
00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 1>They're 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>meters as far.</v>

1015
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.160
<v Speaker 1>How far is that in like feet or miles?</v>

1016
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that a mile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mile?</v>

1017
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.020
<v Speaker 1>A mile or kilometer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's two and a half kilometers.</v>

1018
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.863
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody a mile from the highways </v>

1019
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.250
<v Speaker 1>getting poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1020
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 1>you'll hope it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how old is that studying?</v>

1021
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Is it still happening as much like our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our break,</v>

1022
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 1>our breaks made me better now than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a few years ago.</v>

1023
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:51.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1024
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.080
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those 2010 breaks at the same.</v>

1025
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no different.</v>

1026
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:55.930
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1027
00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 1>they're the same fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've always had these pads.</v>

1028
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 1>They press down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were out.</v>

1029
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 1>You got to replace them and when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing out there grinding down,</v>

1030
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:04.520
<v Speaker 1>that powder isn't going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1031
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Someone should probably figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to contain that mean.</v>

1032
00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:11.360
<v Speaker 1>That seems like what we're doing now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1033
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.060
<v Speaker 1>it just goes out into the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they should be contained,</v>

1034
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:18.740
<v Speaker 1>like where the powder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brakes would work the same way,</v>

1035
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.353
<v Speaker 1>but the powder would have to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked up into some sort of a pouch or </v>

1036
00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 1>something and you have to change it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a filter.</v>

1037
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 1>How often would you have to change it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably all the time,</v>

1038
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>but that seems like that would be like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real viable alternative,</v>

1039
00:43:32.361 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of encased break thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1040
00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:37.940
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem like outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of engineering,</v>

1041
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.120
<v Speaker 1>what can they make the breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that sounds unfeasible,</v>

1042
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.163
<v Speaker 1>can they make the breaks out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's actually just not as </v>

1043
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:46.160
<v Speaker 1>bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything they can do that might</v>

1044
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:48.380
<v Speaker 1>be a little bit of a fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think anything you breathe in,</v>

1045
00:43:48.381 --> 00:43:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you breathe in Sawdust and sucks for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1046
00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:51.453
<v Speaker 1>It's a particulate matter like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking in things and you're taking a </v>

1047
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of dust into your lungs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes an irritant,</v>

1048
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.590
<v Speaker 1>so it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not good,</v>

1049
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1050
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:03.243
<v Speaker 1>A sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad for all those people that live near </v>

1051
00:44:04.611 --> 00:44:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1052
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.820
<v Speaker 1>they live near the highway and I have my</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle,</v>

1053
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:08.654
<v Speaker 1>so I guess we're all going to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped that a little earlier than we </v>

1054
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:10.820
<v Speaker 1>showed this.</v>

1055
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1056
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Keep a rubber on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be fine.</v>

1057
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Don't anybody come in your butt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's gonna be okay.</v>

1058
00:44:17.391 --> 00:44:20.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking what a party killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've got a lot of rules,</v>

1059
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.770
<v Speaker 1>but no condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1060
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't wear them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1061
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.220
<v Speaker 1>well that's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a problem.</v>

1062
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.233
<v Speaker 1>My fucking Dick shrivels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many guys have gotten aids from </v>

1063
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 1>regular sex though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably very few.</v>

1064
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Very few probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but should have it.</v>

1065
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:33.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's somehow physically </v>

1066
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:35.874
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you probably have to have so many </v>

1067
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 1>things lined up to get it from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy or even fucking ass.</v>

1068
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to have so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it can happen though.</v>

1069
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's.</v>

1070
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the issue is it has to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

1071
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.853
<v Speaker 1>but I know that people get sick all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time from having a cut and then I'm </v>

1072
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.493
<v Speaker 1>getting someone's blood in their cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's happened to people in </v>

1073
00:44:57.991 --> 00:44:58.824
<v Speaker 1>hospitals that have done surgery and cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>their finger while they're doing it and </v>

1074
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:04.290
<v Speaker 1>they get infected by the blood of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

1075
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.710
<v Speaker 1>That's common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1076
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a little cut on your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I had that thought,</v>

1077
00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I've told the story of Hbo Special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had three similar Ron Jeremy after the</v>

1078
00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>porn awards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1079
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:12.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was.</v>

1080
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't feel necessarily sexy,</v>

1081
00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:17.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1082
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.690
<v Speaker 1>it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1083
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.591
<v Speaker 1>it was a Goof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1084
00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like a girl and he's fucking her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he went into the bathroom.</v>

1085
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking one girl and he fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one and he,</v>

1086
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I remember he put rubbing alcohol around</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dick and I don't know if that's that</v>

1087
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.590
<v Speaker 1>good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he was doing to make sure he</v>

1088
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:29.424
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he only did that before he fucked </v>

1089
00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1090
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I think alcohol or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1091
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.160
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that it was cleaning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

1092
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Cut set is so hard core.</v>

1093
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1094
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:38.964
<v Speaker 1>his Dick has probably seen a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>action and it might be a way to keep </v>

1095
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 1>things off it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1096
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 1>If that guy doesn't have aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is getting aids?</v>

1097
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.010
<v Speaker 1>You know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not lucky.</v>

1098
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lucky guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky.</v>

1099
00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Terrible now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that guy doesn't have aids,</v>

1101
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do realize I've rolled the dice</v>

1102
00:45:57.151 --> 00:46:00.210
<v Speaker 1>way too many times and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky that I'm really grateful.</v>

1103
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Like a fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just stop.</v>

1104
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1105
00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:06.873
<v Speaker 1>it's just think it's harder to get like </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a man than it is for a woman it </v>

1106
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 1>seems like unless again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let somebody come in here,</v>

1107
00:46:14.011 --> 00:46:15.490
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be harder.</v>

1108
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's harder to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't know.</v>

1109
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.280
<v Speaker 1>What am I at Dr.</v>

1110
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>

1111
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.753
<v Speaker 1>I think it is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to go fuck without a rubber </v>

1112
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:24.150
<v Speaker 1>right now because Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tessa.</v>

1113
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're right.</v>

1114
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:26.484
<v Speaker 1>It probably is harder to get unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a cut on your Dick and she's </v>

1115
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 1>cutting her pussy and they happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go air tight against each other.</v>

1116
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:31.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1117
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a woman like you gotta,</v>

1118
00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Speaker 1>think like all there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's exposed,</v>

1119
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:39.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that area inside their vagina is all</v>

1120
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 1>open tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1121
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It's all like absorbing like they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst situation set up,</v>

1122
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:46.913
<v Speaker 1>but I think the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told years ago by a woman who </v>

1123
00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:50.590
<v Speaker 1>worked in the health field that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a.</v>

1124
00:46:50.591 --> 00:46:53.490
<v Speaker 1>it's such a delicate virus that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1125
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 1>she's like a blow job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't even get it from.</v>

1126
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:56.410
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

1127
00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.230
<v Speaker 1>your stomach kills the semen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1128
00:46:58.231 --> 00:46:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1129
00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:01.380
<v Speaker 1>You can even give him a blow job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I don't know how true that is,</v>

1130
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 1>but she called me that fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She lives in Elkton,</v>

1131
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember she was a really cute girl.</v>

1132
00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:06.864
<v Speaker 1>I met at a road gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the fucking town she lived </v>

1133
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was telling you this before.</v>

1134
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:12.040
<v Speaker 1>She blew you and don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1135
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:13.950
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stomach acid.</v>

1136
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Swatch glow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1137

<v Speaker 1>she was a wonderful health practitioner.</v>

1138
00:47:19.631 --> 00:47:20.464
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking drink about a gallon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds and tell me we're all going to be </v>

1139

<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1140
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:25.643

<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy though that so many </v>

1141
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 1>diseases kill people from sex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean syphilis,</v>

1142
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 1>gonorrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are those fatal without,</v>

1143
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:34.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's isn't syphilis would killed </v>

<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:39.094
<v Speaker 1>I believe we even did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the twenties there was nothing </v>

1147
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:40.880
<v Speaker 1>they could do for.</v>

1148
00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1150
00:47:42.521 --> 00:47:45.840
<v Speaker 1>it's just amazing that untreated so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases turned me.</v>

1151
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Think about how few things other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>like severely compromised immune systems</v>

<v Speaker 1>the people that die from the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually it's old people or young really </v>

1154
00:47:56.531 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 1>young people that are kind of frail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wind up getting sick and dying from</v>

1155
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 1>common colds and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

1156
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:02.974
<v Speaker 1>But most people they get better from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine shooting cancer out of </v>

<v Speaker 1>He went out and started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they're like looking at her </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1175
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 1>so he could probably should have kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mouth shut about that,</v>

1176
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.230
<v Speaker 1>but she did.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He loved it.</v>

1262
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.670
<v Speaker 3>He literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told him he literally gotten the knees</v>

1263
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.870
<v Speaker 3>and was bowing to mix.</v>

1264
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 3>I said something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was just enjoying it.</v>

1265
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.160
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy will definitely remember me,</v>

1266
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.473
<v Speaker 3>like fucking dumb slick rick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought him on stage at the comedy </v>

1267
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 3>cellar one time we took a photo </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1268
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I saw him years later in the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing like,</v>

1269
00:52:32.721 --> 00:52:33.554
<v Speaker 3>how do you not remember being on board </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the stage from the audience if I was </v>

1270
00:52:35.691 --> 00:52:37.670
<v Speaker 3>watching a show and they brought me up </v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage,</v>

1271
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1272
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Dylan picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of those guys and meet,</v>

1273
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:45.410
<v Speaker 3>they meet so many people that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hard drivers is constantly full.</v>

1274
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 3>They're just constantly deleting files,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is understandable.</v>

1275
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:50.430
<v Speaker 3>It was just the circumstances that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>

1276
00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.200
<v Speaker 3>like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the fact that it was like me,</v>

1277
00:52:52.201 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>like I've interviewed people and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't remember me,</v>

1278
00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:55.274
<v Speaker 3>but I get that because I've done radio </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and I don't know who the fuck you </v>

1279
00:52:56.931 --> 00:52:57.764
<v Speaker 3>are 10 minutes later.</v>

1280
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:59.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1281
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 3>You and slick rick at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite photos in history,</v>

1282
00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 3>he was in the audience and none of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians would talk to them,</v>

1283
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:07.640
<v Speaker 3>so I was going to always tell them I </v>
<v Speaker 3>loved them and I'm like,</v>

1284
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking a photo with you after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1285
00:53:09.321 --> 00:53:11.030
<v Speaker 3>And Manny and the owner was in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1286
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.433
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was so great and so fucking </v>

1287
00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:15.950
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he get shot in the eye or something?</v>

1288
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:16.933
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe he got shot or he did </v>

1289
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 3>something like that was in a children's </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1290
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.433
<v Speaker 3>Like there was something similar in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>real life when you went to jail like </v>

1291
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that rapid children's.</v>

1292
00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:26.253
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1293
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know exactly how he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

1294
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.513
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he had an interesting story </v>

1295
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:31.770
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he didn't.</v>

1296
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed coolio before he won fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor and the last 31 he was telling me</v>

1297
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 1>that this is already over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already done this.</v>

1298
00:53:39.811 --> 00:53:40.644
<v Speaker 1>He's lived a thousand lives and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand universes and he was just so </v>

1299
00:53:43.561 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Speaker 1>barbecued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like inspirational.</v>

1300
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was I was listening to him.</v>

1301
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because he was so high,</v>

1302
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:53.250
<v Speaker 1>like I think it just had no nerves going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1303
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 1>He just sort of did the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was nothing on afraid.</v>

1304
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely have some balance thing.</v>

1305
00:53:58.681 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were on some beams or some shit.</v>

1306
00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 1>So fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody died doing that show.</v>

1307
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I look back at it sometimes and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1308
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do it again with another host.</v>

1309
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a ludicrous.</v>

1310
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.790
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludicrous is doing it.</v>

1311
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:13.590
<v Speaker 1>They did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're gonna keep doing</v>

1312
00:54:13.591 --> 00:54:14.940
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was kind of a flop.</v>

1313
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:15.923
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean you don't want to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when it was done it was very </v>

1314
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:18.984
<v Speaker 1>timely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now with the Internet has gotten so </v>

1315
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 1>much faster and we can watch everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>on our phone.</v>

1316
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like you could see real </v>
<v Speaker 1>life deaths.</v>

1317
00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:25.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's Kinda hard to see people doing </v>

1318
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.223
<v Speaker 1>crazy stuff when you can turn it on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just see someone do it without a shell </v>

1319
00:54:30.511 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just doing it.</v>

1320
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.333
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the did it without the </v>

1321
00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:36.810
<v Speaker 1>original production team and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original production team,</v>

1322
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.380
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1323
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.190
<v Speaker 1>they cut the budget substantially so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked kind of cheap.</v>

1324
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And then the Stents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warren is dangerous.</v>

1325
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Like the original production team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were wizards.</v>

1326
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:46.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were really good at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of show and they did 148 episodes </v>

1327
00:54:51.631 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 1>of the first season and then we came </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1328
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:56.220
<v Speaker 1>We did six more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a.</v>

1329
00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had just massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and putting together like the</v>

1330
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:03.210
<v Speaker 1>stunt people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stunt people,</v>

1331
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 1>beast on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where all the gross things,</v>

1332
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:05.873
<v Speaker 1>like all that stuff was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they didn't do any gross stuff </v>

1333
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 1>this time around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lawyers got involved.</v>

1334
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.040
<v Speaker 1>They probably now is corporate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lawyers will quietly,</v>

1335
00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:14.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they were like worried about </v>

1336
00:55:14.941 --> 00:55:17.100
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits in no matter what you signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still going to do.</v>

1337
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.133
<v Speaker 1>So the lawyer probably chopped lot lie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit out or they couldn't get </v>

1338
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:20.910
<v Speaker 1>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well with NBC,</v>

1339
00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the second interrail iteration of fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor and be like,</v>

1340
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:26.640
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 2012 or something like that.</v>

1341
00:55:26.641 --> 00:55:27.474
<v Speaker 1>And we did it again.</v>

1342
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Two Thousand Eleven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012 when we did it again.</v>

1343
00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 1>They were often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 11.</v>

1344
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.890
<v Speaker 1>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was off the deep end.</v>

1345
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they went way too far.</v>

1346
00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was dangerous.</v>

1347
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of the stuff they were doing,</v>

1348
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 1>we're like so much more intense than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we'd done before.</v>

1349
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking.</v>

1350
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:48.390
<v Speaker 1>We could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone could get hurt here.</v>

1351
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you not want to do it after that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A second season of the new iteration.</v>

1352
00:55:52.331 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And you said when do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1353
00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 1>they canceled it because people had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

1354
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:55.764
<v Speaker 1>Come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that should have automatically got </v>

1355
00:55:58.131 --> 00:56:01.470
<v Speaker 1>to the second season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what got to cancel.</v>

1356
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.320
<v Speaker 1>They play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They played horseshoes for donkey come.</v>

1357
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:05.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were throwing horseshoes and in no </v>

1358
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:08.484
<v Speaker 1>matter what you had to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some come like if you landed a perfect </v>

1359
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 1>ring toss and then you only had a drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a couple of ounces.</v>

1360
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.453
<v Speaker 1>But these drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these dudes were drinking beer steins </v>

1361
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:18.510
<v Speaker 1>have come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1362
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Why they can't with his complaints or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the network go.</v>

1363
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 1>They went too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm TMZ got</v>

1364
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.160
<v Speaker 2>ahold of footage and they put an NBC </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed on.</v>

1365
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1366
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:33.760
<v Speaker 2>they passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said okay to all these guns.</v>

1367
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

1368
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.793
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cleared all of the ridiculous </v>

1369
00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 2>stunts that they wanted to do and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the most ridiculous.</v>

1370
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Like getting people to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on television.</v>

1371
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:44.404
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's rough.</v>

1372
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

1373
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:46.083
<v Speaker 2>it's so over the top and that's the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that they couldn't have fear factor </v>

1374
00:56:49.121 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 2>the way they used to have it before they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to be.</v>

1375
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.570
<v Speaker 2>It had to be bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>badder,</v>

1376
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:57.190
<v Speaker 2>crazier a fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the second version of it was just</v>

1377
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 2>completely over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little too much and they pushed it too</v>

1378
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:01.690
<v Speaker 2>far and too gross people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1379
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:05.590
<v Speaker 2>They drank donkey pis and donkey come </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was twins.</v>

1380
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 2>So one twin had a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Pis,</v>

1381
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.520
<v Speaker 2>she's drinking piss and the other girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink come.</v>

1382
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mug a Mug of coffee.</v>

1383
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a great girlfriend.</v>

1384
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:19.240
<v Speaker 2>She must be though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking ace.</v>

1385
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:20.103
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the girls wanted a drink to </v>

1386
00:57:22.661 --> 00:57:25.650
<v Speaker 2>come rather than drink the pice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they have experienced with it.</v>

1387
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:25.941
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1388
00:57:25.941 --> 00:57:27.900
<v Speaker 2>the pisses a grocer thing come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1389
00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>

1390
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've drank it and that guy drank.</v>

1391
00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Come and look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're hugging.</v>

1392
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:33.340
<v Speaker 2>They've got on their shirts.</v>

1393
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It was deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1394
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.193
<v Speaker 2>There's only been two times ever in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of the show where I said to the </v>

1395
00:57:40.601 --> 00:57:41.434
<v Speaker 2>producers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1396
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 2>don't don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of them.</v>

1397
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:45.420
<v Speaker 2>You said they shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1398
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 2>it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too crazy.</v>

1399
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of calm.</v>

1400
00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 2>The shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come look at her,</v>

1401
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:51.330
<v Speaker 2>chugging it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1402
00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Amanda and chugging a town with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fucking stupid big head hovering over</v>

1403
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:57.880
<v Speaker 2>you telling you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were encouraging her to do anything.</v>

1404
00:57:58.610 --> 00:57:59.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1405
00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wanted her to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>

1406
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 2>I wanted them all to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the problem with doing that</v>

1407
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:06.400
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You liked them?</v>

1408
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1409
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean hopefully you wanted people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1410
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:10.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like a coach or a motivational </v>

1411
00:58:13.091 --> 00:58:15.640
<v Speaker 2>speaker as much as I was telling him you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it.</v>

1412
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Why did you get in their head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just tell them like,</v>

1413
00:58:17.741 --> 00:58:18.574
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just put one foot in front of the </v>

1414
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:23.110
<v Speaker 2>other and just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't entertain any thoughts of quitting</v>

1415
00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of quitting is just in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

1416
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:27.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of quitting is just your mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1417
00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:28.631
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do this,</v>

1418
00:58:28.631 --> 00:58:29.620
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should find a way out,</v>

1419
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:30.221
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

1420
00:58:30.221 --> 00:58:31.054
<v Speaker 2>This is just too uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you can just force yourself </v>

1421
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 2>to push those aside and don't entertain </v>
<v Speaker 2>those thoughts at all,</v>

1422
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:39.640
<v Speaker 2>you can get through a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get through.</v>

1423
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1424
00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:42.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the hard part is when you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling us.</v>

1425
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.353
<v Speaker 2>It's almost when people push themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember Matt Serra was actually </v>

1426
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:45.664
<v Speaker 2>talking about Ray Longo and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll push you past what you think you </v>

1427
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:50.530
<v Speaker 2>can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my problem is I'll stop,</v>

1428
00:58:50.531 --> 00:58:51.364
<v Speaker 2>but I think I have to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess there is this stuff in the </v>

1429
00:58:53.111 --> 00:58:53.944
<v Speaker 2>reserve tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just feels like there's nothing </v>

1430
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:57.220
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a mind set.</v>

1431
00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:02.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you get your mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to convincing your body,</v>

1432
00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 2>the enough is enough and then you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining those thoughts and thinking</v>

1433
00:59:06.521 --> 00:59:10.240
<v Speaker 2>of those thoughts more than thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about concentrating on the task at hand.</v>

1434
00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.620
<v Speaker 2>You start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

1435
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.633
<v Speaker 2>if I just quit now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can quit all this uncomfortable </v>

1436
00:59:15.221 --> 00:59:16.054
<v Speaker 2>feeling will stop all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A heaving of my breath or burning of my </v>

1437
00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:21.160
<v Speaker 2>legs or whatever it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1438
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.930
<v Speaker 2>That can all stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the nervousness can stop.</v>

1439
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Like you see a lot of times before </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

1440
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:28.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had several instances over the </v>

1441
00:59:30.111 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 2>course of the history of the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time it doesn't happen,</v>

1442
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:33.974
<v Speaker 2>but several incidents where people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety attacks and you could attribute </v>

1443
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 2>that to a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1444
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:40.071
<v Speaker 2>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1445
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:43.280
<v Speaker 2>some people just have anxiety and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is an anxiety attack?</v>

1446
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people believe that a lot of what's</v>

1447
00:59:45.771 --> 00:59:46.604
<v Speaker 2>happening is the mindset that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>entering into a fight with and that </v>

1448
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:56.260
<v Speaker 2>you're allowing your mind to just sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of run rampant rather than corralling it</v>

1449
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.963
<v Speaker 2>and channeling your mind into very </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct pathways like very distinct </v>

1450
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:04.244
<v Speaker 2>pathways of only beneficial thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will vacillate and deviate from </v>

1451
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:08.744
<v Speaker 2>those thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but always bring it back to those very </v>

1452
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 2>important thoughts and to have some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a mantra like you are here to do your</v>

1453
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 2>very best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1454
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:18.680
<v Speaker 2>And all thoughts of quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your body fails on you,</v>

1455
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.510
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let it fail.</v>

1456
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:21.523
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1457
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.510
<v Speaker 2>don't entertain those thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1458
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:24.950
<v Speaker 2>now it's time to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't quit,</v>

1459
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 2>don't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't entertain those thoughts.</v>

1460
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:30.710
<v Speaker 2>And there's a guy named David Goggins </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about on the podcast almost</v>

1461
01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:33.470
<v Speaker 2>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a very famous endurance athlete</v>

1462
01:00:33.471 --> 01:00:34.304
<v Speaker 2>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1463
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.870
<v Speaker 2>things navy seal and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1464
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:40.760
<v Speaker 2>has the world record for the most amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Chin ups in a day and you know,</v>

1465
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:42.620
<v Speaker 2>some insane amount.</v>

1466
01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.453
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing,</v>

1467
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.293
<v Speaker 2>he will do sets of five where he does </v>
<v Speaker 2>five Chin ups and he does them over the </v>

1468
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.820
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was over a thousand.</v>

1469
01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he does way more than it was 2000.</v>

1470
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:54.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way it doesn't burn his arms out </v>

1471
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.353
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how long they take taken between </v>

1472
01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:00.470
<v Speaker 2>fillon and it takes a little break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1473
01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:02.210
<v Speaker 2>do five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a little break,</v>

1474
01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 2>relax a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do another five,</v>

1475
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 2>take a little break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax a little bit back again.</v>

1476
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.573
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he attempted it more than once because </v>

1477
01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:11.610
<v Speaker 2>one time we did it as a forum tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousand and 12.</v>

1478
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.580
<v Speaker 2>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:14.683
<v Speaker 2>So that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his statements is most people </v>

1480
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.374
<v Speaker 2>quit it 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people quit at 40 percent of what </v>

1481
01:01:20.961 --> 01:01:22.130
<v Speaker 2>they're capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1482
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's absolutely accurate.</v>

1483
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1484
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1485
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I think about that all the time.</v>

1486
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I think about all the time when I'm on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard run,</v>

1487
01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.813
<v Speaker 2>you got to know when you're running like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hills and particularly got to know when </v>

1488
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.600
<v Speaker 2>you're just fucking exhausted and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>running the risk of falling down and you</v>

1489
01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:40.350
<v Speaker 2>really can't breathe right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

1490
01:01:40.351 --> 01:01:45.020
<v Speaker 2>you're really pushing it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly things like sprints or hill</v>

1491
01:01:45.021 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 2>sprints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will reach an aerobic threshold.</v>

1492
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 2>You'll reach a place where like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can't go any further.</v>

1493
01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heartbeat is 185 beats a minute.</v>

1494
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1495
01:01:54.171 --> 01:01:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1496
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you're blowing your shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1497
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like when is it failing and when are</v>

1498
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:00.584
<v Speaker 2>you quitting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's some uncomfortable </v>

1499
01:02:01.521 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 2>moments where my heart's like 150,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred 60,</v>

1500
01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:06.160
<v Speaker 2>where if I was feeling like a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1501
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>let me just take a break here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>breathe,</v>

1502
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what Bert Kreischer does.</v>

1503
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably has.</v>

1504
01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mental.</v>

1505
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.430
<v Speaker 2>So you think he's just quitting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1506
01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

1507
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:18.523
<v Speaker 2>Dot you though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you feel like your is telling </v>

1508
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 2>you like I'm on the treadmill,</v>

1509
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't do much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Ah,</v>

1510
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't do it.</v>

1511
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking boring too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like running outside.</v>

1512
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.003
<v Speaker 1>I don't like running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think running on a treadmill would be </v>

1513
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>great if you had a fucking awesome movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of you.</v>

1514
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.183
<v Speaker 1>Say if you were watching platoon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running on a treadmill and it's </v>

1515
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>right in front of you or apocalypse now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're listening to it.</v>

1516
01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can get into it,</v>

1517
01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:39.683
<v Speaker 1>but I like running outside because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where I'm going and it's part of </v>

1518
01:02:43.351 --> 01:02:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1519
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.323
<v Speaker 1>if I reached this peak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means it's a mild one point six </v>

1520
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>miles and then another one point six </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1521
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Can you run farther in real life or on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill?</v>

1522
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't run on treadmills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>

1523
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>But if you had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1524
01:02:56.111 --> 01:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>which one could you do a more on a trip?</v>

1525
01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1526
01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:59.720
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>

1527
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I run,</v>

1528
01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm running all hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't really run flat when I'm </v>

1529
01:03:05.821 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 1>running flats for very short periods of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1530
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>It's only flat in between hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1531
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate hills there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're terrible.</v>

1532
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:13.223
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kickbox box yesterday for the first </v>

1533
01:03:15.721 --> 01:03:19.290
<v Speaker 1>time in months I hadn't done any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any pad work,</v>

1534
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:20.640
<v Speaker 1>any bag work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

1535
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And I was going through rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was nothing.</v>

1536
01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.174
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was so different than cardio is </v>

1537
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.413
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my cardio's way better just from </v>

1538
01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:32.640
<v Speaker 1>running these hills because I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm committed to doing it twice a week.</v>

1539
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.253
<v Speaker 1>I try to do it three times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm committed to doing it twice a </v>

1540
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:37.860
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did it today and I did it Monday.</v>

1541
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take you to run the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hills and our,</v>

1542
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 1>my workouts and our.</v>

1543
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking brutal dude at the end of</v>

1544
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>last several pounds of water completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted and drained.</v>

1545
01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:49.763
<v Speaker 1>But when I do other stuff I have way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more endurance and I feel great after </v>

1546
01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:57.300
<v Speaker 1>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm so relaxed,</v>

1547
01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.640
<v Speaker 1>like after that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just feel so good.</v>

1548
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like regular life is not as,</v>

1549
01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just not as hard because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>running is so difficult.</v>

1550
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I should try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1551
01:04:09.121 --> 01:04:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate running so much but I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>so bored in the gym.</v>

1552
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 1>But you live in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still the park.</v>

1553
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this little place that you could</v>

1554
01:04:15.931 --> 01:04:17.910
<v Speaker 1>run them but you're not running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1555
01:04:17.911 --> 01:04:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you know what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's nothing.</v>

1556
01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.213
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean running is definitely a good </v>

1557
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:22.644
<v Speaker 1>thing as long as you're doing it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right way and running on the balls of </v>

1558
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>your feet and not on the heel and.</v>

1559
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>But try to take in yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1560
01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:29.604
<v Speaker 1>I like Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like women with Yoga bodies that </v>

1561
01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>fucking long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like long lean,</v>

1562
01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:34.014
<v Speaker 1>like thorax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sexy look at a walmart or acts </v>

1563
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just have like a,</v>

1564
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>like an insect body almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's long and Lincoln sex.</v>

1565
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.760
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you into bugs?</v>

1566
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.713
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the best way I can compare </v>

1567
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:45.510
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had bugs on me.</v>

1568
01:04:45.511 --> 01:04:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't care for them three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a book?</v>

1569
01:04:49.021 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Kutcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1570
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are crazy,</v>

1571
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:52.980
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

1572
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 1>they actually almost want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1573
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:55.760
<v Speaker 1>they do want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want it.</v>

1574
01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell people what we're talking about.</v>

1575
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Bug catchers are guys I've only heard of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being gay guy.</v>

1576
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.233
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the straight guys just do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll go out and fuck guys trying </v>

1577
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:08.220
<v Speaker 1>to catch HIV or let guys fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let guys fuck that.</v>

1578
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean like guys fuck them to catch HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they really,</v>

1580
01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1581
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally think it's because then the</v>

1582
01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>pressure is off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1583
01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>that's my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't comprehend it.</v>

1584
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Think it's a self hate thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe.</v>

1585
01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:20.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same reason why some </v>

1586
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>people want to amputate their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1587
01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>some people are just nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is kind of a nutty thing to do,</v>

1588
01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>to want to catch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1589
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>like why I don't even want it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I know that there's medicine</v>

1590
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>that stops it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were talking about this yesterday</v>

1591
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:34.683
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that,</v>

1592
01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>why do people like fisting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a show that your your past,</v>

1593
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>what everybody else is thinking of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore,</v>

1594
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>like I'll take a whole fist right up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the elbow.</v>

1595
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Some women's pussies are weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1596
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Like I gave the girl I dating a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You used to never get all of it and I </v>

1597
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>would get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have little hands too,</v>

1598
01:05:52.751 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get like the first four on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of my knuckle and that would be our</v>

1599
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:58.204
<v Speaker 1>dirty talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she would go crazy when I would </v>

1600
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:02.380
<v Speaker 1>talk to her and tell her that what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do is I'm gonna I'm gonna.</v>

1601
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna curl the thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I told I was in a curl,</v>

1602
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:06.640
<v Speaker 1>the thumbs she knew that the fist was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going in.</v>

1603
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.713
<v Speaker 1>She'd go fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I was just talking dirty </v>

1604
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.473
<v Speaker 1>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm going to curl the thumb </v>

1605
01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:12.243
<v Speaker 1>and she knew that mental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's putting his fucking fight but I </v>

1606
01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.850
<v Speaker 1>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It bitch.</v>

1607
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never get all of it is I got.</v>

1608
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I would get it in like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

1609
01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 1>like a praying mantis.</v>

1610
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you're poking like a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1611
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thumb is touching the floor,</v>

1612
01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:25.750
<v Speaker 1>curled fates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheating.</v>

1613
01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a cheating way to fifth somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1614
01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 1>My asshole has zero ability to take more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a finger.</v>

1615
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole fist.</v>

1616
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.553
<v Speaker 1>There's a video that Nick Swardson sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Whitney were talking about it </v>

1617
01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:38.490
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

1618
01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:41.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's holding a dude up,</v>

1619
01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 1>like in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1620
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sort of a backpack on the front,</v>

1621
01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys around him and he's got his </v>

1622
01:06:46.871 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>fist all the way up to the elbow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's ass and he just keeps pumping</v>

1623
01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:53.530
<v Speaker 1>it up in there and he's holding the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1624
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:54.750
<v Speaker 1>he's holding them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1625
01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.673
<v Speaker 1>he's got his arm wrapped around them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the other arm is just going in </v>

1626
01:06:58.001 --> 01:07:01.240
<v Speaker 1>their credit that both of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1627
01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Derek Pioneers for sure.</v>

1628
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.993
<v Speaker 1>That reminds me of holding up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching season two again of the </v>

1629
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fighter and there's one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they do like how long,</v>

1630
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:13.330
<v Speaker 1>how many rotations around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight can.</v>

1631
01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I think they were either a middleweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>or welterweight.</v>

1632
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Do were he climbs on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight.</v>

1633
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1634
01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.773
<v Speaker 1>and he was going around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many different times can you go </v>

1635
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 1>around this heavyweight body without </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching the ground?</v>

1636
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:26.163
<v Speaker 1>I figured 10:50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was fucking a hundred or 200 </v>

1637
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:34.080
<v Speaker 1>times the way around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to hold somebody else up.</v>

1638
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:35.463
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about something like that is </v>

1639
01:07:36.581 --> 01:07:37.414
<v Speaker 1>doing a contest like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta realize that person's blown </v>

1640
01:07:39.821 --> 01:07:40.654
<v Speaker 1>their body out for days after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's not something you're </v>

1641
01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to and you're doing on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily basis,</v>

1642
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 1>that's like doing a chin up contest like</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Goggins,</v>

1643
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.760
<v Speaker 1>like if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't plan on fighting.</v>

1644
01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:52.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is your arms are going to be blown </v>

1645
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:54.700
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1646
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>your legs are going to be blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1647
01:07:56.391 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a good skill to have,</v>

1648
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:00.543
<v Speaker 1>but doing something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do it one time to find out </v>

1649
01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:04.564
<v Speaker 1>what your Max is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't plan on recovering from that </v>

1650
01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:08.014
<v Speaker 1>anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about people in </v>

1651
01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:10.264
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the big problems with </v>

1652
01:08:11.831 --> 01:08:14.170
<v Speaker 1>injuries with MMA fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu people,</v>

1653
01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people is overtraining,</v>

1654
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.640
<v Speaker 2>meaning you're not prepared for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

1655
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.713
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Cam hands runs a marathon a </v>

1656
01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:24.890
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs a marathon every day.</v>

1657
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a buildup to that.</v>

1658
01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Does he really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1659
01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:28.174
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's training for this 238 Mile Moab a </v>

1660
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 2>race in October,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're running 238 miles,</v>

1661
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.370
<v Speaker 2>his ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets a marathon in every day,</v>

1662
01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:43.370
<v Speaker 2>so his body is just constantly used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of stress,</v>

1663
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:46.160
<v Speaker 2>but for him it's not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll run a marathon.</v>

1664
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you tried to run a marathon every</v>

1665
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:51.913
<v Speaker 2>day your body would break down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have some serious issues and the </v>

1666
01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:55.610
<v Speaker 2>first day I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1667
01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.310
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to do it.</v>

1668
01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.900
<v Speaker 2>It might be able to take you eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

1669
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:00.853
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to get through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to be fucked up for </v>

1670
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:03.644
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you built up to it slowly over </v>

1671
01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:10.430
<v Speaker 2>time you could develop the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscular endurance that allows you to do</v>

1672
01:09:10.431 --> 01:09:11.900
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get conditioned to it.</v>

1673
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.440
<v Speaker 2>So like doing something like that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing like these rotations around</v>

1674
01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:18.740
<v Speaker 2>someone or you're doing like how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times he climbed to the top of a 30 foot</v>

1675
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:19.574
<v Speaker 2>rope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1676
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:20.443
<v Speaker 2>someone's doing something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's not something you do all the </v>

1677
01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:25.940
<v Speaker 2>time and you just try to do it once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on a television show for,</v>

1678
01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 2>for funsies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1679
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.940
<v Speaker 2>You could fuck yourself up.</v>

1680
01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:32.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1681
01:09:32.011 --> 01:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying things along those </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

1682
01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're trying to do as many as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1683
01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.433
<v Speaker 1>anytime you're doing as many as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many bodyweight squats can you </v>

1684
01:09:40.411 --> 01:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 100,</v>

1685
01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:42.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1686
01:09:42.751 --> 01:09:44.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if you can get to $500.</v>

1687
01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Good luck walking for the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days if that's.</v>

1688
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.540
<v Speaker 1>If you try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a couple of.</v>

1689
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.473
<v Speaker 1>Is it now this guy does chin up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he do like the perfect military </v>

1690
01:09:52.381 --> 01:09:52.921
<v Speaker 1>ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

1691
01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:54.230
<v Speaker 1>If he's a navy seal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you lil boys.</v>

1692
01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Full Body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand up.</v>

1693
01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kipping Chin ups are kind of where</v>

1694
01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>they flop around like a fish are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use the ones where they go,</v>

1695
01:10:03.091 --> 01:10:03.924
<v Speaker 1>they lift up and then they go hire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they pull their full body </v>

1696
01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:09.780
<v Speaker 1>weight above the muscle up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

1697
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>You're just chin up and then you do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dip and then it's not.</v>

1698
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people think it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best functional exercise.</v>

1699
01:10:16.651 --> 01:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>They think it looks cool and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1700
01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:19.930
<v Speaker 1>but they don't believe it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a vest,</v>

1701
01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>functional exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guys that can do that,</v>

1702
01:10:22.171 --> 01:10:23.004
<v Speaker 1>so like I've always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at guys do that with these </v>

1703
01:10:24.151 --> 01:10:25.890
<v Speaker 1>guys that do these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>

1704
01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:26.963
<v Speaker 1>these guys are freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are outdoor guys where they work </v>

1705
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:32.640
<v Speaker 1>outdoors and they can just do an endless</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of things outdoors.</v>

1706
01:10:32.641 --> 01:10:35.110
<v Speaker 1>They can hold the bar sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1707
01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:35.963
<v Speaker 1>look at what this guy's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just doing like Chin ups and dips </v>

1708
01:10:39.091 --> 01:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>and sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

1709
01:10:41.731 --> 01:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>The upper body strength and control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1710
01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Not just the strength but like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>static control,</v>

1711
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.710
<v Speaker 1>these able to do like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's being blown into a </v>

1713
01:10:51.111 --> 01:10:51.931
<v Speaker 1>hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1714
01:10:51.931 --> 01:10:54.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do those really called </v>
<v Speaker 1>flag poles.</v>

1715
01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done that.</v>

1716
01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Why am I saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprising?</v>

1717
01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Of course I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy,</v>

1718
01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>but I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does,</v>

1719
01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:02.843
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys don't have that kind of </v>

1720
01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.140
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy is a.</v>

1721
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.170
<v Speaker 1>he's doing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dip to a handstand.</v>

1722
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that in between the two bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1723
01:11:11.971 --> 01:11:12.840

<v Speaker 1>they all wear,</v>

1724
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>which I find interesting.</v>

1725
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:17.010
<v Speaker 3>I guess they do that because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bars get sweaty.</v>

1726
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also don't want to slip and probably</v>

<v Speaker 3>flux your hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>when I worked out just to keep my hands.</v>

1733
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.990

<v Speaker 3>and give them a fist to shake the </v>

01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:40.700
<v Speaker 3>fucking worse.</v>

1737
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:43.763
<v Speaker 3>He's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hated shaking hands with people and </v>

1738
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.244
<v Speaker 3>he would go and watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember one time we were out to eat </v>

1739
01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:48.954
<v Speaker 3>and some guy he washed his hands on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy came over and shook his hand and </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's so funny that he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's such a pig on stage,</v>

1743
01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:59.530

<v Speaker 3>He likes fucking honey and his tea.</v>

1744
01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.710
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just a big Mama's boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes to be comforted.</v>

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.990
<v Speaker 3>He's an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very interesting guy.</v>

1746
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:04.824
<v Speaker 3>Dies and he's also in a lot of ways a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pioneer because he was one of the very </v>

01:15:31.951 --> 01:15:32.784
<v Speaker 2>That's dice at danger fields from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>special that that's when he did Rodney </v>

1829
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 2>dangerfield special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we toured with him.</v>

1830
01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was on Rodney Dangerfield,</v>

1831
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:43.660
<v Speaker 2>HBO special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how he broke.</v>

1832
01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:47.080
<v Speaker 2>And then he came back and did the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laughter died.</v>

1833
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.943
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think there's any pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clips out of Kenny was with him when he </v>

1834
01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:52.730
<v Speaker 2>did those.</v>

1835
01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:53.563
<v Speaker 2>Those cds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so jealous that he got to watch </v>

1836
01:15:55.091 --> 01:15:55.924
<v Speaker 2>those tapings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Kenny was like his bodyguard or </v>

1837
01:15:57.911 --> 01:15:58.530
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1838
01:15:58.530 --> 01:15:59.363
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't manager body guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first started the dice it was </v>

1839
01:16:01.421 --> 01:16:02.254
<v Speaker 2>like 1997 and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenny was the road manager and a body </v>

1840
01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.420
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that Rodney and Fabio?</v>

1841
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that and dice?</v>

1842
01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodney.</v>

1843
01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.790
<v Speaker 2>His wife would get mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1844
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Is that Rodney's wife or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that Fabio getting married?</v>

1845
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:16.563
<v Speaker 2>Someone's getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fabio can get married with a shirt open </v>

1846
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:19.024
<v Speaker 2>like that radius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that day the laughter died for </v>

1847
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy named Mike Donovan who's</v>

1848
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 2>a Boston comedy legend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hilarious,</v>

1849
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:28.054
<v Speaker 2>hilarious comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is the one who told me about the </v>

1850
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.420
<v Speaker 2>day the laughter died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't he?</v>

1851
01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:32.283
<v Speaker 2>We were in the back of the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection and he was just laughing </v>

1852
01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:36.670
<v Speaker 2>until he was crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about dice,</v>

1853
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.160
<v Speaker 2>do an impression of Nixon while he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

1854
01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll do Nixon in that ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me that book.</v>

1855
01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Fat fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1856
01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:53.170
<v Speaker 2>he was doing a Nixon impression while </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's eating as and for whatever reason,</v>

1857
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Mike Donovan thought it was the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I've ever heard in his life.</v>

1858
01:16:55.481 --> 01:16:58.090
<v Speaker 2>He's just cry and laugh and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a brilliant,</v>

1859
01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.880
<v Speaker 2>brilliant album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is Rick Rubin producers out there.</v>

1860
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For that album.</v>

1861
01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an odd masterpiece.</v>

1862
01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:05.341
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1863
01:17:05.341 --> 01:17:06.174
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful that he did that </v>

1864
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 2>because there is a flow to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like it's the greatest.</v>

1865
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.323
<v Speaker 3>Watching a comics mind just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>randomly bounce from joke to joke to </v>

1866
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:19.850
<v Speaker 3>bomb to joke and just really exploring </v>
<v Speaker 3>and grabbing for shit.</v>

1867
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no material preparation,</v>

1868
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:23.384
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell he's just totally ad </v>

1869
01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:30.420
<v Speaker 3>libbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1870
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:31.263
<v Speaker 3>That's the album cover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember getting it and listening to </v>

1871
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:36.530
<v Speaker 3>and being so close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that cassette one.</v>

1872
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people who didn't know I liked,</v>

1873
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:40.580
<v Speaker 3>there was also people who didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1874
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.380
<v Speaker 3>like this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

1875
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.633
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris rock is at the seller one night </v>

1876
01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:46.930
<v Speaker 3>and I forget how it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best comedy album ever.</v>

1877
01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:50.140
<v Speaker 3>One of them he said did after that I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to die by Angela,</v>

1878
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.073
<v Speaker 3>but that's also the best comedy album </v>
<v Speaker 3>for him because he's a comic and he </v>

1879
01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.220
<v Speaker 3>thinks it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy just went up there and just had</v>

1880
01:17:58.221 --> 01:18:02.360
<v Speaker 3>no fucking no preparation whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've laughed harder.</v>

1881
01:18:02.361 --> 01:18:03.194
<v Speaker 3>But your prior albums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I did it that there are better </v>

1882
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:07.250
<v Speaker 3>comedy record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as being a pure thing to show</v>

1883
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:09.440
<v Speaker 3>like what comics do sometimes to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff out.</v>

1884
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 3>He literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

1885
01:18:10.941 --> 01:18:11.631
<v Speaker 3>Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this game,</v>

1886
01:18:11.631 --> 01:18:13.100
<v Speaker 3>he was fucking 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99.</v>

1887
01:18:13.150 --> 01:18:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Probably sold a million copies of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1888
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a fucking 800,000</v>

1889
01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.293
<v Speaker 3>unhappy people.</v>

1890
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.410
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even call the day the laughter</v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

1891
01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:25.244
<v Speaker 3>He didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would go up sometimes and literally </v>

1892
01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:30.530
<v Speaker 3>like to see how long he could go without</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a laugh and clubs.</v>

1893
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:35.270
<v Speaker 3>He would just fuck around and see how </v>
<v Speaker 3>long he could go and not get a laugh.</v>

1894
01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.640
<v Speaker 3>My favorite is insult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dice.</v>

1895
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:39.590
<v Speaker 3>When you find someone in the audience </v>
<v Speaker 3>and go look,</v>

1896
01:18:39.591 --> 01:18:42.890
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look good to really cut your fucking</v>

1897
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:48.010
<v Speaker 3>hair digging on people and they wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know whether to laugh or be upset and it</v>

1898
01:18:50.331 --> 01:18:51.164
<v Speaker 3>would be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was almost angry at them for being </v>

1899
01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:53.984
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He described women's tits and he and he </v>

1900
01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:56.864
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at those big fat fucking mother </v>

1901
01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:02.270
<v Speaker 3>fucking fat fucking tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was really dirty,</v>

1902
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

1903
01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:06.350
<v Speaker 3>that's emotionally the best description </v>
<v Speaker 3>of tits.</v>

1904
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you feel though.</v>

1905
01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:13.730
<v Speaker 3>You can't get the words that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe the lust of big breasts,</v>

1906
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.390
<v Speaker 3>more than fat.</v>

1907
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:16.380
<v Speaker 3>Fucking motherfucking fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking it.</v>

1908
01:19:16.381 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>There was something so guttural about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1909
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:19.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the greatest description of tits.</v>

1910
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.580
<v Speaker 3>And nobody's ever given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as emotionally for a guy.</v>

1911
01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:23.533
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what dice did to that nobody </v>

1912
01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:28.190

<v Speaker 3>Has He created punchlines that everybody</v>

1913
01:19:28.191 --> 01:19:29.660
<v Speaker 3>wanted to repeat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1914
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:31.363
<v Speaker 3>Those wines are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People wanting to repeat what's in the </v>

1915
01:19:33.801 --> 01:19:34.634
<v Speaker 3>bowl bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he would point the microphone to </v>

1916
01:19:36.591 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 3>the audience and they knew the punchline</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would yell it out and cheer.</v>

1917
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on day left die.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>

1923
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Like Robin Williams did in the album </v>
<v Speaker 3>called a reality.</v>

1924
01:19:55.731 --> 01:19:56.564

1929
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't go.</v>

1930
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:12.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with dice,</v>

<v Speaker 1>most famous comic alive at the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>three night period.</v>

<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2000
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>like you talked to someone who lives in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a small town about a small town</v>

2001
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.903

01:23:11.921 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 3>and to stand up and takes pills to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting aids.</v>

2004
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a sigh of relief.</v>

2005
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

2006
01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.260
<v Speaker 3>one of the most nervous I've ever been </v>
<v Speaker 3>was when I took the,</v>

2007
01:23:21.261 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to digress for a second,</v>

2008
01:23:22.361 --> 01:23:23.194
<v Speaker 3>was to take the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so convinced that HIV and I </v>

2009
01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 3>fucking took this oral test that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>get from cvs.</v>

2010
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:30.603
<v Speaker 3>And there's a weird thing where you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>said it's up a good up until the last </v>

2011
01:23:33.671 --> 01:23:34.810
<v Speaker 3>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like in the high,</v>

2012
01:23:34.811 --> 01:23:36.730
<v Speaker 3>90 percent accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not One hundred percent,</v>

2013
01:23:36.731 --> 01:23:38.770
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good precursor to the bucket </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>

2014
01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:41.100
<v Speaker 3>So I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have to,</v>

2015
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.610
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2016
01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:42.443
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you rub it on your gums once each and </v>

2017
01:23:43.901 --> 01:23:45.130
<v Speaker 3>then you put it in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2018
01:23:45.131 --> 01:23:46.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this folding,</v>

2019
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 3>like almost like a trapper keeper.</v>

2020
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.393
<v Speaker 3>And you close it and they say what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens is there's a red line and if </v>

2021
01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 3>there's two red lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're positive,</v>

2022
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.020
<v Speaker 3>the one red line stays there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

2023
01:23:56.021 --> 01:24:00.000
<v Speaker 3>do not watch the progress because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>will freak you out.</v>

2024
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Don't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you watch it only for a second</v>

2025
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.353
<v Speaker 3>because I literally thought I saw the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of a second line and I </v>

2026
01:24:07.571 --> 01:24:10.540
<v Speaker 3>remember closing it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have HIV.</v>

2027
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

2028
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I remember where I went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It went down to the fucking store,</v>

2029
01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.620
<v Speaker 3>bought a couple of rx bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2030
01:24:17.621 --> 01:24:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to have a nice fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein bar and go back and 20 minutes,</v>

2031
01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:24.070
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't black I to photograph it.</v>

2032
01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.810
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe that I was negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I came back and it was clear I was,</v>

2033
01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I was a hundred percent convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 3>HIV was scary.</v>

2034
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:30.783
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm well anytime there's something like </v>

2035
01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:34.900
<v Speaker 3>that where you don't know if you have it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you do have it,</v>

2036
01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:35.734
<v Speaker 3>it's a death sentence or even it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even that thought was die because now </v>

2037
01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:39.820
<v Speaker 3>there's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is recent,</v>

2038
01:24:39.821 --> 01:24:40.654
<v Speaker 3>this is probably three months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many medications you can </v>

2039
01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:43.264
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the idea of having to tell a </v>

2040
01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:45.874
<v Speaker 3>partner and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to want to fuck you with </v>

2041

<v Speaker 3>that Matt Lauer,</v>

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.713
<v Speaker 3>tell them to zero where it's not visible</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they can knock it down to where </v>

2057
01:25:24.461 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 3>it's undetectable and I really do think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't pass it then because there are</v>

2058
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:30.250
<v Speaker 3>drugs that you won't be able to pass it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and prep.</v>

2059
01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:31.084
<v Speaker 3>We won't able to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still think you're obligated to </v>

2060
01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:33.620
<v Speaker 3>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2061
01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 3>you're obligated to say it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>let that person make the decision.</v>

2062
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2063
01:25:37.961 --> 01:25:38.310
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2064
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:41.000
<v Speaker 3>you can't make that decision for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2065
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:41.891
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2066
01:25:41.891 --> 01:25:42.724

<v Speaker 3>mean everyone's just having terrible </v>

2067
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:48.970
<v Speaker 3>judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2068
01:25:48.971 --> 01:25:49.804
<v Speaker 3>I imagine that was quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>naughty behavior in the residence times </v>

2069
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:54.820
<v Speaker 3>doing tremendous amounts of blow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2070
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:55.663
<v Speaker 3>Like they would talk about him doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>below that would kill a normal size </v>

<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

2078
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones called me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

2121

<v Speaker 1>Gary Busey wants to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he fucking.</v>

2122
01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:49.933
<v Speaker 1>Gary Busey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Gary Busey talked to me and he's </v>

2123
01:27:52.221 --> 01:27:52.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking lie.</v>

2125
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:56.323

<v Speaker 1>Gary Busey got in a motorcycle accident </v>

2126
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 1>with no helmet and caved his head in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like real bad.</v>

2127
01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:05.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why Gary Busey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at one eyes up here,</v>

2128
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.220
<v Speaker 1>he's got that Shannon Shannon Doherty </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing going on.</v>

2129
01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's down here when I was up there.</v>

2130
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:13.730
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's literal skull was </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed in a motorcycle accident.</v>

2131
01:28:13.731 --> 01:28:16.160
<v Speaker 1>He hit a fucking curb with his hedge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2132
01:28:18.570 --> 01:28:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And seeing that picture,</v>

2133
01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:23.060
<v Speaker 1>if his eyebrows are up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it look like he's okay.</v>

2134
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.940
<v Speaker 1>But I'm getting to the one on our right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His left is the one that drew.</v>

2135
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:29.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like is left as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>

2136
01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:29.864
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had him in a couple of times when </v>

2137
01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:31.840
<v Speaker 1>he came back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he remembered my.</v>

2138
01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's loopy,</v>

2139
01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.960
<v Speaker 1>but he's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>

2140
01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:37.431
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2141
01:28:37.431 --> 01:28:38.900
<v Speaker 1>he knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he wasn't.</v>

2142
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:41.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a little nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's always been a little nutty.</v>

2143
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:42.770
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He remembers lying.</v>

2144
01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.640
<v Speaker 1>He can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can act.</v>

2145
01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how his right eyebrows up?</v>

2146
01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2147
01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Eyes up and left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's down.</v>

2148
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a significant brain injury.</v>

2149
01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.100
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2151
01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that accident,</v>

2152
01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.120
<v Speaker 1>he was a pretty normal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has that injury.</v>

2153
01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:01.200
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking TB.</v>

2154
01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.730
<v Speaker 1>They already called Tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traumatic brain.</v>

2155
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.890
<v Speaker 1>That fucking wide open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at you again.</v>

2156
01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:06.780

2158
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:08.664
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe there's structural damage </v>

2159
01:29:10.741 --> 01:29:12.820
<v Speaker 1>to his actual skull itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm.</v>

2160
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive that he hit the curb</v>

2161
01:29:15.691 --> 01:29:16.524
<v Speaker 1>without a helmet is when la didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>helmet laws and he wiped out and curbed </v>

2162
01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 1>is fucking brain and was lucky to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

2163
01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:26.560

01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:41.340
<v Speaker 1>because that really does remind me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive safe.</v>

2171
01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't control everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I say guy burning to death in a</v>

2172
01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:46.620
<v Speaker 1>car or fucking cut in half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2173
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not his fault.</v>

2174
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went under a tractor trailer.</v>

2175
01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:52.620
<v Speaker 1>He was texting and driving and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like.</v>

2176
01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Don't fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really,</v>

2177
01:29:55.411 --> 01:29:58.590
<v Speaker 1>really cautious when I drive I by Les.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drove in your Porsche.</v>

2178
01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Last one we did if I can pay and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2179
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:02.730
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a responsible porsche driver.</v>

2180
01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't drive like an animal at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2181
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.903
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have pretty much around the </v>

2182
01:30:05.821 --> 01:30:06.780
<v Speaker 1>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little over.</v>

2183
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:08.400
<v Speaker 1>But you weren't a fucking maniac?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2184
01:30:08.401 --> 01:30:09.234
<v Speaker 1>I don't drive fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never drive fast with a friend </v>

2185
01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:11.580
<v Speaker 1>of the car either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2186
01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a dickhead driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally I've dickhead moments for </v>

2187
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.000
<v Speaker 1>when no one's around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

2188
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't put anybody else in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2189
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in driving like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2190
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:24.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a delightful Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not frightening at all.</v>

2191
01:30:24.241 --> 01:30:25.074
<v Speaker 1>It was comfortable with it.</v>

2192
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.330
<v Speaker 1>You get nervous when you got into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2193
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I've driven with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

2194
01:30:28.141 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 1>but if I didn't know you I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just having a porsche,</v>

2195
01:30:30.811 --> 01:30:31.644
<v Speaker 1>it's just known as somebody who's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move that car in particular because </v>

2196
01:30:34.411 --> 01:30:35.244
<v Speaker 1>it's so loud and so bouncy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you do a lot more to lose </v>

2197
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:39.920
<v Speaker 1>than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

2198
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I figured you'd be driving safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like,</v>

2199
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:44.610
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you don't want to drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the guy who has nothing.</v>

2200
01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Like how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I just lost my fucking house.</v>

2201
01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I ain't got no gig and these two red </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines getting the cat.</v>

2202
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:54.233
<v Speaker 1>I just put a new engine and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go with a guy who's got a </v>

2203
01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 1>little bit more to lose than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was safe.</v>

2204
01:30:58.741 --> 01:30:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2205
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:00.143
<v Speaker 1>Like those cars because they're light </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the responsive and so it's like </v>

2206
01:31:02.761 --> 01:31:03.594
<v Speaker 1>riding a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Disneyland ride everywhere you </v>

2207
01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:05.850
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

2208
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:07.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

2209
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fast have you ever gotten it to?</v>

2210
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I've never gotten it that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't drive that fast.</v>

2211
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2212
01:31:13.621 --> 01:31:14.454
<v Speaker 1>I like cornering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm into cars that grip and feel </v>

2213
01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:18.531
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>

2214
01:31:18.531 --> 01:31:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2215
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:21.320
<v Speaker 1>you're connected to the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BMW.</v>

2216
01:31:21.370 --> 01:31:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Drive like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumping.</v>

2217
01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.093
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.533
<v Speaker 1>I had one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wheel is a kind of stiff and they </v>

2219
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:27.444
<v Speaker 1>said that that's for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because high performance encrypts </v>

2220
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.951
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2221
01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:31.350
<v Speaker 1>they have a bunch of different settings </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could put on a bmw,</v>

2222
01:31:31.351 --> 01:31:33.300
<v Speaker 1>especially the m cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can make the,</v>

2223
01:31:33.301 --> 01:31:34.134
<v Speaker 1>you can vary the stiffnesses of the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steering because they're a electronic </v>

2224
01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.160
<v Speaker 1>power assist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2225
01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:40.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2226
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:43.020
<v Speaker 1>if you want a car that lists are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive.</v>

2227
01:31:43.021 --> 01:31:45.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a BMW.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have an m two.</v>

2228
01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:47.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a tiny little car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of their least,</v>

2229
01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.193
<v Speaker 1>least expensive m cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most enthusiastic it's their best </v>

2230
01:31:52.591 --> 01:31:52.920
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2231
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2232
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I've driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the XX.</v>

2234
01:31:55.261 --> 01:31:57.810

<v Speaker 1>I was leasing them.</v>

2235
01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 1>They were really big cars and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2236
01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:00.994
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of wanted a Mercedes or a lot </v>

2237
01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:03.094
<v Speaker 1>cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never driven over selling fucking </v>

2238
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Mercedes with cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a much cheaper,</v>

2239
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>much cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The BMW is just too big.</v>

2240
01:32:09.581 --> 01:32:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I live in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a car because I like to drive.</v>

2241
01:32:11.921 --> 01:32:13.750

<v Speaker 1>My addiction.</v>

2242
01:32:13.751 --> 01:32:14.584
<v Speaker 1>If I said I kept that because years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would ride around and look at fucking </v>

2243
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:18.460
<v Speaker 1>hookers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

2244
01:32:18.650 --> 01:32:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was why I did,</v>

2245
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:24.940
<v Speaker 1>but I might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've been doing that now.</v>

2246
01:32:24.941 --> 01:32:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm totally out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual cruising,</v>

2247
01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:29.640
<v Speaker 1>the pay pay and people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2248

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2249
01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:31.463
<v Speaker 1>I pay pal for dirty videos sometimes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies of girls who are doing things </v>

2250
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>just because you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just paying for sex.</v>

2251
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.680
<v Speaker 1>The sex trafficking shit just freaked me</v>
<v Speaker 1>out too much.</v>

2252
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

2253
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 1>It freaked me out too much and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for consensual,</v>

2254
01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:43.850
<v Speaker 1>like women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

2255
01:32:43.851 --> 01:32:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a woman once who was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

2256
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say she was an escort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had,</v>

2257
01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:54.670
<v Speaker 1>she had done porn and she stopped doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn and she said the way she said it,</v>

2258
01:32:54.671 --> 01:32:57.760
<v Speaker 1>she likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said she had clients and I was like,</v>

2259
01:32:57.761 --> 01:32:59.620
<v Speaker 1>well how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

2260
01:32:59.621 --> 01:33:00.454
<v Speaker 1>well off the record there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that I've had sex with in the past </v>

2261
01:33:04.991 --> 01:33:05.824
<v Speaker 1>and I liked them and they pay me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over there and it's almost like </v>

2262
01:33:09.191 --> 01:33:11.610
<v Speaker 1>people I really like and I have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and I said like,</v>

2263
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:12.880
<v Speaker 1>how many times a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2264
01:33:12.881 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I only need to do it a few times a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I pay my bills,</v>

2265
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls like that.</v>

2266
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.093
<v Speaker 1>After I stopped going on certain sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls like that who I knew it was </v>

2267
01:33:21.491 --> 01:33:22.990
<v Speaker 1>important me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I knew their lives,</v>

2268
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:26.350
<v Speaker 1>who they were under their real names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew their facebook,</v>

2269
01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.213
<v Speaker 1>like you know what a person's life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just choosing to do this on </v>

2270
01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:30.034
<v Speaker 1>the side because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a chemistry with them and they </v>

2271
01:33:31.211 --> 01:33:34.060
<v Speaker 1>like you and be they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are just dirty.</v>

2272
01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I've met plenty of just dirty and enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2273
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know her too well and I didn't </v>

2274
01:33:37.901 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 1>ask too many questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from what she was saying,</v>

2275
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:43.090
<v Speaker 1>it was essentially like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2276
01:33:43.091 --> 01:33:43.924
<v Speaker 1>she had done porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want to do porn anymore and </v>

2277
01:33:45.491 --> 01:33:47.800
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want to be just a quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote hooker,</v>

2278
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:53.010
<v Speaker 1>but she had a few guys that wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sex and would be willing to pay her</v>

2279
01:33:53.231 --> 01:33:54.064
<v Speaker 1>and I guess they apparently a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand bucks and she would just have </v>

2280
01:33:56.321 --> 01:33:58.030
<v Speaker 1>sex with these guys a couple times a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

2281
01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.610
<v Speaker 1>different guys and she'd make four or </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5,000</v>

2282
01:34:00.611 --> 01:34:02.770
<v Speaker 1>a week and she wouldn't have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about shit and she could do whatever she</v>

2283
01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:05.180
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do for as long as my body </v>
<v Speaker 1>holds up.</v>

2284
01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I talked to this quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago,</v>

2285
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I think she was probably like 36 or 37 </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

2286
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:13.960
<v Speaker 1>so it's like maybe she can't do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2287
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe now she's 46,</v>
<v Speaker 1>47 or 50 and maybe dudes will.</v>

2288
01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 1>How much they try to find an older sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>daddy,</v>

2289
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a guy that they've stayed.</v>

2290
01:34:21.761 --> 01:34:22.594
<v Speaker 1>That's where they start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably when they want to wife </v>

2291
01:34:23.261 --> 01:34:24.660
<v Speaker 1>up to like when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2292
01:34:24.850 --> 01:34:25.683
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard thing for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of men do not want to shack </v>

2293
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:31.750
<v Speaker 1>up with a chick that had sex for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2294
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want them doing it when I'm</v>

2295
01:34:33.761 --> 01:34:35.890
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like somebody with the past.</v>

2296
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.290
<v Speaker 1>I really need it because my past is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

2297
01:34:38.410 --> 01:34:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I much prefer yours as to what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this Jamie?</v>

2298
01:34:41.171 --> 01:34:44.710
<v Speaker 1>The Korean grandmothers or sell sex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you pull these up so quick?</v>

2299
01:34:45.230 --> 01:34:48.850
<v Speaker 1>What do you have on tab?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is wrong with you?</v>

2300
01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:49.953
<v Speaker 1>I saw this story the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember as a video about the </v>

2301
01:34:52.121 --> 01:34:53.680
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Baucus ladies,</v>

2302
01:34:53.681 --> 01:34:54.514
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's a drink called Baka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they walk around selling the baucus </v>

2303
01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 1>as an energy</v>

2304
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.053
<v Speaker 4>drink to a step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there were like 40 and 50 year old </v>

2305
01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:03.194
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now they're elderly women are doing </v>

2306
01:35:04.161 --> 01:35:04.994
<v Speaker 4>it too and so you buy the drink but </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're buying sex is what you're </v>

2307
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:09.170
<v Speaker 4>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it says.</v>

2308
01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:10.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand the way around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>loophole.</v>

2309
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:12.140
<v Speaker 4>A loophole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prostituted,</v>

2310
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.213
<v Speaker 4>you buy this drink and I'll give you sex</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like street vendors with energy </v>

2311
01:35:15.981 --> 01:35:17.720
<v Speaker 4>drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you buy it from them,</v>

2312
01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 4>you're really saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2313
01:35:18.711 --> 01:35:19.544
<v Speaker 4>come with me somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess where is this happening on </v>

2314
01:35:22.161 --> 01:35:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>South Korea.</v>

2315
01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:24.753
<v Speaker 4>Pretty smart work around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the guys by the energy drink knowing </v>

2316
01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 4>that they're gonna get some sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the video described.</v>

2317
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2318
01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.080
<v Speaker 3>technically is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

2319
01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I've known too many people I've known </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were like pseudo forced into it by a</v>

2320
01:35:38.731 --> 01:35:42.450
<v Speaker 3>boyfriend and one girl I was talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently was the industry like yeah,</v>

2321
01:35:42.451 --> 01:35:45.300
<v Speaker 3>my boyfriend had made me kind of do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she got wanted to at one point,</v>

2322
01:35:45.301 --> 01:35:47.940
<v Speaker 3>but then he hit me when I didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm asleep man.</v>

2323
01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:50.160
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know their story.</v>

2324
01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:52.350
<v Speaker 3>If I can guarantee there's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensual,</v>

2325
01:35:52.351 --> 01:35:54.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with it being legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

2326
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.373
<v Speaker 3>But it freaked me out that there was too</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people that I didn't know enough </v>

2327
01:35:57.721 --> 01:35:59.520
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I never go to places.</v>

2328
01:35:59.521 --> 01:36:00.354
<v Speaker 3>I never went to those places because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they felt too much like the Russian mob </v>

2329
01:36:02.041 --> 01:36:04.470
<v Speaker 3>or the Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was controlling them,</v>

2330
01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.660
<v Speaker 3>but then even people I thought I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2331
01:36:06.690 --> 01:36:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I can't guarantee it and I can't.</v>

2332
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:09.743
<v Speaker 3>Well that's very ethical of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you were thinking about them being </v>

2333
01:36:11.581 --> 01:36:12.414
<v Speaker 3>forced into that life over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just got to me because more like I </v>

2334
01:36:15.481 --> 01:36:17.820
<v Speaker 3>would talk to different people and at </v>
<v Speaker 3>first it was like,</v>

2335
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.721
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feminist.</v>

2336
01:36:18.721 --> 01:36:19.554
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're going to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there was certain people that </v>

2337
01:36:21.001 --> 01:36:22.620
<v Speaker 3>said certain things that someone just </v>
<v Speaker 3>says something.</v>

2338
01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.513
<v Speaker 3>See there's some feminists that think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's empowering for a woman to be able </v>

2339
01:36:27.751 --> 01:36:30.390
<v Speaker 3>to choose what to do with her body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2340
01:36:30.391 --> 01:36:31.224
<v Speaker 3>I know a woman who's a very smart woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when she was younger she had done </v>

2341
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:34.703
<v Speaker 3>and she's an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had done some sex work but it was </v>

2342
01:36:37.561 --> 01:36:41.700
<v Speaker 3>just like she fucked some guys for money</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like for her it was like easier than</v>

2343
01:36:41.701 --> 01:36:42.650
<v Speaker 3>working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:36:42.670 --> 01:36:44.610
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying I think it should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>legalized.</v>

2345
01:36:44.611 --> 01:36:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I think that people should be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2346
01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I just personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I was getting older and I'm like,</v>

2347
01:36:49.891 --> 01:36:52.180
<v Speaker 3>this is not what I want to do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think boring.</v>

2348
01:36:52.650 --> 01:36:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2349
01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:55.133
<v Speaker 3>it just anytime someone's being forced </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something and then there's </v>

2350
01:36:58.621 --> 01:36:59.454
<v Speaker 3>potential shame attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think there's anything </v>

2351
01:37:00.931 --> 01:37:02.550
<v Speaker 3>wrong with sex and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't either,</v>

2352
01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.840
<v Speaker 3>but when you attach the potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>societal shame aspect of it,</v>

2353
01:37:06.841 --> 01:37:07.674
<v Speaker 3>like your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your choices could shame you can be a </v>

2354
01:37:10.171 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 3>real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2355
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:12.630
<v Speaker 3>like the same thing with sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2356
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Like people having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Care?</v>

2357
01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Everybody have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd love sex people.</v>

2358
01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Most people love sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2359
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:19.703
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of you being caught on film</v>
<v Speaker 3>having sex is terrifying for a lot of </v>

2360
01:37:23.491 --> 01:37:25.560
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really weird.</v>

2361
01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:28.590
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we know you love sex,</v>

2362
01:37:28.591 --> 01:37:30.210
<v Speaker 3>but if we see you having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2363
01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 3>shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2364
01:37:31.461 --> 01:37:32.610
<v Speaker 3>it's a really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>

2365
01:37:32.611 --> 01:37:36.570
<v Speaker 3>because it's almost like this why I hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people break into these hard drives</v>

2366
01:37:36.571 --> 01:37:39.480
<v Speaker 3>in the cloud for these celebrities </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a weird privacy thing.</v>

2367
01:37:39.481 --> 01:37:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Like even if you're not doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to have.</v>

2368
01:37:41.491 --> 01:37:43.080
<v Speaker 3>You talked to your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talked to your girlfriend,</v>

2369
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:47.430
<v Speaker 3>who wants people hearing that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassing and it's private.</v>

2370
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2371
01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm very open about most things sexually</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my life,</v>

2372
01:37:51.450 --> 01:37:52.283
<v Speaker 3>but I still don't want people to read </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific things I've said because it </v>

2373
01:37:54.361 --> 01:37:56.140
<v Speaker 3>just feels like invasion of privacy</v>

2374
01:37:56.150 --> 01:38:00.480
<v Speaker 2>page and it's also like you didn't write</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for other people to hear and there's.</v>

2375
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:03.390
<v Speaker 2>There's things you say to your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2376
01:38:03.391 --> 01:38:05.430
<v Speaker 2>that if they took out of context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would go,</v>

2377
01:38:05.431 --> 01:38:07.920
<v Speaker 2>well Jim Norton's a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a piece of shit.</v>

2378
01:38:07.921 --> 01:38:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even in just like this thing that I</v>

2379
01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:15.951
<v Speaker 2>did with Ari sent him a text message </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I put it on instagram is Avi.</v>

2380
01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I thought it pretty obvious that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in jest,</v>

2381
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:19.703
<v Speaker 2>but so many people thought it was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the context of your friendship and </v>

2382
01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 2>people who don't understand they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you.</v>

2383
01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>

2384
01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:28.163
<v Speaker 2>Like the way we talk to each other on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular basis is so different than the </v>

2385
01:38:31.111 --> 01:38:31.944
<v Speaker 2>way a lot of folks can because if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working in an office job nine to five </v>

2386
01:38:36.571 --> 01:38:39.730
<v Speaker 2>every day you're controlled by human </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources and the the,</v>

2387
01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the office standards of behavior.</v>

2388
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.793
<v Speaker 2>You have to follow some sort of a firing</v>
<v Speaker 2>guidelines of what's term to what you </v>

2389
01:38:48.331 --> 01:38:49.164
<v Speaker 2>can get terminated for those people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the edge and tiptoeing on fucking </v>

2390
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 2>broken glass every day.</v>

2391
01:38:55.570 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 3>It's scary and you know is Sirius Xm is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a corporate environment and I'm fucking.</v>

2392
01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking dirty comic and I'm more </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful around the women there than half</v>

2393
01:39:05.261 --> 01:39:06.920
<v Speaker 3>of the fucking newscasters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear about getting.</v>

2394
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like if I know that as a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>dirt bag,</v>

2395
01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 3>you don't fucking hit on the women at </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2396
01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Ask them gently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did we talk about now okay and fuck off.</v>

2397
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Well not even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these guys weren't just doing that.</v>

2398
01:39:18.801 --> 01:39:20.890
<v Speaker 2>They were sexually harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2399
01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.940
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they were hitting on him.</v>

2400
01:39:22.941 --> 01:39:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>office environments are just Whitney.</v>

2401
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Cummings is a very funny joke about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2402
01:39:27.231 --> 01:39:28.064
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say it because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of her new bits about working </v>

2403
01:39:29.961 --> 01:39:30.794
<v Speaker 2>in an office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much sexual tension when </v>

2404
01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:34.934
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck in a room with people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours a day and if two people are </v>

2405
01:39:37.611 --> 01:39:40.580
<v Speaker 2>attracted to each other and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>working side by side on a daily basis,</v>

2406
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:41.623
<v Speaker 2>occasionally they test the waters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say fucked up things and then saying </v>

2407
01:39:44.151 --> 01:39:44.984
<v Speaker 2>those fucked up things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are allowed to do whatever they </v>

2408
01:39:45.921 --> 01:39:47.990
<v Speaker 2>want essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really hard.</v>

2409
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.370
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard for her to get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2410
01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean a woman says something dirty you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny,</v>

2411
01:39:51.651 --> 01:39:53.870
<v Speaker 2>but if a guy says something unwanted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty,</v>

2412
01:39:53.871 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 2>it's really disgusting because why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2413
01:39:56.091 --> 01:39:56.924
<v Speaker 2>because men rape in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more dangerous and they're </v>

2414
01:39:58.551 --> 01:39:59.680
<v Speaker 2>scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2415
01:39:59.690 --> 01:40:00.523
<v Speaker 2>they're physically more scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a guy intruding on a woman's space </v>

2416
01:40:04.191 --> 01:40:05.024
<v Speaker 2>and saying creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unwanted sexual shit has an air of </v>

2417
01:40:07.641 --> 01:40:11.180
<v Speaker 2>danger to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if a girl is saying some creepy,</v>

2418
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:13.460
<v Speaker 2>unwanted sexual shit to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go,</v>

2419
01:40:13.461 --> 01:40:14.480
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

2420
01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't say don't talk to them.</v>

2421
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Like precursor to her making you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2422
01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:21.640
<v Speaker 2>It's never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to grab my head,</v>

2423
01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.170
<v Speaker 2>forced me to eat her pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2424
01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Great thought though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't being made to do it.</v>

2425
01:40:25.751 --> 01:40:30.050
<v Speaker 3>That's one of my greatest being made to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be made.</v>

2426
01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Stick your tongue up further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sniff it.</v>

2427

<v Speaker 3>You ever have someone do that?</v>

2429
01:40:42.610 --> 01:40:44.380
<v Speaker 3>I'd have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all right.</v>

2430
01:40:44.650 --> 01:40:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Not Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that.</v>

2431
01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a girl and I didn't go.</v>

2432
01:40:47.621 --> 01:40:48.454
<v Speaker 3>And did I tell you this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's trying to push a fart out and she </v>

<v Speaker 3>mate is sexually compatible with them </v>

2507
01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:37.450
<v Speaker 3>gets hindered by the birth control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fucks it up.</v>

2508
01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:40.510
<v Speaker 3>But when they have women that are not on</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth control pills,</v>

2509
01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:41.493
<v Speaker 3>they can literally smell a man's clothes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and find out whether or not they're </v>

2510
01:43:44.441 --> 01:43:47.410
<v Speaker 3>sexually compatible with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just whether or not they're attracted to</v>

2511
01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:48.253
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a literally a specific </v>

2512
01:43:50.051 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 3>scent and that sent</v>

2513
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.030
<v Speaker 2>they think is not just like whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not you're sexually attracted to someone</v>

2514
01:43:56.031 --> 01:43:56.864
<v Speaker 2>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whether or not you're biologically </v>

2515
01:43:58.221 --> 01:43:59.054
<v Speaker 2>compatible with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do you remember back in the day </v>

2516
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:04.520
<v Speaker 2>when people would get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do blood tests to see if they</v>

2517
01:44:04.521 --> 01:44:06.640
<v Speaker 2>could have kids remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2518
01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:08.780
<v Speaker 2>There was a thing that they used to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2519
01:44:08.781 --> 01:44:12.230
<v Speaker 2>like people would have tests to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if,</v>

2520
01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was legitimately scientifically </v>

2521
01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:14.954
<v Speaker 2>valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would have tests like a blood </v>

2522
01:44:16.521 --> 01:44:20.720
<v Speaker 2>test and I remember people talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this when I was in high school like that</v>

2523
01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:21.554
<v Speaker 2>married people would have go and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these blood tests to see if they could </v>

2524
01:44:24.621 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not pregnancy.</v>

2525
01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:26.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2526
01:44:26.601 --> 01:44:27.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not pregnancy,</v>

2527
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:28.663
<v Speaker 2>but whether or not they were compatible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as like raising healthy </v>

2528
01:44:33.171 --> 01:44:34.940
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some weird.</v>

2529
01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might've been some bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake science that they tried to pass off</v>

2530
01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:41.414
<v Speaker 2>back in the seventies and the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I distinctly remember people </v>

2531
01:44:44.571 --> 01:44:45.404
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

2532
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:49.910
<v Speaker 2>This is like before I was anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood typing compatibility.</v>

2533
01:44:49.911 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blood types of categorized by a,</v>

2534
01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:53.084
<v Speaker 2>B and o.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're reading something here and given </v>

2535
01:44:55.101 --> 01:44:59.950
<v Speaker 2>the rh factor of positive or negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abo and rh in compatibility happens when</v>

2536
01:44:59.951 --> 01:45:03.440
<v Speaker 2>a mother's blood type conflicts with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that of a newborn child.</v>

2537
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:04.423
<v Speaker 2>It's possible for the mothers red blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells to cross into the placenta or </v>

2538
01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 2>fetus during pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2539
01:45:10.281 --> 01:45:11.114
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm incompatibilities between a mother </v>

2540
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:13.184
<v Speaker 2>and a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's between a man and a woman </v>

2541
01:45:15.801 --> 01:45:19.430
<v Speaker 2>and the way they have theirs is probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>

2542
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.520
<v Speaker 2>but it was something that people used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a lot.</v>

2543
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:23.383
<v Speaker 2>I remember people talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember people talking about it when </v>

2544
01:45:26.181 --> 01:45:28.760
<v Speaker 2>I had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very limited understanding of biology,</v>

2545
01:45:28.761 --> 01:45:31.340
<v Speaker 2>so I was probably in high school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even before that,</v>

2546
01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:33.170
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what blood tests?</v>

2547
01:45:33.171 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 2>They have to take a blood test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2548
01:45:34.551 --> 01:45:36.620
<v Speaker 2>what if you love somebody and you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get married to them?</v>

2549
01:45:36.621 --> 01:45:38.930
<v Speaker 2>You find out that you take a blood test </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't work out.</v>

2550
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.823
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work?</v>

2551
01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the worker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's such a nature thing.</v>

2552
01:45:42.101 --> 01:45:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe if it's not meant to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can still work.</v>

2553
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.941
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2554
01:45:45.941 --> 01:45:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Nature may work on this fucking base </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

2555
01:45:48.031 --> 01:45:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still going to work,</v>

2556
01:45:49.091 --> 01:45:50.710
<v Speaker 3>but that's like letting you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will work.</v>

2557
01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:51.611
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what I mean?</v>

2558
01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:53.920
<v Speaker 3>It may still work fine if you're sent is</v>
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>

2559
01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.690
<v Speaker 3>but they're closed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thing makes sense.</v>

2560
01:45:55.691 --> 01:45:58.810
<v Speaker 3>There was a girl I had come over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would come over and mood fuck around</v>

2561
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.823
<v Speaker 3>and she wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her underarms with smell and it made me </v>

2562
01:46:01.151 --> 01:46:02.320
<v Speaker 3>fucking bonkers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2563
01:46:02.321 --> 01:46:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I was so attracted to her since she left</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jacket in my house,</v>

2564
01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:09.100
<v Speaker 3>the fucking armpit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smelled the armpits for six months.</v>

2565
01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.630
<v Speaker 3>You're so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dude.</v>

2566
01:46:13.631 --> 01:46:18.631
<v Speaker 3>I fucking sniffed the armpit and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy who's into toys or clothing.</v>

2567
01:46:19.781 --> 01:46:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Like as far as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't usually want their panties.</v>

2568
01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm the girl I'm seeing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do though.</v>

2569
01:46:24.610 --> 01:46:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I do want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to figure out a way for her</v>

2570
01:46:26.861 --> 01:46:27.694
<v Speaker 3>to fedex overnight and your panties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never asked to go do that my life </v>

2571
01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.740
<v Speaker 3>ever tell her to put them in a Ziploc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2572
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.760
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2573
01:46:33.761 --> 01:46:35.560
<v Speaker 3>That was number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want me to tell him to tape the zip lock</v>

2574
01:46:35.561 --> 01:46:36.940
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't open up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2575
01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:39.460
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's really ultra rare that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually want that.</v>

2576
01:46:39.730 --> 01:46:42.330
<v Speaker 3>But this girl's jacket hung in my closet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I fucking smelled.</v>

2577
01:46:42.331 --> 01:46:45.040
<v Speaker 3>That drove me crazy for months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having Deja Vu.</v>

2578
01:46:45.370 --> 01:46:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Losing today's</v>

2579
01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>parents says that you should be getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood tests for screening because</v>

2580
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 4>they can find out if they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have potential blood diseases and stuff.</v>

2581
01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2582
01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.460
<v Speaker 4>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today's parent is at a website.</v>

2583
01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:57.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's that knows?</v>

2584
01:46:57.571 --> 01:46:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Is that a common practice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>

2585
01:46:59.881 --> 01:47:00.600
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2586
01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:01.433
<v Speaker 4>this was like an article that says test </v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be getting before pregnancy </v>

2587
01:47:03.991 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 4>and there's like a pre pregnancy checkup</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the man and the woman,</v>

2588
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:08.334
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Prenatal vaccinations and then sexually </v>

2589
01:47:09.421 --> 01:47:10.254
<v Speaker 4>transmitted diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to check for it to end genetic </v>

2590
01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:12.864
<v Speaker 4>screening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says so they just do like probably </v>

2591
01:47:13.641 --> 01:47:16.180
<v Speaker 4>overall blood tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting.</v>

2592
01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.900
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you don't hear about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2593
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:19.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2594
01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't hear about that from doctors.</v>

2595
01:47:22.341 --> 01:47:24.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear about that when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were trying to get pregnant.</v>

2596
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:26.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear about that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>newlyweds.</v>

2597
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Just don't hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blood tests.</v>

2598
01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like getting blood tests to make sure </v>

2599
01:47:30.171 --> 01:47:31.004
<v Speaker 2>that your kids would be healthy or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder now though if there's so much </v>

2600
01:47:33.201 --> 01:47:34.034
<v Speaker 2>stress put on disease shit like aids the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day we still say get a blood test and </v>

2601
01:47:37.461 --> 01:47:39.440
<v Speaker 2>get tested and all this stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>handled,</v>

2602
01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:40.483
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we just don't talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other aspect of it because the big one </v>

2603
01:47:42.621 --> 01:47:44.540
<v Speaker 2>is HIV or whatever or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2604
01:47:44.541 --> 01:47:45.374
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get you had to check to see what </v>

2605
01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:49.640
<v Speaker 2>diseases you're family has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe we're still talking about it,</v>

2606
01:47:49.641 --> 01:47:51.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's just not being phrased the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2607
01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:52.213
<v Speaker 2>This is why I don't think it's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we went to a very good doctor </v>

2608
01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:55.980
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2609
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:57.103
<v Speaker 2>I have kids.</v>

2610
01:47:57.470 --> 01:48:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I never took a fucking test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shot loads in there and made kids.</v>

2611
01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:03.310
<v Speaker 2>He just alluded to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just don't.</v>

2612
01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I dunno.</v>

2613
01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.053
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno about the science of all that </v>

2614
01:48:09.411 --> 01:48:11.300
<v Speaker 2>stuff and I just don't know why it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>never discussed,</v>

2615
01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 2>but I do remember being a kid where that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a big deal like that a parent,</v>

2616
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:16.863
<v Speaker 2>these two parents would get a blood test</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they got married and make sure </v>

2617
01:48:19.071 --> 01:48:21.530
<v Speaker 2>they could have kids and it just never </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear about that shit anymore.</v>

2618
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:22.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember hearing about it </v>

2619
01:48:23.541 --> 01:48:25.460
<v Speaker 2>back then to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does make sense.</v>

2620
01:48:25.461 --> 01:48:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2621
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.923
<v Speaker 2>let's just see if there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if there's an obvious problem that </v>

2622
01:48:29.061 --> 01:48:29.894
<v Speaker 2>will show up through the blood test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how fucking weird is it that you </v>

2623
01:48:31.761 --> 01:48:33.380
<v Speaker 2>could have a different kind of blood in </v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

2624
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Like your blood might be a in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be,</v>

2625
01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your blood is in my body.</v>

2626
01:48:38.481 --> 01:48:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2627
01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I got to keep my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even compatible.</v>

2628
01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:42.923
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we vary so much biologically </v>

2629
01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:50.360
<v Speaker 2>that we have different kinds of blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one is not good in the other.</v>

2630
01:48:50.410 --> 01:48:51.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some bloods that are </v>

2631
01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:56.150
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's o positive is a universal</v>

2632
01:48:56.151 --> 01:48:58.460
<v Speaker 2>blood donor and anyone can take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2633
01:48:58.760 --> 01:48:59.593
<v Speaker 2>that's what I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that my blood can go into </v>

2634
01:49:02.511 --> 01:49:05.420
<v Speaker 2>other people's body and it's okay to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out if that's true.</v>

2635
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:07.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably should know.</v>

2636
01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably 50.</v>

2637
01:49:09.190 --> 01:49:10.011
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that someone is comfortable,</v>

2672
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:41.130
<v Speaker 1>like someone is comfortable in their own</v>

2677
01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:52.534

<v Speaker 1>more normal thing to be and then just a </v>

2678

<v Speaker 1>healthier thing without needing bells </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whistles and fucking juggling and,</v>

2679
01:50:59.421 --> 01:51:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to see a woman with perfect features</v>

2680
01:51:02.411 --> 01:51:05.110
<v Speaker 1>and she's cold and she's not friendly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nice.</v>

2681

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:08.590

<v Speaker 1>like way less,</v>

2683
01:51:08.591 --> 01:51:09.424
<v Speaker 1>like classically attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's very affectionate and very </v>

2684
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.890
<v Speaker 1>kind and sweet and fun to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that very attractive.</v>

2685
01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:19.720
<v Speaker 1>That will vary from person to person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go with kind and sweet or I can go</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is it how you're choosing to address all</v>

2701

<v Speaker 1>of your issues and that you can escape </v>
<v Speaker 1>them with like really like crazy </v>

<v Speaker 1>talk and freaky behavior.</v>

2704
01:52:08.290 --> 01:52:10.330
<v Speaker 1>You can escape those because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>naughty.</v>

2705
01:52:10.570 --> 01:52:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It's so off the [inaudible] you're not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal guy.</v>

2706
01:52:13.211 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But none of us are.</v>

2707
01:52:14.441 --> 01:52:17.230
<v Speaker 1>If we're working in show business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a standup comedian,</v>

2708
01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:18.064
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting paid to talk crazy shit </v>

2710
01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:24.140
<v Speaker 1>your world is in normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wake up whenever the fuck you want,</v>

2711
01:52:24.141 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 1>unless you have to do a radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2712
01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:28.450

<v Speaker 1>The whole world you live in is different</v>

2713
01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.553
<v Speaker 1>and then you have all this kinky shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get added addictions to </v>

2714
01:52:32.351 --> 01:52:33.184
<v Speaker 1>dirty stuff and so like whatever it is </v>

2719
01:52:45.681 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Just for</v>

2720
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:49.280
<v Speaker 2>a brief moment with all this insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

2721
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:52.230
<v Speaker 3>It could be that and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I wonder like with.</v>

2722
01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:53.213
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like if you eat too much ice</v>
<v Speaker 3>cream is diabetes that will come with </v>

2723
01:52:55.351 --> 01:52:57.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be the diabetes,</v>

2724
01:52:57.121 --> 01:52:57.954
<v Speaker 3>like just too much access and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden instead of three to make this </v>

2725
01:53:01.651 --> 01:53:02.790
<v Speaker 3>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes 11.</v>

2726
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:03.833
<v Speaker 3>It's just it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get the same effect from the </v>

2727
01:53:05.701 --> 01:53:07.680
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was growing up,</v>

2728
01:53:07.681 --> 01:53:09.840
<v Speaker 3>I loved lesbian porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love to girls.</v>

2729
01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:14.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>When I was on news radio,</v>

2734
01:53:18.181 --> 01:53:20.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys who was a writer on news</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio is a very nice guy,</v>

2735
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:22.633
<v Speaker 2>but he was a nebbishy sort of fellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had problems with women and he was </v>

2736
01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:29.334
<v Speaker 2>a writer on news radio and in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>moonlight time you used a pseudonym and </v>

2744
01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.810
<v Speaker 2>lesbian porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was her thing.</v>

2745
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on the set and it was just so,</v>

2746
01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:03.310
<v Speaker 2>like clinical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2747
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.900
<v Speaker 2>like it was weird like they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were doing the scene.</v>

2748
01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:07.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's her.</v>

2749
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:08.663

01:54:09.931 --> 01:54:11.430
<v Speaker 2>cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful,</v>

2751
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:12.520
<v Speaker 2>beautiful woman.</v>

2753
01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:18.030
<v Speaker 2>she's got this scene as lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was like a cartoon character</v>

2754
01:54:18.031 --> 01:54:20.100
<v Speaker 2>that came back to life or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous shit.</v>

2755
01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what she looks like now?</v>

2756
01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but is that like a spa?</v>

2758
01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a mug shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She went to jail.</v>

2759
01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I forget what she went to jail for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2760
01:54:34.590 --> 01:54:35.423
<v Speaker 2>not good.</v>

2761
01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things go south,</v>

2762
01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:39.843
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we were talking about </v>

2763
01:54:39.991 --> 01:54:40.824
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these gals that get a little </v>

2764
01:54:41.701 --> 01:54:44.760
<v Speaker 2>older and all the pressure of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forbidden behavior,</v>

2765
01:54:44.761 --> 01:54:45.594
<v Speaker 2>just the societal pressure and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that lead them to be that way in </v>

2766
01:54:49.681 --> 01:54:51.510
<v Speaker 2>the first place come crashing down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2767
01:54:51.810 --> 01:54:54.570
<v Speaker 2>But for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this scene like there,</v>

2768
01:54:54.690 --> 01:54:55.523
<v Speaker 2>the two of them were on a bed and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were eating each other's pussies and </v>

2769
01:54:58.111 --> 01:54:59.190
<v Speaker 2>there was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2770
01:54:59.370 --> 01:55:02.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a sound guy with the fuzzy mic</v>

2771
01:55:02.431 --> 01:55:04.290
<v Speaker 2>that's on a stick that has hovered over </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2772
01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:05.363
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another guy that was over there doing </v>

2773
01:55:06.841 --> 01:55:08.790
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was literally eating a sandwich where</v>

2774
01:55:08.791 --> 01:55:09.624
<v Speaker 2>these girls are eating pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he was so disinterested and </v>

2775
01:55:12.211 --> 01:55:13.044
<v Speaker 2>then there was a director and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were kind of aware that we were there </v>

2776
01:55:16.891 --> 01:55:17.724
<v Speaker 2>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she was sort of putting on this sort </v>

2777
01:55:19.741 --> 01:55:23.550
<v Speaker 2>of self conscious show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an in between takes.</v>

2778
01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:24.840
<v Speaker 2>They would like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

2779
01:55:24.841 --> 01:55:25.411
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>

2780
01:55:25.411 --> 01:55:26.244
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep eating her pussy and she would say </v>

2781
01:55:27.391 --> 01:55:29.010
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love my job,</v>

2782
01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:30.053
<v Speaker 2>I love my job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like convincing herself that </v>

2783
01:55:32.971 --> 01:55:36.090
<v Speaker 2>she loved her job and it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>super bummed me out.</v>

2784
01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been on a bunch of those sets and </v>

2785
01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:38.973
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's different energy depending </v>

2786
01:55:40.381 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 3>on the set like I've been on when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hosted the award show the end with Jenna</v>

2787
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Jamison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got to one,</v>

2788
01:55:45.161 --> 01:55:47.130
<v Speaker 3>one of her sets and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually was doing a lesbian scene.</v>

2789
01:55:47.131 --> 01:55:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Her husband at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay,</v>

2790
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.660
<v Speaker 3>I guess was directing it and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking set.</v>

2791
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:53.850
<v Speaker 3>There was a wardrobe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was craft,</v>

2792
01:55:53.851 --> 01:55:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was a set.</v>

2793
01:55:55.170 --> 01:55:57.120
<v Speaker 3>It was a high end sheet at the craft </v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

2794
01:55:57.170 --> 01:55:57.731
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

01:55:57.731 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah know I thought I just hot dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tacos,</v>

2796
01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I think I just watched her eat pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2797
01:56:06.961 --> 01:56:07.794
<v Speaker 3>this is Jenna Jamison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is the biggest ever in this </v>

2798
01:56:09.811 --> 01:56:11.580
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to watch this happen.</v>

2799
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.863
<v Speaker 3>And then we went on another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw another one another day where it </v>

2800
01:56:15.061 --> 01:56:20.061
<v Speaker 3>was like a lower budget average budget </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was two guys and a girl and the</v>

2801
01:56:20.131 --> 01:56:22.260
<v Speaker 3>girl was in between the two guys and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the director was gone,</v>

2802
01:56:22.261 --> 01:56:23.930
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me a little bit more,</v>

2803
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more of that.</v>

2804
01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:26.033
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2805
01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:26.893
<v Speaker 3>they're amazing people that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>function sexually under those </v>

2806
01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:31.410
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally unsexy.</v>

2807
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:34.800
<v Speaker 3>The sexiest one I saw was like a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>low budget,</v>

2808
01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:35.634
<v Speaker 3>like a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one guy with a light and one guy </v>

2809
01:56:36.961 --> 01:56:41.670
<v Speaker 3>holding a camera and a couple and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were like a couple who real amateur.</v>

2810
01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.600
<v Speaker 3>And so it felt more like sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2811
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:47.220
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think the guy could get hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a little while.</v>

2812
01:56:47.221 --> 01:56:49.620
<v Speaker 3>He struggled a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were real people.</v>

2813
01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:53.040
<v Speaker 3>That was the hottest one because it felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closest to real sex.</v>

2814
01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like minor and one girl would blow me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could never come from her.</v>

2820
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:09.650
<v Speaker 3>She could head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like,</v>

2821
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:12.330
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

01:57:55.930 --> 01:57:58.410
<v Speaker 3>He loves directing because he likes what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing.</v>

2848
01:57:58.680 --> 01:57:59.513
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time I did the tonight show </v>

2849
01:58:00.570 --> 01:58:01.403
<v Speaker 3>was in like September of 2004 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I watched it at Joey's house </v>

2850
01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.790
<v Speaker 3>downstairs and I've seen so much porn </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot in that house.</v>

2851
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.863
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and brandon irons was upstairs with his </v>

2852
01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:11.880
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

2853
01:58:11.881 --> 01:58:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Brandon irons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his throat fucker.</v>

2854
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.333
<v Speaker 3>Like he's the guy look up brands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland someday that guy will teach a </v>

2855
01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Canadian dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's in Canada now.</v>

2856
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:23.850
<v Speaker 3>He will fucking rip a throat apart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not my thing,</v>

2857
01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:26.040
<v Speaker 3>but I think I asked him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you ever get your Dick Bitten?</v>

2858
01:58:26.041 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Like it just seemed like such a hard way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have sex and I don't like,</v>

2859
01:58:29.011 --> 01:58:30.890
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know what I mean,</v>

2860
01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:31.743
<v Speaker 3>like spanking or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't like to feel like I'm </v>

2861
01:58:33.811 --> 01:58:34.644
<v Speaker 3>missing somebody.</v>

2862
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:38.910
<v Speaker 3>That's just not my energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also problem is like if you get hard,</v>

2863
01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:39.744
<v Speaker 3>if that's exciting on film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like is that exciting to you in regular </v>

2864
01:58:43.001 --> 01:58:43.834
<v Speaker 3>life or is this just like an act that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're putting on and film and like how </v>

2865
01:58:46.091 --> 01:58:46.924
<v Speaker 3>do you like how sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does it translate or can you do </v>

2866
01:58:49.601 --> 01:58:50.350
<v Speaker 3>both?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2867
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:53.050
<v Speaker 3>He might be a guy who just can get his </v>
<v Speaker 3>dick hard anywhere.</v>

2868
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Like Nacho vidal could literally fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>during a house fire.</v>

2869
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:59.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those guys that nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>matters to him.</v>

2870
01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:01.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rocco Suffredini,</v>

2871
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:04.540
<v Speaker 3>these guys or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a Manuel Ferrara like these guys.</v>

2872
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:05.703
<v Speaker 3>The men impressed me more than the women</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because they have to keep their </v>

2873
01:59:07.271 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 3>dick hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2874
01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:10.384
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the newer guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't really watch as much with </v>

2875
01:59:11.771 --> 01:59:12.604
<v Speaker 3>big names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that these guys can </v>

2876
01:59:13.811 --> 01:59:17.620
<v Speaker 3>function under these conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas my dick is very,</v>

2877
01:59:17.621 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 3>very susceptible to having an issue.</v>

2878
01:59:19.930 --> 01:59:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Preval Agora.</v>

2879
01:59:21.490 --> 01:59:23.200
<v Speaker 3>There were real superstars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2880
01:59:23.230 --> 01:59:24.063
<v Speaker 3>There were real guys who were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>freaks and now there's like chemically </v>

2881
01:59:26.291 --> 01:59:27.124
<v Speaker 3>enhanced superstars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even with Viagara have lost heart </v>

2882
01:59:28.901 --> 01:59:30.910
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I haven't taken salice in over</v>

2883
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:31.740
<v Speaker 3>a month I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it's been three,</v>

2884
01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.573
<v Speaker 3>actually three or four months now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stopped because my dick was </v>

2885
01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:35.710
<v Speaker 3>horrible without it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2886
01:59:35.711 --> 01:59:36.544
<v Speaker 3>I can't even with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like my dick was kind of half </v>

2887
01:59:38.381 --> 01:59:40.780
<v Speaker 3>mast and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're training your body wrong.</v>

2888
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 3>So I stopped taking you to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone to give you that advice.</v>

2889
01:59:44.190 --> 01:59:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to stop taking it,</v>

2890
01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just knew,</v>

2891
01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:47.373
<v Speaker 3>I knew myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was taking it the wrong time and I </v>

2892
01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:51.100
<v Speaker 3>wasn't even horny and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you need one,</v>

2893
01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 3>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't been sold.</v>

2894
01:59:52.361 --> 01:59:54.010
<v Speaker 3>So you were relying on its </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological?</v>

2895
01:59:54.011 --> 01:59:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2896
01:59:55.151 --> 01:59:55.750
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

2897
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought there might be a chance </v>
<v Speaker 3>that night I'd pop one alice,</v>

2898
01:59:59.410 --> 02:00:00.243
<v Speaker 3>go to the seller and hope for the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>was too optimistic sitting there with a </v>

2899
02:00:05.021 --> 02:00:05.830
<v Speaker 3>boner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2900
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it would make you feel great,</v>

2901
02:00:07.451 --> 02:00:08.900
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2902
02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:10.090
<v Speaker 3>I kept taking him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't need.</v>

2903
02:00:10.091 --> 02:00:10.924
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a genius thing that nature has </v>

2904
02:00:13.181 --> 02:00:14.014
<v Speaker 3>done to make it so that there's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different factors that keep you </v>

2905
02:00:16.781 --> 02:00:18.010
<v Speaker 3>from getting direct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2906
02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Nervousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>

2907
02:00:19.751 --> 02:00:20.584
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes sense because you really </v>

2908
02:00:23.051 --> 02:00:24.570
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be concentrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2909
02:00:24.590 --> 02:00:25.423
<v Speaker 3>because for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a human male sex is so </v>

2910
02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:32.230
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmingly interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2911
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:33.303
<v Speaker 3>That you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could get it up in the face of </v>

2912
02:00:35.681 --> 02:00:36.514
<v Speaker 3>danger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would probably be terrible for your </v>

2913
02:00:38.621 --> 02:00:40.090
<v Speaker 3>survival mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2914
02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.133
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you read a book called the midnight </v>

2915
02:00:42.341 --> 02:00:43.620
<v Speaker 3>of Garden in the middle of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2916
02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:46.540
<v Speaker 3>the good with the midnight in the garden</v>
<v Speaker 3>of evil.</v>

2917
02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:49.480
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Kevin Spacey was in the film,</v>

2918
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:52.540
<v Speaker 3>good and evil in the bid night gardener.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm fucking up.</v>

2919
02:00:53.050 --> 02:00:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Midnight in the garden of good and evil.</v>

2920
02:00:55.690 --> 02:00:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never read that in the garden of Eden.</v>

2921
02:00:57.880 --> 02:00:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I read the member of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2922
02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one thing in the book,</v>

2923
02:01:01.391 --> 02:01:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I remember years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2924
02:01:03.370 --> 02:01:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Something happened and the guy's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girl and like somebody came,</v>

2925
02:01:07.930 --> 02:01:08.763
<v Speaker 3>they will fucking outdoors and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad guy who was coming with a gun or </v>

2926
02:01:11.201 --> 02:01:12.034
<v Speaker 3>something and she said what she </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembered is that like they couldn't </v>

2927
02:01:14.141 --> 02:01:15.370
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was like,</v>

2928
02:01:15.371 --> 02:01:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I remember he stayed hard while he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside me and he kept his erection.</v>

2929
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if it's fiction or </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonfiction.</v>

2930
02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Something tells me it was nonfiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could just be hoping.</v>

2931
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always envied guys like that,</v>

2932
02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:28.290
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2935
02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:31.970

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2936
02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:34.450
<v Speaker 3>I ended up health necessarily totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

2937
02:01:34.451 --> 02:01:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're really healthy.</v>

2938
02:01:35.971 --> 02:01:37.390
<v Speaker 3>It'd be thinking about your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>survival.</v>

2939
02:01:37.391 --> 02:01:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Someone's got a gun to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2942
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.350
<v Speaker 2>just in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't right,</v>

2943
02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:42.373
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the way you are or the way </v>

<v Speaker 2>And we connected and it feels right.</v>

2946
02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Like those guys I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I envy.</v>

2947
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Are you ever completely comfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you ever like relaxed.</v>

2948
02:01:53.301 --> 02:01:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Where you look totally no peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

2949
02:01:56.121 --> 02:01:57.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought of that recently,</v>

2950
02:01:57.561 --> 02:01:59.840
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not comfortable around my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

2951
02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I love my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm comfortable around them but am other</v>

2952
02:02:04.851 --> 02:02:05.684
<v Speaker 2>times I'm really comfortable yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes on the radio when we're going </v>

2953
02:02:08.511 --> 02:02:09.344
<v Speaker 2>back and they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's no time to think when </v>

2954
02:02:10.351 --> 02:02:11.184
<v Speaker 2>there's like fucking six or seven comics</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and you're just being animals </v>

2955
02:02:13.371 --> 02:02:14.204
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's moving and punching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitting on each other and we're very </v>

2956
02:02:16.701 --> 02:02:17.534
<v Speaker 2>comfortable because there's no time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflect or think you just kind of doing </v>

2957
02:02:21.291 --> 02:02:22.250
<v Speaker 2>what you do comfortably.</v>

2958
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that environment I'm,</v>

2959
02:02:24.331 --> 02:02:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2960
02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:25.803
<v Speaker 2>I realized that after like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like just really alive and great </v>

2961
02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:34.280
<v Speaker 2>in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the moment is exactly at flowing in a</v>

2962
02:02:34.281 --> 02:02:36.350
<v Speaker 2>flow state doing something and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

2963
02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:38.900
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm thinking I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 2>worrying about this,</v>

2964
02:02:38.901 --> 02:02:39.734
<v Speaker 2>who the fucks me up and sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know I'm not comfortable too </v>

2965
02:02:43.371 --> 02:02:45.300
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2966
02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:48.380
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried to be?</v>

2967
02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>

2968
02:02:50.090 --> 02:02:50.923
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it's all shame based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to think if I talk about </v>

2969
02:02:53.031 --> 02:02:55.540
<v Speaker 2>things that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2970
02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:56.413
<v Speaker 2>but if it doesn't it look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it hasn't helped to the point where </v>

2971
02:02:57.801 --> 02:03:01.070
<v Speaker 2>you're never comfortable now at 49,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2972
02:03:01.130 --> 02:03:01.963
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whatever this pattern is that you </v>

2973
02:03:03.201 --> 02:03:04.820
<v Speaker 2>followed your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2974
02:03:05.090 --> 02:03:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Might not be the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2975
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing.</v>

2976
02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2977
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:11.270
<v Speaker 2>but that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

2978
02:03:11.271 --> 02:03:14.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I'm never comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure,</v>

2979
02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:15.073
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why I'm asking is asking you </v>

2980
02:03:16.311 --> 02:03:17.144
<v Speaker 2>about yoga and that's what I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask you about meditation to just a </v>

2981
02:03:19.551 --> 02:03:20.384
<v Speaker 2>wonder like maybe you can train your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind to relax when it comes to certain </v>

2982
02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:28.490
<v Speaker 2>things or train your mind to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertained so many neurotic thoughts or</v>

2983
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:29.623
<v Speaker 2>train your mind to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive things and eventually build </v>

2984
02:03:32.391 --> 02:03:34.220
<v Speaker 2>that up the same way you build up </v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance.</v>

2985
02:03:34.221 --> 02:03:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Like for like we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys doing that exercise.</v>

2986
02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:37.913
<v Speaker 2>We're circling a persons body like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>burn yourself out unless you did it all </v>

2987
02:03:40.431 --> 02:03:41.264
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like my friend Cam will runs a </v>

2988
02:03:42.291 --> 02:03:44.180
<v Speaker 2>marathon a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's used to it.</v>

2989
02:03:44.181 --> 02:03:45.014
<v Speaker 2>He does it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you can do that also with </v>

2990
02:03:47.631 --> 02:03:48.410
<v Speaker 2>your point of view.</v>

2991
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you can do that also with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mindfulness,</v>

2992
02:03:51.021 --> 02:03:51.854
<v Speaker 2>with just thinking about the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself around you that you could maybe </v>

2993
02:03:54.621 --> 02:03:58.280
<v Speaker 2>not entertain those same thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these neurotic thoughts.</v>

2994
02:03:58.760 --> 02:03:59.593
<v Speaker 2>Maybe those thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's akin to like an endurance </v>

2995
02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:05.430
<v Speaker 2>racer giving in to the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

2996
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:08.030
<v Speaker 2>discomfort and modern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just quit now.</v>

2997
02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe there's the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2998
02:04:10.061 --> 02:04:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe these are mental patterns </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can sort of stray away from.</v>

2999
02:04:14.571 --> 02:04:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Keep your mind on a positive track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3000
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:18.103
<v Speaker 2>come up with some sort of like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good ways of thinking about things </v>

3001
02:04:21.141 --> 02:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>because you're obviously a very smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and you're in your,</v>

3002
02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:25.880
<v Speaker 2>you're obviously a very sensitive guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think a lot,</v>

3003
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:27.163
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you let that thinking and that </v>

3004
02:04:28.671 --> 02:04:31.590
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity sort of run a muck without </v>
<v Speaker 2>any control,</v>

3005
02:04:31.591 --> 02:04:34.040
<v Speaker 2>without any discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be the issue.</v>

3006
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:35.053
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had those issues myself in the </v>

3007
02:04:36.021 --> 02:04:36.854
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why I bring </v>

3008
02:04:37.621 --> 02:04:39.150
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not,</v>

3009
02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:40.313
<v Speaker 2>I'm way healthier now at this point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life than I've ever been before </v>

3010
02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:44.753
<v Speaker 2>because of really worked at it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked at being at peace and being calm </v>

3011
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:49.614
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also I've worked at all the </v>

3012
02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:52.763
<v Speaker 2>extraneous sort of influences that fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that and to sort of eliminate them </v>

3013
02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:03.330
<v Speaker 2>and then do use exercise sort of as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug in a lot of ways.</v>

3014
02:05:03.331 --> 02:05:04.164
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why exercise so much </v>

3015
02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 2>is because if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a looks thing.</v>

3016
02:05:10.110 --> 02:05:13.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a mind thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I don't strain myself,</v>

3017
02:05:13.471 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 2>if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't do something really difficult</v>

3018
02:05:15.331 --> 02:05:16.164
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day I do something five days a </v>

3019
02:05:18.631 --> 02:05:20.390
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it everyday.</v>

3020
02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I have days where I take off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I take more than one day off,</v>

3021
02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:25.290
<v Speaker 2>my body starts going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>

3022
02:05:25.291 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you have a dog that you</v>

3023
02:05:27.421 --> 02:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>don't walk your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3024
02:05:29.770 --> 02:05:30.603
<v Speaker 2>I know that when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why one of the reasons why I </v>

3025
02:05:32.101 --> 02:05:32.934
<v Speaker 2>thought about it way back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my dog would be so much calmer </v>

3026
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:36.780
<v Speaker 2>if I went and played with them for a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

3027
02:05:36.781 --> 02:05:40.050
<v Speaker 2>so if I took her for a walk and threw </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ball and he ran around,</v>

3028
02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.670
<v Speaker 2>he be chill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I did,</v>

3029
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:42.570
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

3030
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:43.404
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3031
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:44.790
<v Speaker 2>do I have a neurotic dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3032
02:05:44.791 --> 02:05:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I have a dog that doesn't get any </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

3033
02:05:46.291 --> 02:05:47.124
<v Speaker 2>He has physical requirements for him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be content and I think people have </v>

3034
02:05:50.431 --> 02:05:52.680
<v Speaker 2>physical requirements for them to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>content too,</v>

3035
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:53.753
<v Speaker 2>but I think unlike people or unlike dogs</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather people can go on these sort of </v>

3036
02:05:57.750 --> 02:06:02.550
<v Speaker 2>downward mental spirals of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of self hate,</v>

3037
02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:06.060
<v Speaker 2>of self analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a neurosis,</v>

3038
02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:08.560
<v Speaker 2>neurotic thinking of you.</v>

3039
02:06:08.590 --> 02:06:12.930
<v Speaker 2>You can get yourself in these really bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of like shitting on yourself or</v>

3040
02:06:12.931 --> 02:06:15.180
<v Speaker 2>looking at yourself in a negative way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3041
02:06:15.181 --> 02:06:16.014
<v Speaker 2>and I think you tend to gravitate </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards these negative things sometimes </v>

3042
02:06:19.921 --> 02:06:22.560
<v Speaker 2>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize it and then you bounce back.</v>

3043
02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:25.230
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is causing you to gravitate towards</v>

3044
02:06:25.231 --> 02:06:28.920
<v Speaker 2>them and why can you never achieve it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a few moments,</v>

3045
02:06:28.921 --> 02:06:30.750
<v Speaker 2>like an hour or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just chill.</v>

3046
02:06:30.751 --> 02:06:35.580
<v Speaker 2>We could just sit at home and just read </v>
<v Speaker 2>a book and have a cup of tea and just.</v>

3047
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever feel like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you just comfortable and relax?</v>

3048
02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Watch a movie on Netflix and chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always restless if you tell it.</v>

3049
02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:44.153
<v Speaker 2>The mental patterns and changing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical stuff is what I gotta do first </v>

3050
02:06:47.071 --> 02:06:48.480
<v Speaker 2>they bring the body and the mind will </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>

3051
02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:51.090
<v Speaker 2>So I have to stop doing certain things.</v>

3052
02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:52.043
<v Speaker 2>And this thing of not cheating on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl is it [inaudible] I've not cheated </v>

3053
02:06:56.101 --> 02:06:56.934
<v Speaker 2>on girls before when they were here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's not here yet and we're still </v>

3054
02:06:59.941 --> 02:07:00.774
<v Speaker 2>in a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me to not it it's miraculous </v>

3055
02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:06.360
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had a fight recently and I almost</v>

3056
02:07:06.361 --> 02:07:08.250
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started fucking tech and I'm like,</v>

3057
02:07:08.251 --> 02:07:10.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see what you do.</v>

3058
02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Sabotage things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you're so um,</v>

3059
02:07:14.890 --> 02:07:16.650
<v Speaker 2>and I've been going kind of up and down </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>

3060
02:07:16.651 --> 02:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>But it's like whenever you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you,</v>

3061
02:07:18.690 --> 02:07:20.820
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while for you to adjust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go like,</v>

3062
02:07:20.850 --> 02:07:21.683
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you feel something now you've got </v>

3063
02:07:22.971 --> 02:07:24.240
<v Speaker 2>to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't feel it.</v>

3064
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:27.240
<v Speaker 2>And then run and go on eroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever go to a therapist?</v>

3065
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>

3066
02:07:28.561 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 2>many others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One I went to,</v>

3067
02:07:30.421 --> 02:07:32.520
<v Speaker 2>she was very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once I started getting familiar with</v>

3068
02:07:32.521 --> 02:07:33.660
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3069
02:07:33.661 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 2>there was one time I forget why I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucking</v>

3070
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:39.220
<v Speaker 3>suicidal and I called her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like calling a therapist.</v>

3071
02:07:39.221 --> 02:07:42.100
<v Speaker 3>It was a bad day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was talking to her.</v>

3072
02:07:42.110 --> 02:07:43.870
<v Speaker 3>What triggered it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3073
02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:46.400
<v Speaker 3>it's usually the same stuff around </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling like a failure.</v>

3074
02:07:46.401 --> 02:07:49.390
<v Speaker 3>It just the same shit that everybody has</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same feeling like I'm worthless.</v>

3075
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:51.570
<v Speaker 3>So I talked to her and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3076
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:52.503
<v Speaker 3>she was being nice but she was not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful and I didn't want her to rescue </v>

3077
02:07:55.781 --> 02:07:56.614
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder just simply to give some </v>

3078
02:07:57.671 --> 02:08:00.910
<v Speaker 3>kind of an answer or trigger me to ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself a question.</v>

3079
02:08:00.970 --> 02:08:03.040
<v Speaker 3>As a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they trigger you to go,</v>

3080
02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:04.900
<v Speaker 3>why am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my fucking.</v>

3081
02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:06.840
<v Speaker 3>That's what their job is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nonsense.</v>

3082
02:08:07.050 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just not very good at it.</v>

3083
02:08:09.150 --> 02:08:10.290
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

3084
02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:11.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3085
02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:13.540
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3086
02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Let's just kind of empathizing a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

3087
02:08:16.211 --> 02:08:17.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't need you to fucking empathize </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>

3088
02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:22.570
<v Speaker 3>I just need you to just give me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggestion on something.</v>

3089
02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Don't just be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where we're at.</v>

3090
02:08:25.930 --> 02:08:27.280
<v Speaker 3>All right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll see you next week.</v>

3091
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:29.140
<v Speaker 3>You really might not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3092
02:08:29.141 --> 02:08:30.110
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that to her because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3093
02:08:30.111 --> 02:08:30.731
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3094
02:08:30.731 --> 02:08:32.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fucking emo girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just was like,</v>

3095
02:08:32.591 --> 02:08:33.424
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3096
02:08:33.670 --> 02:08:34.503
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I can't be in a </v>

3097
02:08:35.411 --> 02:08:37.840
<v Speaker 3>therapist therapy with her anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3098
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:39.760
<v Speaker 3>I think therapists are probably a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>like comics,</v>

3099
02:08:39.761 --> 02:08:40.594
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's really good ones and there's </v>

3100
02:08:41.011 --> 02:08:41.844
<v Speaker 3>really bad ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ones that some people think are really </v>

3101
02:08:43.631 --> 02:08:45.760
<v Speaker 3>good and you might think suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3102
02:08:45.761 --> 02:08:47.340
<v Speaker 3>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gotten yours.</v>

3103
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3104
02:08:49.001 --> 02:08:50.920
<v Speaker 3>I feel better now than I have in a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

3105
02:08:50.921 --> 02:08:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm happy now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

3106
02:08:52.330 --> 02:08:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked up lately because I'm kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through this huge change,</v>

3107
02:08:56.110 --> 02:08:58.750
<v Speaker 3>but other than that I feel better than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have in a long time.</v>

3108
02:08:58.870 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Like life is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

3109
02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I love the radio show I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have fun with Sam.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But character,</v>

3115
02:09:16.130 --> 02:09:18.040
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people love it.</v>

3116
02:09:18.190 --> 02:09:19.023
<v Speaker 3>Like the podcast they're going to hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>this week because we did it in La and </v>

<v Speaker 3>was very ugly experience last week.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This uh,</v>

3119
02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Maria Menounos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his boyfriend,</v>

3120
02:09:28.391 --> 02:09:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Undergaro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he runs this place.</v>

3121
02:09:30.461 --> 02:09:32.890
<v Speaker 3>They do all these after show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a huge chip fan.</v>

3122
02:09:33.250 --> 02:09:33.701
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

02:09:33.701 --> 02:09:34.534
<v Speaker 3>while you're out here you can use my </v>
<v Speaker 3>studio because I have a podcast because </v>

<v Speaker 3>I can't teach.</v>

3125
02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a different hair every week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't look.</v>

3126
02:09:41.950 --> 02:09:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I can't look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking humiliating.</v>

3127
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I love the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make me do it.</v>

3128
02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.240
<v Speaker 3>A different wig on every week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every week.</v>

3129
02:09:49.241 --> 02:09:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The glasses,</v>

3130
02:09:50.050 --> 02:09:52.430
<v Speaker 3>those are glasses that Colin Quinn gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>me to fuck.</v>

3131
02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:55.390
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so awful.</v>

3132
02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:57.453
<v Speaker 3>But the last one we released as a live </v>
<v Speaker 3>one and it's the people we was an hour </v>

3133
02:09:59.981 --> 02:10:00.814
<v Speaker 3>and 20 minutes long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did it the village underground and </v>

3134
02:10:03.041 --> 02:10:05.500
<v Speaker 3>it's sold out faster than anything I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>sold in years.</v>

3135
02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:12.670
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking ridiculous character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what it is.</v>

3136
02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:14.530
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was a fun shy at Collin,</v>

3137
02:10:14.531 --> 02:10:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Anthony fucking Sam was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3139
02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:22.750
<v Speaker 3>and it was just so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people I think is,</v>

3140
02:10:22.751 --> 02:10:26.170
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like everybody's greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear is to be that on aware.</v>

3141
02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why do people like this?</v>

3142
02:10:28.391 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Because the joke stink if fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible jokes.</v>

3143
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:36.350
<v Speaker 3>And they said with conviction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she always has people around him who</v>

3144
02:10:36.351 --> 02:10:40.730
<v Speaker 3>know him doing it this week in La was me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Sam and x park was on,</v>

3145
02:10:40.731 --> 02:10:41.564

<v Speaker 3>But he knows me as the wrestler who </v>

3146
02:10:43.851 --> 02:10:46.300
<v Speaker 3>fucked China in the porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was extra.</v>

3147
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:48.200
<v Speaker 3>There's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3148
02:10:48.201 --> 02:10:49.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>means more than a guy who fuck China,</v>

3149
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.090
<v Speaker 3>but that's using the reference people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

3150
02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he knows Jim,</v>

3151
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.871
<v Speaker 3>so he's like,</v>

3152
02:10:53.871 --> 02:10:56.000

<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't know what to do.</v>

3153
02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:57.313
<v Speaker 3>And these fucking four girls that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>no idea because Kevin wanted it to be a </v>

3154
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:04.330
<v Speaker 3>train wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking fucking Kevin Underdog.</v>

3155
02:11:04.610 --> 02:11:07.310
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to be a train wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had these girls.</v>

3156
02:11:07.311 --> 02:11:08.380
<v Speaker 3>He didn't tell him a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go here,</v>

3157
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Jim Warren's going to be there to huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast from New York.</v>

3158
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.863
<v Speaker 3>So I fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're trying to go with it and </v>

3159
02:11:13.311 --> 02:11:16.610
<v Speaker 3>chip just an abrasive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what to do.</v>

3160
02:11:16.611 --> 02:11:21.200
<v Speaker 3>I was the only time I've ever been </v>
<v Speaker 3>humiliated doing chip.</v>

3161
02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I was embarrassed and uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also like,</v>

3162
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:26.383
<v Speaker 3>this is what it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy stinks when you supposed to be </v>

3163
02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:33.900
<v Speaker 3>disliked because people were in on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke,</v>

3164
02:11:33.901 --> 02:11:35.030
<v Speaker 3>loved the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3165
02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:37.430
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get that the jokes are awful.</v>

3166
02:11:37.431 --> 02:11:39.740
<v Speaker 3>So the fun point with people who love it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to,</v>

3167
02:11:39.741 --> 02:11:40.574
<v Speaker 3>at times give one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my ex girlfriend really new chip </v>

3168
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:44.840
<v Speaker 3>and there was times I would do a is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

3169
02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:45.790

<v Speaker 3>love chipotle actually love this episode</v>

3172
02:11:54.051 --> 02:11:57.080
<v Speaker 3>then because it's chip interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have no idea who he is.</v>

3173
02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:57.973
<v Speaker 3>If they really love chip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they understand who chip jepperson </v>

3179
02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:12.890

3202
02:13:20.630 --> 02:13:22.220
<v Speaker 3>you came up with this character when you</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like girlfriends hated it.</v>

3205
02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I think we talked with his girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 3>drove me.</v>

3206
02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:31.560
<v Speaker 3>They hated it so much because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>humiliating and I,</v>

3207
02:13:31.561 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 3>it got a reaction out of them and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>kept doing it so much.</v>

3208
02:13:34.230 --> 02:13:37.170
<v Speaker 3>It was so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times I,</v>

3209
02:13:37.171 --> 02:13:38.850
<v Speaker 3>anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at first hated it,</v>

3210
02:13:38.851 --> 02:13:41.880
<v Speaker 3>but then anthony started to love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then opie never loved it.</v>

3211
02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:43.073
<v Speaker 3>It was always kind of fun to do because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew like deep down uncle Paulie </v>

3212
02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:46.013
<v Speaker 3>hates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would always do uncle Paul just to </v>

3213
02:13:47.371 --> 02:13:50.850
<v Speaker 3>fucking make him sick because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get with uncle Paul.</v>

3214
02:13:50.851 --> 02:13:51.571
<v Speaker 3>Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

3215
02:13:51.571 --> 02:13:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Could you more comfortable now doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>without him?</v>

3216
02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 3>The radio show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much much Yo.</v>

3217
02:13:56.850 --> 02:13:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We stopped liking each other.</v>

3218
02:13:58.590 --> 02:13:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality is we are,</v>

3219
02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:00.753
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really mean I don't wish the guy bad </v>

3220
02:14:02.401 --> 02:14:03.234
<v Speaker 3>in his real life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't want bad shit to happen to </v>

3221
02:14:04.801 --> 02:14:05.710
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3222
02:14:05.730 --> 02:14:07.860
<v Speaker 3>we simply stopped liking each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3223
02:14:07.861 --> 02:14:09.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

3224
02:14:09.051 --> 02:14:11.880
<v Speaker 3>he was enjoying his afternoon show much </v>
<v Speaker 3>more without me.</v>

3225
02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Then he was with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3226
02:14:13.831 --> 02:14:15.510
<v Speaker 3>I got the morning spa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spa or whatever,</v>

3227
02:14:15.511 --> 02:14:16.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3228
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I think the company just was annoyed at </v>
<v Speaker 3>him or whatever they like to be in San.</v>

3229
02:14:19.891 --> 02:14:22.620
<v Speaker 3>We're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his afternoon show was good.</v>

3230
02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:23.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3231
02:14:23.611 --> 02:14:23.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3232
02:14:23.991 --> 02:14:26.070
<v Speaker 3>him and shirod and those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were having fun.</v>

3233
02:14:26.190 --> 02:14:27.660
<v Speaker 3>So people didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't like it,</v>

3234
02:14:27.661 --> 02:14:31.020
<v Speaker 3>but he sounded like he was having fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was looking at him fired.</v>

3235
02:14:31.021 --> 02:14:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened,</v>

3236
02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:34.860
<v Speaker 3>what the technical reason was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was um,</v>

3237
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.380
<v Speaker 3>he had filmed role in campus.</v>

3238
02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Our booker taking a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3239
02:14:40.770 --> 02:14:41.550
<v Speaker 3>now I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oop,</v>

3240
02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:44.690
<v Speaker 3>well he filmed me doing it in 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was being a goofball.</v>

3241
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he was trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>degrading just being an ass and then I'm</v>

3242
02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:53.250
<v Speaker 3>showing it to I think a couple of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics and I guess I don't know exactly.</v>

3243
02:14:54.090 --> 02:14:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I heard about it after the ball had </v>
<v Speaker 3>already been rolling,</v>

3244
02:14:56.850 --> 02:14:57.683
<v Speaker 3>so somehow role and got nervous that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to release it and maybe with </v>

3245
02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:02.540
<v Speaker 3>tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what role he said to them,</v>

3246
02:15:02.541 --> 02:15:03.374
<v Speaker 3>I really don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that it got back to one of </v>

3247
02:15:05.131 --> 02:15:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Roland's bosses and then the head of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>talent department spoke to them and then</v>

3248
02:15:09.061 --> 02:15:12.780
<v Speaker 3>once human resources got involved then </v>
<v Speaker 3>things change.</v>

3249
02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.153
<v Speaker 3>And I remember there was a clip of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was getting bad and there was another </v>

3250
02:15:18.751 --> 02:15:19.584
<v Speaker 3>producer in the studio named Paul and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was videotaping it and I think he had </v>

3251
02:15:23.521 --> 02:15:27.510
<v Speaker 3>been unrolling side and he thought he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was being a dick to him.</v>

3252
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:28.650
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be a dick to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's like,</v>

3253
02:15:28.651 --> 02:15:29.484
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you chose rolling in this whole </v>

3254
02:15:30.271 --> 02:15:32.520
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like making it a public thing.</v>

3255
02:15:32.521 --> 02:15:34.950
<v Speaker 3>That was really uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Paul goes,</v>

3256
02:15:34.951 --> 02:15:36.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I thought it was wrong.</v>

3257
02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:37.100
<v Speaker 3>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rod goes like,</v>

3258
02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:38.070
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was having fun.</v>

3259
02:15:38.071 --> 02:15:39.690
<v Speaker 3>We all saw the tape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was enjoying it,</v>

3260
02:15:39.691 --> 02:15:42.720
<v Speaker 3>he was laughing and when I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3261
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:45.600
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just said we all saw the tape.</v>

3262
02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:48.780
<v Speaker 3>So other like that just made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3263
02:15:48.810 --> 02:15:50.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe they were going to fire them </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

3264
02:15:50.070 --> 02:15:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they don't tell me that shit.</v>

3265
02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:53.053
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he thinks that the company was out </v>

3266
02:15:55.081 --> 02:15:55.914
<v Speaker 3>to get him.</v>

3267
02:15:57.570 --> 02:15:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3268
02:15:58.471 --> 02:15:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I kind of know what they said to him </v>
<v Speaker 3>privately,</v>

3269
02:16:00.570 --> 02:16:01.403
<v Speaker 3>but to me he had two months left on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal and no company wants to fire you </v>

3270
02:16:05.761 --> 02:16:09.650
<v Speaker 3>two months out because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the potential lawsuits loss,</v>

3271
02:16:09.810 --> 02:16:12.760
<v Speaker 3>they would much rather let you ride it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and then just not resign.</v>

3272
02:16:12.761 --> 02:16:16.080
<v Speaker 3>You will serious isn't a weird place </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of podcasts.</v>

3273
02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just a very weird place that</v>

3274
02:16:18.241 --> 02:16:19.074
<v Speaker 3>the idea of paying money for these talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows that are going to get interrupted </v>

3275
02:16:22.261 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 3>by commercials and to have to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them only when they come on and not have</v>

3276
02:16:26.371 --> 02:16:28.950
<v Speaker 3>them on demand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such an inferior distribution where</v>

3277
02:16:28.951 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>they demand like now</v>

3278
02:16:30.230 --> 02:16:32.920
<v Speaker 2>now they're on demand is getting your </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone an hour after it's up.</v>

3279
02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.793
<v Speaker 2>You can get it an hour after it's but </v>
<v Speaker 2>live you can listen live on the phone </v>

3280
02:16:37.691 --> 02:16:40.060
<v Speaker 2>and get it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is on your radio,</v>

3281
02:16:40.061 --> 02:16:42.300
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in your car and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3282
02:16:42.390 --> 02:16:43.223
<v Speaker 2>you can't just pick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to listen to Tuesdays opie and </v>

3283
02:16:46.081 --> 02:16:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Show or Jim Norton and Sam show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't just pick that.</v>

3284
02:16:50.050 --> 02:16:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you have a phone,</v>

3285
02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:54.430
<v Speaker 2>it might be a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That phone hooked up.</v>

3286
02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:55.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

3287
02:16:55.181 --> 02:16:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3288
02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:59.470
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Sirius radio is only playing what's</v>

3289
02:16:59.471 --> 02:17:04.471
<v Speaker 2>playing right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so far I don't know her.</v>

3290
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't have a thing where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could just pick an episode.</v>

3291
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:12.730
<v Speaker 2>How is the podcast played in a car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just get.</v>

3292
02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:14.680
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

3293
02:17:14.681 --> 02:17:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you can do it where you could stream it </v>
<v Speaker 2>live through youtube.</v>

3294
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Some people do that and you just play </v>
<v Speaker 2>the audio and if you have it setup,</v>

3295
02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:24.700
<v Speaker 2>you can play the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people do it where you,</v>

3296
02:17:24.701 --> 02:17:25.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on stitcher,</v>

3297
02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:29.520
<v Speaker 2>stitcher is a low bit rate version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning it's a,</v>

3298
02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:31.930
<v Speaker 2>the audio quality's not as good because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's compressed,</v>

3299
02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:35.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's way quicker to download.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have some sort of a plan where</v>

3300
02:17:35.831 --> 02:17:36.664
<v Speaker 2>you want to get a less data per month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people use stitcher or they </v>

3301
02:17:41.141 --> 02:17:44.260
<v Speaker 2>just get it off of itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about it is that you just,</v>

3302
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:46.930
<v Speaker 2>if you have your phone bluetooth up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally,</v>

3303
02:17:46.931 --> 02:17:47.764
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is press play and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll immediately play like whatever </v>

3304
02:17:50.291 --> 02:17:53.950
<v Speaker 2>episode like you to scroll through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scroll through our stuff.</v>

3305
02:17:54.450 --> 02:17:57.520
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Syria now too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the new operating system,</v>

3306
02:17:58.030 --> 02:17:59.290
<v Speaker 2>just like ask for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3307
02:17:59.291 --> 02:18:02.650
<v Speaker 2>you could play it for Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go through,</v>

3308
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:04.150
<v Speaker 2>have you ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you use it?</v>

3309
02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you use a itunes or a podcast APP?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never look at podcast standing by like</v>

3310
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:13.980
<v Speaker 2>my most recent ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of all the ones that I subscribe to that</v>

3311
02:18:13.981 --> 02:18:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I can just take one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click it and boom,</v>

3312
02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:17.180
<v Speaker 2>now it's playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3313
02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's done differently on serious.</v>

3314
02:18:21.191 --> 02:18:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The APP you have to use.</v>

3315
02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:24.290
<v Speaker 2>The on demand is pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3316
02:18:24.310 --> 02:18:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an hour after it as you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it forever.</v>

3317
02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't list.</v>

3318
02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:30.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't really listen to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I never listened to our show.</v>

3319
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it on drives and like wow,</v>

3320
02:18:33.251 --> 02:18:34.084
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like it.</v>

3321
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3322
02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:35.553
<v Speaker 2>it's new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We finally got anthony back in the </v>

3323
02:18:36.731 --> 02:18:39.890
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowed to come on as a guest in the</v>

3324
02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:40.733
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought for three years for that and </v>

3325
02:18:41.621 --> 02:18:44.560
<v Speaker 2>literally right after he got fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let him anthony back in after.</v>

3326
02:18:44.561 --> 02:18:46.240
<v Speaker 2>I hope you got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that he kept them.</v>

3327
02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be really honest.</v>

3328
02:18:47.621 --> 02:18:48.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3329
02:18:48.821 --> 02:18:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that he actively kept him </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3330
02:18:50.351 --> 02:18:52.270
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they know the real numbers?</v>

3331
02:18:52.271 --> 02:18:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Like did they ever tell you how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were actually listening?</v>

3332
02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they know.</v>

3333
02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they would track that.</v>

3334
02:18:58.270 --> 02:19:00.790
<v Speaker 2>They may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't apply to me.</v>

3335
02:19:00.791 --> 02:19:01.624
<v Speaker 2>It's like I really want to know will </v>
<v Speaker 2>give us the negotiating power on a part </v>

3336
02:19:03.981 --> 02:19:05.080
<v Speaker 2>of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't want to know,</v>

3337
02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:07.480
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that we're getting raises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're doing okay.</v>

3338
02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way I can tell you right</v>

3339
02:19:09.310 --> 02:19:10.670
<v Speaker 2>is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that they want to,</v>

3340
02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 2>to keep me every time the contract said </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3341
02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.830
<v Speaker 2>we must be doing okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3342
02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:16.250
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the numbers are,</v>

3343
02:19:16.270 --> 02:19:17.103
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how quickly it became a </v>

3344
02:19:18.551 --> 02:19:20.070
<v Speaker 2>different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3345
02:19:20.071 --> 02:19:20.904
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I remember when Howard went to </v>

3346
02:19:21.911 --> 02:19:22.750
<v Speaker 2>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3347
02:19:22.810 --> 02:19:23.643
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Lulea finally we're going to get </v>

3348
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 2>uncensored radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

3349
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.903
<v Speaker 3>it became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's still just radio and still </v>

3350
02:19:31.131 --> 02:19:31.964
<v Speaker 3>live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you have to pay for it and now it's </v>

3351
02:19:33.501 --> 02:19:36.710
<v Speaker 3>10 bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And mean he made out like a bandit.</v>

3352
02:19:36.711 --> 02:19:39.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean he made ridiculous sums of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>from it,</v>

3353
02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:42.790
<v Speaker 3>but where's the future in that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like that's a,</v>

3354
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:45.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like almost like investing in.</v>

3355
02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:46.693
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're someone who's got a piece of </v>

3356
02:19:48.261 --> 02:19:49.790
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like where's that going?</v>

3357
02:19:49.791 --> 02:19:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Like how are you going to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even use it in a tunnel.</v>

3358
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:53.743
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing with serious and this is this </v>

3359

3440
02:23:00.031 --> 02:23:03.060
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a show together to host a comedy show in</v>

3441
02:23:03.061 --> 02:23:04.650
<v Speaker 3>montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was part of the show,</v>

3442
02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:07.210
<v Speaker 3>but I'll be at home for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He flew home a day early,</v>

3443
02:23:07.211 --> 02:23:08.044
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I did it by himself and hosted the </v>

3444
02:23:09.601 --> 02:23:12.450
<v Speaker 3>show and started shitting on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians and he was really funny.</v>

3445
02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:14.880
<v Speaker 3>First time ever on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was fucking funny.</v>

3446
02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in a,</v>

3447
02:23:16.370 --> 02:23:18.450
<v Speaker 3>in a comic room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrice said that about him.</v>

3448
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:19.343
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said anthony can access funny faster </v>

3449
02:23:21.991 --> 02:23:22.860
<v Speaker 3>than any person.</v>

3450
02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.290
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen and patrice didn't hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3451
02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:26.153
<v Speaker 3>You would not known as the big ol boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy dolan out compliments again </v>

3452
02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:30.210
<v Speaker 3>write down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not patrice is reputation,</v>

3453
02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:35.610
<v Speaker 3>but anthony has that ability to reach in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and grab funny from anywhere and he's as</v>

3454
02:23:35.611 --> 02:23:36.444
<v Speaker 3>fast as any comic we've ever had on a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a comedian in there </v>

3455
02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:40.373
<v Speaker 3>who was faster than him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd been as fast as him guys like </v>

3456
02:23:42.151 --> 02:23:45.030
<v Speaker 3>patrice or burro genius,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no one has ever been able to</v>

3457
02:23:45.031 --> 02:23:46.440
<v Speaker 3>go in there and run circles around </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthony.</v>

3458
02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:48.920
<v Speaker 3>It's staggering how fucking funny that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3459
02:23:48.970 --> 02:23:49.803
<v Speaker 3>it is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's a comic who never became </v>

3460
02:23:51.121 --> 02:23:51.954
<v Speaker 3>a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's how I've always felt about </v>

3461
02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:54.324
<v Speaker 3>being around him and he even said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him and dice was shitting on </v>

3462
02:23:56.881 --> 02:23:58.530
<v Speaker 3>opiod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony when they had a few together,</v>

3463
02:23:58.770 --> 02:23:59.603
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that that anthony is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually talented and he's actually </v>

3464
02:24:02.251 --> 02:24:03.930
<v Speaker 3>almost like a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he never did it.</v>

3465
02:24:04.470 --> 02:24:05.303
<v Speaker 3>He never did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and anthony has an ability brewers and </v>

3466
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:10.320
<v Speaker 3>amazing storyteller to an amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>storyteller.</v>

3467
02:24:10.350 --> 02:24:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Whereas aunt could do that about like he</v>
<v Speaker 3>can literally tell you.</v>

3468
02:24:13.321 --> 02:24:14.310

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3469
02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:18.270
<v Speaker 3>being a tin knocker and stuff I have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of or interest in and,</v>

3470
02:24:18.390 --> 02:24:21.420
<v Speaker 3>and he would have me on the edge of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>seat listening to him talk about it.</v>

3471
02:24:21.421 --> 02:24:25.370
<v Speaker 3>He just has a gift for explaining things</v>
<v Speaker 3>anD for walking you through it.</v>

3472

<v Speaker 3>The ability to explain an amazingly </v>

3473
02:24:28.021 --> 02:24:28.854
<v Speaker 3>interesting fashion and anthony can just</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump in and out of voices and do </v>

3474
02:24:31.171 --> 02:24:33.010
<v Speaker 3>impressions.</v>

02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:15.010
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

3522
02:26:15.010 --> 02:26:15.843
<v Speaker 3>you just go right back into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sam is so perfect in that moment </v>

3523
02:26:19.001 --> 02:26:22.470
<v Speaker 3>till you just kind of go back into it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you flow and you know.</v>

3524
02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:26.150
<v Speaker 3>So I miss him a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uncensored conversations,</v>

3525
02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:27.013
<v Speaker 3>they're just hard to come by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And When you're under the corporate </v>

3526
02:26:29.081 --> 02:26:31.120
<v Speaker 3>umbrella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not really uncensored.</v>

3527
02:26:31.121 --> 02:26:33.390
<v Speaker 3>There's always gonna be something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't say something,</v>

3528
02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:34.233
<v Speaker 3>get you in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I was always encouraging </v>

3529
02:26:35.891 --> 02:26:36.880
<v Speaker 3>you to do a podcast.</v>

3530
02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Like wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even way back in the day,</v>

3531
02:26:39.010 --> 02:26:39.843
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should branch out and you should do </v>

3532
02:26:40.751 --> 02:26:43.270
<v Speaker 3>something on the wrong side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like people wouldn't.</v>

3533
02:26:43.271 --> 02:26:44.104
<v Speaker 3>Why voice felt people wouldn't want it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or they were sick of me or they're not </v>

3534
02:26:45.731 --> 02:26:47.140
<v Speaker 3>interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3535
02:26:47.141 --> 02:26:49.450
<v Speaker 3>the closest I've come at this point is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dumb.</v>

3536
02:26:49.451 --> 02:26:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Chip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made you my own sunday,</v>

3537
02:26:50.861 --> 02:26:52.690
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm literally loving doing that.</v>

3538
02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:55.330
<v Speaker 3>It's freedom and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do what you love then,</v>

3539
02:26:55.331 --> 02:26:56.800
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3540
02:26:56.801 --> 02:26:59.170
<v Speaker 3>I know you love doing the sam and jim </v>
<v Speaker 3>show too,</v>

3541
02:26:59.171 --> 02:27:00.004
<v Speaker 3>but I really feel like even that show </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be bigger if it was just </v>

3542
02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:05.950
<v Speaker 3>accessible to everybody and not on </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>

3543
02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:07.450
<v Speaker 3>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3544
02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:08.284
<v Speaker 3>we have one more year left on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>contract and it is something I would do </v>

3545
02:27:10.331 --> 02:27:12.790
<v Speaker 3>as a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It absolutely is something I would do as</v>

3546
02:27:12.791 --> 02:27:13.624
<v Speaker 3>a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to say one thing in </v>

3547
02:27:15.071 --> 02:27:15.550
<v Speaker 3>their favor.</v>

3548
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Besides the fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3549
02:27:16.481 --> 02:27:19.150
<v Speaker 3>there's human resources and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't go around and fucking grabbing</v>

3550
02:27:19.151 --> 02:27:22.840
<v Speaker 3>clits they never fuck with us </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatively.</v>

3551
02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:23.853
<v Speaker 3>Like literally never say nothing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>condoleezza rice where you guys got </v>

3552
02:27:28.601 --> 02:27:31.180
<v Speaker 3>kicked off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a homeless guy.</v>

3553
02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Here's what that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your right to homeless charlie.</v>

3554
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:34.541
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3555
02:27:34.541 --> 02:27:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That bush bItch.</v>

3556
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:39.100
<v Speaker 3>He was just a funny fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's how that got pushed.</v>

3557
02:27:39.101 --> 02:27:42.700
<v Speaker 3>That was before sirius xm merged and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what sunk,</v>

3558
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:43.583
<v Speaker 3>what it will almost happened was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>made it to fucking brietbart or </v>

3559
02:27:46.051 --> 02:27:50.710
<v Speaker 3>breitbart and then got onto drudge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then became a big deal and I heard later</v>

3560
02:27:50.711 --> 02:27:51.544
<v Speaker 3>that the people who were making that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story where the people who worked in </v>

3561
02:27:54.130 --> 02:27:58.180
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial radio who did not want that </v>
<v Speaker 3>merger to happen.</v>

3562
02:27:58.510 --> 02:27:59.343
<v Speaker 3>So the only reason the company pulled </v>
<v Speaker 3>him off if they were literally scared </v>

3563
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:02.883
<v Speaker 3>that it was going to hurt whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed in congress for fucking two to </v>

3564
02:28:06.011 --> 02:28:06.580
<v Speaker 3>make the merger.</v>

3565
02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:07.413
<v Speaker 3>Haptics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>

3566
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:09.520
<v Speaker 3>So they were saying it was a merger in </v>
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>

3567
02:28:09.521 --> 02:28:12.160
<v Speaker 3>Like once that got out there and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>either way,</v>

3568
02:28:12.161 --> 02:28:15.490
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't have been off the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm as crazy as it was,</v>

3569
02:28:15.491 --> 02:28:19.450
<v Speaker 3>that's where terrestrial radio saved us </v>
<v Speaker 3>because k rock who they wanted to be off</v>

3570
02:28:19.451 --> 02:28:20.760
<v Speaker 3>the fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those cons.</v>

3571
02:28:20.770 --> 02:28:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I hate that they wanted you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3572
02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:24.033
<v Speaker 3>because the ratings weren't as good as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to be and they thought I was </v>

3573
02:28:25.911 --> 02:28:27.190
<v Speaker 3>the probleM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll walk around and talk to myself and </v>

3607
02:29:37.431 --> 02:29:39.860
<v Speaker 3>full blown conversation like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3608
02:29:40.450 --> 02:29:41.283
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not.</v>

3609
02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:42.353
<v Speaker 3>I have actually embarrassed this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a shit today and I got up and I </v>

3610
02:29:45.201 --> 02:29:46.034
<v Speaker 3>was done and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to the fucking to look at my </v>

3611
02:29:48.081 --> 02:29:50.330
<v Speaker 3>computer and I had to shit again </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

3612
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:52.100
<v Speaker 3>And I stood up and out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3613
02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:53.990
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just jostled a little more loose,</v>

3614
02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:59.150
<v Speaker 3>and I walked back to the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said those words to myself alone.</v>

3615
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:00.920
<v Speaker 3>I do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3616
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:03.050
<v Speaker 3>I talk and I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought everyone did that,</v>

3617
02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:04.461
<v Speaker 3>but sam's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3618
02:30:04.461 --> 02:30:06.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll think things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't say them.</v>

3619
02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:07.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine most people think </v>

3620
02:30:08.631 --> 02:30:10.640
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a few people talk to themselves.</v>

3621
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:14.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I've done it on occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a normal in the shower.</v>

3622
02:30:14.331 --> 02:30:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I do it out loud just for conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me when I'm alone,</v>

3623
02:30:17.301 --> 02:30:20.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to not talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked so fucking much.</v>

3624
02:30:20.271 --> 02:30:21.104
<v Speaker 3>I talk so much doing a podcast so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing stand up so much doing ufc </v>

3625
02:30:24.141 --> 02:30:27.410
<v Speaker 3>commentary when I can not talk at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking happy.</v>

3626
02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

3627
02:30:29.061 --> 02:30:32.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like things that just kind of come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out or I work through things or I worked</v>

3628
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:33.740
<v Speaker 3>through this girlfriends argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3629
02:30:33.741 --> 02:30:37.670
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I logically talk things through,</v>

3630
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:39.403
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where a lot of the characters </v>

3631
02:30:39.771 --> 02:30:40.604
<v Speaker 3>should come from is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll start thinking of it and I'll talk </v>

3632
02:30:42.201 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 3>in a weird voice and there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that resonates with me and I'm</v>

3633
02:30:45.471 --> 02:30:47.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
