1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches watch is such a scary thing though because compromising</v>

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>the ability to think correctly to me is one of the scariest things that could</v>

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:10.794
<v Speaker 1>happen to you.</v>

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.371
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I had Lyme disease and one of the,</v>

6
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and I spent three years in bed,</v>

7
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but the worst part about life,</v>

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I was really sick.</v>

9
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>That's where the flow research came from.</v>

10
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I pulled myself out of it through surfing in these crazy altered states that I</v>

12
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>was having while I was surfing.</v>

13
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>And my first question was,</v>

14
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck has got right?</v>

15
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:29.911
<v Speaker 1>Surfing is not,</v>

16
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>I've known Carol for chronic autoimmune conditions and why was having these</v>

17
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>crazy altered state of consciousness experiences while surfing?</v>

18
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>That's where it started for me.</v>

19
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 1>but with Lyme I law,</v>

21
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

22
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>you go crazy.</v>

23
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>You become extremely paranoid.</v>

24
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>The most common misdiagnosis for Lyme is paranoid schizophrenia.</v>

25
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>So you become extremely paranoid.</v>

26
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I was hallucinating short term memory gone longterm memory,</v>

27
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>gone beam dyslexic.</v>

28
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:55.314
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't write,</v>

29
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even read cause I would get to the end of a sentence.</v>

30
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember the beginning of the sentence that I read.</v>

31
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's like watching yourself go mad.</v>

32
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.783
<v Speaker 1>I don't know of any,</v>

33
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

34
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>but I've been through a lot of physical pain.</v>

35
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I've been through a lot of different illnesses and whatever.</v>

36
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is worse than watching yourself go crazy.</v>

37
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow are fine.</v>

38
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 1>But my good friend Tommy,</v>

39
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend just this past weekend was telling me about she had Lyme and she</v>

40
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>was misdiagnosed.</v>

41
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>She had to go to just more than a,</v>

42
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I think she said more than a dozen different doctors before somebody finally</v>

43
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>listened to her.</v>

44
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>If you find it out,</v>

45
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>my second book,</v>

46
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.041
<v Speaker 1>west of Jesus,</v>

47
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>which is the book I write about this,</v>

48
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>this is very early.</v>

49
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the first couple of pages on,</v>

50
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I have a list of all the diseases that I was told I had before.</v>

51
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>They actually discovered his lime and it's,</v>

52
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a half a page of diseases.</v>

54
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:40.734
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

55
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm so confused by that because Lyme is common.</v>

56
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>So as well,</v>

57
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

58
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>first of all I was,</v>

59
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.703
<v Speaker 1>I had it,</v>

60
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I got it on the east coast,</v>

61
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but I was here.</v>

62
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I was living in California,</v>

63
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I was living in La at the time where they hadn't really,</v>

64
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>now they've seen it,</v>

65
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>but at that time nobody had really seen it and they didn't believe it was a west</v>

66
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.861
<v Speaker 1>coast disease.</v>

67
00:01:58.861 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

68
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>it's still this point that diagnostics are not fantastic for Lyme.</v>

69
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.441
<v Speaker 1>But what I was saying,</v>

70
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>my friend Katie,</v>

71
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.181
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>

72
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Tommy's girlfriend Katie,</v>

73
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>she lives in New Jersey or Connecticut rather,</v>

74
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>where it's really common.</v>

75
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean like Connecticut is where it came from.</v>

76
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>So they live in a place where it's really common in,</v>

77
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>the doctor was like,</v>

78
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.823
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

79
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>not lying.</v>

80
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.991
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

81
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:19.824
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be like,</v>

82
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

83
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>not what I'm,</v>

84
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.953
<v Speaker 1>you're going crazy.</v>

85
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.943
<v Speaker 1>I went in,</v>

86
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I could talk about this,</v>

87
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk about this a little bit,</v>

88
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>but so that we'll keep names out of it.</v>

89
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So the first time I walked in to see my doctor,</v>

90
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.091
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been sick for a while and I just moved to La so I didn't have,</v>

92
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>or a regular practitioner.</v>

93
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I finally got one and I've been sick for a while.</v>

94
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of my friends had been trying to figure out what the hell was going on</v>

95
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.421
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

96
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>And one of my editors said,</v>

97
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

98
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing research.</v>

99
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

100
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I think we have Lyme.</v>

101
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Go ask your doctor.</v>

102
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>And I remember walking into the doctor's the first time I'd seen him and I was</v>

103
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

104
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.571
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

105
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

106
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.381
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

108
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.214
<v Speaker 1>This is what's going on.</v>

109
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

110
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I think I have Lyme.</v>

111
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:55.381
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

112
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

113
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

114
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.371
<v Speaker 1>you don't have Lyme,</v>

115
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:57.204

<v Speaker 1>are you sure cause decided you were gay?</v>

121
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.331
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

122
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I looked at him,</v>

123
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.021
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

124

<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

138
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:24.930

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like I haven't add homosexual sex.</v>

150
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I've never used Ivy.</v>

151
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 1>That was what happened.</v>

152
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And the worst thing is like,</v>

153
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>go home to your girlfriend who you're living with and she's like,</v>

155
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>how was the doctor honey?</v>

156
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.733
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

157
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Did he test you before?</v>

159
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>He said No.</v>

160
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.551
<v Speaker 1>He tested.</v>

161
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:55.384
<v Speaker 1>He tested.</v>

162
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>That's just say I won the lawsuit.</v>

163
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

164
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:57.971
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

165
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>By the time it was all said and done,</v>

166
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.311
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

167
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:01.144
<v Speaker 1>you had a Su.</v>

168
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

169
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>It got really obnoxious.</v>

170
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean like they wouldn't test me for anything.</v>

171
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:05.961
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

172
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>it dragged on and on and on</v>

173
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.561
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>

174
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>they're worried that if they do test you for something and they confirmed that</v>

175
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 2>they were incorrect and it sets them up for malpractice so they're trying to</v>

176
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.264
<v Speaker 2>drag it out.</v>

177
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 1>It was an Hmo.</v>

178
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.053
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

179
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Insurance has changed.</v>

180
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.804
<v Speaker 1>But back in the,</v>

181
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>this was early 2000 [inaudible] 99 98 I paid,</v>

182
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I think my premium loose HML cupboard was like,</v>

183
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say at the time it was like a couple hundred bucks a month of that 200</v>

184
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>bucks a month,</v>

185
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>$7 went to the doctor for testing.</v>

186
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>The rest of went to the insurance company.</v>

187
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>The doctor got $7 a month to treat me.</v>

188
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>So how incentivized our that are run a bunch of big expensive tests.</v>

189
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 2>So he looks at anybody on an Hmo is like aids.</v>

190
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>You got a these days,</v>

191
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.360
<v Speaker 2>get them to run out of my office.</v>

192
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully the guy will just do drugs and die.</v>

193
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Just drink himself to death.</v>

194
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:56.304
<v Speaker 2>It was ugly.</v>

195
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.731
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

196
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

197
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.790
<v Speaker 2>So this was a long time ago when lime wasn't nearly as prevalent.</v>

198
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Now Lyme is a God damn scary disease because I don't know when it originated and</v>

199
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.460
<v Speaker 2>they just started sort of treating people for it over the last few decades.</v>

200
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

201
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

202
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

203
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is still true,</v>

204
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:19.251
<v Speaker 1>but there was a period of time where it was the first of the second biggest</v>

205
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 1>communicable disease viral disease in the world.</v>

206
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.780
<v Speaker 1>He was second</v>

207
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.260
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

208
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.411
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

209
00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:25.700
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I studied,</v>

210
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

211
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I did this show called a Joe Rogan questions,</v>

212
00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:30.470
<v Speaker 2>everything for Psi Phi.</v>

213
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.010
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that we looked into with something called more challenge,</v>

214
00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 2>do you know what more challenges?</v>

215
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.930
<v Speaker 2>More Jaylen's is a very controversial disease where people feel like they have</v>

216
00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:43.310
<v Speaker 2>fibers growing out of their skin and they scratch themselves and develop these</v>

217
00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:45.860
<v Speaker 2>like open sores from itching.</v>

218
00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 2>And then they think that like they'll get like carpet fibers in their skin,</v>

219
00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 2>they'll think it's coming out of their body,</v>

220
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.430
<v Speaker 2>like we'll have like fibers from their clothes that they'll detect on their</v>

221
00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:56.150
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

222
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 2>And so it has sort of weird psychological aspect to it.</v>

223
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting about it is a disproportionate number of people who have more</v>

224
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 2>challenge or believe they haven't test positive for Lyme disease.</v>

225
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.780
<v Speaker 2>So I was talking to a doctor who had more jealous,</v>

226
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 2>who also has Lyme and he was very candid and honest about it.</v>

227
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.710
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

228
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 2>he thinks that there's a direct risk.</v>

229
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 2>There's something going on.</v>

230
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 2>There was a neurotoxic effect that's happening with the Lyme disease that's</v>

231
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 2>twisting his mind.</v>

232
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Does,</v>

233
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean crazy?</v>

234
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.381
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>

235
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I was at,</v>

236
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 2>that's why I wanted to talk to you that Fairfax and sunset.</v>

237
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.421
<v Speaker 2>I was driving my car,</v>

238
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 2>it was just stick and it was,</v>

239
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I was coming back from the doctors.</v>

240
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 2>This was a typical Lyme,</v>

241
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 2>what happens to your brain and um,</v>

242
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>the light's red and it's rush hour.</v>

243
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what Fairfax and sunset is like at rush hour and uh,</v>

244
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 2>the light turned from red to green and I no longer know what green means.</v>

245
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

246
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 2>my brain is just like,</v>

247
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.681
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

248
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:52.491
<v Speaker 2>what am I supposed to do?</v>

249
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:53.324
<v Speaker 2>What am I supposed to do?</v>

250
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>People are flocking and hawking.</v>

251
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 2>And finally I'm like,</v>

252
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh crap.</v>

253
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Green means go.</v>

254
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 2>And I looked down at the stick shift and I no longer have not remember how to</v>

255
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.864
<v Speaker 2>drive stick.</v>

256
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I had to literally get out and people had to push my car and to whatever that</v>

257
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:08.980
<v Speaker 2>little grocery store is right there to the party.</v>

258
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.570
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

259
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

260
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>fundamental skills that I'd had since I was 16 years old.</v>

261
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.381
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

262
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 2>the ability to go when the light turns green.</v>

263
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean you watch yourself go crazy.</v>

264
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

265
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 2>that must be insane.</v>

266
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 2>But you knew how to walk.</v>

267
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>You knew how to talk.</v>

268
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 2>You need her to say there's something wrong.</v>

269
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 2>You had full access to the language that had full access to land.</v>

270
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:30.591
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't write.</v>

271
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 2>I started developing a select like scrabble words up when I was writing,</v>

272
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.391
<v Speaker 2>but I could talk.</v>

273
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever lost my powers of speech that I remember.</v>

274
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.400
<v Speaker 2>What a scary little fucking disease.</v>

275
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Lyme is,</v>

276
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 2>was weird,</v>

277
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.171
<v Speaker 2>scary,</v>

278
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 2>creepy disease.</v>

279
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.761
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

280
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>this doctor,</v>

281
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 2>he was absolutely convinced that the two of them were correlated.</v>

282
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 2>He said that there's something going on with Lyme disease that produces this</v>

283
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:52.150
<v Speaker 2>thing where you,</v>

284
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 2>you start seeing these fibers coming out of your body and uh,</v>

285
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:55.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:55.771
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

287
00:07:55.771 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 2>we had a ton of people like to send in videos and show us images and they had</v>

288
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 2>slides that they had prepared.</v>

289
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>They were convinced these fibers were coming out of their skin.</v>

290
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.270
<v Speaker 2>And so doctors oftentimes just completely label it as a psychosomatic disorder.</v>

291
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 2>But this one doctor who had it said,</v>

292
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the correlation is Lyme disease and it completely makes sense.</v>

293
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Listen to what you're saying.</v>

294
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is everything is a psychosomatic disease,</v>

295
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

296
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.331
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

297
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 2>there's not an aids.</v>

298
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

299
00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>the mine,</v>

300
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>all I was saying is that,</v>

301
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean it that way.</v>

302
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny now because it's a,</v>

303
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like you could kind of avoid,</v>

304
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it used to be,</v>

305
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:37.790
<v Speaker 2>we were all worried everybody's going to die.</v>

306
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Like you can joke around about aids now,</v>

307
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:40.933
<v Speaker 2>which is rare.</v>

308
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

309
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like the,</v>

310
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>the time when Magic Johnson came out as HIV positive,</v>

311
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>everybody was terrified.</v>

312
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to die.</v>

313
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

314
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I lost a lot of friends during that period.</v>

315
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you,</v>

316
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 2>cause they thought you had aids.</v>

317
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.401
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

318
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:52.631
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

319
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:53.464
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

320
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I might've lost</v>

321
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>some friends that way too.</v>

322
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.343
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

323
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.273
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

324
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 1>But for you,</v>

325
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.810
<v Speaker 1>what did they have to do to you to get you off the alarm disease and his,</v>

326
00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>isn't lime something you keep semi-permanently so I mean,</v>

327
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

328
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:10.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

329
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:11.731
<v Speaker 1>I was in bed for three.</v>

330
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'll tell you the year.</v>

331
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

332
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>it was in bed for about three years.</v>

333
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>They had to pull me off antibiotics cause my stomach lining started bleeding</v>

334
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:18.650
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

335
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

336
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing else maybe we could do for me and up just tell you the full</v>

337
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>story and I was going to end my life.</v>

338
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

339
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I was at that point I was functional but 10% of the time,</v>

340
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe like an hour a day,</v>

341
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't work.</v>

342
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I was going to be was a burden to my friends and my family.</v>

343
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like,</v>

344
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

345
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

346
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

347
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

348
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

349
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of this I was,</v>

350
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.651
<v Speaker 1>it was what,</v>

351
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I was still living in Los Angeles.</v>

352
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine showed up at my door and said,</v>

353
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:44.634
<v Speaker 1>we're going surfing.</v>

354
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I secured to your fucking mind.</v>

355
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't walk across the room.</v>

356
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:48.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

357
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I literally couldn't do it and she wouldn't shut up and wouldn't leave and</v>

358
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't leave and wouldn't,</v>

359
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>he's trying and after like it just hard to make a point of she's going to drown</v>

360
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 1>me four hours of this or three hours a day.</v>

361
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

362
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.573
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

363
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 1>let's go surfing today.</v>

364
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

365
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst that can happen?</v>

366
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:05.701
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

367
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll always kill myself tomorrow and a drag me out to sunset beach.</v>

368
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And they literally sort of had to walk me to the car.</v>

369
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I take it,</v>

370
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.731
<v Speaker 1>by the shoulders.</v>

372
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was,</v>

373
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:15.481
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>

374
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.314
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

375
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>they gave me a fourth the size of a Cadillac in the bigger the board,</v>

377
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:19.960
<v Speaker 1>the easier it is to surf.</v>

378
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>And this was enormous and it was a tiny day.</v>

379
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Like waves were like two feet at best and was so crappy.</v>

380
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was even out,</v>

381
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>but the water was warm and they sort of like,</v>

382
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:30.540
<v Speaker 1>they took me by the elbow and they walked me out to the break and I was out</v>

383
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>there and I knew how to surf a little bit.</v>

384
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It had been a longtime side surfed at that point,</v>

385
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>but 30 seconds later or wave came and you know,</v>

386
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:38.281
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

387
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Muscle memory took over whatever would,</v>

388
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I spun my board,</v>

389
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I paddled a couple times and I popped up and I just popped up from a dimension I</v>

390
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know existed.</v>

391
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

392
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>So when the eye panoramic vision,</v>

393
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:52.461
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I could see out of the back of my head and I felt amazing.</v>

394
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I felt like that kind of full thrum of lifetime and slow down.</v>

395
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 1>None of it made any sense.</v>

396
00:10:58.291 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 1>It felt so good.</v>

397
00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I caught like four more waves that day.</v>

398
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And by the fifth wave I was just,</v>

399
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.223
<v Speaker 1>I was disassembled.</v>

400
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 1>They kinda put me back in the car and drove me home.</v>

401
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

402
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

403
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I was so sick after that that I was,</v>

404
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I got into bed and people had to bring me food for like two weeks because I</v>

405
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 1>couldn't walk to my kitchen,</v>

406
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 1>which was like 60 feet away and just exhausted.</v>

407
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I was not surfing experience like the 15th Day,</v>

408
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:21.120
<v Speaker 1>which is the day I could walk again,</v>

409
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>caught another ride back to the beach.</v>

410
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.503
<v Speaker 1>And I did it again.</v>

411
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

412
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.681
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

413
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I had this crazy altered state of consciousness experience.</v>

414
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:29.371
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

415
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:29.701
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

416
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I was disassembled this time,</v>

417
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was like 13 days that I was in bed and I did it again.</v>

418
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And over the course of about six to eight months where the only thing I was</v>

419
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>doing differently in my life was surfing.</v>

420
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I went from about 10% functionality to about 80% functionality.</v>

421
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>So my first question is the fuck is going on,</v>

422
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:46.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

423
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Like as I said earlier,</v>

424
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 1>surfing is not a known cure for chronic autoimmune conditions.</v>

425
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

426
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

427
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and I lit out on a giant class.</v>

428
00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>The other thing was I backgrounds as a science writer.</v>

429
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:02.341
<v Speaker 1>So like I don't have quasi mystical experiences and I sure as hell don't have</v>

430
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>them while surfing,</v>

431
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:04.470
<v Speaker 1>which has gotta be the flakiness,</v>

432
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 1>thing ever.</v>

434
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

435
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

436
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

437
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.260
<v Speaker 1>so I really believed that even though I was feeling better lives,</v>

438
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>only fatal if it gets into your brain.</v>

439
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.283
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

440
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty sure that even though I was starting to feel physically better that</v>

441
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>the disease had crept into my brain because why else would I be having these</v>

442
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>mystical experiences?</v>

443
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I must be totally losing my mind.</v>

444
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to die.</v>

445
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>And I lit out on a giant quest beer at what the hell happened.</v>

446
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

447
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 1>very quickly discovered that these states of consciousness have names.</v>

448
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 1>We call them flow states.</v>

449
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 1>And the version of what happened to me health wise,</v>

450
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

451
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>and this is her Benson did some of the work on the neurobiology of this.</v>

452
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:42.724
<v Speaker 1>He's at Harvard.</v>

453
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

454
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 1>he wrote about it in his book,</v>

455
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>the breakup principle.</v>

456
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.633
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

457
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

458
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.220
<v Speaker 1>all the neurochemicals that show up and float,</v>

459
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.021
<v Speaker 1>two things happen.</v>

460
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:50.651
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>

461
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 1>when you move into flow,</v>

462
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a global release of nitric oxide.</v>

463
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a gas as signaling molecules anywhere in the body.</v>

464
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it flushes all the stress hormones out of your system and it</v>

465
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:02.920
<v Speaker 1>pumps you full of these kind of feel good performance.</v>

466
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Standard Lyme is an essentially any autoimmune conditions,</v>

467
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system gone haywire.</v>

468
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 1>So when you go into flow,</v>

469
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it resets your nervous system,</v>

470
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 1>calms everything down.</v>

471
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 1>It gets rid of all the stress hormone and all that stuff and it,</v>

472
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

473
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>the worst part about Lyme is you don't even know where normal is.</v>

474
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Like it has been so long since you have felt normal,</v>

475
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:25.331
<v Speaker 1>like you don't even,</v>

476
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't even find it on a map.</v>

477
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly like I was like,</v>

478
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.803
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

479
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>this is what normal feels like.</v>

480
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:30.371
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

481
00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:31.204
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is,</v>

482
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:31.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:34.470
<v Speaker 1>the positive neurochemicals that show up and float dopamine,</v>

484
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin and Nanda Amaanah see Towson.</v>

485
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Those are all immune system boosters.</v>

486
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:38.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

487
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:40.030
<v Speaker 1>they do a ton of other stuff,</v>

488
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 1>enhance cognitive performance and whatever,</v>

489
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 1>but her Benson at Harvard,</v>

490
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and I think this may be overstretching,</v>

491
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

492
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.741
<v Speaker 1>a budget,</v>

493
00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 1>but he has kind of gone on record and said,</v>

494
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>he thinks most cases of so called spontaneous healing actually have a flow state</v>

495
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:54.971
<v Speaker 1>at their heart.</v>

496
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's this particular process that's doing it.</v>

497
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.943
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

498
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
