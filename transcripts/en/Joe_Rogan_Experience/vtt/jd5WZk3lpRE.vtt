00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.750
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience you are,</v>

2
00:00:02.751 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>you were in space for 166 days.</v>

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.511
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

4
00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

6
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

7
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it's when I sit on my dark and watch the space station go over,</v>

8
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to rationalize cause I know I was up here and I can remember</v>

10
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:16.611
<v Speaker 1>all the details,</v>

11
00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>but to try and link in life on earth with,</v>

12
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>with seeing that spotlight go across the horizon,</v>

13
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:22.381
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:22.971
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>

15
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got sorted out of my head how to connect it.</v>

16
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that the longest a person's ever been up there?</v>

17
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

18
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

19
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.581
<v Speaker 1>there was a Russian guy,</v>

20
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>didn't Valarie Poliakoff a state of 14 months straight.</v>

21
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>400 and whatever that is days.</v>

22
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Long time.</v>

23
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

24
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm nowhere near the record.</v>

27
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 2>That's in the still in 166 days is an incredible amount of time to be detached</v>

28
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>from gravity and floating around in space.</v>

29
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.760
<v Speaker 2>What is the effect on your body?</v>

30
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>A big effects short term,</v>

31
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.341
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>

32
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't have to lift the blood up to your head when you're weightless.</v>

33
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:53.821
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

34
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>So your whole cardiovascular system changes.</v>

35
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>All the nice little mechanisms that squeeze the balloon,</v>

36
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>that is your body to get the blood up to your head.</v>

37
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.941
<v Speaker 1>They stop working,</v>

38
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>your heart gets smaller.</v>

39
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

40
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you start losing your skeleton.</v>

41
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>your balanced system completely shuts down.</v>

43
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>it has no stimulus from gravity anymore.</v>

45
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>So you become totally visually based.</v>

46
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>So when you come home,</v>

47
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

48
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Building all those things back up again.</v>

49
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

50
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>and most of them you feel,</v>

51
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

52
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you lose the callouses on the bottom of your feet.</v>

53
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of disgusting because you're sure your feet are like a snake up there.</v>

54
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Over the bottom of your feet are shedding cause you never used the bottom of</v>

55
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.940
<v Speaker 1>your feet and you build up calluses on the top because you're always tucking</v>

56
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>your feet underneath things.</v>

57
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So when you come back,</v>

58
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you've even have to grow the callousness back in the bottom of your feet.</v>

59
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that takes the longest is your skeleton.</v>

60
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.241
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I lost about 8% of the bone across my hips and butt.</v>

62
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.254
<v Speaker 1>It's gone back.</v>

63
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.621
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

64
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>within about a year of landing all,</v>

66
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>hopefully be back to normal one year.</v>

68
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>It takes one year for your body to fully recover.</v>

69
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>It took about four months before I could run normally again where my body would</v>

70
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>get the blood out of my feet and pump it properly back up to my head about four</v>

71
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:01.501
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

72
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>which is almost as long as I was up in this trip.</v>

73
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.261
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

74
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the bone takes the longest,</v>

75
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's uh,</v>

76
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>it's automatic,</v>

77
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.663
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>

78
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.670
<v Speaker 1>My body got osteoporosis and it's reversing osteoporosis using some internal</v>

79
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>stimulus that we don't even understand.</v>

80
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>So it makes a pretty good medical study for everybody.</v>

81
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 2>200 years ago,</v>

82
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 2>it was so long ago when you think of like,</v>

83
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 2>if you had to go back in time and live like people live 200 years ago,</v>

84
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 2>it would suck a fat one.</v>

85
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't even be a little fun.</v>

86
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would die.</v>

87
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Every time the flu comes into town,</v>

88
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 2>all your best friends are dead,</v>

89
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.213
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

90
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 2>You don't live if you get an infection dead,</v>

91
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 2>you just got to survive at that point.</v>

92
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 2>200 years later,</v>

93
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about 200 years from now where there's robots that you literally</v>

94
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 2>can't tell if it's a person or a robot.</v>

95
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:50.121
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

96
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:50.721
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

97
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

98
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 2>100% and no wrinkles.</v>

99
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I think they're already here.</v>

100
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the robot prostitutes will be the first market?</v>

101
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.733
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

102
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 2>probably right.</v>

103
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Violence or how much?</v>

104
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 2>How much blow back do you think there'll be with robot prostitutes if women,</v>

105
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>what will women like draw a line in the sand?</v>

107
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 2>That fucking robot is a cheating thing.</v>

108
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 2>So back to what you were saying.</v>

109
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

110
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>so something is ugly as like</v>

111
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 2>they would still get mad if we had sex with it.</v>

112
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

113
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:18.244
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

114
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 2>If he gets to like,</v>

115
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>if it looks like a fake thing,</v>

116
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.580
<v Speaker 2>women probably,</v>

117
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>it would be like treat it like a fleshlight.</v>

118
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

119
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 2>But as it gets closer and closer to a real person,</v>

120
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 2>like if it looks like Robby,</v>

121
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 2>the robot from lost in space,</v>

122
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>danger,</v>

123
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.640
<v Speaker 2>danger,</v>

124
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>he could stick your Dick in that.</v>

125
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to say anything.</v>

126
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>What would they let you print out a face of her though?</v>

127
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Like so if it looks just like your wife,</v>

128
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

129
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>but then you'd be that,</v>

130
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to come home or faces carving seven inches of calm?</v>

131
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 2>You never clean it.</v>

132
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>You just keep shooting on her face.</v>

133
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.291
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

134
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:47.641
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

135
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to drown me.</v>

136
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Is this like some passive aggressive shit,</v>

137
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

138
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Or you're drowning income or you're married to your Burnett and you come home</v>

139
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:54.120
<v Speaker 2>and the robot's blonde.</v>

140
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's what she just freaks the fuck out.</v>

142
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>You come home,</v>

143
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you're putting black face on your role,</v>

144
00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.460
<v Speaker 2>your wife.</v>

145
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.293
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

146
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.163
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

147
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I think distract.</v>

148
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.400
<v Speaker 2>The problem that people have with,</v>

149
00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

150
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 2>being informed over being distracted is that it's incredibly frustrating and you</v>

151
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 2>feel helpless when you start reading all these stories about the stock market</v>

152
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:18.301
<v Speaker 2>manipulations about the banks being bailed out and about bail outs where the</v>

153
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 2>fucking people that were involved in the bail out somehow or another warranted</v>

154
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 2>some crazy commission.</v>

155
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 2>They got some bonus of the gut and then the president is going to limit to a</v>

156
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.661
<v Speaker 2>half a million dollars,</v>

157
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking half a million dollars is a lot of money,</v>

158
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

159
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you're limiting it to a half a month?</v>

160
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Didn't we just give them a ton of money?</v>

161
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 2>You feel helpless when you read about this shit over and over and over again.</v>

163
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 2>When you watch documentaries on fracking,</v>

164
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

165
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 2>you read stories in the news about how,</v>

167
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 2>how poorly veterans are being taken care of when they come back from war and</v>

168
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different things that you read where that doesn't make sense.</v>

169
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.921
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

170
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at all of these new stories,</v>

171
00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:58.640
<v Speaker 3>there's always one underlying issue in every news story.</v>

172
00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:03.641
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of amazing and it always goes back to who is funding these</v>

173
00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 3>politicians,</v>

174
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

175
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.190
<v Speaker 3>If you get the money out of politics,</v>

176
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:08.060
<v Speaker 3>that virus,</v>

177
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:09.920
<v Speaker 3>if you destroy that virus,</v>

178
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 3>things will change quickly because our representatives will be forced to pay</v>

179
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Speaker 3>attention to the American people,</v>

180
00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:18.800
<v Speaker 3>the people that are voting for them as opposed to the people who are paying</v>

181
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:19.490
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

182
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

183
00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:23.330
<v Speaker 3>if you get rid of that type of bribery that we're dealing with right now,</v>

184
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.210
<v Speaker 3>the entire system needs to be changed</v>

185
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.560
<v Speaker 2>unquestionably.</v>

186
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.880
<v Speaker 2>But how does that ever happen?</v>

187
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

188
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:30.560
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean we eat.</v>

189
00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 2>You have to like get them to change it themselves as well.</v>

190
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.420
<v Speaker 2>How else is it going to get changed?</v>

191
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

192
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.533
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

193
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

194
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Congress is obviously very corrupt.</v>

195
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.133
<v Speaker 3>So Congress,</v>

196
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 3>this is congress of America.</v>

197
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.950
<v Speaker 3>They're obviously very much bought by corporations and as a result,</v>

198
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.660
<v Speaker 3>it's really difficult for them to propose any real change.</v>

199
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>But when it comes to the state level,</v>

200
00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to state legislators,</v>

201
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a little different.</v>

202
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 3>So we actually to get,</v>

203
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm a state representative from Texas to propose a regular resolution for a</v>

204
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 3>constitutional convention.</v>

205
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 3>And it goes back to what I was saying earlier about wolf pack.</v>

206
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 3>And if we get,</v>

207
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

208
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 3>state state representatives from all the states to agree to this constitutional</v>

209
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:12.914
<v Speaker 3>convention,</v>

210
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 3>then we can actually have this constitutional amendment to get money out of</v>

211
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

212
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>

213
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 3>We just need to inform people about it.</v>

214
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 3>wolf-pack.com</v>

215
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 4>what is the main stream explanation for human sacrifice?</v>

216
00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

217
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.660
<v Speaker 4>what do they believe started off?</v>

218
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

219
00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:35.871
<v Speaker 4>that it's that it's a feeding of psychic energy to supernatural beings.</v>

220
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.260
<v Speaker 4>That's what human sacrifices about that,</v>

221
00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 4>that that you take the psychic energy of the individual,</v>

222
00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:43.410
<v Speaker 4>you're going to kill you,</v>

223
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.273
<v Speaker 4>kill them,</v>

224
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.720
<v Speaker 4>take their psychic energy and feed it to these vampire like creatures that are</v>

225
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 4>lying in the beyond that,</v>

226
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.250
<v Speaker 4>that thrive on human misery and pain.</v>

227
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.421
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

228
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 4>who are we to say that such things do not exist?</v>

229
00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:58.890
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand the nature of reality.</v>

230
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't go with you on that,</v>

231
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.920
<v Speaker 4>but I do in a way.</v>

232
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in demons,</v>

233
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.191
<v Speaker 4>but I do.</v>

234
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:10.191
<v Speaker 4>I think it's undeniable that there have been massive groups of people that have</v>

235
00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:12.990
<v Speaker 4>participated in horrific things.</v>

236
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.370
<v Speaker 4>So what is that,</v>

237
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.020
<v Speaker 4>if not demonic?</v>

238
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.800
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's,</v>

239
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's demonic.</v>

240
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.870
<v Speaker 4>I can't prove it.</v>

241
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.790
<v Speaker 4>I can't prove that that's the case.</v>

242
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:24.780
<v Speaker 4>I just think we should stay open to that possibility that the nature of reality</v>

243
00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 4>is so complex and so multilayered that there may be much more going on than we</v>

244
00:07:29.341 --> 00:07:30.600
<v Speaker 4>think and that if we just,</v>

245
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 4>if we just confine our explanations of things to purely economic and material</v>

246
00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:35.431
<v Speaker 4>terms,</v>

247
00:07:35.431 --> 00:07:40.431
<v Speaker 4>we may be missing part of the picture and that when the ancient spoke of angels</v>

248
00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:41.580
<v Speaker 4>and demons to use words,</v>

249
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that I believe in angels or demons as such,</v>

250
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 4>but when they spoke of Lawton light and dark forces,</v>

251
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.100
<v Speaker 4>negative and positive forces playing on the,</v>

252
00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:50.851
<v Speaker 4>on the human race,</v>

253
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 4>maybe they had something going.</v>

254
00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there was something to that.</v>

255
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

256
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 4>I always consider the fact that human beings have this incredibly broad spectrum</v>

257
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.350
<v Speaker 4>of possibility.</v>

258
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.520
<v Speaker 4>It's incredibly broad spectrum of behavior and personality of circumstance,</v>

259
00:08:02.521 --> 00:08:05.940
<v Speaker 4>of genetics and that there's this Yin and Yang of life.</v>

260
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 4>There's this pull and push of life and that the extreme ends of it are good and</v>

261
00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:11.370
<v Speaker 4>evil,</v>

262
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 4>good and evil.</v>

263
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.451
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

264
00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:13.000
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

265
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.490
<v Speaker 4>it may not be a demon,</v>

266
00:08:14.491 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 4>but it might as well be a demon if you're marching 80,000 people off the side of</v>

267
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:20.460
<v Speaker 4>a pyramid and cutting their heart out with a fucking stone tool.</v>

268
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

269
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.960
<v Speaker 4>That's demonic.</v>

270
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 4>It might as well being,</v>

271
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.880
<v Speaker 4>might as well be a demon.</v>

272
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:24.271
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

273
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:24.511
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

274
00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

275
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.800
<v Speaker 4>and that is a,</v>

276
00:08:25.801 --> 00:08:26.820
<v Speaker 4>that is worth considering.</v>

277
00:08:26.821 --> 00:08:27.101
<v Speaker 4>And the A,</v>

278
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 4>and the question is what is,</v>

279
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

280
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.550
<v Speaker 4>what is going on here?</v>

281
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:34.551
<v Speaker 4>I have a very dear friend called James Tiburon who refers to this world that we</v>

282
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:39.510
<v Speaker 4>live in as a university of July polity that we have,</v>

283
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.373
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

284
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.750
<v Speaker 4>that we have lessons to learn from Jew oddity,</v>

285
00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:43.630
<v Speaker 4>maybe dualities,</v>

286
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.431
<v Speaker 4>not the whole thing.</v>

287
00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:47.130
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there is an overarching unity and oneness in,</v>

288
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.940
<v Speaker 4>in all things.</v>

289
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.670
<v Speaker 4>But right now here in this incarnation on planet earth,</v>

290
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.620
<v Speaker 4>we have to learn from duality.</v>

291
00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about [inaudible] is human beings choose.</v>

292
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 4>We can always choose,</v>

293
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 4>even in the most straightened and difficult circumstances,</v>

294
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 4>we can always choose for the light rather than the darkness.</v>

295
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 4>We can always choose for good rather than evil.</v>

296
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to take that act that causes pain and suffering to another human</v>

297
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:08.611
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

298
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 4>We never have to do that.</v>

299
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 4>We can always choose not to.</v>

300
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 4>The alarming thing is that people often will choose the act that causes pain and</v>

301
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 4>suffering to others,</v>

302
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 4>and we are defined by our choices,</v>

303
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 4>and this is where we need to grow up as a species and start to choose,</v>

304
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 4>start to choose the light.</v>

305
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.980
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
