1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of rich people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a lot of rich people live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in like you.</v>

4
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we even get started,</v>

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I salute you sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I was a 16 year old kid and I</v>

6
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>won the lottery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be living exactly the way you live.</v>

7
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Like if you asked a 16 year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

8
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>if you had 100 million bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

9
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

11
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:28.921
<v Speaker 1>I'd be jet skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be driving around in Ferrari's and </v>

12
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>private jets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live in like a,</v>

13
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>a life that doesn't even seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

14
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Does it seem real to you?</v>

15
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it seems normal.</v>

16
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 2>As crazy as that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it for awhile,</v>

17
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 2>but that's actually kind of exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

18
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:46.721
<v Speaker 2>I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it started in maybe like 2000,</v>

19
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>

20
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.991
<v Speaker 2>So I had a girlfriend for about two or </v>
<v Speaker 2>three years and she was pretty happy </v>

21
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 2>that she was a playmate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had like 100,000</v>

22
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 2>followers and she was going to move to </v>
<v Speaker 2>La to become famous and this and that.</v>

23
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 2>And we ended up breaking up and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually ended up getting a place in San</v>

24
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I got a place in La and I started </v>

25

<v Speaker 2>playing this real big poker and I mean I</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat one guy for like $54 million and </v>

26
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 2>then I'd be another guy for like 10 and </v>

<v Speaker 1>it's hundreds of millions of people here</v>
<v Speaker 1>will see hidden hundred 61 million,</v>

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4,000,</v>

55
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Grant,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

58
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 2>and it's really underrepresented because</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all everybody else is buying </v>

59
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 2>all their followers and the likes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all their shifts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>also I actually kind of like the </v>

61
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 2>opposite because I got a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are looking at my shit.</v>

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 2>They can't really be seen looking at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

63
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was like some big producer,</v>

64
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I won't say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like every time I posted a girl,</v>

<v Speaker 3>because they're always searching you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think kind of the craziness I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say started in 2012 probably.</v>

88
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I just distinctly remember because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won like $11,</v>

89
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 2>million bucks in a night and my buddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who I just give them like $2,000</v>

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:14.231
<v Speaker 2>I take that back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd broken up with my girlfriend and it </v>

99
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 2>was a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nick cassavetes,</v>

100
00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:17.270
<v Speaker 2>who he's like know he's pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

101
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 2>he did like the notebook and blow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:22.280
<v Speaker 2>like the director or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

103
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.390
<v Speaker 2>I played poker with him a lot and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke it up my girl and I was like,</v>

104
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go down to Cabo,</v>

105
00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:29.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bring some chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was supposed to be me,</v>

106
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:34.961
<v Speaker 2>him and one other guy and the other guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up bailing but he had committed so</v>

107
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:38.030
<v Speaker 2>he paid for his part of the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was me and nick and I think it was</v>

108
00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say 17 chicks.</v>

109
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I remember I had sex nine times in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

110
00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so proud of myself,</v>

111
00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:46.340
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think by the end I was like,</v>

112
00:04:46.341 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 3>it was like dust was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

113
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 3>it was funny because I didn't even want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have sex the night time,</v>

114
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.830
<v Speaker 3>but it was just kinda like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a matter of principle.</v>

115
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:58.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like have a billion a billionaires </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking down the street and he sees $100</v>

116
00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 3>bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

117
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.410
<v Speaker 3>always going to pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

118
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.660
<v Speaker 3>That was me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a lot of pussy when I was </v>

119
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.660
<v Speaker 3>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>

120
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.660
<v Speaker 3>it was a hot chick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

121
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 3>We like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care about wanting to beggars,</v>

122
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.810
<v Speaker 3>just like obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 17 girls.</v>

123
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the pay these girls to come.</v>

124
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the big misconception on </v>

125
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 3>addressing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On my app.</v>

126
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I actually nap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got an APP coming out and I'm just </v>

127
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 3>going to basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what,</v>

128
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll give it to you for free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

129
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to paying for sex,</v>

130
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

131
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have in the past like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

132
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 3>fuck thousands of girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

133
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I paid for maybe like 10 or 20,</v>

134
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:41.531
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not because I have any moral </v>

135
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 3>dilemma about it and it's not because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's wrong.</v>

136
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

137
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:49.121
<v Speaker 3>I think like sex for money is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most like pure interactions because the </v>

138
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:49.310
<v Speaker 3>guy gets what he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girl gets what she wants.</v>

139
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:54.311
<v Speaker 3>There's no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like this whole like sugar </v>

140
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:56.561
<v Speaker 3>daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar baby thing is the biggest fucked </v>

141
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.381
<v Speaker 3>up part because then the guy's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretending to like the girl pretending </v>

142
00:05:59.381 --> 00:05:59.381
<v Speaker 3>he's not</v>

143
00:05:59.381 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking other girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The girls pretending to like him.</v>

144
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.951
<v Speaker 2>It's just like all this like convoluted </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit is prostitution at the end of </v>

145
00:06:05.951 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it is paying for sex.</v>

146
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:12.191
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're not coming out and saying </v>

147
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:12.191
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

148
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:12.191
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want x and I'll give you why.</v>

149
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like the guy from the clippers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>donald sterling and that girl.</v>

150
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all,</v>

151
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>they all have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.561
<v Speaker 2>these five girlfriends there supporting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and then the girls have other </v>

153
00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:23.561
<v Speaker 2>boyfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't tell,</v>

154
00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's this whole fucked up thing.</v>

155
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>

156
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a moral thing.</v>

157
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me it's not a monetary thing.</v>

158
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'd much prefer to just give a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl money fucker and be done.</v>

159
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:38.681
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the girl's not into me then I'm just </v>

160
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 2>like kind of not into the sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the hangup for me.</v>

161
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

162
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually healthy.</v>

163
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

164
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean make these big judgments there.</v>

165
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.230
<v Speaker 4>They're going to make big judgments on </v>
<v Speaker 4>you first of all because you're doing </v>

166
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.300
<v Speaker 4>some stuff that's just like so far to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right end of the spectrum.</v>

167
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how the fuck is he pulling all this</v>

168
00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 4>off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

169
00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:01.480
<v Speaker 4>It's like it seems unattainable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're gonna make well he's this guy</v>

170
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 4>is wrong and these gi would never do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

171
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.890
<v Speaker 4>They're saying a bunch of crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the way you're living is just so</v>

172
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:09.450
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the end of the day,</v>

173
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people just can't wrap their hands </v>

174
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 4>around the fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

175
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

176
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 2>because so many guys are paying right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

177
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:21.451
<v Speaker 2>like people are tricking off in record </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers because of instagram and all </v>

178
00:07:21.451 --> 00:07:22.210
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and the access that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like</v>

179
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 4>tricking off being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying for,</v>

180
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 4>paying for sex in like record numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's unbelief.</v>

181
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be legal,</v>

182
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 4>just like getting a massage should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>legal.</v>

183
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody wants to rub your feet.</v>

184
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to suck your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it should be able to pay both of </v>

185
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.661
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the oldest profession like since </v>

186
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:40.661
<v Speaker 4>the history of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

187
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:40.661
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

188
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:45.521
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they taught chimpanzees the value of </v>

189
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 4>currency that gave chimpanzees coins and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they gave them coins and then every time</v>

190
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 4>the chimps had given the coins to back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the people that give them candy.</v>

191
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 4>You know the chimps did the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing they did.</v>

192
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 4>They gave the coins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the female chimps,</v>

193
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 4>and they fucked up surveys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing they did,</v>

194
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 4>and the researchers like Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is number one.</v>

195
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 4>The first thing they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it added.</v>

196
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Another layer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a little bit about it.</v>

197
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.470
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with it and like </v>

198
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.990
<v Speaker 4>making pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A crime is ridiculous.</v>

199
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 4>There's no victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's getting her.</v>

200
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Think of all the shitty jobs that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can get paid to do.</v>

201
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.470
<v Speaker 4>You can get paid to clean toilets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get paid to fucking insulate </v>

202
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.071
<v Speaker 4>addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of terrible jobs that you </v>

203
00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:31.450
<v Speaker 4>can get paid to mop up the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on a fucking on the floors of these</v>

204
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:31.890
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

205
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.050
<v Speaker 4>jerk houses or the place or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

206
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:34.940
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

207
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

208
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no issues with it.</v>

209
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 4>I think it should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

210
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Speaker 4>it's a victimless crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

211
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:43.800
<v Speaker 4>I just</v>

212
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.040
<v Speaker 2>like for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

213
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 2>for me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

214
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.270
<v Speaker 2>it's the mental thing and I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

215
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't fuck all the girls,</v>

216
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had five dicks.</v>

217
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:53.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

218
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not like bragging like</v>

219
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

220
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kicking you the real deal,</v>

221
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I should.</v>

222
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no victims.</v>

223
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I kissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some,</v>

224
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>there's victims of some prostitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:10.731
<v Speaker 1>There's a people that are abducted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people that are like sex</v>

226
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 1>traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sex slaves.</v>

227
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>That's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not talking about it</v>

228
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.300
<v Speaker 3>that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what you said,</v>

229
00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:18.440
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sex slavery,</v>

230
00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:20.270
<v Speaker 3>that's not really like a girl saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

231
00:09:20.271 --> 00:09:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I want x for y.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's her saying,</v>

232
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:27.011
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do this and you're getting </v>

233
00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:27.011
<v Speaker 3>your ass beat.</v>

234
00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a big way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger difference,</v>

235
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 1>a big difference between that and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you see in La as these girls,</v>

236
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:37.101
<v Speaker 1>they want to wear the nice purses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have nice shoes and they don't really </v>

237
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:41.241
<v Speaker 1>want a job and they want to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice apartment but they don't want to </v>

238
00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I work this out?</v>

239
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.120
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting back to your last thing,</v>

240
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.850
<v Speaker 3>if it was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wouldn't be,</v>

241
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pimp saying,</v>

242
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:48.920
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do this.</v>

243
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:49.880
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your ass beat.</v>

244
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.910
<v Speaker 3>It will all be regulated just like drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealers and also then than the </v>

245
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.910
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

246
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.560
<v Speaker 3>tested and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just be like a whole regulated </v>

247
00:09:59.560 --> 00:09:59.560
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

248
00:09:59.560 --> 00:09:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

249
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.710
<v Speaker 1>as much as I hate pain pills and as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I have lost friends to pain pills and</v>

250
00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:07.711
<v Speaker 1>oxides and all this different shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking wars being fought </v>

251
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:11.821
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not blood in the streets of war </v>

252
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:11.821
<v Speaker 1>as Mexico over pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

253
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:13.180
<v Speaker 1>all that shit is over drugs that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

254
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>As soon as those drugs become legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably less people would use </v>

255
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.231
<v Speaker 1>them and you'd get tax dollars from them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the least there would be some sort </v>

256
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:25.921
<v Speaker 1>of a solution in terms of treatment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and he'd be able to look </v>

257
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.530
<v Speaker 1>at it a little bit differently.</v>

258
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think there's too much money and </v>

259
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.030
<v Speaker 3>kickbacks for that to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

260
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.030
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

261
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.800
<v Speaker 3>I think alcohol is far worse for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>than many drugs and I mean,</v>

262
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:40.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many times have you seen </v>

263
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 3>people get into fights or shoot people </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

264
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 3>wreck their cars because they're high on</v>
<v Speaker 3>al or high on weed,</v>

265
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it never happens.</v>

266
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Never happens on alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

267
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 3>more people are dying from alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>related deaths and there are firearms,</v>

268
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 3>but they want to ban the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

269
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

270
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of real problems with that</v>

271
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.220
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

272
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 1>there's also these companies like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company that makes a fentanyl fentanyl,</v>

273
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it's super strong pain pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a painkiller that's 10 times at least </v>

274
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than a oxycontin's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's what the numbers,</v>

275
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.920
<v Speaker 1>they're spending $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to keep marijuana illegal in </v>

276
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Arizona because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.490
<v Speaker 1>they've got it on the ballot to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreationally legal in the state of </v>

278
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.531
<v Speaker 1>Arizona and so they're putting out all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ads and they have this whole </v>

279
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 1>campaign to try to sway people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just doing it for business.</v>

280
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with public safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>or health.</v>

281
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.130
<v Speaker 1>You see a fucking thing about Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton.</v>

282
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the Wiki leaks things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton,</v>

283
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.310
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wikileaks released some paper where she </v>

284
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.761
<v Speaker 1>was in communication with bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the emails and she was saying </v>

285
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:42.620
<v Speaker 1>that she was going to stop weed and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was going to make sure that we're,</v>

286
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not legal.</v>

287
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Then she was gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do her best and stand her ground.</v>

288
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>And all this nonsense leak reveals </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton promise bankers to stand against</v>

289
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 1>marijuana legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

290
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary.</v>

291
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>She's pretty brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what the fuck.</v>

292
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I know you're bought and sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you have enough money,</v>

293
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money you need?</v>

294
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're gambling with Dan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilzerian,</v>

295
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck's all your money going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read.</v>

296
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.250

<v Speaker 3>pay these presidents like 250 k a year,</v>

297
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>$400,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and they're all worth hundreds of</v>

298
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollar or billionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

299
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.330

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

301
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:19.680
<v Speaker 1>like she was trying to say that once </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill got out of the office,</v>

302
00:12:19.681 --> 00:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>he was dead broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so how the fuck did you guys make all </v>

00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:26.241
<v Speaker 1>that money that they're worth hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>

305
00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:31.230
<v Speaker 1>It's all from speaking arrangements and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay to play and weird fucking shady </v>

306
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.991
<v Speaker 1>deals they have with banks and they do </v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking here and they pay him a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>million bucks an hour.</v>

308
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.200
<v Speaker 1>So preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 3>the more money you have and the more you</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of rub shoulders with these people,</v>

311
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 3>you kind of get a look behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>curtain and you see that,</v>

312
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just uh,</v>

313
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean politics.</v>

314
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 3>If you look up the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

315
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like bullshitting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

316
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Well that is being political is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being yourself,</v>

317
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

318
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're kind of like an anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician it a lot of ways,</v>

319
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.540

<v Speaker 1>Do you get hit up by people that are in </v>

321
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.690
<v Speaker 1>the political spectrum that want to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>your influence and your.</v>

322

<v Speaker 4>do you think you're ever going to go the</v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage route?</v>

369
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Is that possible at this point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look,</v>

370
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a gambler.</v>

371
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to bet half of my net </v>
<v Speaker 4>worth.</v>

372
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm a lucky girl forever,</v>

373
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.180
<v Speaker 2>but that's not to say that I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a girlfriend or you know what I'm </v>

374
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:15.910
<v Speaker 2>capable of being monogamous.</v>

375
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

376
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just for me it's more about options</v>

377
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.570
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the end of the day,</v>

378
00:15:21.571 --> 00:15:26.571
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to most guys earn </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships I feel like because it's </v>

379
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

380
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to jerk off on Saturday night </v>
<v Speaker 2>or I've got to put up with her shit.</v>

381
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 2>And I get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's like in a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's out of laziness.</v>

383
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's not a lack of options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the case may be,</v>

384
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for me,</v>

385
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I think a correct relationship as a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be fucking,</v>

386
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:46.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five or 10 girls and he chooses to hang </v>

387
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.941
<v Speaker 2>out with this one girl because he likes </v>
<v Speaker 2>her and he likes hanging out with her </v>

388
00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 2>and she hangs out with him because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoys his company.</v>

389
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And regardless of what the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:52.890
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

391
00:15:52.891 --> 00:15:57.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that girl's a gold digger or they want </v>

392
00:15:57.891 --> 00:15:57.891
<v Speaker 2>to hate on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

393
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:01.420
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day if a guy has made </v>

394
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 2>his money from successful business and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

395
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 2>being smart and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he hasn't fucked it off like,</v>

396
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he's a doctor,</v>

397
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me is more of a part of who that</v>

398
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 2>guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a girl that's just born hot.</v>

399
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 2>So for a guy to like a girl just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's hot,</v>

400
00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's like the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>superficial thing of all time.</v>

401
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean chess would be nice to.</v>

402
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.430
<v Speaker 4>She can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean hopefully she does,</v>

403
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.460
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying a lot of guys are with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl just because she's hot and they </v>

404
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.241
<v Speaker 2>don't really get as much shit as a girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's with a guy because he's </v>

405
00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:33.241
<v Speaker 2>successful because he has money.</v>

406
00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is true.</v>

407
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the guy who earned that money,</v>

408
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 4>it's his character and his willpower and</v>
<v Speaker 4>his discipline that's allowed him,</v>

409
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 4>his smarts is allowed him to earn that </v>
<v Speaker 4>money or he just got lucky as fuck.</v>

410
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.260
<v Speaker 4>And there's definitely some lucky ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

411
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have to hold onto it.</v>

412
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean once you got money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got every asshole and their </v>

413
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 2>mother with their handout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 2>trying to scam you and it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 2>fuck it off or</v>

416
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make bad investments or you know,</v>

417
00:16:57.411 --> 00:16:58.740
<v Speaker 4>whatever the case might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

418
00:16:58.741 --> 00:16:59.200
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

419
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.470
<v Speaker 4>it is a funny little situation there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

420
00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:06.471
<v Speaker 4>Because like it's also the way women are</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to dress even like a,</v>

421
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 4>like a respectable woman is allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have her tits pressed together and </v>

422
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.360
<v Speaker 4>pushed up and she's allowed to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>skirt that's just like a little,</v>

423
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.850
<v Speaker 4>a little light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vagina curtain,</v>

424
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's really all it is.</v>

425
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Little panties underneath and smooth </v>
<v Speaker 4>legs and high heels.</v>

426
00:17:22.561 --> 00:17:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean the whole thing is sex selling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lust.</v>

427
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.820
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about bathing suits and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that every bathing suit now,</v>

428
00:17:29.821 --> 00:17:34.560
<v Speaker 4>is it basically a thong and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like a bathing suit shows more than</v>

429
00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:36.930
<v Speaker 4>like the most revealing underwear back </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the day.</v>

430
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.990
<v Speaker 4>Ever used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like completely socially </v>

431
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.601
<v Speaker 4>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then on Halloween they could wear even </v>

432
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:44.601
<v Speaker 4>less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They paint.</v>

433
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:44.601
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

434
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:45.570
<v Speaker 4>It's like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but naked.</v>

435
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 4>When the fuck did paint become close,</v>
<v Speaker 4>magically put on our deck and went</v>

436
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd get arrested,</v>

437
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:55.971
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well how come a girl can wear on tits </v>

438
00:17:55.971 --> 00:17:55.971
<v Speaker 5>became,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were paying on your Dick?</v>

439
00:17:55.971 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 5>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to know.</v>

440
00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a double standard.</v>

441
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 5>It is a double standard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to see your Dick painted it</v>

442
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why especially with like American</v>

443
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:04.700
<v Speaker 5>flag or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

444
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to see a bunch of zebra.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is weird.</v>

445
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:14.020
<v Speaker 5>There are weird double standards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also people don't want to open </v>

446
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:14.020
<v Speaker 5>their mouth because they don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

447
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 5>they don't want anybody to think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

448
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:16.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like why do women get do is not,</v>

449
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you complaining?</v>

450
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 5>Poor guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

451
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:24.921
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's also when men complain about </v>

452
00:18:24.921 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 5>the double standard in like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like marriage,</v>

453
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 5>like what you said as far as it being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>gamble.</v>

454
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 5>It's a terrible gamble for a wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

455
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.030
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's essentially a financial agreement.</v>

456
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.440
<v Speaker 5>It's not a love agreement.</v>

457
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking the government permission </v>

458
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 2>to be with a girl and if you decide that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be with them,</v>

459
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:48.621
<v Speaker 2>now you have to go ask the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to get lawyers </v>

460
00:18:48.621 --> 00:18:51.591
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's this whole process that in my </v>

461
00:18:51.591 --> 00:18:52.140
<v Speaker 2>eyes it makes both parties field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

462
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 2>not both parties because usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

463
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like a magnet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one is pushing a little bit further</v>

464
00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the other.</v>

465
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:59.340
<v Speaker 2>And so there's one kind of like always </v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing or whatever.</v>

466
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.480
<v Speaker 2>So for me it just makes the party that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit less invested,</v>

467
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:08.481
<v Speaker 2>just feel trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're in a relationship and </v>

468
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:08.481
<v Speaker 2>you feel trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you want to do is run,</v>

469
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:09.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got this one person,</v>

470
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:14.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that inevitably ends up feeling trapped </v>

471
00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 2>and the other person you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of gets lazy or complacent.</v>

472
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like it just snowballs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 2>there's like a lot of momentum things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

474
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:25.341
<v Speaker 2>So if relationships just starts kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>going downhill and you're trapped in it </v>

475
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:29.421
<v Speaker 2>because you're legally bound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it's just gonna get </v>

476
00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:32.661
<v Speaker 2>worse and worse and the girl is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop giving them blowjobs and the guy's </v>

477
00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:32.661
<v Speaker 2>going to resent it and then maybe he </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheats.</v>

478
00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:37.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this whole cycle that just </v>

479
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.711
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't happen if you were hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he wanted to hang out because </v>

480
00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:39.711
<v Speaker 2>let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

481
00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 2>if you're hanging out with the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like her,</v>

482
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:45.111
<v Speaker 2>she's cool and then she just decides to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just completely let herself go and she </v>

483
00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:48.561
<v Speaker 2>turns into a fat ass and or she just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like stopped wanting to have sex and </v>

484
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:51.941
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to fuck other girls or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to hang out with </v>

485
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:51.941
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

486
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 2>But if you're married to or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have a choice.</v>

487
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean now you're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to ask the government permission</v>

488
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:56.610
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

489
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to get lawyers involved.</v>

490
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.470
<v Speaker 5>You live in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta Oh,</v>

491
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 5>it takes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to agree on terms and you have </v>

492
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.190
<v Speaker 5>to pay for her lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you mean how brutal is that?</v>

493
00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Like you're like literally like trapped </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the same house as the birth,</v>

494
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

495
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.180
<v Speaker 5>it can get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can get crazy and I've seen it get </v>

496
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.180
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you have to.</v>

497
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.550
<v Speaker 5>When people get divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is one of the most stressful </v>

498
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.110
<v Speaker 5>things a person go through in their life</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you're working,</v>

499
00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:26.020
<v Speaker 5>you're working all day and if she's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>working,</v>

500
00:20:26.021 --> 00:20:31.021
<v Speaker 5>that's when it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a buddy who was going through a </v>

501
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:31.540
<v Speaker 5>divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his wife never worked and he was working</v>

502
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.770
<v Speaker 5>10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 hours a day,</v>

503
00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:37.771
<v Speaker 5>just busting his ass constantly as his </v>
<v Speaker 5>own business and she would be fucking </v>

504
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:39.310
<v Speaker 5>off and doing whatever she wanted during</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day.</v>

505
00:20:39.311 --> 00:20:43.420
<v Speaker 5>He had to pay for all that on top of </v>
<v Speaker 5>paying for her lawyer and her lawyer was</v>

506
00:20:43.421 --> 00:20:48.421
<v Speaker 5>trying to fuck him and then he had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>pay for his lawyer to paddle her and </v>

507
00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:48.421
<v Speaker 5>they all</v>

508
00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 4>just dragged the whole thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Took over a year and a half for him to </v>

509
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 4>get divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suffix,</v>

510
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 4>a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This poor bastard just means free now,</v>

511
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 4>but God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but try to get them married now.</v>

512
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.980
<v Speaker 4>He'll fucking shoot you in the face if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you even bring up that word.</v>

513
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:05.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like he went through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have a term for it and </v>

514
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.260
<v Speaker 4>gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a negative free role.</v>

515
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.810
<v Speaker 4>It's where you can basically only lose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have no upside.</v>

516
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for instance,</v>

517
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.520
<v Speaker 4>a negative free roll is like if I were </v>
<v Speaker 4>to tell you,</v>

518
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.530
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

519
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can go bench press 300 pounds,</v>

520
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you $10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I just can't win anything,</v>

521
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:23.731
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you can't do it then I don't </v>

522
00:21:23.731 --> 00:21:23.731
<v Speaker 4>get anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's Kinda like in my eyes,</v>

523
00:21:23.731 --> 00:21:27.631
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like as a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can just lose its kinda like my </v>

524
00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:31.591
<v Speaker 4>buddy he got into a relationship and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just dove in like super hardcore really </v>

525
00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:35.611
<v Speaker 4>fast and I just told them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said look like I just feel like you </v>

526
00:21:35.611 --> 00:21:36.370
<v Speaker 4>don't have a lot of upside by doing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

527
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 4>you can get hurt and if you just take it</v>
<v Speaker 4>slow,</v>

528
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:40.960
<v Speaker 4>like worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

529
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 4>you just weren't quite as close for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>

530
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 4>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

531
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:49.410
<v Speaker 4>if it doesn't work out then now you </v>
<v Speaker 4>invested all this time and this effort </v>

532
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.240
<v Speaker 4>and it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like because he went so </v>

533
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.600
<v Speaker 4>hardcore for this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it Kinda like,</v>

534
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it makes them run away a </v>

535
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:01.500
<v Speaker 4>little bit because they know people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

536
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.330
<v Speaker 4>they just by nature want what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't have rights.</v>

537
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 4>If you just give it all to him </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately,</v>

538
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 4>then it's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like look at this bitch.</v>

539
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

540
00:22:08.021 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 4>The kind of like lose respect for you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

541
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.030
<v Speaker 4>It can happen or it can be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

542
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.160
<v Speaker 4>relationships just have to be organic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it really has to be.</v>

543
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.320
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as you involve legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>contracts,</v>

544
00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:18.890
<v Speaker 4>it's not organic anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

545
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:24.220
<v Speaker 4>Once it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once I feel like once it starts to be </v>

546
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:24.220
<v Speaker 4>forced in anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

547
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 4>then well it's when there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>prenuptial to.</v>

548
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 4>That's when things get really screwy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

549
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:30.520
<v Speaker 4>when you find out how much people </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually have to pay.</v>

550
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 4>Like I've talked about it on my podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

551
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:36.160
<v Speaker 4>but I have another buddy who's paying </v>
<v Speaker 4>his ex wife for the rest of her life.</v>

552
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 4>They were married for 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has to pay her forever.</v>

553
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

554
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 4>She's got a new boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's married,</v>

555
00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:44.200
<v Speaker 4>he's got kids now with another woman to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most brutal part.</v>

556
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:49.201
<v Speaker 4>It's when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they get to the boyfriend and now </v>

557
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:49.201
<v Speaker 4>you're like support and this dude to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bang your wife.</v>

558
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:53.190
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dude lives in his house and every </v>

559
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.430
<v Speaker 4>time they send a lawyer over to check </v>
<v Speaker 4>the date,</v>

560
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.210
<v Speaker 4>the guy packs up his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a joke.</v>

561
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 4>He throws it in a u haul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He drives around the corner,</v>

562
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.480
<v Speaker 4>waits for the inspector to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes all the way around and brings the </v>

563
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.480
<v Speaker 4>shit back.</v>

564
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.870
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking insanity because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got this baller house in the </v>

565
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.200
<v Speaker 4>palisades is living with this girl and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the only way she gets screwed up because</v>

566
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:11.500
<v Speaker 4>if she marries this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this guy doesn't have any money,</v>

567
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.380
<v Speaker 4>so she's never going to marry this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she would,</v>

568
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.050
<v Speaker 4>she would have to bank on marrying this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy would be worth,</v>

569
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I think my buddy pays or somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>around a half million dollars a year </v>

570
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.190
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forever for life.</v>

571
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.560
<v Speaker 4>So they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were married for 12 years,</v>

572
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 4>had been divorced for 15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He's been paying her longer than they</v>

573
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:36.631
<v Speaker 4>were married.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just want to just fucking jump off a </v>

574
00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 4>bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

575
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

576
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:38.980
<v Speaker 4>negative fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

577
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't see the upside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

578
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 4>What's so rare that it works out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other way.</v>

579
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 4>It's so rare that a woman has to pay a </v>
<v Speaker 4>man and it's one of those things where</v>

580
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like men are being victimized left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and right by this and when you talk to </v>

581
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 1>people about their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

582
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will.</v>

583
00:23:52.271 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

584
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

585
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:55.960
<v Speaker 1>you should've got a prenup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

586
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

587
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could say all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

588
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:03.311
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was obviously a mistake under </v>

589
00:24:03.311 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole spell of love.</v>

590
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.730
<v Speaker 1>And to have this be a financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>entanglements that can trap you in this </v>

591
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.880
<v Speaker 1>one I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend doesn't even have any kids.</v>

592
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.460
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any kids with this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

593
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 1>it's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

594
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just a robbery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a legalized robbery.</v>

595
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And I was having this conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a buddy of mine who is married.</v>

596
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.850
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

597
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at it that way.</v>

598
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it this way,</v>

599
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>the the business of divorce and it is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

600
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Whenever there's money involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

601
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people that try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to extract that money of </v>

602
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.991
<v Speaker 1>the lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only money is in taking the money </v>

603
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:38.991
<v Speaker 1>from the rich guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the money comes from.</v>

604
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way you get the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get the money.</v>

605
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:45.740
<v Speaker 1>If the girl doesn't make much money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wins.</v>

606
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.870
<v Speaker 1>If the rich guy gets fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the.</v>

607
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.900
<v Speaker 1>If the legal battle for the divorce last</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years as opposed to two minutes,</v>

608
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.600
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The both lawyers on both sides make a </v>

609
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.691
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman gets a substantial amount of </v>

610
00:25:01.691 --> 00:25:04.001
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy gets fucking drain like a </v>

611
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:04.790
<v Speaker 1>vampire and that's what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>predominantly.</v>

612
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is usually the outcome of a lot of</v>

613
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:10.910
<v Speaker 1>times when a rich guy gets involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything is yeah,</v>

614
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:15.911
<v Speaker 1>he gets drained and that's kind of goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to my previous point of why I feel </v>

615
00:25:15.911 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 1>like women that are attracted to guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are successful,</v>

616
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense because there's just so </v>

617
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:23.160
<v Speaker 1>many people trying to take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker down,</v>

618
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're at the top of the hill,</v>

619
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:25.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.170
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.760
<v Speaker 1>get out there and bringing it down while</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nature.</v>

622
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like a moose having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant set of antlers.</v>

623
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 1>All the other moods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

624
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:37.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at those antlers.</v>

625
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a thing that exists in all </v>

626
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 1>different species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no,</v>

627
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a guy pulls up in a Rolls Royce and</v>

628
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:52.301
<v Speaker 1>he flies into his own private jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does a bunch of things that nobody </v>

629
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:52.301
<v Speaker 1>else can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people just go,</v>

630
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:56.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women automatically genetically get </v>

631
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 1>attracted to that guy for some strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

632
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 1>There is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are buddy bawling,</v>

633
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 1>bawling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of control.</v>

634
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.060
<v Speaker 1>How did you get all your money </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally?</v>

635
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:11.370
<v Speaker 3>So that's another common misconception </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't really,</v>

636
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really talk about it or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or saying anything about it just because</v>

637
00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:20.890
<v Speaker 3>it helped me out so much in poker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

638
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.590
<v Speaker 3>but everybody just thought that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

639
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:23.770
<v Speaker 3>rich trust fund,</v>
<v Speaker 3>idiot.</v>

640
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then my parents gave me all my money</v>

641
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:29.860
<v Speaker 3>so that actually allowed me to get into </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these poker games.</v>

642
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they thought you were a fish.</v>

643
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a weird thing.</v>

644
00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that,</v>

645
00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:40.021
<v Speaker 3>but in poker I've noticed that if a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>loses money to another guy and he knows </v>

646
00:26:42.011 --> 00:26:47.011
<v Speaker 3>that that money's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that other guy out or his quality of </v>

647
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:47.011
<v Speaker 3>life is going to be improved by that </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

648
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:49.080
<v Speaker 3>It really fucking irritates them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like going.</v>

649
00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm guilty of it too.</v>

650
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 3>If I lose $5,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a billionaire,</v>

651
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:59.090
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't bother me nearly as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I lose maybe a couple hundred </v>

652
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 3>thousand to some guy that's like pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke.</v>

653
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 3>And now he goes out and buys a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking car with my money.</v>

654
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like this fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

655
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

656
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:06.850
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why and it,</v>

657
00:27:06.851 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of counterintuitive,</v>

658
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:13.641
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But another thing about it is like if </v>

659
00:27:13.641 --> 00:27:13.641
<v Speaker 3>you lose money to a guy that has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch,</v>

660
00:27:13.641 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>like you always think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

661
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a chance you could win it back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

662
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 3>So there's that piece of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

663
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:22.671
<v Speaker 3>if you lose money to a guy that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really have much and he goes out and </v>

664
00:27:22.671 --> 00:27:23.070
<v Speaker 3>spends it will like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never getting it back again.</v>

665
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

666
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.420
<v Speaker 3>that exists in pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of guys don't want to gamble </v>

667
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 3>with guys only have one barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go play your game pool for 100 bucks,</v>

668
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 3>but he's only got 100 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they might have 10,000.</v>

669
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you look at your upside,</v>

670
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:34.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

671
00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:37.440
<v Speaker 3>best case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk away from this with this guy's last</v>

672
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 3>hundred bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which to me,</v>

673
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.170
<v Speaker 3>some guys get off on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

674
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't really ever want to break a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

675
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 3>But then you look at the d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>The downswing of that is like,</v>

676
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:47.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could spend 10,000</v>

677
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 3>trying to chase my initial hundred bucks</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I lost.</v>

678
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 3>So you have to take that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just a lot of things in gambling</v>

679
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.190
<v Speaker 3>that you've taken to account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the money management,</v>

681
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 3>psychological things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

682
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 3>So how did you make your money then </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing poker?</v>

683
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.300
<v Speaker 3>He made it all playing poker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

684
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>

685
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 3>So what did you do for a living before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you played poker?</v>

686
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the military for four years.</v>

687
00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I got out,</v>

688
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.270
<v Speaker 3>got honorable discharge,</v>

748
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I went to my ship and the ship </v>

749
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.580
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the captain of the ship wants to take me</v>

750
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.070
<v Speaker 3>out to see even though it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be on crutches.</v>

751
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.750
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker.</v>

752
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:42.751
<v Speaker 3>So after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after going through like the hardest </v>

753
00:30:42.751 --> 00:30:43.450
<v Speaker 3>thing and then getting dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

754
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 3>now I'm on a boat and I was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like healing up and this guy wants to</v>

755
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 3>take me out at sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go to Okinawa.</v>

756
00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 3>And I requested to go in to see my </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom teeth.</v>

757
00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:54.850
<v Speaker 3>And then when I was there I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.970

<v Speaker 3>come back in two hours.</v>

762
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:05.950
<v Speaker 3>So I went for a two hour run and in just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my fucking,</v>

765
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 3>It was like a work uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a button down shirt.</v>

766
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I wear a two hour run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a shower,</v>

767
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 3>came back and he looked at my legs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

768
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 3>your legs are fucking destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't believe you can walk.</v>

769
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

770
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:21.000
<v Speaker 3>these motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 3>and so they're gonna kick me out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>navy.</v>

772
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.200
<v Speaker 3>So it just like that was thing I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get medically discharged from </v>

773
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.831
<v Speaker 3>the navy and it took them so long that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually requested to go back and I </v>

774
00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:38.461
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget because I went in and </v>

775
00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:40.411
<v Speaker 3>talked to the CEO of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a limited duty security </v>

776
00:31:40.411 --> 00:31:41.800
<v Speaker 3>detail or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

777
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:43.090
<v Speaker 3>let me get this straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

778
00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 3>you're about to be medically retired </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the military.</v>

779
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:51.121
<v Speaker 3>He goes for broken legs and you want me </v>
<v Speaker 3>to request or approval requests for you </v>

780
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 3>to go to seal training.</v>

781
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fucking stupid are you?</v>

782
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't really know what to say.</v>

783
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I was or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just like,</v>

784
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:02.770
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of my office.</v>

785
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it,</v>

786
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well fuck,</v>

787
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

788
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll have been doing steroids.</v>

789
00:32:07.991 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 3>I feel great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fucking working out like,</v>

790
00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:11.920
<v Speaker 3>well it's been like eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

791
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like I could go do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

792
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up pulling some strings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

793
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:21.570
<v Speaker 3>and basically I just had to get cleared </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I had to pray that I got sent </v>

794
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.500
<v Speaker 3>to buds because if not it'll go to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ship.</v>

795
00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:24.790
<v Speaker 3>And then I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>

796
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 3>it would be the biggest disaster of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

797
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So that was one of my biggest gambles </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing that.</v>

798
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 3>I'd like a free ride for the rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life medically retired.</v>

799
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

800
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:36.550

802
00:32:41.551 --> 00:32:41.551

<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

803
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

804
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:44.630
<v Speaker 3>I went into his office and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

805
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.660
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be the stupidest motherfucker </v>

806
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:49.660
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

807
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

808
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 3>you just better hope that you don't end </v>
<v Speaker 3>up back at this command.</v>

809
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:57.731
<v Speaker 3>He could see goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to clean fucking toilets </v>

810
00:32:57.731 --> 00:32:59.180
<v Speaker 3>until you get discharged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

811
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was,</v>

812
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.060
<v Speaker 3>how would they have discharge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would they have paid you for life </v>

813
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.060
<v Speaker 3>from broken links?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

814
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Delta legs heal up and then you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is like,</v>

815
00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:13.481
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had been basically since it was </v>

816
00:33:13.481 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 3>documented because when I got out of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bootcamp at a school,</v>

817
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:18.250
<v Speaker 3>I had them and I had them all through </v>
<v Speaker 3>buds.</v>

818
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Where is it broken?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bilateral tibial stress fracture.</v>

819
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 3>So my tip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

820
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 3>and then that's the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

821
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.330
<v Speaker 3>The fibula is a smaller one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those in the shins.</v>

822
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was the very one.</v>

823
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then so all through bonds and then,</v>

824
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the boat.</v>

825
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was basically like,</v>

826
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:42.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had broken legs for like a year and a </v>

827
00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:42.431
<v Speaker 3>half or a year and seven months just </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

828
00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Speaker 3>It was basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

829
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:47.921
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this guy's legs are just never </v>

830
00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:47.921
<v Speaker 3>going to fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll right.</v>

831
00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:47.921
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was kind of like the military,</v>

832
00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 3>his take on it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

833
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 3>well he's been on limited duty like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

834
00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:54.260
<v Speaker 3>like his leg should have healed by now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just aren't,</v>

835
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:57.620
<v Speaker 3>so what are we going to do with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why wasn't it healing?</v>

836
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:02.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm still confused because I went </v>
<v Speaker 3>through seal training that kind of </v>

837
00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.800
<v Speaker 3>fucked them up a little bit and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

838
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 3>I was on the boat and I wasn't allowed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to use crutches.</v>

839
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.210
<v Speaker 3>And then I think obviously the final </v>
<v Speaker 3>Straw was probably me fucking going on a</v>

840
00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:15.800
<v Speaker 3>two hour run on a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

841
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:17.310
<v Speaker 3>I did it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

842
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 3>But what was the goal of fighting to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck off the ship?</v>

843
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

844
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.380
<v Speaker 3>this capital was such a dickhead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Brah,</v>

845
00:34:25.381 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I went through all this fucking pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

846
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Like I went through seal training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like letting my legs,</v>

847
00:34:30.411 --> 00:34:31.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking cock sucker.</v>

848
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Like the guy like wanted me to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand watches on the bus.</v>

849
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.100
<v Speaker 3>It was like Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically like a fuck you to him.</v>

850
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:42.190
<v Speaker 3>So you crushed her own legs to get off </v>
<v Speaker 3>the boat and then try to get into seal </v>

851
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.190
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

852
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it took them so long,</v>

853
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:48.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took them so long to process me out of </v>

854
00:34:48.221 --> 00:34:49.871
<v Speaker 3>the military that they had healed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like well fuck wow that's </v>

855
00:34:49.871 --> 00:34:52.070
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just from those broken links,</v>

856
00:34:52.071 --> 00:34:57.071
<v Speaker 3>you could have been set up where you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a pension forever and not only that </v>

857
00:34:57.071 --> 00:35:01.931
<v Speaker 3>but like if you're a disabled veteran </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get like a year eligible for a lot </v>

858
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:01.931
<v Speaker 3>of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

859
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:04.430
<v Speaker 3>if you're like medically retired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like,</v>

860
00:35:04.431 --> 00:35:05.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went in the military,</v>

861
00:35:05.621 --> 00:35:06.670
<v Speaker 3>he tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

862
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 3>be in there forever and like you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>got injured,</v>

863
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:11.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they like make a lot of,</v>

864
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowances for people like that.</v>

865
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Like I think they give you like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>first loan on your house for free.</v>

866
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.020
<v Speaker 3>There's like a whole bunch of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

867
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember because I looked into it when</v>

868
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I gave it all up.</v>

869
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:26.950
<v Speaker 3>So then what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so well then I went back into uh,</v>

870
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 3>into bugs or field training or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

871
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

872
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I made it two days before graduation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got rolled all the way back the </v>

873
00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 3>beginning and then I did the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing again.</v>

874
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 3>And why did you get rolled all the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the beginning?</v>

875
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.770
<v Speaker 3>So when I went through the second time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of had the attitude of just like,</v>

876
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:51.870
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already done this shit and I just,</v>

877
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:53.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>

878
00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was just in great shape and I </v>

879
00:35:59.350 --> 00:35:59.350
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't worried about anything.</v>

880
00:35:59.350 --> 00:35:59.480
<v Speaker 3>So my attitude was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

881
00:35:59.481 --> 00:36:03.350
<v Speaker 3>well worst case scenario I'm just going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get beat and I don't really care.</v>

882
00:36:03.351 --> 00:36:08.351
<v Speaker 3>So I just would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just figured if I passed everything </v>

883
00:36:08.351 --> 00:36:11.081
<v Speaker 3>and I performed well and I didn't quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they couldn't kick me out so I </v>

884
00:36:11.081 --> 00:36:13.310
<v Speaker 3>kinda didn't really like kiss ass or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

885
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

886
00:36:14.271 --> 00:36:14.900
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:36:14.901 --> 00:36:17.060
<v Speaker 3>and if I fucked up it's like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get beat.</v>

888
00:36:17.061 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

889
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I was like pretty hard dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been trained for two years,</v>

890
00:36:21.021 --> 00:36:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I'd already been through hell week and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm doing it without broken legs,</v>

891
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:29.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like going through with broken legs now </v>

892
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:29.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>

893
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:29.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:33.431
<v Speaker 3>like nothing could be bad now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like worth the worst that can </v>

895
00:36:33.431 --> 00:36:33.431
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

896
00:36:33.431 --> 00:36:34.310
<v Speaker 3>we get hypothermia or I'm going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do some pushups,</v>

897
00:36:34.311 --> 00:36:39.311
<v Speaker 3>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I just didn't really have a good </v>

898
00:36:39.311 --> 00:36:39.311
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't too worried about um,</v>

899
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.030
<v Speaker 3>like the other guys in the class because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured,</v>

900
00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would lose Mosa.</v>

901
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean started off with 239 guys and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>came through hell week with like 34.</v>

902
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.330
<v Speaker 3>My first class we started with 119 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we came through [inaudible] 17.</v>

903
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.440
<v Speaker 3>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to lose most of these guys.</v>

904
00:36:57.441 --> 00:36:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

905
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

906
00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't much of a team player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to graduate,</v>

907
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

908
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:04.910
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how they kick you back then?</v>

909
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Well started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got one safety violation,</v>

910
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

911
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.690
<v Speaker 3>for the instructor gave the wrong order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're on the range and we're facing down</v>

912
00:37:14.691 --> 00:37:17.030
<v Speaker 3>range and he gave an about face and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop.</v>

913
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.620
<v Speaker 3>So half the class just did with words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

914
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.480
<v Speaker 3>we did the about face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we drop and now we're like pointing down</v>

915
00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:24.140
<v Speaker 3>range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

916
00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:26.240
<v Speaker 3>So half the class got a safety violation</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

917
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:31.930
<v Speaker 3>And then the second one was we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing I ads like these a live fire </v>

918
00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.280
<v Speaker 3>drills and half the classes behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>berm,</v>

919
00:37:34.281 --> 00:37:39.281
<v Speaker 3>the other half was doing it and then we </v>
<v Speaker 3>switched and I was behind the berm and </v>

920
00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:43.421
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>off my own berm was like a big mound of </v>

921
00:37:43.421 --> 00:37:43.421
<v Speaker 3>dirt.</v>

922
00:37:43.421 --> 00:37:43.640
<v Speaker 3>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

923
00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:45.770
<v Speaker 3>the officer in charge of my class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't really like me.</v>

924
00:37:45.771 --> 00:37:48.830
<v Speaker 3>So he had me on watch every single night</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he put me on the Middle Watch.</v>

925
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.020
<v Speaker 3>So out on the island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

926
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.080
<v Speaker 3>you get six hours of sleep Max if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall asleep when you get off and then </v>

927
00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.080
<v Speaker 3>you wake up the second and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean any of your gear,</v>

928
00:37:58.081 --> 00:38:03.081
<v Speaker 3>you get six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he put me on us on a watch in the </v>

929
00:38:03.081 --> 00:38:06.311
<v Speaker 3>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got maybe like an hour in the </v>

930
00:38:06.311 --> 00:38:08.921
<v Speaker 3>beginning and then I just wake up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>two hours for the watch and then maybe </v>

931
00:38:08.921 --> 00:38:08.921
<v Speaker 3>if I could go back to bed I'd get like </v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour,</v>

932
00:38:08.921 --> 00:38:13.481
<v Speaker 3>maybe two hours asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was running on real low sleep and </v>

933
00:38:13.481 --> 00:38:13.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was behind the Berman.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

935
00:38:13.941 --> 00:38:15.320

<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a big deal.</v>

936
00:38:15.321 --> 00:38:20.321
<v Speaker 3>Most guys did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my crew leader didn't wake me up </v>

937
00:38:20.321 --> 00:38:20.321
<v Speaker 3>because he didn't like me.</v>

938

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a dad and there's a son or </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather's grandfather,</v>

1266
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.810
<v Speaker 2>son and dad and they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all in the military in different</v>

1267
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:52.811
<v Speaker 2>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking to me about maybe </v>

1268
00:50:52.811 --> 00:50:52.811
<v Speaker 2>playing the son and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're having,</v>

1269
00:50:52.811 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was interested in it because I'd </v>

1270
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 2>done a little bit of acting up until </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1271
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1272
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1273
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1274
00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 2>check it out.</v>

1275
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
<v Speaker 2>And so I remember it was like every 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds or minutes somebody would come </v>

1276
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:09.161
<v Speaker 2>up and ask you for a picture and after </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the 20th person,</v>

1277
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.590
<v Speaker 2>somebody came up and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Ron,</v>

1278
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I love a picture with you and I'll never</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>

1280
00:51:16.011 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget for the rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1281
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.160
<v Speaker 2>He stood up and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1282
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.330
<v Speaker 2>you want a picture of me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1283
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:25.331
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sure you don't want a picture of </v>

1284
00:51:25.331 --> 00:51:25.331
<v Speaker 2>this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was kidding.</v>

1285
00:51:25.331 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 2>But I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1286
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is so fucking crazy.</v>

1287
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Now here's a guy that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
00:51:29.121 --> 00:51:31.400
<v Speaker 2>a super successful actor has been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1289
00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 2>big like tv series and like all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are asking to take a picture with</v>

1290
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

1291
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:38.970
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is so fucked up.</v>

1292
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 2>But it was real.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is like a real thing.</v>

1294
00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:43.940
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just like numbers on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

1295
00:51:43.941 --> 00:51:48.941
<v Speaker 2>This is like I'm in a foreign country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got all these fucking people </v>

1296
00:51:48.941 --> 00:51:48.941
<v Speaker 2>coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1297
00:51:48.941 --> 00:51:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I was kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dumbfounded.</v>

1298
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever</v>

1299
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
<v Speaker 1>read that thoreau quote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most men live lives of quiet </v>

1300
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.000
<v Speaker 1>desperation.</v>

1301
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually quoted that in one of my </v>

1302
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:01.610
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1303
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:03.981
<v Speaker 2>that's a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The massive men or something along the </v>

1304
00:52:03.981 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 2>lines of the mass of men lead lives of </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>

1305
00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That quote,</v>

1306
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.480
<v Speaker 1>fucking died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love that quote.</v>

1307
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>That's got a lot of great ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant,</v>

1308
00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:17.490
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that quote is that one of the </v>

1309
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.521
<v Speaker 1>reasons why I think your instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is so popular is because </v>

1310
00:52:20.521 --> 00:52:24.391
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are stuck in cubicles or they're stuck </v>

1311
00:52:24.391 --> 00:52:24.640
<v Speaker 1>in jobs that they don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1312
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.900
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be doing what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1313
00:52:25.901 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so small,</v>

1314
00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:29.950
<v Speaker 1>they're tired all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get done from work.</v>

1315
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any energy to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

1316
00:52:32.561 --> 00:52:37.561
<v Speaker 1>They're saddled down with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is probably not optimal to </v>

1317
00:52:37.561 --> 00:52:39.760
<v Speaker 1>getting yelled at the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going well.</v>

1318
00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of joy.</v>

1319
00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And then they go on your instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking jet skiing and lake mead </v>

1320
00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:46.750
<v Speaker 1>and so all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1321
00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.240
<v Speaker 1>shooting guns and your underwear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1322
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks so fun,</v>

1323
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:52.230
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1324
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:54.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I try and be authentic,</v>

1325
00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:55.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one of his quotes,</v>

1326
00:52:55.481 --> 00:52:57.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than love rather than fame rather</v>

1327
00:52:57.551 --> 00:53:02.551
<v Speaker 2>than money Gimme truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I liked that to have all those </v>

1328
00:53:02.551 --> 00:53:02.551
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1329
00:53:02.551 --> 00:53:02.551
<v Speaker 2>you got it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to truth.</v>

1330

<v Speaker 2>You've got fame.</v>

<v Speaker 2>heroin and la.</v>

1332
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Well it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is rare because it's difficult to </v>

1333
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:12.410
<v Speaker 1>pull off because most people are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really comfortable with who they are.</v>

1334
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.230
<v Speaker 1>So instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1335
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.190
<v Speaker 1>instead of fixing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just kinda pretend you know,</v>

1336
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.070
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1337
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what politics is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a business is.</v>

1338
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 1>When you put that fucking stupid tie on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got those slippery shoes with the</v>

1339
00:53:25.801 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 1>tassels on them and pretending that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really talk like that.</v>

1340
00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about dividends and </v>

1341
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.501
<v Speaker 1>making them know that we can make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and let's touch base on Monday and </v>

1342
00:53:36.501 --> 00:53:39.951
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great to talk to you and like shut the </v>

1343
00:53:39.951 --> 00:53:39.951

1344
00:53:39.951 --> 00:53:41.740
<v Speaker 2>or correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking pleasant trees that just the</v>

1345
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.380
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1346
00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what I wanted to just kind of</v>

1347
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.880
<v Speaker 1>get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with someone about,</v>

1348
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have a lot of money and </v>

1349
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.030
<v Speaker 1>ballers and someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh Oh,</v>

1350
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:57.381
<v Speaker 1>that seems like such an empty life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if we were talking </v>

1351
00:53:57.381 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 1>about you specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're like a perfect example of it.</v>

1352
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's my point.</v>

1353
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm defending you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1354
00:54:01.261 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 1>what's empty about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's having fun.</v>

1355
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so great about showing up to an </v>

1356
00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.150
<v Speaker 1>insurance company every day and putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your work like,</v>

1357
00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:09.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1358
00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:12.240
<v Speaker 1>it's very admirable to provide for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

1359
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:17.241
<v Speaker 1>It's very admirable to put in hard work </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't want to and get it done.</v>

1360
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 1>But there's nothing wrong with figuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to not do that either.</v>

1361
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:26.590
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you got stuck in some sort </v>

1362
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 1>of a weird situation where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grind it out at some lumber yard</v>

1363
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

1364
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean that a guy like you who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just got some crazy life that he's lived</v>

1365
00:54:34.421 --> 00:54:36.240
<v Speaker 1>and where he figured out a way to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of money,</v>

1366
00:54:36.241 --> 00:54:39.700
<v Speaker 1>gambling poker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing card games like that's not,</v>

1367
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:42.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I look at all your shit.</v>

1368
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything wrong.</v>

1369
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I see you having a bunch of fun and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a bunch of girls that are laughing.</v>

1370
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.890
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be having a bunch of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're flying to Italy,</v>

1371
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all this crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything wrong but yet </v>

1372
00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:01.671
<v Speaker 1>people get mad and people hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I have conversations with </v>

1373
00:55:01.671 --> 00:55:05.271
<v Speaker 1>people and Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is shallow about all these </v>

1374
00:55:05.271 --> 00:55:05.271
<v Speaker 1>experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>

1375
00:55:05.271 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 1>what is so awful?</v>

1376
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1377
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.880
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of girls have really </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefited,</v>

1378
00:55:07.881 --> 00:55:09.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build some careers.</v>

1379
00:55:09.231 --> 00:55:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1380
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay polyps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I started dating her,</v>

1381
00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:12.680
<v Speaker 2>she had a 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>followers.</v>

1382
00:55:12.681 --> 00:55:17.681
<v Speaker 2>She bumped up the one point $6 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>and three weeks and now this chick's </v>

1383
00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:19.850
<v Speaker 2>making poor $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year posting pictures on instagram and</v>

1384
00:55:19.851 --> 00:55:20.390
<v Speaker 2>snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1385
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 2>just just think about that for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she's making four times as much as </v>

1386
00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:29.760
<v Speaker 2>a doctor or a lawyer when they get out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of college and,</v>

1387
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:34.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forget about all their debt that </v>

1388
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:34.840
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1389
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:34.940
<v Speaker 2>let's just say they come out of college </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no debt.</v>

1390
00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.410
<v Speaker 2>She's still making five times more money</v>
<v Speaker 2>than them at four years younger.</v>

1391
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Well also the amount of fucking time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to spend if you're a doctor or</v>

1392
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:46.780
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just going through medical school,</v>

1393
00:55:46.781 --> 00:55:48.670
<v Speaker 1>not just going through your residency </v>
<v Speaker 1>but working,</v>

1394
00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 1>constantly working and she's got a post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple pictures.</v>

1395
00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Sit on a couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post a few pictures.</v>

1396
00:55:54.081 --> 00:55:57.760
<v Speaker 1>She stuck her by t her ass up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

1397
00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.230
<v Speaker 1>High heels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

1398
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:04.550
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world of social media is a </v>

1399
00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:05.340
<v Speaker 1>fascinating world man because like </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking for me personally as a,</v>

1400
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:09.970
<v Speaker 1>as a comedian before social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have to do so much work.</v>

1401
00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I used to have to get up early in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and do radio shows before gigs.</v>

1402
00:56:13.931 --> 00:56:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I used to have to do morning TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to do interviews with,</v>

1403
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do an interview with some newspaper </v>

1404
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 1>reporter if that guy did not want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking talk to me and give a shit about</v>

1405
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.450
<v Speaker 1>me and try to have fun with it and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would try to have fun with it,</v>

1406
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:30.451
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it was nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do any of that </v>

1407
00:56:30.451 --> 00:56:30.451
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social media,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's actually fucked it up honestly for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these girls now because they </v>

1410
00:56:40.911 --> 00:56:45.911

<v Speaker 2>Like they don't need to go to parties </v>

<v Speaker 2>you can't really blame them and it's </v>

1426
00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:16.261
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1427
00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:16.910
<v Speaker 2>if I was one of these girls and I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel the world on a private jet and do</v>

<v Speaker 2>all this other crazy shit for free and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

1429
00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

1430
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:26.480
<v Speaker 1>blame them at all as long as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing awful is happening.</v>

1431
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to know this guy,</v>

1432
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.940
<v Speaker 1>we call him wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A buddy of mine used to work at a strip </v>

1433
00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.701
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a DJ at a strip club and there </v>

1434
00:57:37.701 --> 00:57:40.101
<v Speaker 1>was a guy there that apparently invented</v>
<v Speaker 1>bell bottoms is a crazy story and he had</v>

1435
00:57:40.801 --> 00:57:45.801
<v Speaker 1>lung cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He smoked cigarettes like packs and </v>

1436
00:57:45.801 --> 00:57:46.500
<v Speaker 1>packs a day and no emphysema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his doctor was telling him,</v>

1437
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:52.190
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to fucking die if you </v>

1438
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.190
<v Speaker 1>don't stop smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna fucking die.</v>

1439
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:53.280
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just addicted to smoking.</v>

1440
00:57:53.281 --> 00:57:54.890
<v Speaker 1>It was like smoke joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1441
00:57:54.891 --> 00:57:59.891
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've shown in studies that smoking </v>

1442
00:57:59.891 --> 00:58:02.121
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is not nearly as bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually it might act as an </v>

1443
00:58:02.121 --> 00:58:03.570
<v Speaker 1>expectorant it might help clean your </v>
<v Speaker 1>lungs out even though it sounds contrary</v>

1444
00:58:03.571 --> 00:58:05.190
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to logical thinking.</v>

1445
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Just give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy starts smoking weed,</v>

1446
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.640
<v Speaker 1>like he would smoke cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just roll in joint smoking.</v>

1447
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:14.370
<v Speaker 1>He would smoke like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 joints a day.</v>

1448
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he pull up to the Strip club,</v>

1449
00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:21.290
<v Speaker 1>he would give these guys like his </v>
<v Speaker 1>roaches because there's roaches were </v>

1450
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.290
<v Speaker 1>like half done because he would smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1451
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:24.170
<v Speaker 1>smoke cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy changes his entirely.</v>

1452
00:58:24.171 --> 00:58:26.310
<v Speaker 1>He gets so high and he's so high all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1453
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:31.520
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do any of these things </v>

1454
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:31.520
<v Speaker 1>that I'm doing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1455
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:31.800
<v Speaker 1>this is one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want to play guitar?</v>

1456
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And I want a bank checks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when he decides to do.</v>

1457
00:58:35.341 --> 00:58:38.340
<v Speaker 1>He realizes he's like 60 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's worth some shit,</v>

1458
00:58:38.341 --> 00:58:43.341
<v Speaker 1>ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was like right around when </v>

1459
00:58:43.341 --> 00:58:45.171
<v Speaker 1>Viagra was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy goes on a rampage and he's.</v>

1460
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:48.990
<v Speaker 1>But he's mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like really nasty.</v>

1461
00:58:48.991 --> 00:58:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And he did what he would call mad dog in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these chicks.</v>

1462
00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:56.210
<v Speaker 1>So He'd bring them back to his house and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would say nasty shit to him and hit </v>

1463
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.510
<v Speaker 1>him and piss on him and all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

1464
00:58:57.511 --> 00:58:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the full details of it,</v>

1465
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:05.060
<v Speaker 1>but his house was for sale and he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ball baller house in the Hollywood </v>

1466
00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.860
<v Speaker 1>hills and for awhile I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I go to the comedy store all the</v>

1467
00:59:07.861 --> 00:59:08.400
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1468
00:59:08.401 --> 00:59:09.900

<v Speaker 1>maybe I should buy this fucking house.</v>

1469
00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:11.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's close to the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

1470
00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:12.600
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1471
00:59:12.601 --> 00:59:14.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like this $5,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1472
00:59:14.161 --> 00:59:16.020
<v Speaker 1>It's right on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

1473
00:59:16.021 --> 00:59:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you could use the sidewalk and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's his door.</v>

1474
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you just touch his door and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna fucking break into this </v>

1475
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:24.020

<v Speaker 1>with a ski mask robbing your fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to bring them to his house and </v>

<v Speaker 5>Every now and then I wake up and I got </v>

1636
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.190
<v Speaker 5>some new pain and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's this pain like forever</v>

1637
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:54.300
<v Speaker 5>is this going to heal here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this hip thing that's going on lately?</v>

1638
01:05:55.410 --> 01:06:00.410
<v Speaker 5>And it's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I did kickboxing today and no </v>

1639
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.750
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no pain while I'm working out,</v>

1640
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.050
<v Speaker 5>but every now and then it irritates me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and instead of it,</v>

1641
01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:06.720
<v Speaker 5>like when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I had something that irritated me,</v>

1642
01:06:06.721 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

1643
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:08.850
<v Speaker 5>some fucking nothing.</v>

1644
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.880
<v Speaker 5>I'll get over that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's also why I developed a bunch </v>

1645
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.431
<v Speaker 5>of chronic injuries from Jujitsu because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would go and train even though it had </v>

1646
01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:18.300
<v Speaker 5>something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also because Jujitsu is really fun,</v>

1647
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:20.200
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1648
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:23.370
<v Speaker 5>Now I think,</v>

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.061
<v Speaker 1>inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the REGENECA and then three weeks </v>

1804
01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:23.061
<v Speaker 1>later I was boxing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Regina,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1808
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:30.350
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1809
01:12:30.351 --> 01:12:35.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean I literally from like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks later I was boxing like,</v>

1811
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1812
01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:43.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by all the doctors told me I needed </v>

1813
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:43.231
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

1814
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Same thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I've had that said to me twice.</v>

1815
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I need surgery on my neck and I've heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need surgery on my shoulder.</v>

1816
01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I avoided both of them and I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything now,</v>

1817
01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.520
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things about shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries that I've found from Steve </v>

1818
01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty famous,</v>

1819
01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 1>a strength and conditioning coach has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been on this podcast a bunch of times,</v>

1820
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:01.600
<v Speaker 1>is a hanging hanging from Chin up bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1821
01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:06.660
<v Speaker 1>it's so important to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good for your shoulders to </v>

1822
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 1>straighten out your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say bad.</v>

1823
01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck done.</v>

1824
01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:11.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really good for you.</v>

1825
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole video about it with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor who was a shoulder surgery </v>

1826
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 1>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing shoulder surgery on most </v>

1827
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 1>of his patients and started them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1828
01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:25.370
<v Speaker 1>This hanging therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you see most human human </v>

1829
01:13:26.071 --> 01:13:31.071
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially we're primates and most </v>

1830
01:13:31.071 --> 01:13:31.071
<v Speaker 1>primates swing from trees.</v>

1831
01:13:31.071 --> 01:13:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grab a hold of things and they </v>

1832
01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.491
<v Speaker 1>swing and it stretches out your arm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you develop impingements from gravity </v>

1833
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:41.460
<v Speaker 1>from a lack of use or from too much use </v>
<v Speaker 1>or overuse,</v>

1834
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.690
<v Speaker 1>and this guy has you hang from a chin up</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>

1835
01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.840
<v Speaker 1>just just holding on and hanging and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches out your shoulder and it </v>

1836
01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.690
<v Speaker 1>alleviates pain in a giant percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have shoulder injuries and I</v>

1837
01:13:54.691 --> 01:13:59.691
<v Speaker 1>urge anybody who's listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has any sort of shoulder weirdness </v>

1838
01:13:59.691 --> 01:14:00.870
<v Speaker 1>or some shit that fucks with them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just try this.</v>

1839
01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:05.871
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds crazy like how the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hanging by your shoulders going to </v>

1840
01:14:05.871 --> 01:14:09.000
<v Speaker 1>help you and this is one doctor that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the doctor that invented the</v>

1841
01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:14.001
<v Speaker 1>procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he basically explains it really </v>

1842
01:14:14.001 --> 01:14:14.001
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them.</v>

1843
01:14:14.001 --> 01:14:17.670
<v Speaker 1>What did you google so people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder pain hanging from a bar and </v>

1844
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that start </v>
<v Speaker 1>popping up as there's a gang of it,</v>

1845
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's super effective.</v>

1846
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:23.020
<v Speaker 1>It's super effective for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1847
01:14:23.021 --> 01:14:28.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have significant tearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to need surgery of a </v>

1848
01:14:28.021 --> 01:14:29.130
<v Speaker 1>failure of your joint or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1849
01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>

1850
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:35.041
<v Speaker 1>But for a lot of people this offers them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great deal of relief and it really </v>

1851
01:14:35.041 --> 01:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it every day.</v>

1852
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the first things I do in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

1853
01:14:38.051 --> 01:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I hang and then I do a scapular raises </v>
<v Speaker 1>for archery.</v>

1854
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:47.460
<v Speaker 1>So I hang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do like two minutes of hanging and </v>

1855
01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>then once I've done two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I just,</v>

1856
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I contract my scapula and I hold that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>place for as long as I can.</v>

1857
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's like my hands are given out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my forms are given out and then I forced</v>

1858
01:14:55.631 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 1>my scapula to carry all the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you make it a daily routine.</v>

1859
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Just make it is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brush my teeth,</v>

1860
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to do it.</v>

1861
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm forcing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have zero pain,</v>

1862
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:08.130
<v Speaker 1>zero pain in my shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the stem cells was a</v>

1863
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:13.340
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now are you getting the infusion or </v>

1864
01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:13.340
<v Speaker 2>are you getting the like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1865
01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.250
<v Speaker 2>how are you getting it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said earlier?</v>

1866
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they,</v>

1868
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:18.950
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they take it from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

1869
01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 1>a young woman who's had a Sicilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>section when they give birth through </v>

1870
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Assyrian section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take the placenta and then they use</v>

1871
01:15:25.401 --> 01:15:30.401
<v Speaker 1>that for stem cells and that apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the most powerful version of stem </v>

1872
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:35.261
<v Speaker 1>cell therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different kinds of </v>

1873
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:35.261
<v Speaker 1>they use in this country that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1874
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:35.840
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they take your fat out,</v>

1875
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 1>they take your fat out and they convert </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stem cells and I brought into that.</v>

1876
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:41.210
<v Speaker 1>But Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went into his hip.</v>

1877
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:42.770
<v Speaker 1>They got his marrow.</v>

1878
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

1879
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I got a 19 year old bone marrow</v>

1880
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.300
<v Speaker 1>from someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1881
01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went into his own hip and pulled it</v>

1882
01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:56.681
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard great results from a lot </v>

1883
01:15:56.681 --> 01:15:57.680
<v Speaker 1>of different versions of stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know for me personally,</v>

1884
01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:01.610
<v Speaker 1>when they shot the stuff from placenta </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in my shoulder,</v>

1885
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>it was like within a couple of weeks it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was better than it had been in a year.</v>

1886
01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:08.930
<v Speaker 1>And then a few months after that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1887
01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.690
<v Speaker 1>no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how quick it's healed.</v>

1888
01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:16.430
<v Speaker 1>And also did a lot of shoulder exercises</v>
<v Speaker 1>with rubber bands and stuff.</v>

1889
01:16:16.730 --> 01:16:18.530
<v Speaker 1>A lot of different things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on.</v>

1890
01:16:18.531 --> 01:16:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I do all the time now to strengthen up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the area and keep it tight.</v>

1891
01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.900
<v Speaker 1>But you haven't done the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1892
01:16:23.901 --> 01:16:25.550
<v Speaker 1>the Ivs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you did that?</v>

1893
01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that twice.</v>

1894
01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Last route and did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me that it was like he goes,</v>

1895
01:16:29.121 --> 01:16:31.220
<v Speaker 1>it was like the power was coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my hands.</v>

1896
01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1897
01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was weird though,</v>

1898
01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:40.470
<v Speaker 2>the first time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like I had a lot more profound</v>

1899
01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:45.471
<v Speaker 2>effect on the second but the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went down to Mexico because you </v>

1900
01:16:46.231 --> 01:16:51.231
<v Speaker 2>can't do it in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went down there and got like $90 </v>

1901
01:16:51.231 --> 01:16:51.231
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1902
01:16:51.231 --> 01:16:54.450
<v Speaker 2>of the 19 year old bone marrow oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 2>deprived or whatever,</v>

1903
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:57.530
<v Speaker 2>and they injected in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1904
01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:02.660
<v Speaker 2>the next day I went to get some dental </v>
<v Speaker 2>work done and they got a root canal or </v>

1905
01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.721
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they injected 25 vials of like lie </v>

1906
01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:06.990
<v Speaker 2>to Canaan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novacane and whatever it is.</v>

1907
01:17:06.991 --> 01:17:10.430
<v Speaker 2>And they said that my body was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycling through like instantaneously.</v>

1908
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had all this dental work done the </v>

1909
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.430
<v Speaker 3>next day I was completely healed from </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the dental work,</v>

1910
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.490
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:17:16.491 --> 01:17:19.490
<v Speaker 3>And they said they've never given </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that much lighter cane ever.</v>

1912
01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

1913
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:21.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1914
01:17:21.211 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

1915
01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:26.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy asked me if I do coke and I'm </v>

1916
01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:26.981
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1917
01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:26.981
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done that since I was 25.</v>

1918
01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:27.230
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1919
01:17:27.231 --> 01:17:28.910
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally like nobody can,</v>

1920
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:33.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs this much unless they have some </v>

1921
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.771
<v Speaker 3>kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like actually normally really </v>

1922
01:17:35.771 --> 01:17:35.771
<v Speaker 3>drug sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also found that um,</v>

1923
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.450
<v Speaker 3>because I do a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1924
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.730
<v Speaker 3>hrt and I found that when I did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shots like I,</v>

1925
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 3>it was like a lot of people listening to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone replacement therapy.</v>

1926
01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1927
01:17:45.231 --> 01:17:50.231
<v Speaker 3>and so basically I found that it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycled all these drugs faster through my</v>

1928
01:17:50.421 --> 01:17:53.060
<v Speaker 3>system so I'd get a stronger effect but </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it be out.</v>

1929
01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I went to the gym.</v>

1930
01:17:55.530 --> 01:17:57.770
<v Speaker 3>They said you're not supposed to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out for three days or whatever.</v>

1931
01:17:57.910 --> 01:18:02.910
<v Speaker 3>I went to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like four or five days </v>

1932
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:04.961
<v Speaker 3>later and I was like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 20 percent stronger and I mean </v>

1933
01:18:06.401 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 3>I've been training for 20 something </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of done everything.</v>

1934
01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:13.490
<v Speaker 3>So to get like 20 percent strength in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Greece is just fucking crazy.</v>

1935
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so part of Mexico.</v>

1936
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Where do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly?</v>

1937
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I had an address Tijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He it so dangerous.</v>

1938
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.730
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like Mario had,</v>

1939
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I had like the armored cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like made them give me a machine gun.</v>

1940
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had like a machine go,</v>

1941
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.130
<v Speaker 3>you want to your own machine going down </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1942
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.620
<v Speaker 3>She just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in case shit goes down.</v>

1943
01:18:33.621 --> 01:18:36.530
<v Speaker 3>You don't want these guys to get shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>that place like the wild west man,</v>

1944
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:37.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least I'm going out.</v>

1945
01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:39.040
<v Speaker 3>I want to have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1946
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Tiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me like,</v>

1947
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:42.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the wild west,</v>

1948
01:18:42.621 --> 01:18:45.200
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to fuck it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's,</v>

1949
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:50.320
<v Speaker 3>the money's made all through tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if somebody gets gunned down or </v>

1950
01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:50.320
<v Speaker 3>kidnap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to go to Tijuana.</v>

1951
01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.900
<v Speaker 3>So you rarely hear about anything going </v>
<v Speaker 3>down in Tijuana except those drugs.</v>

1952
01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Murders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1953
01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:58.060
<v Speaker 3>That was just the last ones with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>beheadings which were,</v>

1954
01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.050
<v Speaker 3>that was like a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty gnarly shit.</v>

1955
01:19:00.051 --> 01:19:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1956
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know that they didn't want me to </v>

1957
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>fly my plane down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did anyways.</v>

1958
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>But they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1959
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:08.870
<v Speaker 3>you should probably show and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably drive you drive.</v>

1960
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.710
<v Speaker 3>Not that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1961
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last time I went,</v>

1962
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean I hadn't been down there since </v>
<v Speaker 3>the military,</v>

1963
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:18.140
<v Speaker 3>but she seemed like the border crossing </v>
<v Speaker 3>going back just took forever.</v>

1964
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a nightmare and now they want you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1965
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1966
01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:24.420
<v Speaker 3>it just it back in the day it was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to walk across the license.</v>

1967
01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1968
01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Driver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1969
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.320
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did he make it a passport?</v>

1970
01:19:27.321 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Things Canada too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1971
01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1972
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Canada has been like that,</v>

1973
01:19:31.881 --> 01:19:36.881
<v Speaker 3>but Mexico I think you said not be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe Canada used to be licensed when</v>

1974
01:19:38.151 --> 01:19:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I used to go to Montreal is to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1975
01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:41.420
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1976
01:19:41.421 --> 01:19:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Because I used to go fishing trips with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.770
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long ago it was,</v>

1978
01:19:45.771 --> 01:19:49.350
<v Speaker 3>but they definitely uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely changed a lot since you know,</v>

1979
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.890
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to get these injections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just for no reason.</v>

1980
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:53.510
<v Speaker 3>I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it for no reason.</v>

1981
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

1982
01:19:55.701 --> 01:19:59.890
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we only did it once and I did it twice.</v>

1983
01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.350
<v Speaker 3>But the second time I just felt like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just left.</v>

1985
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I actually went straight from burning </v>
<v Speaker 3>man down there,</v>

1986
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1987
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only got 70 and I just,</v>

1988
01:20:10.951 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1989
01:20:11.431 --> 01:20:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I did a fast before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1990
01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:19.360
<v Speaker 2>and I kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda got sick and then I took some </v>

1991
01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.691
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say you're not supposed to take </v>

1992
01:20:23.691 --> 01:20:23.691
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1993
01:20:23.691 --> 01:20:23.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe I fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure,</v>

1994
01:20:23.971 --> 01:20:28.971
<v Speaker 2>but I just remember the first time was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinctly like super strong effect.</v>

1995
01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I believe boss route and went to </v>

1996
01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 4>South America I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember where he said he went?</v>

1997
01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.310
<v Speaker 4>Jamie Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you say Peru?</v>

1998
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy doesn't.</v>

1999
01:20:37.771 --> 01:20:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Can Cue and I know they were doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and determine a.</v>

2000
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just the door if I,</v>

2001
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2002
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.660
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just basically anywhere that is not</v>

2003
01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.600
<v Speaker 2>the US I think.</v>

2004
01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:50.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we got fucked during the Bush </v>

2005
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.501
<v Speaker 4>administration when they did these </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweeping ban on stem cells because the </v>

2006
01:20:53.501 --> 01:20:58.421
<v Speaker 4>religious right and they went back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want you to play God and you </v>

2007
01:20:58.421 --> 01:20:58.760
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't just that they were concerned.</v>

2008
01:20:58.761 --> 01:21:03.761
<v Speaker 4>Stem cells were connected to fetal </v>
<v Speaker 4>tissue and there was this whole idea </v>

2009
01:21:03.761 --> 01:21:08.141
<v Speaker 4>that people are going to get abortions </v>
<v Speaker 4>on purpose just to get the fetal tissue </v>

2010
01:21:08.141 --> 01:21:08.141
<v Speaker 4>and cell this something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2011
01:21:08.141 --> 01:21:10.150
<v Speaker 4>and they probably would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean someone probably will.</v>

2012
01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.520
<v Speaker 4>It probably wouldn't be a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it'd be enough that it would be an </v>

2013
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:15.860
<v Speaker 4>issue with some folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so because of that,</v>

2014
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:20.890
<v Speaker 4>all these European countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially Germany and got way ahead of </v>

2015
01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:23.420
<v Speaker 4>the curve when it comes to stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>research and applications in the medical</v>

2016
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:27.800
<v Speaker 4>industry and now what we're seeing now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you obviously know Regena.</v>

2017
01:21:27.801 --> 01:21:29.270
<v Speaker 4>Keem was invented in Germany.</v>

2018
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:33.800
<v Speaker 4>That's how I found out about it for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>knee like fuck.</v>

2019
01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:36.710
<v Speaker 4>I think it was 20 years ago or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just just realize what a fucking actor </v>

<v Speaker 4>Angel Heart.</v>

2029

<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2031
01:22:01.341 --> 01:22:03.800
<v Speaker 4>the rest of this seems so authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

2032
01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:05.080
<v Speaker 4>It's just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2033
01:22:05.081 --> 01:22:10.081
<v Speaker 4>I just liked that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was perfect for him at the time </v>

2034
01:22:10.081 --> 01:22:13.000
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was an older guy and you </v>

2035
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:13.000
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was kind of fucked up.</v>

2036
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.830
<v Speaker 4>He let his own the part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was perfect for it.</v>

2037
01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he's a fucking amazing actor and </v>

2038
01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:20.850
<v Speaker 4>people forget that because he's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a freak now.</v>

2039
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:26.110
<v Speaker 4>But if you go back to his earlier stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you see like how good he was in </v>

2040
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:27.260

<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2043
01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:36.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever he's doing don't do that </v>

2044
01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:36.690
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2045
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:39.170

2053
01:22:48.721 --> 01:22:50.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like stem cell infusion.</v>

2054
01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You could</v>

2057
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:58.130
<v Speaker 2>test for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2058
01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:03.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>

2059
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.130
<v Speaker 2>the difference between a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a stem cell from you or a stem cell</v>

2060
01:23:04.131 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 2>from me or whatever if been scrubbed and</v>

2061
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:07.030
<v Speaker 5>your system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2062
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:09.460
<v Speaker 5>it's like they said to me as stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stem cells.</v>

2063
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2064
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I paid very close attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>latest cutting edge research for doping </v>

2065
01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because,</v>

2066
01:23:17.321 --> 01:23:22.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm friends with Jeff Novitsky who was </v>

2067
01:23:22.321 --> 01:23:24.241
<v Speaker 1>the guy who busted Lance Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's of course the guy who works for </v>

2068
01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:26.941
<v Speaker 1>the UFC now and he and I talk all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and it's really fucking interesting</v>

2069
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:32.910
<v Speaker 1>how these people who are trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead or like way they're way ahead of </v>

2070
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:37.921
<v Speaker 1>the people that are trying to detect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like now they're developing </v>

2071
01:23:37.921 --> 01:23:41.431
<v Speaker 1>testosterone from animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting because you're </v>

2072
01:23:41.431 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 1>seeing people that are taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

2073
01:23:41.471 --> 01:23:45.040
<v Speaker 1>It's exoticness testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be that they were getting</v>

2074
01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:50.041
<v Speaker 1>it from wild yams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they would do is they'd do </v>

2075
01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:53.101
<v Speaker 1>carbon isotope tests and they would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to detect that the testosterone </v>

2076
01:23:53.101 --> 01:23:55.420
<v Speaker 1>inside of your body's not from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological.</v>

2077
01:23:55.421 --> 01:24:00.421
<v Speaker 1>It's not from an animal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone is actually coming from a </v>

2078
01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:00.910
<v Speaker 1>yam is a Mexican Wild Yam.</v>

2079
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:02.530
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2080
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.680
<v Speaker 1>but now they're figuring out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract it from animals at least </v>

2081
01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.921
<v Speaker 1>theoretically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Novitsky Levitsky says it like it </v>

2082
01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been proven yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty sure.</v>

2083
01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.560
<v Speaker 1>So what they're doing now is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking people's pis and blood and then </v>

2084
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 1>they freeze it and they hold onto it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years.</v>

2085
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:23.910
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that eight years from now</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to find out like new </v>

2086
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 1>detection methods and they're using </v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2087
01:24:24.311 --> 01:24:29.311
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why two Russian Olympic gold </v>

2088
01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:30.580
<v Speaker 1>medalist in wrestling got their metals </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken away from 2008.</v>

2089
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they haven't even gone in 2012 yet.</v>

2090
01:24:34.061 --> 01:24:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So there's 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

2091
01:24:35.411 --> 01:24:36.730
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

2092
01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.920
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are going to get fucked over </v>

2093
01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:41.920
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2094
01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Russia has extensive state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti doping agency.</v>

2095
01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:50.600
<v Speaker 5>They also are pretty big advocates of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they were the ones that started </v>

2096
01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:52.450
<v Speaker 5>back to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:54.000
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they started it.</v>

2098
01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:59.001
<v Speaker 5>But also what's interesting is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists that were involved in the </v>

2099
01:24:59.001 --> 01:24:59.001
<v Speaker 5>program,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all got whacked.</v>

2100
01:24:59.001 --> 01:25:00.180
<v Speaker 5>They're killing these motherfuckers left</v>
<v Speaker 5>and right.</v>

2101
01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.660
<v Speaker 5>All the people that know when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when one guy blew the whistle,</v>

2102
01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:08.810
<v Speaker 5>one of the Russian anti-doping guys blew</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whistle and apparently they just </v>

2103
01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:12.921
<v Speaker 5>started ice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And these motherfuckers see if you pull </v>

2104
01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:12.921
<v Speaker 5>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

2105
01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:16.020
<v Speaker 5>like how many Russian anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists have been murdered?</v>

2106
01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:20.640
<v Speaker 5>They don't fuck around over there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't fuck around.</v>

2107
01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:21.600
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2108
01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:26.740
<v Speaker 5>and from what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Putin is like really into sports </v>

2109
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:26.740
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2110
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:26.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's into fighting.</v>

2111
01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:29.910
<v Speaker 5>Loves fader fade or million INCO.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2112
01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:33.270
<v Speaker 5>whatever happened to that guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

2116

2117
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:40.950
<v Speaker 5>he changed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his body changed.</v>

2118
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:41.760
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

2119
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:45.430
<v Speaker 5>it's indicative of his training methods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never really had much of a body on.</v>

2120
01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:50.740
<v Speaker 5>It's always say Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so strange to be when you see guys </v>

2121
01:25:50.941 --> 01:25:55.760
<v Speaker 5>like him or especially guys like country</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nelson and this guy,</v>

2122
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.590
<v Speaker 5>like I just don't understand how you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could train all the.</v>

2123
01:25:58.690 --> 01:26:00.910
<v Speaker 5>It looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's like so crazy to me.</v>

2124
01:26:00.911 --> 01:26:01.950
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I know.</v>

2125
01:26:01.951 --> 01:26:02.910
<v Speaker 5>Especially Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2126
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:03.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2127
01:26:03.871 --> 01:26:03.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2128
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.870
<v Speaker 4>Big country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.370
<v Speaker 4>He wears it like a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A badge of courage too.</v>

2130
01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.160
<v Speaker 4>I think Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he just have really got super </v>

2131
01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.841
<v Speaker 4>disciplined and lost a ton of way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would be fighting at 185 pounds and </v>

2132
01:26:16.841 --> 01:26:19.040
<v Speaker 4>you'd be knocking motherfuckers to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be visible with that fucking chin.</v>

2133
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 4>This guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big crack.</v>

2134
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.060
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big guys can't knock them out of the</v>

2135
01:26:23.061 --> 01:26:28.061
<v Speaker 4>fucking little guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well unfortunately his chin started to </v>

2136
01:26:28.061 --> 01:26:30.891
<v Speaker 4>fail him in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple of in Mark Hunt knocked him </v>

2137
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just kinda like time.</v>

2138
01:26:31.851 --> 01:26:32.810
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm just saying like,</v>

2139
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:35.990
<v Speaker 4>genetically the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was blessed with the freakiest Chin of</v>

2140
01:26:35.991 --> 01:26:36.860
<v Speaker 4>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

2141
01:26:36.861 --> 01:26:37.520
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like.</v>

2142
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.240
<v Speaker 4>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never understood how you could train </v>

2143
01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:43.730
<v Speaker 4>that much because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously it's genetics,</v>

2144
01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:44.800
<v Speaker 4>but I just remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2145
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 4>when I was in the military like going </v>
<v Speaker 4>through and I'll eat like pizza is audi </v>

2146
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 4>butter.</v>

2147
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:54.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was trying to like gain fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's so fucking cold in this </v>

2148
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.830
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do it.</v>

2149
01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Granted we were training more hours but </v>
<v Speaker 4>like fuck,</v>

2150
01:26:58.401 --> 01:26:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a lot of these,</v>

2151
01:26:59.691 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC guys that I know,</v>

2152
01:27:00.951 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 4>they train six hours a day and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

2153
01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:05.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what Roy eats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good.</v>

2154
01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.230
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's most likely a lot of carbs,</v>

2155
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 4>most likely he's just taken in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>

2156
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:14.540
<v Speaker 4>a lot of carbs and his body doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what to do with it and it just,</v>

2157
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:16.650
<v Speaker 4>he must just have a slow metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

2158
01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he certainly trains hard.</v>

2159
01:27:19.191 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 4>He's got endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2160
01:27:20.451 --> 01:27:23.120
<v Speaker 4>Roy doesn't gas out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he gets tired like everybody else</v>

2161
01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:24.860
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like a fatigue issue.</v>

2162
01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:26.720
<v Speaker 4>She didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy is.</v>

2163
01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.720
<v Speaker 4>I knew Roy way back in the day and Roy </v>
<v Speaker 4>was known as being a really good </v>

2164
01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.440
<v Speaker 4>grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a Brazilian Jujitsu competitor.</v>

2165
01:27:33.441 --> 01:27:36.470
<v Speaker 4>I knew him before he ever did MMA and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when he did mma,</v>

2166
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:37.580
<v Speaker 4>my thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2167
01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:42.581
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see some high level </v>

2168
01:27:42.581 --> 01:27:42.581
<v Speaker 4>grappling from this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's like a stud on the mat.</v>

2169
01:27:42.581 --> 01:27:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just started bombing on the ground.</v>

2170
01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardly ever.</v>

2171
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:50.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one time we really see his Jujitsu </v>

2172
01:27:50.170 --> 01:27:51.430
<v Speaker 4>was in the Andre Arlovski fight when </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fighting elite ECC,</v>

2173
01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 4>took our lawsky down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hadn't been signed control,</v>

2174
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.180
<v Speaker 4>but elite not elite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>ECC was.</v>

2175
01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:01.360
<v Speaker 4>They were really corrupt and they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>this weird thing where if you on the </v>

2176
01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:01.550
<v Speaker 4>ground from whether 15 seconds it </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing up,</v>

2177
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:06.670
<v Speaker 4>so he's on the ground inside control </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a double double wrist lock going </v>

2178
01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 4>for memorial on Orlowski and they stand </v>
<v Speaker 4>them up.</v>

2179
01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Anyone up getting stopped by Orlowski.</v>

2180
01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:13.070
<v Speaker 4>But that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was that.</v>

2181
01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.970
<v Speaker 4>They were making Kimbo slice their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their poster boy,</v>

2182
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:21.971
<v Speaker 4>and it was like Gary Shaw was promoting </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was a boxing guy and he had his </v>

2183
01:28:21.971 --> 01:28:25.550
<v Speaker 4>own idea about how to promote it and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't mma friendly it was just,</v>

2184
01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:30.551
<v Speaker 4>they wanted excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't really want to promote like </v>

2185
01:28:30.551 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 4>in a pure sense of the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2186
01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 4>so it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing was kind of fucked.</v>

2187
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:37.510
<v Speaker 4>But I remember I saw Kimbo was down in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Miami and I saw one of his fights or </v>

2188
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:40.931
<v Speaker 4>whatever and they had like some </v>
<v Speaker 4>alternate gallic coming off the couch </v>

2189
01:28:40.931 --> 01:28:40.931
<v Speaker 4>and this guidance document.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

2190
01:28:40.931 --> 01:28:41.360
<v Speaker 4>seth petrus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>len seconds.</v>

2191
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 4>So that was a bad fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have never taken that fight.</v>

2192
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:49.120
<v Speaker 4>Seth Petrocelli's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I saw that I had known that Kim</v>

2193
01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Boses a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a really good guy to </v>

2194
01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.800
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately he passed away recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just kind of fucked up because he had a </v>

2195
01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:57.740
<v Speaker 4>bad heart and he was scheduled for </v>
<v Speaker 4>another fight.</v>

2196
01:28:58.230 --> 01:29:00.600
<v Speaker 4>They ever figured out what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just had heart disease,</v>

2197
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:02.430
<v Speaker 4>congenital heart defect,</v>

2198
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:03.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2199
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's something that </v>

2200
01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:09.020
<v Speaker 1>happened along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2201
01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:12.570
<v Speaker 1>but he was a really good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretty much universally loved.</v>

2202
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His story is so crazy.</v>

2203
01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I heard the guy that basically almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like walked onto the football team.</v>

2204
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2205
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Living on the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2206
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.550

2207
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:27.280
<v Speaker 1>tough guy knew how to punch and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2208
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:32.290
<v Speaker 1>when I found out about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out about them like everybody </v>

2209
01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:34.971
<v Speaker 1>else did these youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see when he fought Sean </v>

2210
01:29:34.971 --> 01:29:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Gannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gannon was a cop.</v>

2211
01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2212
01:29:37.941 --> 01:29:38.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The White Guy,</v>

2213
01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:39.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2214
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It's all big white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you find that in Sean Gannon </v>

2215
01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:48.770
<v Speaker 1>versus Kimbo slice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a Dojo war and he was a cop in </v>

2216
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:52.671
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got in trouble for beaten up Kimbo </v>

2217
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.820
<v Speaker 1>and like he got suspended I think from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the police force.</v>

2218
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there he is right there.</v>

2219
01:29:57.781 --> 01:29:59.100
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2220
01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.910
<v Speaker 1>They just had this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this brawl in the middle of this Dojo.</v>

2221
01:30:02.911 --> 01:30:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I think Kenny Florian was there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were posted.</v>

2222
01:30:05.371 --> 01:30:10.371
<v Speaker 1>This was a mixed martial arts.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the greatest martial arts </v>

2223
01:30:10.371 --> 01:30:11.010
<v Speaker 1>website on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2224
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:14.340
<v Speaker 1>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all watch this shit live.</v>

2225
01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if we had to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2226
01:30:16.081 --> 01:30:19.940
<v Speaker 1>It was streaming on some website or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that as a of data,</v>

2227
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:23.130
<v Speaker 1>like an aeronautical number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This I definitely remember being like,</v>

2228
01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:25.710
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy could fucking hodges oh yeah.</v>

2229
01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Well we got tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2230
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what John Gannon is a tough </v>

2231
01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean tough as hell.</v>

2232
01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Long time cop real martial artists had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of pro fights and uh,</v>

2233
01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:41.230
<v Speaker 1>there was like all these discrepancies </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the rules because he's got them in</v>

2234
01:30:41.231 --> 01:30:46.231
<v Speaker 1>a standing guillotine and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to break it up and </v>

2235
01:30:46.231 --> 01:30:46.500
<v Speaker 1>there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to let go and all this different</v>

2236
01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2237
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So He lets go and then it winds up going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ground like there was,</v>

2238
01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.680
<v Speaker 1>it was all stacked against Gannon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2239
01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to get submitted and </v>

2240
01:30:57.710 --> 01:30:57.710
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2241
01:30:57.710 --> 01:30:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2242
01:30:58.290 --> 01:31:03.290
<v Speaker 1>again has got ahold of this good team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to let it go and then </v>

2243
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Kimbo winds up getting them down on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

2244
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:05.700
<v Speaker 1>So then kimball's ground and pounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>them see like this,</v>

2245
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:10.850
<v Speaker 1>this is supposed to be illegal to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to be able to do </v>

2246
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:10.860
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But gannon had a fucking head,</v>

2247
01:31:10.861 --> 01:31:15.510
<v Speaker 1>like a fire hydrant and it just super </v>
<v Speaker 1>game and great endurance.</v>

2248
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And so kimball is used to taking these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys out and he couldn't take in and out</v>

2249
01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.770
<v Speaker 1>again and eventually beat him down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had some crazy nonsense,</v>

2250
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:25.250
<v Speaker 1>like a 30 count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he goes down,</v>

2251
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:27.930
<v Speaker 1>you count the 30 before you get back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

2252
01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And he beat it once he beat it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Gannon got him,</v>

2253
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.420
<v Speaker 1>knocked him down again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like you could see Kimbo starting to</v>

2254
01:31:36.421 --> 01:31:38.640
<v Speaker 1>get tired and that was the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

2255
01:31:38.641 --> 01:31:43.641
<v Speaker 1>So he goes from this and then starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting in elite ECC and has some great</v>

2256
01:31:44.191 --> 01:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2257
01:31:45.031 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Some really good fights that James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thompson.</v>

2258
01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of controversial as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I knew him as like a pretty tough.</v>

2259
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean really tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like professional </v>

2260
01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:58.420
<v Speaker 1>skillset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2261
01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.890
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't like the elite level</v>

2262
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.600
<v Speaker 3>and so when he fought Petros Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2263
01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get fucked up.</v>

2264
01:32:03.011 --> 01:32:08.011
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a terrible fight for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Petrocelli's like it's a world class </v>

2265
01:32:08.011 --> 01:32:10.720
<v Speaker 3>fighter that happened real quick now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was.</v>

2266
01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like front row.</v>

2267
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 3>So tell me about your heart attacks if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't show me the video.</v>

2268
01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically,</v>

2269
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2272
01:32:23.891 --> 01:32:27.970
<v Speaker 3>My fraternity brothers were in Park </v>
<v Speaker 3>City,</v>

2273
01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:32.320

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2544
01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:42.430
<v Speaker 3>I ended up staying in the hospital for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like four days.</v>

2545
01:41:42.431 --> 01:41:46.180
<v Speaker 3>I actually fucked my girlfriend in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital with all these cords and crazy.</v>

2548
01:41:49.781 --> 01:41:54.781
<v Speaker 3>I fucked her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had a buddy of my bringing like </v>

2549
01:41:54.781 --> 01:41:56.110

<v Speaker 3>I think the worst patient of all time.</v>

2550
01:41:56.111 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And somehow like,</v>

2551
01:41:58.061 --> 01:42:00.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so give me all these fucking pills.</v>

2552
01:42:00.461 --> 01:42:05.461
<v Speaker 3>I got to take their telling me like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to take these pills for the rest of </v>

2553
01:42:05.461 --> 01:42:05.461
<v Speaker 3>my life for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>

2554
01:42:05.461 --> 01:42:07.150
<v Speaker 3>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after like three days,</v>

2555
01:42:07.151 --> 01:42:09.310
<v Speaker 3>like they fucked my girlfriend eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Chinese food.</v>

2556
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.850
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2557
01:42:09.851 --> 01:42:12.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm like back to being invincible again </v>
<v Speaker 3>through all the shit.</v>

2558
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.940
<v Speaker 3>He's a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2559
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is the exact medical thing </v>

2560
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.310
<v Speaker 3>that's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2561
01:42:21.311 --> 01:42:23.150
<v Speaker 3>for guidance had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should know.</v>

2562
01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:28.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just like basically when </v>

2563
01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:29.390
<v Speaker 3>your heart's not getting enough oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something or um,</v>

2564
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not functioning properly.</v>

2565
01:42:31.871 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually there's like a.</v>

2566
01:42:33.581 --> 01:42:35.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a blocked artery.</v>

2567
01:42:35.051 --> 01:42:38.490
<v Speaker 3>There's like something and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think like coke is a,</v>

2568
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.190
<v Speaker 3>is a vasoconstrictor whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe like constricted my veins.</v>

2569
01:42:42.191 --> 01:42:43.890
<v Speaker 3>So there wasn't like an that isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way I grew up.</v>

2570
01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:48.891
<v Speaker 3>Visal dilator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She shouldn't have balance it out I </v>

2571
01:42:48.891 --> 01:42:48.891
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>

2572
01:42:48.891 --> 01:42:49.150
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2573
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:50.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know the science behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2574
01:42:50.771 --> 01:42:55.771
<v Speaker 3>but I know that like coke and wag or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think you're supposed to make </v>

2575
01:42:55.771 --> 01:42:55.771
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>

2576
01:42:55.771 --> 01:42:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2577
01:42:56.230 --> 01:42:57.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I did a lot of both.</v>

2578
01:42:59.290 --> 01:43:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Should've canceled it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess it didn't.</v>

2579
01:43:01.410 --> 01:43:04.210
<v Speaker 3>I guess my body was like so confused as </v>
<v Speaker 3>going so directions.</v>

2580
01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:06.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like fuck you to shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2581
01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:07.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

2582
01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking terrifying.</v>

2583
01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five years old and have a heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>

2584
01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty crazy.</v>

2585
01:43:13.901 --> 01:43:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your heart,</v>

2586
01:43:14.650 --> 01:43:16.910
<v Speaker 3>your heart obviously works great now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2587
01:43:16.911 --> 01:43:21.911
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did that vegas run crazy bike the </v>

2588
01:43:21.911 --> 01:43:25.041
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a fucking hilarious cause you </v>

2589
01:43:25.041 --> 01:43:27.250
<v Speaker 3>and I were talking about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lance Armstrong gets hold of me.</v>

2590
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.150
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2591
01:43:28.151 --> 01:43:33.151
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I got the text view and </v>

2592
01:43:33.151 --> 01:43:33.151
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you want lance to coach?</v>

2593
01:43:33.151 --> 01:43:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck yeah.</v>

2594
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:36.940
<v Speaker 3>So what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit in the woods.</v>

2595
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:42.900
<v Speaker 3>So I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny because he came out and I </v>

2596
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:42.900
<v Speaker 3>was expecting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2597
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

2598
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:48.090
<v Speaker 3>what kind of drugs do I need to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like ready to get all doped up and </v>

2599
01:43:48.090 --> 01:43:48.490
<v Speaker 3>he didn't really want to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the drug shit,</v>

2600
01:43:48.491 --> 01:43:53.491
<v Speaker 3>which was kind of disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to talk about the drug </v>

2601
01:43:53.491 --> 01:43:53.491
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2602
01:43:53.491 --> 01:43:53.491
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2603
01:43:53.491 --> 01:43:57.000
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought this guy would have like some </v>

2604
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:57.000
<v Speaker 6>like miracle formula.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2605
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.911
<v Speaker 6>I was like ready to get all hooked up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I actually had like a super high </v>

2606
01:43:59.911 --> 01:44:01.780
<v Speaker 6>humor credit count and he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was actually the one that told me,</v>

2607
01:44:01.781 --> 01:44:03.820
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think sleep apnea makes it so that you</v>

2608
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:06.670
<v Speaker 6>have that you can have a really high red</v>
<v Speaker 6>blood cell count.</v>

2609
01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:11.850
<v Speaker 6>So I actually have like the equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 6>of like the guys that are doing the EPO </v>

2610
01:44:11.850 --> 01:44:12.510
<v Speaker 6>and doping,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess</v>

2611
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.460
<v Speaker 4>that helps in some sort of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2612
01:44:15.461 --> 01:44:16.450
<v Speaker 4>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2613
01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:19.210
<v Speaker 4>you're basically at night you're gasping</v>
<v Speaker 4>for air,</v>

2614
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:21.070
<v Speaker 4>gasping for air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're lacking oxygen.</v>

2615
01:44:21.071 --> 01:44:24.010
<v Speaker 4>So it's Kinda like goes back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole like sleeping in an oxygen tent,</v>

2616
01:44:24.011 --> 01:44:25.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the reason you do that,</v>

2617
01:44:25.601 --> 01:44:30.601
<v Speaker 4>it's because you don't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen because you don't your body </v>

2618
01:44:30.601 --> 01:44:33.421
<v Speaker 4>stimulate your red blood cell count and </v>
<v Speaker 4>because red blood cells are what </v>

2619
01:44:33.421 --> 01:44:34.600
<v Speaker 4>transports the oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the less auction you have,</v>

2620
01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:37.660
<v Speaker 4>the more your body produces that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well if it gets to a certain point,</v>

2621
01:44:37.661 --> 01:44:39.640
<v Speaker 4>then your blood kind of turns into </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking syrup.</v>

2622
01:44:39.641 --> 01:44:41.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is amazing.</v>

2623
01:44:41.051 --> 01:44:46.051
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A surprising link between sleep apnea </v>

2624
01:44:46.051 --> 01:44:46.051
<v Speaker 4>and red blood cell count according to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sleep Review magazine,</v>

2625
01:44:46.051 --> 01:44:50.431
<v Speaker 4>elevated red blood cell count or a high </v>
<v Speaker 4>hematic rate is an indicator of a lack </v>

2626
01:44:50.431 --> 01:44:51.640
<v Speaker 4>of oxygen in the person's body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2627
01:44:51.641 --> 01:44:54.280
<v Speaker 4>So sleep apnea can actually give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>more endurance,</v>

2628
01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:55.600
<v Speaker 4>sort of,</v>

2629
01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:57.000
<v Speaker 6>you know that the attire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>

2630
01:44:57.170 --> 01:44:58.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the problem is you don't really recover.</v>

2631
01:44:58.821 --> 01:45:01.190
<v Speaker 6>So I actually got.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually because of him actually ended</v>

2632
01:45:01.191 --> 01:45:03.020
<v Speaker 6>up getting a mouth garbage I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>helped.</v>

2633
01:45:03.210 --> 01:45:05.220
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a really good one and I know,</v>

2634
01:45:05.221 --> 01:45:10.221
<v Speaker 4>I know a really good doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if yours is the same as </v>

2635
01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:10.221
<v Speaker 4>what we'll talk about that letting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mom was like 50 bucks online.</v>

2636
01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:13.560
<v Speaker 4>So it's probably not a guide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's close to here.</v>

2637
01:45:13.561 --> 01:45:18.561
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually pushes down on your tongue </v>

2638
01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:18.561
<v Speaker 4>because the issue is well with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

2639
01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:23.490
<v Speaker 6>mine was they put my jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it kind of moved my back jaw </v>

2640
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:24.110
<v Speaker 6>forward a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kinda like gives me an underbite.</v>

2641
01:45:24.130 --> 01:45:24.530
<v Speaker 6>So I suppose</v>

2642
01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:25.780
<v Speaker 4>airway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know,</v>

2643
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:26.870
<v Speaker 4>that's not the best one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2644
01:45:26.871 --> 01:45:28.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a better one than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me it's,</v>

2645
01:45:28.670 --> 01:45:31.110
<v Speaker 4>it's a life changer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changed my fucking life.</v>

2646
01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys will work out a lot in particular.</v>

2647
01:45:33.721 --> 01:45:38.721
<v Speaker 4>You developed big neck muscles and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>can constrict the air hole and your </v>

2648
01:45:39.721 --> 01:45:43.050
<v Speaker 4>tongue can fall back on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you lie on your back.</v>

2649
01:45:43.051 --> 01:45:44.310
<v Speaker 4>Like if I align my back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2650
01:45:44.311 --> 01:45:45.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sound,</v>

2651
01:45:45.090 --> 01:45:49.350
<v Speaker 4>it sounds hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it sounds like choking and it's just</v>

2652
01:45:49.410 --> 01:45:50.220
<v Speaker 4>terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2653
01:45:50.221 --> 01:45:51.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the same boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2654
01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2655
01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:54.390
<v Speaker 4>so what did he have you do?</v>

2656
01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.580
<v Speaker 6>Lance or lance?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2657
01:45:57.581 --> 01:45:59.010
<v Speaker 6>so I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did it,</v>

2658
01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:00.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did a good ride with him.</v>

2659
01:46:00.730 --> 01:46:05.730
<v Speaker 6>We did like some vehicle drafting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was actually surprisingly really </v>

2660
01:46:05.730 --> 01:46:10.081
<v Speaker 6>fucking hard because you have to stay </v>
<v Speaker 6>close enough to the vehicle to where </v>

2661
01:46:10.271 --> 01:46:15.271
<v Speaker 6>you're like in that draft.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then if you get caught by a </v>

2662
01:46:15.271 --> 01:46:17.911
<v Speaker 6>crosswind and plus if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're drafting a vehicle you can't </v>

2663
01:46:17.911 --> 01:46:19.520
<v Speaker 6>see like what's in the road and if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>hit any shit in the road,</v>

2664
01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:20.260
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2665
01:46:20.261 --> 01:46:25.261
<v Speaker 6>because on my race I blew out a front </v>
<v Speaker 6>tire doing like 30 something downhill </v>

2666
01:46:25.261 --> 01:46:27.550
<v Speaker 6>and almost crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like on the highway doing this</v>

2667
01:46:27.551 --> 01:46:28.690
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I like,</v>

2668
01:46:28.691 --> 01:46:33.691
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have those things that wake you up </v>

2669
01:46:33.691 --> 01:46:33.691
<v Speaker 6>when you're sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2670
01:46:33.691 --> 01:46:36.631
<v Speaker 6>there's debate to try hitting that on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bicycle with little skinny tires you in </v>

2671
01:46:36.631 --> 01:46:38.530
<v Speaker 6>like 30 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that shit that gnarly.</v>

2672
01:46:38.531 --> 01:46:41.380
<v Speaker 6>So it like sent me into the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>highway and I'm getting passed.</v>

2673
01:46:41.381 --> 01:46:43.450
<v Speaker 6>But like tractor trailers that like 70,</v>
<v Speaker 6>80,</v>

2674
01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.910
<v Speaker 6>90 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which if you think about it,</v>

2675
01:46:45.911 --> 01:46:47.920
<v Speaker 6>if you're in a car and it lays waste </v>
<v Speaker 6>5,000</v>

2676
01:46:47.921 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 6>pounds and it can pull a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>imagine</v>

2677
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:55.040
<v Speaker 3>what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do a guy on a bike that weighs 200 </v>

2678
01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.931
<v Speaker 3>pounds plus fucking 10 bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't explain the bet what was the </v>

2679
01:46:56.931 --> 01:46:56.931
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2680
01:46:56.931 --> 01:47:00.540
<v Speaker 3>so it actually originally were in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>poker game.</v>

2681
01:47:00.541 --> 01:47:01.330
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott,</v>

2682
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Bill Perkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2683
01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:04.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2684
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just makes crazy best all the time </v>

2685
01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.241
<v Speaker 3>because he's a real rich guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>likes to just fucking make people do </v>

2686
01:47:11.241 --> 01:47:11.241
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's Kinda like,</v>

2687
01:47:11.241 --> 01:47:12.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poker world too.</v>

2688
01:47:12.211 --> 01:47:17.211
<v Speaker 3>So the first bet was he bet my brother </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he couldn't go three days without </v>

2689
01:47:17.491 --> 01:47:19.250
<v Speaker 3>saying the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2690
01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like 100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2691
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:26.550
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he basically just wanted to shut</v>

2692
01:47:26.551 --> 01:47:29.340
<v Speaker 3>my brother up to pay 100 because he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2693
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.760
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>

2694
01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:36.940
<v Speaker 3>well he ended up buying out because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized that my brother was just like </v>

2695
01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:39.711
<v Speaker 3>such a stubborn asshole that he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to talk for three days and he's </v>

2696
01:47:39.711 --> 01:47:39.711
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>married with kids.</v>

2697
01:47:39.711 --> 01:47:44.350
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have to go out and get any </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy and like you could probably just </v>

2698
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:47.030
<v Speaker 3>sit home with this fucking miserable </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs and just like not talk for three </v>

2699
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:48.360
<v Speaker 3>days and just collect a hundred grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you ended up buying out of that.</v>

2700
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.880
<v Speaker 3>But that's on the honor system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2701
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:55.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean all of this honor system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the thing about the poor </v>

2702
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:58.881
<v Speaker 3>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you lie one fucking time or you </v>

2703
01:47:58.881 --> 01:47:58.881
<v Speaker 3>don't pay a debt back and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2704
01:47:58.881 --> 01:48:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody will fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

2705
01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your word has to be good,</v>

2706

<v Speaker 3>on a drag race and I hadn't even raced a</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's been so many crazy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to think of the </v>

<v Speaker 3>highlight reel a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll think of some other ones later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he ended up betting.</v>

2736
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.280
<v Speaker 3>He ended up wanting to Bet Rick Solomon </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he couldn't ride from La to Vegas </v>

2737
01:49:14.911 --> 01:49:19.911
<v Speaker 3>or Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la or whatever on a bicycle in 48 hours </v>

2738
01:49:19.911 --> 01:49:23.330
<v Speaker 3>and rick called one of his buddies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has set some Guinness Book of World </v>

2739
01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:24.990

<v Speaker 3>you can't do this.</v>

2742
01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:31.440
<v Speaker 3>And so rick ended up turning down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bet and it was just really intriguing to</v>

2743
01:49:31.441 --> 01:49:34.440
<v Speaker 3>me because I'm always up for physical </v>

<v Speaker 3>with no sleep and you run 144 miles like</v>

2747
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:47.540
<v Speaker 3>boats and telephone poles and you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothermia and you're doing all this </v>

2748
01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:47.830
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't sleep for five days and you're</v>

2749
01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:48.000
<v Speaker 3>just</v>

2750
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.450
<v Speaker 6>going the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2751
01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Speaker 6>So I've like put myself through some </v>
<v Speaker 6>likes and I did two of those.</v>

2752
01:49:53.381 --> 01:49:58.381
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I've put myself through some real </v>

2753
01:49:58.381 --> 01:50:01.051
<v Speaker 6>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like physical tests and one of the </v>

2754
01:50:01.051 --> 01:50:03.931
<v Speaker 6>things that you learned there is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>your body's just capable of way more </v>

2755
01:50:03.931 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 6>than what you think or anybody else </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinks is capable of doing.</v>

2756
01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.640
<v Speaker 6>But one other thing that you learn and </v>
<v Speaker 6>gambling is that like there's certain </v>

2757
01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:15.661
<v Speaker 6>things that sound like a good bet that </v>
<v Speaker 6>just aren't just like drinking a gallon </v>

2758
01:50:15.661 --> 01:50:17.800
<v Speaker 6>of milk in and hour like that sounds </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty fucking easy.</v>

2759
01:50:17.801 --> 01:50:22.801
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like there's something with the </v>

2760
01:50:22.801 --> 01:50:23.230
<v Speaker 6>lactose which like most people just </v>
<v Speaker 6>physically can't do it without puking.</v>

2761
01:50:23.231 --> 01:50:24.880
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because there's just some weird thing.</v>

2762
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:25.640
<v Speaker 6>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who would,</v>

2763
01:50:25.641 --> 01:50:30.641
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who would guess that are like saltine </v>

2764
01:50:30.641 --> 01:50:30.641
<v Speaker 6>crackers?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't,</v>

2765
01:50:30.641 --> 01:50:33.960
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's like these weird little </v>

2766
01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:34.330
<v Speaker 6>things that like sound super easy but </v>
<v Speaker 6>you just can't do.</v>

2767
01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would think a gallon of milk would be </v>

2768
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 6>totally doable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2769
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's like,</v>

2770
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:40.210
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a thing.</v>

2771
01:50:40.211 --> 01:50:45.211
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember I like better fraternity </v>

2772
01:50:45.211 --> 01:50:47.641
<v Speaker 6>brother and he ended up puking like I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet him before his midterm and I </v>

2773
01:50:47.641 --> 01:50:47.860
<v Speaker 6>remember in his midterm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2774
01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:50.770
<v Speaker 6>vomiting on a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicked out of his,</v>

2775
01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:54.760
<v Speaker 6>like projectile vomited,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a gallon of milk onto a girl in his</v>

2776
01:50:54.761 --> 01:50:56.590
<v Speaker 6>midterm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I look pretty fucking brutal.</v>

2777
01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.040
<v Speaker 6>A head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2778
01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.910
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we had some funny midterms stories.</v>

2779
01:51:00.911 --> 01:51:03.670
<v Speaker 6>I actually ended up taking my vitamins </v>
<v Speaker 6>one morning with A.</v>

2780
01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:06.460
<v Speaker 6>I had a thing of Ghb and it looks just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like water,</v>

2781
01:51:06.461 --> 01:51:07.140
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh No.</v>

2782
01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:12.340
<v Speaker 6>So I ended up taking like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a full swallow because I had all </v>

2783
01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:14.050
<v Speaker 6>these horse pills.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I took like a full swig and I was like,</v>

2784
01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.730
<v Speaker 6>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2785
01:51:15.731 --> 01:51:17.440
<v Speaker 6>I knew like as a guide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but 20,</v>

2786
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:19.570
<v Speaker 6>30 minutes before I turned into a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking wild animal.</v>

2787
01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:24.570
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I just like got in my car and I </v>

2788
01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:24.570
<v Speaker 6>drove right down and I called.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My buddy was like,</v>

2789
01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:24.570
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2790
01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:26.120
<v Speaker 6>I gotta take this final.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2791
01:51:26.290 --> 01:51:28.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be fucking lights out in 30</v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes.</v>

2792
01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:29.740
<v Speaker 6>You got to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come pick me up.</v>

2793
01:51:29.741 --> 01:51:31.930
<v Speaker 6>But I got to finish as much as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2794
01:51:31.931 --> 01:51:35.890
<v Speaker 6>So I go in there and I got like halfway </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the test and I was just like,</v>

2795
01:51:35.891 --> 01:51:39.030
<v Speaker 6>he ended up like carrying me out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2796
01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:40.380
<v Speaker 6>he was black out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2797
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a state called the,</v>

2798
01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:45.040
<v Speaker 6>it's a date rape drug.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's real hip.</v>

2799
01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 6>Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he used me as well.</v>

2800
01:51:47.111 --> 01:51:48.610
<v Speaker 6>They've used that on people too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2801
01:51:48.611 --> 01:51:49.600
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2802
01:51:49.670 --> 01:51:54.670
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to be a real fucking asshole </v>
<v Speaker 6>to do that because if you mix it with </v>

2803
01:51:54.670 --> 01:51:56.080
<v Speaker 6>alcohol you can kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I know people have done it though.</v>

2804
01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:01.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to be pretty hard up for pussy </v>

2805
01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:01.140
<v Speaker 6>to like risk killing the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fucker.</v>

2806
01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:01.140
<v Speaker 6>But I don't know.</v>

2807
01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking of the throwing up from </v>

2808
01:52:05.690 --> 01:52:05.690
<v Speaker 1>drink a two milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much milk.</v>

2809
01:52:05.690 --> 01:52:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the opiod anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketch with the baby bird?</v>

2810
01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see baby bird know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is?</v>

2811
01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the most disgusting stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone's ever done on the radio.</v>

2812
01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:17.370
<v Speaker 1>They had an eggnog drinking contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this dude,</v>

2813
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:22.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drank 72 shots of eggnog.</v>

2814
01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>

2815
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:28.910
<v Speaker 1>but then projectile vomited and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to figure out what to do </v>

2816
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:29.300
<v Speaker 1>here before he played this pauses for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

2817
01:52:29.301 --> 01:52:31.740
<v Speaker 1>because I'm explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew he was gonna throw up.</v>

2818
01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:35.730
<v Speaker 1>So they had this intern named Pat Duffy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this intern's fucking crazy.</v>

2819
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.330
<v Speaker 1>And I'm dave from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from knocky.</v>

2820
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:40.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the other guy?</v>

2821
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Pat Pat from when knocky is the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>throws up and,</v>

2822
01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Duffy</v>

2823
01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:50.630
<v Speaker 5>is the guy who is laying down there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2824
01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.960
<v Speaker 5>we were trying to figure out what to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the throw up,</v>

2825
01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:55.610
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to throw up.</v>

2826
01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.620
<v Speaker 5>And so this guy had done or like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was it?</v>

2827
01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:58.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2828
01:52:58.841 --> 01:52:59.660
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's an intern.</v>

2829
01:52:59.661 --> 01:53:00.710
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a fucking animal.</v>

2830
01:53:00.711 --> 01:53:05.711
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of them are trying to do </v>

2831
01:53:05.711 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will fucking do anything for us just</v>

2832
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:08.360
<v Speaker 5>for the store and just for the gag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we say,</v>

2833
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.340
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the idea,</v>

2834
01:53:10.341 --> 01:53:12.170
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was hosting fear factor at the time.</v>

2835
01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:13.250
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

2836
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:18.310
<v Speaker 5>here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You lean your head over the edge of the </v>

2837
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:22.030
<v Speaker 5>over the edge of this garbage pail and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he throws up in your mouth and he's </v>

2838
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.030
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it.</v>

2839
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.310
<v Speaker 5>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no fucking way.</v>

2840
01:53:22.311 --> 01:53:23.870
<v Speaker 5>And I think bill burroughs one who named</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2841
01:53:23.871 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 5>he named it the baby bird.</v>

2842
01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.940
<v Speaker 5>And so just watch this because the sheer</v>
<v Speaker 5>volume,</v>

2843
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:32.350
<v Speaker 5>you're not even going to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really all weekend long.</v>

2844
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:36.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm a caroline's all weekend long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the plug.</v>

2845
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 5>So pat had done this before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he obviously,</v>

2846
01:53:39.741 --> 01:53:43.160
<v Speaker 5>he's a giant dude and he was on like </v>
<v Speaker 5>number,</v>

2847
01:53:43.161 --> 01:53:48.161
<v Speaker 5>like 72 and this other kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pat Duffy sitting there with his head </v>

2848
01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:53.200
<v Speaker 5>leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's sitting in a chair leaning back </v>

2849
01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:54.920
<v Speaker 5>with his head over this barrel and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>this day,</v>

2850
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:57.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean they've got tarps all over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>

2851
01:53:57.710 --> 01:54:02.710
<v Speaker 5>Who else was there fear?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was there think red band was there to </v>

2852
01:54:02.710 --> 01:54:04.460
<v Speaker 5>this day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe one of the best moments of my life</v>

2853
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:07.610
<v Speaker 5>just because it was so completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking ridiculous.</v>

2854
01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:09.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here it comes.</v>

2855
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:11.300
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here we go.</v>

2856
01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:14.530
<v Speaker 5>He takes one last chuck and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to throw up this.</v>

2857
01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:16.690
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>

2858
01:54:17.290 --> 01:54:19.960

<v Speaker 7>He throws it his face.</v>

2859

2893
01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:55.820
<v Speaker 5>You could die from that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a woman in San Jose or </v>

<v Speaker 5>Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those places where she was doing </v>

<v Speaker 5>how much water can you drink?</v>

2896
01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:05.670

<v Speaker 5>He brushed his teeth with cat shit.</v>

2901
01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:23.060
<v Speaker 5>He also ate fruit loops in the puke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he took a bowl of fruit loops and </v>

2902
01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.980
<v Speaker 5>mixed it with the puke and ate the fruit</v>
<v Speaker 5>loops.</v>

2903
01:56:27.690 --> 01:56:28.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2904

<v Speaker 5>we can't do.</v>

2906
01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.750
<v Speaker 5>What's the why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why it's just,</v>

2907
01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:39.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just for the story steps and now I don't</v>

2908
01:56:39.001 --> 01:56:40.320
<v Speaker 5>know what we're talking about them </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

2909
01:56:40.321 --> 01:56:42.690
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we're talking about,</v>

2910
01:56:42.691 --> 01:56:43.140
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's,</v>

2911
01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:45.450
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things like that's why</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did it.</v>

2912
01:56:45.451 --> 01:56:48.420
<v Speaker 5>We're still talking about this isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 5>world pre youtube really,</v>

2913
01:56:48.421 --> 01:56:50.700
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember when it was.</v>

2914
01:56:50.730 --> 01:56:53.280
<v Speaker 5>It says 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that's correct.</v>

2915
01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:59.300
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it was earlier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it was like 2003 or four or </v>

2916
01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:02.900
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a long time ago is </v>

2917
01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:02.900
<v Speaker 5>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2918
01:57:03.450 --> 01:57:04.270
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2919
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:05.880
<v Speaker 6>I think that was like the guy in </v>
<v Speaker 6>college,</v>

2920
01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:07.350
<v Speaker 6>so similar to that.</v>

2921
01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:13.040
<v Speaker 5>So back to the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2922
01:57:15.001 --> 01:57:20.001
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the bed is that you can't ride a bike</v>

2923
01:57:21.121 --> 01:57:22.950

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that response you just like laughed at </v>

2974
01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:18.720
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2975
01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:18.720
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like really?</v>

2976
01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:22.141
<v Speaker 6>Like I got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got like five weeks and he's just </v>

2977
01:59:22.141 --> 01:59:25.171
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he just like looked at me like I was a </v>

2978
01:59:25.171 --> 01:59:26.530
<v Speaker 6>complete fucking retard and I'm like no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I've got a bet,</v>

2979
01:59:26.531 --> 01:59:28.390
<v Speaker 6>like I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the guy's like,</v>

2980
01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.340
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what kind of bike do you.</v>

2981
01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.420
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2982
01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:34.270
<v Speaker 6>like you're the bike shop looked like I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't have no fucking idea.</v>

2983
01:59:34.271 --> 01:59:36.670
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it gives me like this race bike,</v>

2984
01:59:36.671 --> 01:59:41.671
<v Speaker 6>which is super fucking uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I go out and I ride this thing and I </v>

2985
01:59:41.831 --> 01:59:46.831
<v Speaker 6>wrote it like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know for like 45 minutes and my </v>

2986
01:59:46.831 --> 01:59:48.730
<v Speaker 6>ass was just like fucking in so much </v>
<v Speaker 6>pain.</v>

2987
01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:51.820
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am fucked.</v>

2988
01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:55.180
<v Speaker 6>Like I think I made it like 11 miles and</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just like,</v>

2989
01:59:55.181 --> 02:00:00.181
<v Speaker 6>this is going to be really brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I ended up finding like a bike </v>

2990
02:00:00.181 --> 02:00:04.261
<v Speaker 6>where like you could sit down a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit more with like a recumbent or </v>

2991
02:00:04.261 --> 02:00:04.510
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was literally a low rider bicycle.</v>

2992
02:00:04.511 --> 02:00:05.500
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2993
02:00:05.501 --> 02:00:08.440
<v Speaker 6>So that'll kind of alleviate a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit of like the ass issue.</v>

2994
02:00:09.250 --> 02:00:11.290
<v Speaker 6>And it gave me like a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 6>different,</v>

2995
02:00:11.291 --> 02:00:16.291
<v Speaker 6>like pedaling position.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I got that and then I felt a little </v>

2996
02:00:16.291 --> 02:00:20.041
<v Speaker 6>bit better about the bat and then I </v>
<v Speaker 6>talked to like written a little bit but </v>

2997
02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:25.420
<v Speaker 6>like nothing over like 20 or 30 miles </v>
<v Speaker 6>and now it's like,</v>

2998
02:00:25.421 --> 02:00:27.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kinda like going hard.</v>

2999
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:30.550
<v Speaker 6>And then I talked to you and I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 6>lance and lance like,</v>

3000
02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:35.551
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you use a fucking any other bike </v>

3001
02:00:35.551 --> 02:00:35.551
<v Speaker 6>other than a road bike,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm not fucking,</v>

3002
02:00:35.551 --> 02:00:36.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't have any need to do this.</v>

3003
02:00:36.611 --> 02:00:37.390
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

3004
02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:40.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it's like a purist.</v>

3005
02:00:40.730 --> 02:00:43.450
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a bike or out of the fucking no.</v>

3006
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:45.970
<v Speaker 6>So I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well listen buddy,</v>

3007
02:00:45.971 --> 02:00:47.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm betting big money on this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3008
02:00:47.741 --> 02:00:52.741
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do whatever the fuck I </v>
<v Speaker 6>gotta do to fucking make it there on a </v>

3009
02:00:52.741 --> 02:00:52.741
<v Speaker 6>bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3010
02:00:52.741 --> 02:00:56.380
<v Speaker 6>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I Bet Rick Solomon,</v>

3011
02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:01.440
<v Speaker 6>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rick thought I was going to die because </v>

3012
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:03.270
<v Speaker 6>like the route that I chose was like on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the freeway and I didn't have a police </v>

3013
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.850
<v Speaker 6>escort at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's like,</v>

3014
02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:08.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy's gonna be driving on the </v>

3015
02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:08.880
<v Speaker 6>freeway at night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there's going to be trucks pass.</v>

3016
02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:09.910
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got a decent chance of dying.</v>

3017
02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:15.330
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's like in the heart attack thing </v>

3018
02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:18.600
<v Speaker 6>now actually went to the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I was like having some shoulder </v>

3019
02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:21.121
<v Speaker 6>pain again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it felt very similar to the last </v>

3020
02:01:21.121 --> 02:01:21.121
<v Speaker 6>things I was like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Rick is like,</v>

3021
02:01:21.121 --> 02:01:25.980
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he likes while you were training you </v>

3022
02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:25.980
<v Speaker 6>were having shoulder pain?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3023
02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:28.080
<v Speaker 6>like after I had done like a long ride.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm one of the nights like I,</v>

3024
02:01:28.130 --> 02:01:30.090
<v Speaker 6>like I actually went to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like kind of word.</v>

3025
02:01:30.970 --> 02:01:34.630
<v Speaker 6>And so rick was like saying that and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

3026
02:01:34.631 --> 02:01:37.810
<v Speaker 6>well honestly let's bet that I'll bet </v>
<v Speaker 6>you I don't die.</v>

3027
02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:40.660
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you a because,</v>

3028
02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:42.110
<v Speaker 6>because for me I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well fuck,</v>

3029
02:01:42.111 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 6>I can't take it with me if I do die,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like fuck it,</v>

3030
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3031
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:50.560
<v Speaker 6>and then it would light up the stakes </v>
<v Speaker 6>for me without really like too much </v>

3032
02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:50.560
<v Speaker 6>risk.</v>

3033
02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:50.930
<v Speaker 6>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>

3034
02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:52.940
<v Speaker 6>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll bet you whatever the fuck you want.</v>

3035
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:55.100
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I'll bet you my plane.</v>

3036
02:01:55.420 --> 02:01:56.500
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was like,</v>

3037
02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.030
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was like 10 to one or 21.</v>

3038
02:01:59.031 --> 02:02:00.820
<v Speaker 6>I think it was like I gave him like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

3039
02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:05.240
<v Speaker 6>I think I initially offered them like 20</v>
<v Speaker 6>to one odds and then we settled it.</v>

3040
02:02:05.241 --> 02:02:05.950
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

3041
02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:10.130
<v Speaker 6>it ended up being where he would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he would lose 250,000</v>

3042
02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:15.460
<v Speaker 6>and I would give him like my plane plus </v>
<v Speaker 6>my pilots for he got my plane and then </v>

3043
02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:18.100
<v Speaker 6>I'd pay the pilots for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We like at all you die,</v>

3044
02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:20.060
<v Speaker 6>you had to die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if I didn't,</v>

3045
02:02:20.090 --> 02:02:24.710
<v Speaker 6>if I didn't complete the race then it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like a wash for me.</v>

3046
02:02:24.711 --> 02:02:27.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm just like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like Rick didn't think I could do</v>

3047
02:02:27.411 --> 02:02:28.100
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>period.</v>

3048
02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:28.460
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

3049
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:30.980
<v Speaker 6>So he didn't think there was a </v>
<v Speaker 6>possibility that I could do it.</v>

3050
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:33.080
<v Speaker 6>And then he thought there was a decent </v>
<v Speaker 6>chance that he could,</v>

3051
02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:38.200
<v Speaker 6>that I could die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for him he thought he was kind of </v>

3052
02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.361
<v Speaker 6>free rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And for me I was free rolling because </v>

3053
02:02:40.361 --> 02:02:40.361
<v Speaker 6>it's like if I die will okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't need the fucking plane.</v>

3054
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:41.790
<v Speaker 6>Ain't going to take me to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3055
02:02:41.791 --> 02:02:44.390
<v Speaker 6>So like I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I made,</v>

3056
02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:49.810
<v Speaker 6>I made the bet with him so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I bet a little bit on the side </v>

3057
02:02:49.810 --> 02:02:53.171
<v Speaker 6>with somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I basically had a million bucks on it </v>

3058
02:02:53.171 --> 02:02:53.171
<v Speaker 6>when I finally ended up doing it and I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3059
02:02:53.171 --> 02:02:56.540
<v Speaker 6>And I cut a police escort like through </v>
<v Speaker 6>vegas.</v>

3060
02:02:56.541 --> 02:02:59.000
<v Speaker 6>So it's so funny because I had like 11 </v>
<v Speaker 6>squad cars,</v>

3061
02:02:59.001 --> 02:03:04.001
<v Speaker 6>like blocking off all the intersections </v>
<v Speaker 6>and here comes this fucking Dildo on a </v>

3062
02:03:04.001 --> 02:03:04.760
<v Speaker 6>bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like riding right through it.</v>

3063
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have all the,</v>

3064
02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:06.410
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3065
02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:09.830
<v Speaker 6>you're expecting like a presidential </v>
<v Speaker 6>motorcade to come or like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>squad cars blocking off every </v>

3068
02:03:15.811 --> 02:03:17.660
<v Speaker 6>intersection and here's this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>asshole on a bicycle.</v>

3069
02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:19.730
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people knew that you were going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do it.</v>

3070
02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.350
<v Speaker 6>They didn't know when you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do it.</v>

3071
02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:24.200
<v Speaker 6>He didn't announce when I didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>announce it because I didn't want people</v>

3072
02:03:24.201 --> 02:03:25.430
<v Speaker 6>to fuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

3073
02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:27.470
<v Speaker 6>Like I didn't want fans to like come out</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3074
02:03:27.471 --> 02:03:29.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or people that hated me or anything,</v>

3075
02:03:29.511 --> 02:03:32.480

<v Speaker 6>I just wanted this bad enough as it was,</v>

3076
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:35.840
<v Speaker 6>it'd be on the fucking highway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3077
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:40.370
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I ended up leaving from Vegas and uh,</v>

3078
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.000
<v Speaker 6>and I did it in about 32 hours was the </v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

3079
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:48.200
<v Speaker 6>And what was the bet?</v>

3080
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:49.460
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

3081
02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:51.830
<v Speaker 6>it was 48.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

3082
02:03:51.831 --> 02:03:52.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I,</v>

3083
02:03:52.641 --> 02:03:54.170
<v Speaker 6>I just remember it because there was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3084
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:57.680
<v Speaker 6>because he was giving me some shit about</v>
<v Speaker 6>cars I was allowed to draft,</v>

3085
02:03:57.681 --> 02:04:00.570
<v Speaker 6>but he was saying that the van that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>had had the doors open like,</v>

3086
02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:05.750
<v Speaker 6>because you had to leave the doors open </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I want to talk to my coach and </v>

3087
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:06.800
<v Speaker 6>they were like filming it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we had the doors open.</v>

3088
02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:10.310
<v Speaker 6>So he was like bitching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rick was bitching about that,</v>

3089
02:04:10.311 --> 02:04:13.640
<v Speaker 6>which was kind of stupid rick to bitch </v>
<v Speaker 6>about because that was like what made it</v>

3090
02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:18.670
<v Speaker 6>the least safe of all was drafting off a</v>
<v Speaker 6>car because you got to be like six </v>

3091
02:04:19.610 --> 02:04:23.060
<v Speaker 6>inches from this car and you can't see </v>
<v Speaker 6>like shit in the road.</v>

3092
02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:25.820
<v Speaker 6>So if they have to slam on the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fucking in the car,</v>

3093
02:04:25.821 --> 02:04:28.280
<v Speaker 6>you're crashing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we had times when,</v>

3094
02:04:28.281 --> 02:04:29.540
<v Speaker 6>like there was a.</v>

3095
02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:34.310
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a time when we're on a fucking</v>

3096
02:04:34.311 --> 02:04:35.900
<v Speaker 6>one lane road,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3097
02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:39.300
<v Speaker 6>And there was um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was.</v>

3098
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:43.620
<v Speaker 6>So there's one lane and were in this </v>
<v Speaker 6>lane and there's lane going this way and</v>

3099
02:04:43.621 --> 02:04:48.450
<v Speaker 6>we had a car come to pass us as another </v>
<v Speaker 6>car was coming.</v>

3100
02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:52.500
<v Speaker 6>And Miss like our van by like inches and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were doing like 50,</v>

3101
02:04:52.501 --> 02:04:57.501
<v Speaker 6>60 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like cross if they were to crash out of </v>

3102
02:04:57.501 --> 02:04:58.590
<v Speaker 6>a dead for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it was fucking bad.</v>

3103
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:04.160
<v Speaker 6>And so like shit got pretty gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of the spots I blew out a tire </v>

3104
02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:06.080
<v Speaker 6>doing like 30 something miles an hour </v>
<v Speaker 6>downhill.</v>

3105
02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:08.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's,</v>

3106
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:10.860
<v Speaker 6>you rest it all while you're doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3107
02:05:10.861 --> 02:05:14.790
<v Speaker 6>I slept for like an hour or two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe an hour and a half.</v>

3108
02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:20.300
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I like stopped to eat but it </v>

3109
02:05:20.851 --> 02:05:23.580
<v Speaker 6>was mostly just just truck the whole way</v>
<v Speaker 6>through.</v>

3110
02:05:23.770 --> 02:05:27.030
<v Speaker 6>And so you stayed on this recumbent </v>
<v Speaker 6>style bike the whole time?</v>

3111
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:32.060
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did half of it on that and half on a </v>

3112
02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:32.060
<v Speaker 6>road bike.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3113
02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:32.760
<v Speaker 6>and then in the second half of it I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't,</v>

3114
02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:34.710
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did know drafting,</v>

3115
02:05:34.711 --> 02:05:37.140
<v Speaker 6>I just did a road bike with no drafting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drafting.</v>

3116
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:40.680
<v Speaker 6>He was bitching about it and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just like,</v>

3117
02:05:40.681 --> 02:05:41.940
<v Speaker 6>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't need it.</v>

3118
02:05:41.941 --> 02:05:43.010
<v Speaker 6>Like it was bitching about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3119
02:05:43.011 --> 02:05:45.630
<v Speaker 6>while you were riding something like </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>

3120
02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:47.070
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was following me.</v>

3121
02:05:47.071 --> 02:05:49.560
<v Speaker 6>So I'm having arguments with them and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was just like,</v>

3122
02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:54.900
<v Speaker 6>it was helpful but it only helped on </v>
<v Speaker 6>like flat,</v>

3123
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.340
<v Speaker 6>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it doesn't help at all.</v>

3124
02:05:57.341 --> 02:05:58.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm uphill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3125
02:05:58.890 --> 02:06:00.360
<v Speaker 6>So no uphill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It helps.</v>

3126
02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:05.630
<v Speaker 6>And on the downhill I didn't need it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you're going so fucking fast </v>

3127
02:06:05.630 --> 02:06:07.610
<v Speaker 6>that like you don't really want to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>going more than like 30,</v>

3128
02:06:07.630 --> 02:06:10.590
<v Speaker 6>40 miles an hour and down hills because </v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you hit shit in the road,</v>

3129
02:06:10.591 --> 02:06:13.110
<v Speaker 6>like you're and you crash,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're fucked.</v>

3130
02:06:13.110 --> 02:06:14.250
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if I crashed,</v>

3131
02:06:14.251 --> 02:06:19.251
<v Speaker 6>like I couldn't finish the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's that and there's shit in the </v>

3132
02:06:19.251 --> 02:06:22.881
<v Speaker 6>road.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm almost like the side of a </v>

3133
02:06:22.881 --> 02:06:24.621
<v Speaker 6>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's like tires and nails and you </v>

3134
02:06:24.621 --> 02:06:24.621
<v Speaker 6>know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3135
02:06:24.621 --> 02:06:25.530
<v Speaker 6>so you don't really want to be going </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3136
02:06:25.570 --> 02:06:28.380
<v Speaker 6>and I couldn't go on the highway because</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't get the police escort for the</v>

3137
02:06:28.381 --> 02:06:33.381
<v Speaker 6>actual highway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The CHP wouldn't do the highway portion </v>

3138
02:06:33.381 --> 02:06:33.381
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3139
02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:35.250
<v Speaker 6>so which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which suck is,</v>

3140
02:06:35.251 --> 02:06:40.251
<v Speaker 6>that was like the most dangerous part.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was in the breakdown lane instead </v>

3141
02:06:40.251 --> 02:06:40.730
<v Speaker 6>of like actually being in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>lanes,</v>

3142
02:06:40.731 --> 02:06:45.731
<v Speaker 6>so there's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's just shit and the breakdown </v>

3143
02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:45.731
<v Speaker 6>lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3144
02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:46.660
<v Speaker 6>just like fucking nails and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you're doing it at night?</v>

3145
02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:47.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was,</v>

3146
02:06:47.591 --> 02:06:51.000
<v Speaker 6>it was like pitch black sometimes we had</v>
<v Speaker 6>high winds.</v>

3147
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It cut down to like 34 degrees at one </v>

3148
02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:56.040
<v Speaker 6>point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Plus with the winds,</v>

3149
02:06:56.041 --> 02:07:00.180
<v Speaker 6>I mean I had a ski jacket on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you're thinking to yourself,</v>

3150
02:07:00.181 --> 02:07:02.570
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A.</v>

3151
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:07.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I've had a lot of those moments </v>

3152
02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:08.730
<v Speaker 6>in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I was more like thinking like I just</v>

3153
02:07:08.731 --> 02:07:13.731
<v Speaker 6>didn't know if I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just didn't know like physically </v>

3154
02:07:13.731 --> 02:07:13.731
<v Speaker 6>because I had just never done any </v>
<v Speaker 6>biking.</v>

3155
02:07:13.731 --> 02:07:17.841
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but my legs were just going to like not </v>

3156
02:07:17.841 --> 02:07:21.171
<v Speaker 6>be able to go anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had no real experience in it so I </v>

3157
02:07:21.171 --> 02:07:22.490
<v Speaker 6>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was my real concern was just like I</v>

3158
02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:24.810
<v Speaker 6>knew mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I was just never going to quit.</v>

3159
02:07:25.530 --> 02:07:30.530
<v Speaker 6>I just didn't want to get injured or </v>
<v Speaker 6>like just physically not be capable.</v>

3160
02:07:30.571 --> 02:07:33.240
<v Speaker 6>That was like my two concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a video of you doing it this,</v>

3161
02:07:33.241 --> 02:07:34.230
<v Speaker 6>watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look this,</v>

3162
02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.090
<v Speaker 6>look at these two cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>

3163
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:38.530
<v Speaker 5>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one fucking lane.</v>

3164
02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:41.170
<v Speaker 5>They just passed each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3165
02:07:41.171 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 5>That was very close.</v>

3166
02:07:45.980 --> 02:07:47.810
<v Speaker 5>Thirty eight hours?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3167
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:50.600
<v Speaker 5>30 to 32 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So 48 hours is the bet.</v>

3168
02:07:50.601 --> 02:07:53.750
<v Speaker 5>And you did it in 32.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How pissed was when you won?</v>

3169
02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:56.270
<v Speaker 5>He actually treated it like a champ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't really give a shit.</v>

3170
02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:58.620
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It got a lot of money.</v>

3171
02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:00.980
<v Speaker 5>He's a baller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is for sure.</v>

3172
02:08:01.610 --> 02:08:03.380
<v Speaker 5>What does this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this your house or my house?</v>

3173
02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:08.570
<v Speaker 5>Just went up on the bike for credit or </v>
<v Speaker 5>are those the grinch?</v>

3174
02:08:11.181 --> 02:08:12.680
<v Speaker 5>The next day I was like green.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3175
02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:18.010
<v Speaker 5>You said the most one is 51 million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the most you've ever won </v>

3176
02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:18.080
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not in one sitting.</v>

3177
02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:22.370
<v Speaker 5>That was over a course of eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine months.</v>

3178
02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:27.400
<v Speaker 5>And that was just you going at it with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this one dude and you guys playing one </v>

3179
02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:28.670
<v Speaker 5>on one when you're doing shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3180
02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:32.590
<v Speaker 5>I remember there was one point where I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was sitting there,</v>

3181
02:08:32.610 --> 02:08:33.970
<v Speaker 5>that's a Granola Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3182
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:35.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that sound?</v>

3183
02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:41.370
<v Speaker 5>And I checked my watch in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there was one point when at 18 </v>

3184
02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:42.740
<v Speaker 5>million bucks in front of me and he had </v>
<v Speaker 5>me covered.</v>

3185
02:08:42.741 --> 02:08:45.440
<v Speaker 5>So if he said all I had to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>decision for 18 million bucks,</v>

3186
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:47.450
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a billionaire.</v>

3187
02:08:47.451 --> 02:08:52.451
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eighteen dollars million on a hand in </v>

3188
02:08:52.451 --> 02:08:53.990
<v Speaker 5>one hand up over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the most you've ever had.</v>

3189
02:08:53.991 --> 02:08:57.820
<v Speaker 5>On one hand it was,</v>

3190
02:09:05.090 --> 02:09:05.930
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like</v>

3191
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:08.090
<v Speaker 9>14,</v>

3192
02:09:08.210 --> 02:09:10.370
<v Speaker 5>10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 million bucks.</v>

3193
02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Obviously you had a buildup to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

3194
02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:17.540
<v Speaker 5>At any point in time while you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>gambling these ridiculous sums of money.</v>

3195
02:09:17.541 --> 02:09:20.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is not that long since you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were broke.</v>

3196
02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:23.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is like you going from </v>
<v Speaker 5>college to you doing this,</v>

3197
02:09:23.810 --> 02:09:25.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're only talking about a decade or so.</v>

3198
02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:26.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3199
02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.630
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3200
02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:32.360
<v Speaker 5>there was periods of time when been </v>
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>

3201
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:35.780
<v Speaker 5>I've played with like almost my entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>net worth on the day.</v>

3202
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:39.530
<v Speaker 5>Will players do that kind of shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

3203
02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:41.560
<v Speaker 6>Stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

3204
02:09:41.650 --> 02:09:45.340
<v Speaker 6>I've had my hair fall out before playing</v>
<v Speaker 6>just because you're too freaking out.</v>

3205
02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:47.640
<v Speaker 6>Shouldn't stress man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3206
02:09:47.641 --> 02:09:52.641
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's just so many things that </v>

3207
02:09:52.641 --> 02:09:52.641
<v Speaker 6>go into it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you're,</v>

3208
02:09:52.641 --> 02:09:53.230
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not only thinking about like what</v>

3209
02:09:53.231 --> 02:09:56.320
<v Speaker 6>that person has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like what do they like?</v>

3210
02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:58.300
<v Speaker 6>What did they think that you think that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they have?</v>

3211
02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:03.780
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the basic step is what do you </v>

3212
02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:06.421
<v Speaker 6>think that they think that you have and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then like the range of hands that they </v>

3213
02:10:06.421 --> 02:10:07.930
<v Speaker 6>could have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3214
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:09.880
<v Speaker 6>why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why,</v>

3215
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:12.340
<v Speaker 6>why would he be betting this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why would he be calling here?</v>

3216
02:10:12.341 --> 02:10:17.341
<v Speaker 6>What type of hands could he have?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what are the probabilities that </v>

3217
02:10:17.341 --> 02:10:17.800
<v Speaker 6>he's bluffing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what is his mental state?</v>

3218
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:22.390
<v Speaker 6>I mean like trying to pick up on telus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's just so many things that go into</v>

3219
02:10:22.391 --> 02:10:25.360
<v Speaker 6>it that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're so focused and it's so much money</v>

3220
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:28.510
<v Speaker 6>and any little mistake that you make is </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to cost you millions of dollars.</v>

3221
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:31.330
<v Speaker 6>So it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is like a lot.</v>

3222
02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:34.610
<v Speaker 6>And you're playing for sometimes 16,</v>
<v Speaker 6>17 hours.</v>

3223
02:10:34.611 --> 02:10:39.611
<v Speaker 6>Like you're just like delirious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember one time while you're </v>

3224
02:10:39.611 --> 02:10:42.431
<v Speaker 6>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you take like provigil or add </v>

3225
02:10:42.431 --> 02:10:44.890
<v Speaker 6>adderall or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I took adderall and it really fucked me </v>

3226
02:10:44.890 --> 02:10:47.771
<v Speaker 6>up because I just like try to win every </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand and it may be too aggressive and I </v>

3227
02:10:47.771 --> 02:10:49.250
<v Speaker 6>just fucking plane crash into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountain.</v>

3228
02:10:49.251 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 6>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So try that a couple times.</v>

3229
02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:52.960
<v Speaker 6>No good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3230
02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:59.080
<v Speaker 6>try weed and it fucking was terrible </v>
<v Speaker 6>every time I was bluffing a little </v>

3231
02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:01.390
<v Speaker 6>paranoid so I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3232
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:06.430
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then sometimes I've taken like </v>

3233
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.430
<v Speaker 6>volume just so fucking relax,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3234
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:07.820
<v Speaker 6>because I'm just like strung out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then that makes you kind of not give</v>

3235
02:11:07.821 --> 02:11:10.640
<v Speaker 6>a fuck and so you do stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>

3236
02:11:10.670 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just almost got to be sober.</v>

3237
02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.730
<v Speaker 6>What about Beta blockers?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3238
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:15.590
<v Speaker 6>I never tried them.</v>

3239
02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.760
<v Speaker 5>I never tried to meet her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I saw this thing on concert </v>

3240
02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:24.810
<v Speaker 5>performers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a penis or it was actually some </v>

3241
02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:25.510
<v Speaker 5>people that playing in an orchestra.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were talking about,</v>

3242
02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:30.540
<v Speaker 5>they took Beta blockers and it made a </v>
<v Speaker 5>massive impact because they were super </v>

3243
02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:30.760
<v Speaker 5>nervous about performing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I always thought about it.</v>

3244
02:11:30.761 --> 02:11:31.390
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3245
02:11:31.391 --> 02:11:36.391
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it just stops you from getting </v>

3246
02:11:36.391 --> 02:11:38.971
<v Speaker 5>nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would be really curious to see what </v>

3247
02:11:38.971 --> 02:11:38.971
<v Speaker 5>that feels like.</v>

3248
02:11:38.971 --> 02:11:38.971
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3249
02:11:38.971 --> 02:11:38.971
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that'd be interesting.</v>

3250
02:11:38.971 --> 02:11:39.720
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3251
02:11:41.010 --> 02:11:42.300
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've definitely heard of that.</v>

3252
02:11:42.301 --> 02:11:47.301
<v Speaker 6>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a big thing for actors and </v>

3253
02:11:47.301 --> 02:11:47.301
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that with stage fright or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3254
02:11:47.301 --> 02:11:51.690
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At just don't know how long it lasts </v>

3255
02:11:51.690 --> 02:11:51.690
<v Speaker 6>because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean these are,</v>

3256
02:11:51.690 --> 02:11:55.011
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about 18 hours sessions </v>

3257
02:11:55.011 --> 02:11:55.011
<v Speaker 6>and it's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And also you don't want anything to fuck</v>

3258
02:11:55.011 --> 02:11:55.170
<v Speaker 6>with your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like mental acuity.</v>

3259
02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:56.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3260
02:11:56.430 --> 02:11:56.970
<v Speaker 6>so</v>

3261
02:11:57.510 --> 02:12:02.510
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you lead your study strategy and </v>

3262
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.510
<v Speaker 5>read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>read poker books?</v>

3263
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.510
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

3264
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:03.030
<v Speaker 6>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did,</v>

3265
02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:08.300
<v Speaker 6>I did back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but back in the day it wasn't quite as </v>

3266
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:08.490
<v Speaker 6>advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now they have so much stuff online where</v>

3267
02:12:08.491 --> 02:12:13.491
<v Speaker 6>you can basically watch these pros play.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'll give you an example.</v>

3268
02:12:13.501 --> 02:12:15.610
<v Speaker 6>Back when I was playing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3269
02:12:16.110 --> 02:12:20.610
<v Speaker 6>I would play in college.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I played 10 tables at a time.</v>

3270
02:12:20.611 --> 02:12:22.140
<v Speaker 6>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3271
02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.210
<v Speaker 6>and you would see about 100 hands an </v>
<v Speaker 6>hour.</v>

3272
02:12:24.450 --> 02:12:29.450
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and let's say I just played for a 10 </v>

3273
02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:31.551
<v Speaker 6>hour session.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you're playing 10 tables </v>

3274
02:12:31.551 --> 02:12:31.551
<v Speaker 6>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you do that?</v>

3275
02:12:31.551 --> 02:12:31.980
<v Speaker 6>You have like 10 windows open up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3276
02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:32.900
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3277
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:33.670
<v Speaker 6>You're going click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

3278
02:12:33.671 --> 02:12:34.100
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click.</v>

3279
02:12:34.110 --> 02:12:39.110
<v Speaker 6>All between all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Many of sometimes you have multiple </v>

3280
02:12:39.110 --> 02:12:39.110
<v Speaker 6>monitors set up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3281
02:12:39.110 --> 02:12:43.580
<v Speaker 6>and so basically in that period,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you extrapolate that out,</v>

3282
02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:45.120
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3283
02:12:45.121 --> 02:12:47.820
<v Speaker 6>you're seeing 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>hands right in that 10 hours of sessions</v>

3284
02:12:47.821 --> 02:12:52.740
<v Speaker 6>because 100 hands an hour per table </v>
<v Speaker 6>times 10 times 10 times 100.</v>

3285
02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:56.670
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so if you plan a casino,</v>

3286
02:12:56.850 --> 02:13:00.810
<v Speaker 6>you're seeing about 20 hands an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're obviously only playing one table.</v>

3287
02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:04.440
<v Speaker 6>So that translates to 200 hands for that</v>
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

3288
02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:08.050
<v Speaker 6>So have one one day playing online,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen 10,000</v>

3289
02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:09.080
<v Speaker 6>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one plant,</v>

3290
02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.120
<v Speaker 6>one day playing live have seen 200.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you can imagine one day playing </v>

3291
02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:18.231
<v Speaker 6>online,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen more hands than a guy that's </v>

3292
02:13:18.231 --> 02:13:20.391
<v Speaker 6>played in a casino for his entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So just think about those numbers.</v>

3293
02:13:20.791 --> 02:13:23.580
<v Speaker 6>And so the thing is like when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>playing in casino.</v>

3294
02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:25.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

3295
02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:26.490
<v Speaker 6>This picture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's that dude?</v>

3296
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:28.200
<v Speaker 6>Lke,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's his name?</v>

3297
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:29.700
<v Speaker 6>Lke Elk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

3298
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:31.800
<v Speaker 6>That's his whole name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was He like Oprah?</v>

3299
02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:34.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

3300
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:37.170
<v Speaker 6>I think he's a Swedish guy or something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

3301
02:13:37.171 --> 02:13:42.171
<v Speaker 6>And so he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got four giant monitors going on </v>

3302
02:13:42.171 --> 02:13:43.320
<v Speaker 6>that like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean these guys are say more tables.</v>

3303
02:13:44.290 --> 02:13:45.960
<v Speaker 6>That guy's got 12 on each side.</v>

3304
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3305
02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:49.620
<v Speaker 6>So I mean this is what it's evolved to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3306
02:13:49.621 --> 02:13:52.860
<v Speaker 6>I was like one of the pioneers of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff because this guy got a fucking six</v>

3307
02:13:52.861 --> 02:13:54.500
<v Speaker 6>monitors here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when,</v>

3308
02:13:54.570 --> 02:13:56.490
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't do this in America anymore?</v>

3309
02:13:56.491 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 6>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it used to gamble online.</v>

3310
02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:04.100
<v Speaker 6>It's stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a black pride or was in 2009.</v>

3311
02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:07.860
<v Speaker 6>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck too.</v>

3312
02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:09.680
<v Speaker 6>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3313
02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:12.540
<v Speaker 6>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why can't my kids total bullshit?</v>

3314
02:14:12.541 --> 02:14:13.830
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's a game of skill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Clearly.</v>

3315
02:14:13.831 --> 02:14:16.350
<v Speaker 6>I mean they allow the fantasy because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a game of skill.</v>

3316
02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:19.440
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and yeah,</v>

3317
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's nonsense.</v>

3318
02:14:21.031 --> 02:14:26.031
<v Speaker 6>I don't really care because I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>be playing online anymore because I </v>

3319
02:14:26.031 --> 02:14:27.690
<v Speaker 6>can't compete with these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've just put too much time in it.</v>

3320
02:14:27.691 --> 02:14:31.500
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is now there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 6>software that does so much for them.</v>

3321
02:14:31.501 --> 02:14:36.501
<v Speaker 6>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll tell you how many hands each </v>

3322
02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:37.890
<v Speaker 6>person plays preflop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many,</v>

3323
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.680
<v Speaker 6>what percentage of the time they bet the</v>
<v Speaker 6>flop,</v>

3324
02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:42.660
<v Speaker 6>what percentage of the time they </v>
<v Speaker 6>bluffed,</v>

3325
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:47.870
<v Speaker 6>and they can just figure that out based </v>
<v Speaker 6>on like how often they're going to have </v>

3326
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.870
<v Speaker 6>a hand in how often they bluff.</v>

3327
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:50.280
<v Speaker 6>So to actually give you their bluff </v>
<v Speaker 6>percentages on each street,</v>

3328
02:14:50.281 --> 02:14:55.281
<v Speaker 6>on the flop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>turn the river and it'll tell you like </v>

3329
02:14:55.281 --> 02:14:55.281
<v Speaker 6>how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many times they're just like calling</v>

3330
02:14:55.281 --> 02:15:00.141
<v Speaker 6>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it'll just give you all these </v>

3331
02:15:00.141 --> 02:15:02.451
<v Speaker 6>stats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's almost more turned into like a </v>

3332
02:15:02.451 --> 02:15:04.581
<v Speaker 6>mathematical computer game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas I liked the more pure form of </v>

3333
02:15:04.581 --> 02:15:05.130
<v Speaker 6>just like I'm looking the guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking.</v>

3334
02:15:05.131 --> 02:15:07.560
<v Speaker 6>I'm just trying to figure out what he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>got.</v>

3335
02:15:07.561 --> 02:15:08.130
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're.</v>

3336
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:10.530
<v Speaker 6>And you're also playing the player.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you're playing live,</v>

3337
02:15:10.531 --> 02:15:12.360
<v Speaker 6>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for me,</v>

3338
02:15:12.361 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 6>I can calculate how much money a guy has</v>
<v Speaker 6>very fast.</v>

3339
02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:18.330
<v Speaker 6>I can figure out like his comfort level </v>
<v Speaker 6>with bluffing.</v>

3340
02:15:18.331 --> 02:15:21.390
<v Speaker 6>I can figure out the type of guy he is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whether or not he's aggressive,</v>

3341
02:15:21.391 --> 02:15:24.480
<v Speaker 6>whether or not he's the type of guy that</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he's winning,</v>

3342
02:15:24.481 --> 02:15:26.740
<v Speaker 6>he's gonna want to lock it up or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>type of guy that when he's winning,</v>

3343
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:28.050
<v Speaker 6>he's want to gamble more.</v>

3344
02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:33.290
<v Speaker 6>The type of guy that when he's losing is</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to kind of play a lot more hands </v>

3345
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:36.381
<v Speaker 6>and try and get even,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or the type of guy that going to just </v>

3346
02:15:36.381 --> 02:15:39.260
<v Speaker 6>try and wait for a big hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The type of guy that's going to be just </v>

3347
02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:39.260
<v Speaker 6>calling his money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>chasing,</v>

3348
02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:40.430
<v Speaker 6>trying to get lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That kind of got,</v>

3349
02:15:40.431 --> 02:15:42.360
<v Speaker 6>that's going to be pushing the action </v>
<v Speaker 6>and betting a lot.</v>

3350
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:45.480
<v Speaker 6>Like there's just so many things that go</v>
<v Speaker 6>into it that,</v>

3351
02:15:45.810 --> 02:15:47.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like to just,</v>

3352
02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:48.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>play live.</v>

3353
02:15:48.481 --> 02:15:50.400
<v Speaker 6>And I like talk to people and I liked </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

3354
02:15:50.401 --> 02:15:52.380
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have that human interaction.</v>

3355
02:15:52.381 --> 02:15:54.480
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of these guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>really good behind a computer,</v>

3356
02:15:54.481 --> 02:15:55.830
<v Speaker 6>but you put them in front of another </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy.</v>

3357
02:15:55.831 --> 02:15:58.510
<v Speaker 6>You can't look at man in the eye and </v>
<v Speaker 6>just fucking blow up.</v>

3358
02:15:58.511 --> 02:15:59.650
<v Speaker 6>You'd just like crumble,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3359
02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:00.630
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so online.</v>

3360
02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:03.390
<v Speaker 6>They can click that button and say all </v>
<v Speaker 6>in and do these crazy bluffs,</v>

3361
02:16:03.391 --> 02:16:08.391
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just physically can't push those </v>

3362
02:16:08.391 --> 02:16:08.430
<v Speaker 6>chips in and keep a straight face on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>table.</v>

3363
02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.790
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's something going on when you're,</v>

3364
02:16:11.791 --> 02:16:13.350
<v Speaker 6>when you're looking at them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's like,</v>

3365
02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:14.890
<v Speaker 6>there's a certain amount of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3366
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never played poker.</v>

3367
02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:21.440
<v Speaker 6>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is a certain amount of intuition </v>

3368
02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:21.440
<v Speaker 6>and instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3369
02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:21.440
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it definitely is.</v>

3370
02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.100
<v Speaker 6>It's not like in the movies where it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3371
02:16:23.130 --> 02:16:28.130
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I picked up a tail on this guy and </v>

3372
02:16:28.130 --> 02:16:28.130
<v Speaker 6>every time he bluffs he twitches or you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know what I mean?</v>

3373
02:16:28.130 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that's a rare thing.</v>

3374
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:35.370
<v Speaker 6>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's more just like understanding the </v>

3375
02:16:35.370 --> 02:16:37.921
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you figure out what kind of </v>

3376
02:16:37.921 --> 02:16:37.921
<v Speaker 6>job this guy does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how much money he makes a year.</v>

3377
02:16:37.921 --> 02:16:40.030
<v Speaker 6>Like how much this money means to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how much he cares about the money,</v>

3378
02:16:40.031 --> 02:16:42.760
<v Speaker 6>how much he wants to gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how much he's playing for fun,</v>

3379
02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:44.920
<v Speaker 6>how much he wants to win.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of these guys,</v>

3380
02:16:44.921 --> 02:16:46.420
<v Speaker 6>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they actually want to lose their,</v>

3381
02:16:46.421 --> 02:16:48.240
<v Speaker 6>just like self sabotagers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3382
02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:53.250
<v Speaker 6>they'll go in there and like some of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them I'll see them and they'll want to </v>

3383
02:16:53.250 --> 02:16:54.760
<v Speaker 6>lose because they'll want everybody at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the table like them.</v>

3384
02:16:54.761 --> 02:16:56.460
<v Speaker 6>And that's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3385
02:16:56.530 --> 02:16:57.830
<v Speaker 6>the path of least resistance.</v>

3386
02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:05.100
<v Speaker 6>How do you detect that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how do you detect that a guy wants </v>

3387
02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:05.100
<v Speaker 6>to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'll be,</v>

3388
02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:05.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'll be just like wanting to be friends</v>

3389
02:17:05.381 --> 02:17:07.650
<v Speaker 6>with everybody and he'll do shit to show</v>
<v Speaker 6>off or to like,</v>

3390
02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:08.170
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>make.</v>

3391
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:09.730
<v Speaker 6>Because I mean look at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>day,</v>

3392
02:17:09.731 --> 02:17:11.530
<v Speaker 6>like people want people to play bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3393
02:17:11.531 --> 02:17:16.531
<v Speaker 6>Like you want a player to play like shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want to play or to give his money </v>

3394
02:17:16.531 --> 02:17:16.531
<v Speaker 6>away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want to play or to,</v>

3395
02:17:16.531 --> 02:17:16.531
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3396
02:17:16.531 --> 02:17:17.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do crazy stuff.</v>

3397
02:17:17.381 --> 02:17:22.381
<v Speaker 6>So these guys will know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll put on a show for people that </v>

3398
02:17:22.381 --> 02:17:22.540
<v Speaker 6>want to be the popular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they weren't cool in high school.</v>

3399
02:17:22.541 --> 02:17:25.240
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they want people like them who </v>
<v Speaker 6>knows what their reason is.</v>

3400
02:17:25.241 --> 02:17:26.920
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they feel like they don't deserve </v>
<v Speaker 6>the money.</v>

3401
02:17:26.921 --> 02:17:29.050
<v Speaker 6>I'll play with a lot of guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3402
02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:31.780
<v Speaker 6>some of them ended up in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of them are fraud somewhere cheat.</v>

3403
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:32.500
<v Speaker 6>Some of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3404
02:17:32.501 --> 02:17:37.501
<v Speaker 6>they have a bunch of money and they feel</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they don't deserve it </v>

3405
02:17:37.501 --> 02:17:37.501
<v Speaker 6>subconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they'll just want to give it away.</v>

3406
02:17:37.501 --> 02:17:41.431
<v Speaker 6>It's just the thing that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And do you see a lot of guys who just </v>

3407
02:17:41.431 --> 02:17:43.810
<v Speaker 6>lose everything?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it before.</v>

3408
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:46.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen guys go completely broke.</v>

3409
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:51.750
<v Speaker 6>It's tough because in gambling you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>just keep going up but you can't really </v>

3410
02:17:52.571 --> 02:17:54.460
<v Speaker 6>go down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like for instance,</v>

3411
02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:59.461
<v Speaker 6>if you go and you play blackjack and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>bet whatever arbitrary number of $500 a </v>

3412
02:17:59.981 --> 02:18:00.640
<v Speaker 6>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3413
02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.610
<v Speaker 6>And you were playing 500 bucks at hand </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

3414
02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:07.620
<v Speaker 6>your level of excitement when you win is</v>
<v Speaker 6>at a seven and you keep playing and </v>

3415
02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:10.720
<v Speaker 6>whatever and then now you go and play a </v>
<v Speaker 6>thousand bucks a hand and even winning a</v>

3416
02:18:10.721 --> 02:18:12.280
<v Speaker 6>little bit or you've been losing or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3417
02:18:12.670 --> 02:18:16.330
<v Speaker 6>And now if you try and go back to $500 </v>
<v Speaker 6>to 50,</v>

3418
02:18:16.331 --> 02:18:17.500
<v Speaker 6>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3419
02:18:17.690 --> 02:18:19.510
<v Speaker 6>if you're losing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just like it's,</v>

3420
02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:24.540
<v Speaker 6>it's a mental fuck because it's really </v>
<v Speaker 6>hard to get even betting smaller and if </v>

3421
02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:27.430
<v Speaker 6>you've been winning you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 6>care about the small money.</v>

3422
02:18:27.430 --> 02:18:28.260
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you want to,</v>

3423
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:30.700
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like one of those things where like</v>

3424
02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:34.120
<v Speaker 6>once you go up it's really hard to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>the other direction.</v>

3425
02:18:34.121 --> 02:18:39.121
<v Speaker 6>So a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the problems that professional </v>

3426
02:18:39.121 --> 02:18:39.400
<v Speaker 6>poker players have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's called bankroll management,</v>

3427
02:18:39.401 --> 02:18:43.850
<v Speaker 6>where they keep going up and up and up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when they start losing they,</v>

3428
02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:48.490
<v Speaker 6>they are completely unable to drop down </v>
<v Speaker 6>and steaks and then play good.</v>

3429
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:52.330
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if they lost let's say $100,000</v>

3430
02:18:52.331 --> 02:18:54.620
<v Speaker 6>just to use round numbers at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3431
02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:59.880
<v Speaker 6>this game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then for them to go to play a game </v>

3432
02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:01.090
<v Speaker 6>that's half that size and try and win </v>
<v Speaker 6>that hundred $100,000</v>

3433
02:19:01.091 --> 02:19:06.091
<v Speaker 6>back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to take them twice as much </v>

3434
02:19:06.091 --> 02:19:06.091
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

3435
02:19:06.091 --> 02:19:06.091
<v Speaker 6>So it's kind of like one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 6>where,</v>

3436
02:19:06.091 --> 02:19:11.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the games have gotten bigger and </v>

3437
02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:11.080
<v Speaker 6>bigger and bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so somebody goes on a bad run,</v>

3438
02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and poker is their profession.</v>

3439
02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:14.070
<v Speaker 6>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3440
02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.320
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's another thing that people don't </v>

3441
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:19.320
<v Speaker 6>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3442
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:19.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3443
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:19.320
<v Speaker 6>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3444
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:19.320
<v Speaker 6>you're winning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you should,</v>

3445
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:20.710
<v Speaker 6>you should take the money and run.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3446
02:19:20.711 --> 02:19:22.390
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you play poker for a living,</v>

3447
02:19:22.391 --> 02:19:25.540
<v Speaker 6>like it never ends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there it's like yeah,</v>

3448
02:19:25.541 --> 02:19:29.420
<v Speaker 6>there may be session to session but like</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're always going to be playing poker.</v>

3449
02:19:29.421 --> 02:19:33.080
<v Speaker 6>So it's like if that's a good spot you </v>
<v Speaker 6>should just play until the game's over.</v>

3450
02:19:33.081 --> 02:19:35.480
<v Speaker 6>Like even if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not like blackjack where you should</v>

3451
02:19:35.481 --> 02:19:40.481
<v Speaker 6>just lock up a when like in poker you </v>
<v Speaker 6>just stay there and in fact the more </v>

3452
02:19:40.481 --> 02:19:41.150
<v Speaker 6>you're winning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more other people are losing and the</v>

3453
02:19:41.151 --> 02:19:43.280
<v Speaker 6>more other people are losing the worst </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to play.</v>

3454
02:19:43.550 --> 02:19:45.470
<v Speaker 6>So it's Kinda like one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you just,</v>

3455
02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:47.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just one long session.</v>

3456
02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:49.090
<v Speaker 6>It never ends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know</v>

3457
02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:52.770
<v Speaker 4>how pissed too people get when they lose</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck tons of money.</v>

3458
02:19:52.771 --> 02:19:56.910
<v Speaker 4>If you ever had issues with that where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people get violent or people were angry.</v>

3459
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:59.780
<v Speaker 6>Definitely angry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's funny because,</v>

3460
02:19:59.810 --> 02:20:01.580
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm a victim of this too,</v>

3461
02:20:01.581 --> 02:20:06.581
<v Speaker 6>like I've found sometimes I've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 6>far more angry at losing $20,000.</v>

3462
02:20:07.671 --> 02:20:11.270
<v Speaker 6>Then I have at losing $500,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A strange as that may sound.</v>

3463
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:13.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm just because</v>

3464
02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:19.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the way I lost it or if I played </v>

3465
02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:19.780
<v Speaker 4>shitty or if I lost it to a guide in </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3466
02:20:19.781 --> 02:20:21.460
<v Speaker 4>or it was just like I lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost,</v>

3467
02:20:21.461 --> 02:20:22.150
<v Speaker 4>lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost,</v>

3468
02:20:22.151 --> 02:20:24.460
<v Speaker 4>and just like a steady progression of </v>
<v Speaker 4>losses.</v>

3469
02:20:24.970 --> 02:20:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Or if I was up a ton of money and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>like let's say I was up a million </v>

3470
02:20:29.970 --> 02:20:34.050
<v Speaker 4>dollars and ended up losing $20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'd be fucking miserable even </v>

3471
02:20:34.050 --> 02:20:38.221
<v Speaker 4>though I only lost 20 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But let's say I was down a million </v>

3472
02:20:38.221 --> 02:20:40.720
<v Speaker 4>dollars and I ended up losing $20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be ecstatic.</v>

3473
02:20:41.350 --> 02:20:43.900
<v Speaker 4>Now look at the end result was one night</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3474
02:20:43.901 --> 02:20:44.590
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3475
02:20:44.650 --> 02:20:49.650
<v Speaker 6>one slash 20 grand and I was miserable </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the other night I lost 20 grand and </v>

3476
02:20:49.650 --> 02:20:49.880
<v Speaker 6>I was happy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3477
02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:54.970
<v Speaker 6>Because I started off up a million and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then last ended up being a $20,000</v>

3478
02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:00.000
<v Speaker 6>winner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that seems like a million dollar </v>

3479
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:00.250
<v Speaker 6>loss to me because at one point in that </v>
<v Speaker 6>game I was up a million bucks,</v>

3480
02:21:00.251 --> 02:21:01.750
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So mentally,</v>

3481
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:06.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I kinda like in my mind I've lost a </v>

3482
02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:10.170
<v Speaker 6>million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then in the other game I was down a </v>

3483
02:21:10.170 --> 02:21:10.170
<v Speaker 6>million and then ended up only losing </v>
<v Speaker 6>$20,000,</v>

3484
02:21:10.170 --> 02:21:11.590
<v Speaker 6>so almost broke even.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm like ecstatic,</v>

3485
02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:12.720
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's</v>

3486
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:18.950
<v Speaker 4>also something that you were just </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about that I think is really </v>

3487
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:19.710
<v Speaker 4>interesting because it kind of parallels</v>
<v Speaker 4>a martial arts and fighting and a lot of</v>

3488
02:21:19.711 --> 02:21:22.230
<v Speaker 4>ways is that you don't want to lose </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that you hate.</v>

3489
02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3490
02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:25.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And fighting.</v>

3491
02:21:25.201 --> 02:21:30.201
<v Speaker 4>That's why conor mcgregor does so well </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that he fucks with your head so bad </v>

3492
02:21:30.201 --> 02:21:34.401
<v Speaker 4>that the amount of pressure that's on </v>
<v Speaker 4>you is so exacerbated when you actually </v>

3493
02:21:34.401 --> 02:21:35.970
<v Speaker 4>get into the cage with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even guys like Josie,</v>

3494
02:21:35.971 --> 02:21:40.971
<v Speaker 4>although who's this seasoned world </v>
<v Speaker 4>champion who never lost in the UFC,</v>

3495
02:21:41.850 --> 02:21:45.690
<v Speaker 4>hey connor just mind fucked him and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can punch.</v>

3496
02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:47.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's both things.</v>

3497
02:21:47.041 --> 02:21:52.041
<v Speaker 4>He's got skill and he's really good at </v>
<v Speaker 4>handling pressure and he's the mindfuck </v>

3498
02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:57.140
<v Speaker 4>master,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you see it with guys when guys get </v>

3499
02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:00.471
<v Speaker 4>in these emotional situations with </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters and then you see when they </v>

3500
02:22:00.471 --> 02:22:01.860
<v Speaker 4>fight with someone who respects them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shake hands the weigh ins and they could</v>

3501
02:22:01.861 --> 02:22:06.861
<v Speaker 4>fight up to their full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I that that is a big factor I guess in </v>

3502
02:22:06.861 --> 02:22:07.830
<v Speaker 4>poker as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3503
02:22:08.730 --> 02:22:10.170
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

3504
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:15.230
<v Speaker 4>I've seen tons of times when somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>really hates another player and in fact </v>

3505
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:20.121
<v Speaker 4>like has just played far worse against </v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy and given that guy so much </v>

3506
02:22:20.731 --> 02:22:22.100
<v Speaker 4>money because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3507
02:22:22.101 --> 02:22:24.070
<v Speaker 4>they kept going after him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3508
02:22:24.071 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 4>like they really wanted bluff them.</v>

3509
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:27.630
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck this motherfucker.</v>

3510
02:22:27.631 --> 02:22:32.631
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to let this guy blocked me</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they ended up just paying them </v>

3511
02:22:32.631 --> 02:22:32.631
<v Speaker 6>off and paying them off and paying them </v>
<v Speaker 6>off.</v>

3512
02:22:32.631 --> 02:22:36.600
<v Speaker 6>I actually found that in poker because </v>
<v Speaker 6>there was times when I'd be friend,</v>

3513
02:22:36.601 --> 02:22:40.650
<v Speaker 6>really bad players and then that player </v>
<v Speaker 6>would not play hard against me,</v>

3514
02:22:41.010 --> 02:22:42.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because of that.</v>

3515
02:22:42.151 --> 02:22:47.151
<v Speaker 6>And it actually ended up costing me a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of money and then there's other </v>

3516
02:22:47.151 --> 02:22:49.761
<v Speaker 6>times when I would just like talk shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>to a bad player and they would really </v>

3517
02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:50.760
<v Speaker 6>come after me and then I'm just smoking </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

3518
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's Kinda like,</v>

3519
02:22:52.770 --> 02:22:57.770
<v Speaker 6>it's tough because usually the bad </v>
<v Speaker 6>players were the coolest guys because </v>

3520
02:22:57.770 --> 02:23:00.981
<v Speaker 6>they're just like the rich guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 6>having fun and they got a good attitude </v>

3521
02:23:00.981 --> 02:23:01.780
<v Speaker 6>and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But sometimes you know,</v>

3522
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:03.480
<v Speaker 6>like you gotta fuck with them a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit,</v>

3523
02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:08.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause otherwise you're not going to be </v>

3524
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.550
<v Speaker 6>able to gamble with them really.</v>

3525
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.550
<v Speaker 6>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you want that.</v>

3526
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:13.071
<v Speaker 6>Like you want that kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>optimally you want that competitive but </v>

3527
02:23:13.951 --> 02:23:17.430
<v Speaker 6>semi friendly relationship because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't want them to just totally hate you</v>

3528
02:23:17.431 --> 02:23:19.110
<v Speaker 6>because then you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck this motherfucker,</v>

3529
02:23:19.170 --> 02:23:24.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm not playing if he's there and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're kinda like out of the game </v>

3530
02:23:24.170 --> 02:23:24.720
<v Speaker 6>because he's the big sucker and he can </v>
<v Speaker 6>call the shots,</v>

3531
02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:28.610
<v Speaker 6>which just seems like such a </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychological management thing with,</v>

3532
02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:30.330
<v Speaker 6>with poker players.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot,</v>

3533
02:23:30.331 --> 02:23:31.590
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a real,</v>

3534
02:23:31.591 --> 02:23:34.560
<v Speaker 6>it seems on the surface like an easy </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing to do.</v>

3535
02:23:34.650 --> 02:23:37.410
<v Speaker 6>No it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I feel like for a lot of people they</v>

3536
02:23:37.411 --> 02:23:38.460
<v Speaker 6>look at it and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3537
02:23:38.461 --> 02:23:41.400
<v Speaker 6>he gambles for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he got lucky or he's just like good</v>

3538
02:23:41.401 --> 02:23:42.190
<v Speaker 6>with numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

3539
02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:47.290
<v Speaker 6>They've break it down so simplistically </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they don't realize like how </v>

3540
02:23:47.290 --> 02:23:47.290
<v Speaker 6>difficult it is.</v>

3541
02:23:47.290 --> 02:23:52.160
<v Speaker 6>But isn't that the case with everything?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I've heard people say that about </v>

3542
02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:52.160
<v Speaker 6>Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Oh,</v>

3543
02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:53.880
<v Speaker 6>they'll just turn left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like No.</v>

3544
02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:55.660
<v Speaker 6>Well Nascar's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would,</v>

3545
02:23:55.690 --> 02:24:00.690
<v Speaker 6>I would come.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that the closest comparison is </v>

3546
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:00.690
<v Speaker 6>with the stock bark,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like stockbrokers,</v>

3547
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:01.410
<v Speaker 6>stock market stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3548
02:24:01.411 --> 02:24:06.411
<v Speaker 6>because they're really gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean at the end of the day that that </v>

3549
02:24:06.411 --> 02:24:06.780
<v Speaker 6>is kind of gambling and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're going to have losses.</v>

3550
02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:07.480
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3551
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:09.960
<v Speaker 6>the parallel there is that you can go </v>
<v Speaker 6>into work,</v>

3552
02:24:10.170 --> 02:24:13.380
<v Speaker 6>you can fucking do a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bust your ass to everything,</v>

3553
02:24:13.381 --> 02:24:18.381
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then just get fucked because of bad </v>

3554
02:24:18.381 --> 02:24:18.381
<v Speaker 6>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That can happen to a doctor.</v>

3555
02:24:18.381 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3556
02:24:19.171 --> 02:24:21.330
<v Speaker 6>Like that can't happen with most </v>
<v Speaker 6>professions.</v>

3557
02:24:21.331 --> 02:24:23.970
<v Speaker 6>Like even in fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like even the loser gets paid,</v>

3558
02:24:23.971 --> 02:24:26.130
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't go into a fight and lose money</v>

3559
02:24:26.131 --> 02:24:27.030
<v Speaker 6>if you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3560
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:30.600
<v Speaker 6>Like poker and the stock market or some </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the few things that like,</v>

3561
02:24:30.601 --> 02:24:34.680
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of hard to really have that </v>
<v Speaker 6>good bankroll management because you can</v>

3562
02:24:34.681 --> 02:24:36.030
<v Speaker 6>go into everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3563
02:24:36.031 --> 02:24:39.480
<v Speaker 6>Bust your ass and work for an entire </v>
<v Speaker 6>month and lose money.</v>

3564
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:43.320
<v Speaker 6>But that is where the thrill lies to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>common man,</v>

3565
02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:43.720
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3566
02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:48.740
<v Speaker 6>the average person that plays it safe </v>
<v Speaker 6>and takes it easy and gets his 401k and </v>

3567
02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:49.680
<v Speaker 6>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't do anything risky.</v>

3568
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:52.260
<v Speaker 6>That's where the thrill lies and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>lifestyle,</v>

3569
02:24:52.261 --> 02:24:55.410
<v Speaker 6>like talking to you and hearing you talk</v>
<v Speaker 6>about this shit,</v>

3570
02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.680
<v Speaker 6>that's where people that are getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>their palms are sweaty right now when </v>

3571
02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:00.900
<v Speaker 6>they're driving to work and they listen </v>
<v Speaker 6>to this and thinking,</v>

3572
02:25:00.901 --> 02:25:02.280
<v Speaker 6>could I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could I do that?</v>

3573
02:25:02.310 --> 02:25:03.780
<v Speaker 6>Could I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most people can't.</v>

3574
02:25:03.810 --> 02:25:04.970
<v Speaker 6>Most people cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3575
02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:06.210
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3576
02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:11.940
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the hardest things I've done</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I've done a lot of hard things just </v>

3577
02:25:11.971 --> 02:25:16.971
<v Speaker 6>because for me doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing physically hard things actually </v>

3578
02:25:16.971 --> 02:25:19.920
<v Speaker 6>isn't like as challenging as mentally </v>
<v Speaker 6>tough things.</v>

3579
02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:25.040
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that makes any sense because the </v>

3580
02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:25.720
<v Speaker 6>physical stuff fit the physically tough </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>

3581
02:25:25.721 --> 02:25:30.721
<v Speaker 6>You just kind of like sparking bite your</v>
<v Speaker 6>tongue and grit and fucking take the </v>

3582
02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:34.651
<v Speaker 6>pain and just power through like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's got to be one of the </v>

3583
02:25:34.651 --> 02:25:35.530
<v Speaker 6>benefits of going through buds twice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3584
02:25:35.531 --> 02:25:38.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean it puts it in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3585
02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:39.460
<v Speaker 6>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3586
02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:44.520
<v Speaker 6>you've been through way more of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>hellacious physical test than most </v>

3587
02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:45.820
<v Speaker 6>people could ever endure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3588
02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:47.710
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of it comes down to,</v>

3589
02:25:47.711 --> 02:25:48.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people are like,</v>

3590
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:49.450
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3591
02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:54.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you must be a super tough motherfucker </v>

3592
02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:56.641
<v Speaker 6>and all this other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think it comes down more to just </v>

3593
02:25:56.641 --> 02:25:58.030
<v Speaker 6>like how bad you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in life,</v>

3594
02:25:58.031 --> 02:26:00.460
<v Speaker 6>like if you just want something so </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking bad.</v>

3595
02:26:00.461 --> 02:26:05.461
<v Speaker 6>Like I just remembered like when I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing the 50 meter underwater swim is </v>

3596
02:26:05.461 --> 02:26:05.461
<v Speaker 6>really hard for me.</v>

3597
02:26:05.461 --> 02:26:07.270
<v Speaker 6>I'd never been able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3598
02:26:07.330 --> 02:26:08.510
<v Speaker 6>outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3599
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:13.590
<v Speaker 6>seal training and the only two times I </v>
<v Speaker 6>did it was when I had to do it and I </v>

3600
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.630
<v Speaker 6>just remembered,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just like,</v>

3601
02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:16.600
<v Speaker 6>well I'm just going to swim until I </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking reached the wall or blackout.</v>

3602
02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:19.270
<v Speaker 6>Like there just wasn't another option.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I was just like,</v>

3603
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:21.880
<v Speaker 6>I just wasn't going to quit just because</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted it so bad.</v>

3604
02:26:22.390 --> 02:26:27.390
<v Speaker 6>So that actually helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember there's one guy that that </v>

3605
02:26:27.390 --> 02:26:30.610
<v Speaker 6>went into buds and he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had like a million dollar business.</v>

3606
02:26:30.611 --> 02:26:35.611
<v Speaker 6>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was the guy that owned van </v>

3607
02:26:35.611 --> 02:26:38.131
<v Speaker 6>Dutch or something maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or had some affiliation with that and I </v>

3608
02:26:38.131 --> 02:26:38.131
<v Speaker 6>just remember he went into buds after </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3609
02:26:38.131 --> 02:26:42.600
<v Speaker 6>I just remember he showed up and he had </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a hot chick or two hot chicks and </v>

3610
02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:42.910
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a sports car and everybody's like,</v>

3611
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.470
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a stud.</v>

3612
02:26:44.470 --> 02:26:45.920
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it was like,</v>

3613
02:26:46.210 --> 02:26:49.780
<v Speaker 6>and then he like showed up a buds and </v>
<v Speaker 6>ended up quitting like straight away.</v>

3614
02:26:49.781 --> 02:26:54.781
<v Speaker 6>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it didn't surprise me because I'm </v>

3615
02:26:54.781 --> 02:26:54.781
<v Speaker 6>like thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3616
02:26:54.781 --> 02:26:55.090
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

3617
02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.640
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I don't make it I'm going to ship and</v>

3618
02:26:57.641 --> 02:27:00.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be fucking miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't want that.</v>

3619
02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:05.490
<v Speaker 6>Like this guy's thinking like if I quit </v>
<v Speaker 6>I can go like fuck a bunch of girls and </v>

3620
02:27:05.490 --> 02:27:07.150
<v Speaker 6>like drive nice cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I got money.</v>

3621
02:27:07.151 --> 02:27:07.930
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3622
02:27:07.931 --> 02:27:10.780
<v Speaker 6>So like for him it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually think it's harder,</v>

3623
02:27:11.170 --> 02:27:12.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3624
02:27:12.101 --> 02:27:15.610
<v Speaker 6>because you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what your alternatives are,</v>

3625
02:27:15.611 --> 02:27:15.980
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3626
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:17.100
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3627
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:22.110
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you put a fucking guy up against the </v>

3628
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:24.121
<v Speaker 6>wall and he's got no choice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then he's just going to like do what </v>

3629
02:27:24.121 --> 02:27:24.121
<v Speaker 6>he's gotta do.</v>

3630
02:27:24.121 --> 02:27:25.570
<v Speaker 6>Like for instance if I told you you had </v>
<v Speaker 6>to go crawl,</v>

3631
02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:30.840
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>50 miles or I'm going to fucking put a </v>

3632
02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:34.651
<v Speaker 6>bullet in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're probably going to go crawl </v>

3633
02:27:34.651 --> 02:27:34.651
<v Speaker 6>that 50 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3634
02:27:34.651 --> 02:27:34.651
<v Speaker 6>but I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

3635
02:27:34.651 --> 02:27:37.690
<v Speaker 6>like I'm going to give you $500,000,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3636
02:27:37.691 --> 02:27:39.820
<v Speaker 6>if you can go crawl these 50 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

3637
02:27:39.821 --> 02:27:41.710
<v Speaker 6>you got money and you don't really need </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3638
02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:43.680
<v Speaker 6>you're probably not going to crawl 50 </v>
<v Speaker 6>miles.</v>

3639
02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:48.720
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's Kinda like one of those </v>

3640
02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.641
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just like the alternative is what </v>

3641
02:27:50.641 --> 02:27:53.370
<v Speaker 6>determines the difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a great scene and officer and a </v>

3642
02:27:53.370 --> 02:27:55.720
<v Speaker 6>gentleman remember what your gear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3643
02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:56.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember that.</v>

3644
02:27:56.860 --> 02:27:57.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do remember that.</v>

3645
02:27:57.821 --> 02:27:59.890
<v Speaker 6>And that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got nowhere else to go.</v>

3646
02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:02.740
<v Speaker 6>That's one thing I tell people when </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're thinking about fighting,</v>

3647
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:04.540
<v Speaker 6>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it all you want to do?</v>

3648
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:05.890
<v Speaker 6>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it your whole life?</v>

3649
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:07.630
<v Speaker 6>Does it absorb you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does it do?</v>

3650
02:28:07.631 --> 02:28:10.240
<v Speaker 6>Do you want that more than anything that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can imagine?</v>

3651
02:28:10.241 --> 02:28:11.320
<v Speaker 6>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3652
02:28:11.321 --> 02:28:16.321
<v Speaker 6>fighting doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be an author it because if </v>

3653
02:28:16.321 --> 02:28:16.420
<v Speaker 6>that's the case and you want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>for the experience,</v>

3654
02:28:16.421 --> 02:28:21.421
<v Speaker 6>that's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you actually think you're going </v>

3655
02:28:21.421 --> 02:28:23.671
<v Speaker 6>to be a champion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have all these other escape </v>

3656
02:28:23.671 --> 02:28:23.671
<v Speaker 6>routes and it's</v>

3657
02:28:23.671 --> 02:28:27.070
<v Speaker 4>not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I actually think it's harder </v>

3658
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:29.231
<v Speaker 4>for guys like conor mcgregor or guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>like mayweather because now they have </v>

3659
02:28:29.231 --> 02:28:29.930
<v Speaker 4>money and they have that lifestyle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like that.</v>

3660
02:28:29.931 --> 02:28:34.931
<v Speaker 4>I actually thought Rhonda was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get fucked up just because she likes </v>

3661
02:28:34.931 --> 02:28:34.931
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3662
02:28:34.931 --> 02:28:35.180
<v Speaker 4>she was going to Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3663
02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.350
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's tough,</v>

3664
02:28:36.351 --> 02:28:37.550
<v Speaker 4>she's fucking great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

3665
02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:42.820
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was like doing the movies and she's </v>

3666
02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:45.641
<v Speaker 4>doing this and it's like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that lifestyle and I know the </v>

3667
02:28:45.641 --> 02:28:49.751
<v Speaker 4>addictiveness of the money and the fame </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that other stuff and now it's </v>

3668
02:28:49.751 --> 02:28:49.751
<v Speaker 4>like these people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

3669
02:28:49.751 --> 02:28:54.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>living in a one bedroom apartment are </v>

3670
02:28:54.251 --> 02:28:55.550
<v Speaker 4>now introduced to all this money and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fame and people and it's just,</v>

3671
02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:58.130
<v Speaker 4>it's so distracting as opposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy that's like,</v>

3672
02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:03.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking waking up everyday and going to </v>

3673
02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:03.530
<v Speaker 4>the gym and fucking busting his ass and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just trying to make ends meet and that's</v>

3674
02:29:03.531 --> 02:29:06.470
<v Speaker 4>all he's got and he's got no fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere else to go.</v>

3675
02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3676
02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:09.230
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for that guy,</v>

3677
02:29:09.231 --> 02:29:12.460
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's far easier to stay the </v>
<v Speaker 4>course for garlic,</v>

3678
02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:14.660
<v Speaker 4>conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he's got all this money and this and</v>

3679
02:29:14.661 --> 02:29:15.680
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3680
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:16.610
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3681
02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.940
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have to fight anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like like I mean,</v>

3682
02:29:19.941 --> 02:29:24.941
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he like if he wants to continue his </v>

3683
02:29:24.941 --> 02:29:26.561
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does right now he's like up as </v>

3684
02:29:26.561 --> 02:29:28.751
<v Speaker 4>expenses in his image and all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's used to all this stuff and now </v>

3685
02:29:28.751 --> 02:29:30.020
<v Speaker 4>he has to make x to maintain his current</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

3686
02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:32.810
<v Speaker 4>So he's got a little bit of pressure on </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in that sense,</v>

3687
02:29:33.050 --> 02:29:35.720
<v Speaker 4>but he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not struggling.</v>

3688
02:29:35.721 --> 02:29:37.250
<v Speaker 4>He's not hungry anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3689
02:29:37.251 --> 02:29:39.110
<v Speaker 4>He's got the pencil on who you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3690
02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:41.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody has a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation.</v>

3691
02:29:41.001 --> 02:29:46.001
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not even like they changed the </v>

3692
02:29:46.001 --> 02:29:46.460
<v Speaker 4>goalposts instead of becoming rich.</v>

3693
02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:51.580
<v Speaker 4>It's become the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you look at all these other </v>

3694
02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:51.590
<v Speaker 4>guys that are nipping at your heels and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you decide,</v>

3695
02:29:51.591 --> 02:29:56.591
<v Speaker 4>no motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am the man at the top of the mountain </v>

3696
02:29:56.591 --> 02:29:59.711
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to stay at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain as long as my body hangs in </v>

3697
02:29:59.711 --> 02:29:59.711
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

3698
02:29:59.711 --> 02:30:03.161
<v Speaker 4>it's like that has to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to do and you could see the </v>

3699
02:30:03.161 --> 02:30:03.950
<v Speaker 4>shift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see the shift in guys were,</v>

3700
02:30:03.951 --> 02:30:08.951
<v Speaker 4>they all of a sudden they do it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>money and they started doing it for a </v>

3701
02:30:08.951 --> 02:30:11.471
<v Speaker 4>living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that shift and it's an ugly </v>

3702
02:30:11.471 --> 02:30:13.211
<v Speaker 4>shift because they just don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same tenacity is like I see a lot and </v>

3703
02:30:13.421 --> 02:30:18.421
<v Speaker 4>like nfl and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure we get tired of getting your </v>

3704
02:30:18.421 --> 02:30:22.181
<v Speaker 4>fucking bell rang to men know he get </v>
<v Speaker 4>tired of Bang Bang clashing heads with </v>

3705
02:30:22.761 --> 02:30:24.440
<v Speaker 4>people and running into each other.</v>

3706
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:29.710
<v Speaker 4>After a while that shit gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember there was a big basketball </v>

3707
02:30:29.710 --> 02:30:29.710
<v Speaker 4>player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3708
02:30:29.710 --> 02:30:33.470
<v Speaker 4>and he would play poker and it was funny</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he would go on these vendors and</v>

3709
02:30:33.471 --> 02:30:35.490
<v Speaker 4>he would play for like 24 hours straight</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>

3710
02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:39.630
<v Speaker 4>I just remember we just always bet </v>
<v Speaker 4>against him and he was like a big,</v>

3711
02:30:39.631 --> 02:30:42.080
<v Speaker 4>big basketball player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was like the star on the team or</v>

3712
02:30:42.081 --> 02:30:43.530
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we were just like,</v>

3713
02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:46.010
<v Speaker 4>always bet against like whatever team he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was playing,</v>

3714
02:30:46.011 --> 02:30:48.170
<v Speaker 4>if he had been playing poker for 24,</v>
<v Speaker 4>48 hours,</v>

3715
02:30:48.171 --> 02:30:49.710
<v Speaker 4>which is bet against the other team were</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3716
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:54.730
<v Speaker 4>like almost every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he just like always played like </v>

3717
02:30:54.730 --> 02:30:54.730
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3718
02:30:54.730 --> 02:30:55.880
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like mentally exhausting.</v>

3719
02:30:55.881 --> 02:30:57.560
<v Speaker 4>He's not sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't eat.</v>

3720
02:30:57.561 --> 02:30:59.830
<v Speaker 4>It's just like it's just hard on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body or you,</v>

3721
02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:04.860
<v Speaker 4>you're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cortisone or whatever cortisol </v>

3722
02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:04.860
<v Speaker 4>levels go up.</v>

3723
02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:05.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3724
02:31:05.530 --> 02:31:06.320
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's tough.</v>

3725
02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:09.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a balancing act I think in </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything in life,</v>

3726
02:31:09.231 --> 02:31:14.231
<v Speaker 4>but especially in risky things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's playing poker or fighting </v>

3727
02:31:14.231 --> 02:31:15.620
<v Speaker 4>or anything along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that's really difficult to do.</v>

3728
02:31:15.650 --> 02:31:20.650
<v Speaker 4>There's this weird balancing act and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to this this perfect balance of </v>

3729
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:24.480
<v Speaker 4>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reward,</v>

3730
02:31:24.481 --> 02:31:26.460
<v Speaker 4>intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>focused,</v>

3731
02:31:26.461 --> 02:31:28.710
<v Speaker 4>disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still pleasure.</v>

3732
02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:32.700
<v Speaker 4>You can't be miserable forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's to be a time where you have</v>

3733
02:31:32.701 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 4>fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

3734
02:31:34.201 --> 02:31:34.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

3735
02:31:34.951 --> 02:31:37.050
<v Speaker 4>I think it just comes down to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just gotTa want it,</v>

3736
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:42.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just got to fucking just want it </v>

3737
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.230
<v Speaker 4>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there was some study recently that I</v>

3738
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:46.110
<v Speaker 4>was reading about whether they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about how you can't be happy all</v>

3739
02:31:46.111 --> 02:31:48.810
<v Speaker 4>the time and you don't want to be happy </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

3740
02:31:48.811 --> 02:31:53.811
<v Speaker 4>Like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you won't achieve the same levels of </v>

3741
02:31:53.811 --> 02:31:54.820
<v Speaker 4>happiness all the time if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>miserable like you,</v>

3742
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:59.830
<v Speaker 4>you don't ever hit those highs unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>you hit those lows like you ever been </v>

3743
02:31:59.830 --> 02:32:01.080
<v Speaker 4>around someone who's manic ever day to </v>
<v Speaker 4>check his manic.</v>

3744
02:32:01.350 --> 02:32:04.750
<v Speaker 4>I know where you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>suite is a sweet,</v>

3745
02:32:04.930 --> 02:32:05.050
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

3746
02:32:05.050 --> 02:32:09.040
<v Speaker 3>bitter end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've found that I'm actually have an</v>

3747
02:32:09.041 --> 02:32:13.450
<v Speaker 3>interesting outlook on that because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have bought pleasure for so long,</v>

3748
02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I can't buy happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can buy a pleasure though.</v>

3749
02:32:16.310 --> 02:32:17.380
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3750
02:32:17.381 --> 02:32:22.381
<v Speaker 3>money isn't happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money can buy a boat and the boat will </v>

3751
02:32:22.381 --> 02:32:22.381
<v Speaker 3>make me fucking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of thing.</v>

3752
02:32:22.381 --> 02:32:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm an example I like to give is,</v>

3753
02:32:25.010 --> 02:32:26.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 16,</v>

3754
02:32:26.860 --> 02:32:29.260
<v Speaker 3>like my dream car was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3755
02:32:29.530 --> 02:32:30.730
<v Speaker 3>a Mustang Cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3756
02:32:30.731 --> 02:32:33.430
<v Speaker 3>So if I got a Mustang Cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have been a 10,</v>

3757
02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:35.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3758
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:37.000
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3759
02:32:37.001 --> 02:32:38.770
<v Speaker 3>a Ferrari would also bring me to a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3760
02:32:38.771 --> 02:32:40.210
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't go higher than a 10,</v>

3761
02:32:40.211 --> 02:32:42.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's just say that I got,</v>

3762
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:43.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3763
02:32:43.321 --> 02:32:43.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3764
02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:46.900
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 16 and now we flash forward,</v>

3765
02:32:46.901 --> 02:32:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I graduated college and my dad gives me </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3766
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:54.460
<v Speaker 3>let's say he gives me a BMW m five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had the Ferrari,</v>

3767
02:32:54.490 --> 02:32:56.680
<v Speaker 3>now I'm going to be kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably at a seven,</v>

3768
02:32:56.681 --> 02:32:56.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3769
02:32:56.830 --> 02:33:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm stepping down on a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I had the Mustang Cobra and now </v>

3770
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to an m five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be back at a 10.</v>

3771
02:33:03.070 --> 02:33:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Well it's the same car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the same person.</v>

3772
02:33:05.981 --> 02:33:10.981
<v Speaker 3>You're at the same spot in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only difference is your perspective </v>

3773
02:33:10.981 --> 02:33:11.290
<v Speaker 3>because your previous experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3774
02:33:11.291 --> 02:33:16.291
<v Speaker 3>so it's Kinda like when people ask like </v>
<v Speaker 3>why rich people aren't as happy and I </v>

3775
02:33:17.291 --> 02:33:22.291
<v Speaker 3>just think it's because they've upped </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bar so far that only the best things</v>

3776
02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:26.500
<v Speaker 3>satisfy them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a guy off the street.</v>

3777
02:33:26.501 --> 02:33:28.380
<v Speaker 3>If I took like when I was going to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bootcamp,</v>

3778
02:33:28.450 --> 02:33:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I'll use that as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to outback steakhouse,</v>

3779
02:33:30.610 --> 02:33:35.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to 10 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I go to the best restaurant in the </v>

3780
02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:35.860
<v Speaker 3>fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3781
02:33:35.861 --> 02:33:37.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm like maybe like a six or a seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

3782
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:39.430
<v Speaker 3>satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got three chefs,</v>

3783
02:33:39.431 --> 02:33:41.740
<v Speaker 3>like I eat the best food all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3784
02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:43.690
<v Speaker 3>So like that doesn't make me happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

3785
02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody bought me a Lamborghini,</v>

3786
02:33:45.791 --> 02:33:47.620
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've had them,</v>

3787
02:33:47.621 --> 02:33:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't care like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're gay,</v>

3788
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:51.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give it a guy off the street,</v>

3789
02:33:51.671 --> 02:33:54.490
<v Speaker 3>he'd be at a 10 so I can't buy happiness</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

3790
02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:57.280
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought every fucking thing that I ever</v>

3791
02:33:57.281 --> 02:33:57.850
<v Speaker 3>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3792
02:33:57.851 --> 02:34:01.390
<v Speaker 3>There's not really anything that I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can't buy any like,</v>

3793
02:34:01.391 --> 02:34:02.830
<v Speaker 3>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3794
02:34:03.010 --> 02:34:07.240
<v Speaker 3>and also if you gave me like a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>car or put me in a regular hotel,</v>

3795
02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:10.150
<v Speaker 3>I would actually be it like below the </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal level.</v>

3796
02:34:10.151 --> 02:34:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a normal person would be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy to be on a vacation,</v>

3797
02:34:13.271 --> 02:34:18.271
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I think that has like some </v>

3798
02:34:18.271 --> 02:34:18.271
<v Speaker 3>correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda</v>

3799
02:34:18.271 --> 02:34:20.650
<v Speaker 4>like a guy that wins the lotto like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year later.</v>

3800
02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:25.651
<v Speaker 4>He is like statistically less happy than</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy that got his leg amputated a year </v>

3801
02:34:26.051 --> 02:34:27.400
<v Speaker 4>prior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3802
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3803
02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:30.070
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also,</v>

3804
02:34:30.071 --> 02:34:32.110
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you trying to do?</v>

3805
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Like do a lot of people that are trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get rich because they think that once</v>

3806
02:34:35.021 --> 02:34:40.021
<v Speaker 4>they get rich there'll be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that that's going to give </v>

3807
02:34:40.021 --> 02:34:40.021
<v Speaker 4>them this thing that they've always been</v>
<v Speaker 4>missing.</v>

3808
02:34:40.021 --> 02:34:44.911
<v Speaker 4>And so they've been working hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>busting their ass and they look at all </v>

3809
02:34:44.911 --> 02:34:44.911
<v Speaker 4>these other people like we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

3810
02:34:44.911 --> 02:34:45.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you uh,</v>

3811
02:34:45.161 --> 02:34:47.090
<v Speaker 4>you land your private jet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you drive your,</v>

3812
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:49.150
<v Speaker 4>your Bentley to the club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's like,</v>

3813
02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:49.810
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>samples,</v>

3814
02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:52.300
<v Speaker 4>you want to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3815
02:34:52.301 --> 02:34:53.970
<v Speaker 4>But once you're that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3816
02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:58.980
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then for a lot of people there's </v>

3817
02:34:58.980 --> 02:34:59.320
<v Speaker 4>this emptiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing left to chase,</v>

3818
02:34:59.321 --> 02:35:00.400
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing else to do.</v>

3819
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:04.390
<v Speaker 4>And your life is just about possessions </v>
<v Speaker 4>and upping the ante.</v>

3820
02:35:04.391 --> 02:35:06.880
<v Speaker 4>And now I got to get a yacht and now I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to get the biggest yacht.</v>

3821
02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:08.950
<v Speaker 4>Now I've got to buy an island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3822
02:35:08.951 --> 02:35:11.260
<v Speaker 4>and trying to find something to fill </v>
<v Speaker 4>that void.</v>

3823
02:35:11.261 --> 02:35:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Because you've sort of set your life up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to chase these material goals instead of</v>

3824
02:35:16.211 --> 02:35:20.020
<v Speaker 4>to try to find out what actually does </v>
<v Speaker 4>make you happy.</v>

3825
02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:23.020
<v Speaker 4>You have to have goals and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have stuff that like,</v>

3826
02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:28.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to be climbing the mountain </v>

3827
02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:29.941
<v Speaker 4>because at the end of the day like </v>
<v Speaker 4>climbing the mountain is far more </v>

3828
02:35:29.941 --> 02:35:29.941
<v Speaker 4>satisfying than being at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain.</v>

3829
02:35:29.941 --> 02:35:31.000
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that weird though?</v>

3830
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:33.130
<v Speaker 4>That's not what we've ever been taught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3831
02:35:33.131 --> 02:35:35.730
<v Speaker 4>it's counterintuitive because most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't like get the,</v>

3832
02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:37.300
<v Speaker 4>they just know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3833
02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:38.290
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3834
02:35:38.291 --> 02:35:40.840
<v Speaker 4>my dad told me like it's better to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>than receive.</v>

3835
02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:42.470
<v Speaker 4>And I was like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's perfect by the burglary unit,</v>

3836
02:35:42.471 --> 02:35:44.760
<v Speaker 4>just give me shit and I'll receive it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll be happy.</v>

3837
02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:45.610
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3838
02:35:45.611 --> 02:35:46.600
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have it.</v>

3839
02:35:46.601 --> 02:35:48.580
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have it then that makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

3840
02:35:48.750 --> 02:35:49.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3841
02:35:49.361 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3842
02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:52.780
<v Speaker 4>just people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just experience like,</v>

3843
02:35:52.781 --> 02:35:54.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean like from the time you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little kid,</v>

3844
02:35:54.911 --> 02:35:56.230
<v Speaker 4>you get something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're happy.</v>

3845
02:35:56.231 --> 02:35:58.000
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a boat,</v>

3846
02:35:58.001 --> 02:35:59.710
<v Speaker 4>you're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I have this bike,</v>

3847
02:35:59.711 --> 02:36:01.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm be happy and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's true and it works,</v>

3848
02:36:01.871 --> 02:36:06.871
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a point you almost have to </v>

3849
02:36:06.871 --> 02:36:10.141
<v Speaker 4>like get really rich to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you really have to just buy all that </v>

3850
02:36:10.141 --> 02:36:10.480
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was okay.</v>

3851
02:36:10.481 --> 02:36:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Like I got it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool.</v>

3852
02:36:11.981 --> 02:36:13.600
<v Speaker 4>That made me happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's temporary,</v>

3853
02:36:13.601 --> 02:36:14.070
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3854
02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:16.960
<v Speaker 4>that's I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of where I differentiate the</v>

3855
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:18.340
<v Speaker 4>happiness and the pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3856
02:36:18.341 --> 02:36:21.000
<v Speaker 4>you can buy the pleasure for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pleasure is somewhat short lived,</v>

3857
02:36:21.001 --> 02:36:21.150
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3858
02:36:21.610 --> 02:36:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a conversation with someone about </v>

3859
02:36:26.610 --> 02:36:26.610
<v Speaker 4>this recently where I was saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>material possessions,</v>

3860
02:36:26.610 --> 02:36:28.450
<v Speaker 4>once you have enough money to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically everything you want,</v>

3861
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:31.210
<v Speaker 4>they don't mean anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they don't mean anything.</v>

3862
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:33.370
<v Speaker 4>You can enjoy them when you have them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you lose them?</v>

3863
02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.180
<v Speaker 4>It's really not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3864
02:36:35.181 --> 02:36:37.600
<v Speaker 4>if like if you get an escalate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking meteor hits,</v>

3865
02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:40.040
<v Speaker 4>you're escalating and go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Homes get another escalate,</v>

3866
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:41.950
<v Speaker 4>there's bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no big deal.</v>

3867
02:36:42.130 --> 02:36:47.130
<v Speaker 4>But if that was all you had and you had </v>
<v Speaker 4>a save and scrape up your money to get </v>

3868
02:36:47.130 --> 02:36:49.360
<v Speaker 4>that escalate and he kept it clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it got hit by a meteor.</v>

3869
02:36:49.361 --> 02:36:50.490
<v Speaker 4>You'd be devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3870
02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:55.090
<v Speaker 4>Once you have achieved this level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>success where material possessions don't</v>

3871
02:36:55.091 --> 02:36:58.050
<v Speaker 4>mean anything anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can kind of like,</v>

3872
02:36:58.120 --> 02:36:59.580
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what do I enjoy?</v>

3873
02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:01.300
<v Speaker 4>Camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>friendship,</v>

3874
02:37:01.301 --> 02:37:06.301
<v Speaker 4>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is it that I'm actually </v>

3875
02:37:06.301 --> 02:37:08.341
<v Speaker 4>chasing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I remember talking to this </v>

3876
02:37:08.341 --> 02:37:08.440
<v Speaker 4>Buddhist monk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to do this thing once where I went</v>

3877
02:37:08.441 --> 02:37:13.441
<v Speaker 4>to all these different religions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was for this TV show and I </v>

3878
02:37:13.441 --> 02:37:15.230
<v Speaker 4>interviewed all these different people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ask them like,</v>

3879
02:37:15.231 --> 02:37:15.970
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3880
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:17.810
<v Speaker 1>what is it about your religion that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

3881
02:37:17.811 --> 02:37:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Like say if I was going to join your </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

3882
02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you try to sell me your salad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Buddhist guy was saying that sex</v>

3883
02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:27.290
<v Speaker 1>and all these material possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3884
02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:30.800
<v Speaker 1>they possess you and that to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely free,</v>

3885
02:37:30.801 --> 02:37:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to be abstinent and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be free of material possessions.</v>

3886
02:37:33.741 --> 02:37:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3887
02:37:34.131 --> 02:37:35.450
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3888
02:37:35.451 --> 02:37:39.260
<v Speaker 1>what if you achieve a level of success </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you don't worry about those things</v>

3889
02:37:39.261 --> 02:37:40.880
<v Speaker 1>anymore and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

3890
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:43.770
<v Speaker 1>they don't contain you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't hold you there,</v>

3891
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:47.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not a prisoner of them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really not worried about them.</v>

3892
02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Like if all you had was this one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one thing was taken from you,</v>

3893
02:37:51.951 --> 02:37:53.990
<v Speaker 1>that would be devastating and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what this is based on.</v>

3894
02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:56.720
<v Speaker 1>But what if you had unlimited resources?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were,</v>

3895
02:37:56.721 --> 02:37:59.270
<v Speaker 1>if you were Richard Branson or someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you or whatever,</v>

3896
02:37:59.630 --> 02:38:04.630
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an issue then then those </v>

3897
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.760
<v Speaker 1>material possessions no longer possess </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3898
02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but this guy didn't want to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

3899
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Like he didn't want to think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was ever a possibly an option.</v>

3900
02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3901
02:38:09.921 --> 02:38:14.921
<v Speaker 1>it's not an option because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's possible to achieve that </v>

3902
02:38:14.921 --> 02:38:16.010
<v Speaker 1>level of material possession of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>material success.</v>

3903
02:38:16.090 --> 02:38:21.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's Kinda the thing I feel like </v>

3904
02:38:21.090 --> 02:38:22.651
<v Speaker 6>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to get to that place to </v>

3905
02:38:22.651 --> 02:38:22.651
<v Speaker 6>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3906
02:38:22.651 --> 02:38:23.550
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda like tell him that</v>

3907
02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:28.560
<v Speaker 1>to anybody who's listening to this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>99 point nine percent of people </v>

3908
02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:31.711
<v Speaker 1>listening to this are never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a fraction of the amount of money </v>

3909
02:38:31.711 --> 02:38:31.711
<v Speaker 1>that you've earned.</v>

3910
02:38:31.711 --> 02:38:32.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

3911
02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:38.160
<v Speaker 6>in some ways that is a blessing because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to have a lifetime of </v>

3912
02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:40.660
<v Speaker 6>being able to buy that pleasure to </v>
<v Speaker 6>because of that.</v>

3913
02:38:40.661 --> 02:38:45.661
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because if you start here on this lower </v>

3914
02:38:45.661 --> 02:38:46.600
<v Speaker 6>rung than all those little purchases and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that,</v>

3915
02:38:46.601 --> 02:38:49.420
<v Speaker 6>you're still like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're enjoying the shit out there.</v>

3916
02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:52.110
<v Speaker 6>Their baseline is just lower,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3917
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:54.010
<v Speaker 6>They get a new fishing rod,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're fucking pumped.</v>

3918
02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:55.000
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3919
02:38:55.001 --> 02:39:00.001
<v Speaker 6>and when that wears off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then they're gonna get a new reel and </v>

3920
02:39:00.001 --> 02:39:00.001
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when that wears off,</v>

3921
02:39:00.001 --> 02:39:01.660
<v Speaker 6>they're gonna buy a new depth finder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

3922
02:39:01.661 --> 02:39:03.460
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's the little ship,</v>

3923
02:39:03.461 --> 02:39:05.170
<v Speaker 6>that little shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it makes them happy,</v>

3924
02:39:05.171 --> 02:39:06.760
<v Speaker 6>then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then that's okay.</v>

3925
02:39:06.761 --> 02:39:07.080
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3926
02:39:07.250 --> 02:39:08.660
<v Speaker 1>but to the people listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

3927
02:39:08.661 --> 02:39:09.410
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3928
02:39:09.411 --> 02:39:14.411
<v Speaker 1>well you're equating material </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessions in the acquisition of these </v>

3929
02:39:14.411 --> 02:39:15.440
<v Speaker 1>material possessions as being the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes people happy.</v>

3930
02:39:15.441 --> 02:39:20.441
<v Speaker 1>Now is this because you've got 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches and you're flying around on </v>

3931
02:39:20.441 --> 02:39:23.450
<v Speaker 1>private jets and yachts and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lacking like real depth to you.</v>

3932
02:39:23.451 --> 02:39:25.430
<v Speaker 1>You're a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a dumb guy.</v>

3933
02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:28.130
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's the case.</v>

3934
02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I think you're having a lot of fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3935
02:39:30.651 --> 02:39:32.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a lot of wild,</v>

3936
02:39:32.241 --> 02:39:37.241
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think you're lacking in </v>

3937
02:39:37.241 --> 02:39:37.241
<v Speaker 1>depth.</v>

3938
02:39:37.241 --> 02:39:40.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no I am just trying to fully experience </v>

3939
02:39:40.130 --> 02:39:44.360
<v Speaker 6>everything that I wanted to experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there also a part of me that's,</v>

3940
02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:47.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kinda doing some wish fulfillment,</v>

3941
02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:52.150
<v Speaker 6>some part of me that's overcompensating </v>
<v Speaker 6>for lack of things,</v>

3942
02:39:52.151 --> 02:39:57.151
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I had childhood was or when I was </v>

3943
02:39:57.151 --> 02:39:59.721
<v Speaker 6>growing up or that I wanted or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>it was basically just kinda like </v>

3944
02:39:59.721 --> 02:40:01.710
<v Speaker 6>whatever I wanted when I was younger or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever I place emphasis on,</v>

3945
02:40:01.711 --> 02:40:06.570
<v Speaker 6>I kinda like just overexaggerated and </v>
<v Speaker 6>beat it into the fucking dirt.</v>

3946
02:40:06.571 --> 02:40:10.080
<v Speaker 6>So then now I can move on and do </v>
<v Speaker 6>something else like my life,</v>

3947
02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:11.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>

3948
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:12.990
<v Speaker 6>I have add,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so for,</v>

3949
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:18.200
<v Speaker 6>it's like hypersensitive or real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it is and I think I think a lot </v>

3950
02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:20.820
<v Speaker 6>of successful people have it and I think</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it allows you to do is when you are</v>

3951
02:40:20.821 --> 02:40:24.390
<v Speaker 6>focused on something and when you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>that like pinpoint focus,</v>

3952
02:40:24.391 --> 02:40:27.390
<v Speaker 6>you can be extremely successful but when</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't,</v>

3953
02:40:27.391 --> 02:40:32.391
<v Speaker 6>you're just scattered all over the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking map and you can't accomplish </v>

3954
02:40:32.391 --> 02:40:32.391
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>

3955
02:40:32.391 --> 02:40:36.290
<v Speaker 6>I mean you're just like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think a lot of kids have nowadays </v>

3956
02:40:36.290 --> 02:40:36.780
<v Speaker 6>because of the stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

3957
02:40:36.781 --> 02:40:41.781
<v Speaker 6>I think you have so much stimulus at </v>
<v Speaker 6>your fingertips nowadays that these </v>

3958
02:40:41.781 --> 02:40:42.060
<v Speaker 6>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they're not,</v>

3959
02:40:42.830 --> 02:40:47.830
<v Speaker 6>I guess I guess what I'm trying to say </v>
<v Speaker 6>is that people just overstimulated in </v>

3960
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:48.900
<v Speaker 6>and because they have it at their </v>
<v Speaker 6>fingertips all the time.</v>

3961
02:40:48.901 --> 02:40:53.901
<v Speaker 6>Like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we used to have to entertain </v>

3962
02:40:53.901 --> 02:40:56.841
<v Speaker 6>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You said it was just like go out and </v>

3963
02:40:56.841 --> 02:40:56.841
<v Speaker 6>play,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3964
02:40:56.841 --> 02:40:58.710
<v Speaker 6>and just like figure out shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so we didn't need massive amounts of</v>

3965
02:40:58.711 --> 02:41:03.711
<v Speaker 6>stimulus nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If kids don't have a fucking video game </v>

3966
02:41:03.711 --> 02:41:06.060
<v Speaker 6>and a movie playing at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're bored and three other friends to</v>

3967
02:41:06.061 --> 02:41:06.690
<v Speaker 6>talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3968
02:41:06.691 --> 02:41:08.760
<v Speaker 6>so it's when they're hanging out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're constantly checking their phone,</v>

3969
02:41:08.761 --> 02:41:09.750
<v Speaker 6>they're not even looking at each other.</v>

3970
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:10.460
<v Speaker 6>They know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3971
02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:12.300
<v Speaker 6>And I'm victim of it too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3972
02:41:12.301 --> 02:41:13.040
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you'll be,</v>

3974
02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:16.740
<v Speaker 6>you'll be in a social setting and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there'll be five,</v>

3975
02:41:16.741 --> 02:41:19.650
<v Speaker 6>six people at a table and they'll all be</v>
<v Speaker 6>on their phones and it's just like,</v>

3976
02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:23.040
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda sad that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we've been reduced to that level of</v>

3977
02:41:23.041 --> 02:41:25.700
<v Speaker 6>interaction where it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 6>electronic,</v>

3978
02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:27.900
<v Speaker 6>like this just all electronic and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3979
02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:33.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I mean when people call people </v>

3980
02:41:33.130 --> 02:41:33.130
<v Speaker 6>nowadays,</v>

3982
02:41:33.130 --> 02:41:34.350
<v Speaker 6>Like why are you calling me back when we</v>
<v Speaker 6>were kids,</v>

3983
02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:36.630
<v Speaker 6>like there wasn't even texting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3984
02:41:36.631 --> 02:41:41.631
<v Speaker 6>it was like flip phones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like now it's like if somebody calls </v>

3985
02:41:41.631 --> 02:41:41.631
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

3986
02:41:41.631 --> 02:41:41.631
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

3987
02:41:41.631 --> 02:41:42.600
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have one friend,</v>

3988
02:41:42.601 --> 02:41:45.060
<v Speaker 6>Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We never text each other ever.</v>

3989
02:41:45.210 --> 02:41:46.530
<v Speaker 6>He might've texted me once,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3990
02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:47.550
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is going on?</v>

3991
02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:48.900
<v Speaker 6>All we do is call.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3992
02:41:48.901 --> 02:41:50.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't like to text.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3993
02:41:50.251 --> 02:41:51.630
<v Speaker 6>I like the car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to hear your voice.</v>

3994
02:41:51.631 --> 02:41:53.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to know you love me.</v>

3995
02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:55.560
<v Speaker 6>Like you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wants to talk to you on the phone.</v>

3996
02:41:56.130 --> 02:41:57.480
<v Speaker 6>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3997
02:41:57.560 --> 02:41:59.190
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're definitely missing something.</v>

3998
02:41:59.191 --> 02:42:02.940
<v Speaker 6>We definitely missing something by all </v>
<v Speaker 6>this electronic shit,</v>

3999
02:42:02.970 --> 02:42:05.460
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also like a new style of living and</v>

4000
02:42:05.461 --> 02:42:09.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure humans will adjust eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll figure it out how to manage it or,</v>

4001
02:42:09.370 --> 02:42:14.370
<v Speaker 6>or change accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The one positive thing I think is just </v>

4002
02:42:14.370 --> 02:42:14.430
<v Speaker 6>that you,</v>

4003
02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:17.390
<v Speaker 3>you're so connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4004
02:42:17.391 --> 02:42:22.391
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like everybody's more connected </v>

4005
02:42:22.391 --> 02:42:22.391
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like back when we were kids,</v>

4006
02:42:22.391 --> 02:42:24.200
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy in Idaho is never going to fucking</v>

4007
02:42:24.470 --> 02:42:27.920
<v Speaker 3>feel any connection whatsoever with </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that's in California,</v>

4008
02:42:27.921 --> 02:42:32.921
<v Speaker 3>but now like that guy can upload a </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube video and everybody around the </v>

4009
02:42:32.921 --> 02:42:33.920
<v Speaker 3>world can see it and people are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4010
02:42:33.921 --> 02:42:36.200
<v Speaker 3>dating wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media wise,</v>

4011
02:42:36.201 --> 02:42:37.220
<v Speaker 3>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

4012
02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:39.820
<v Speaker 3>there is more connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I feel like it's,</v>

4013
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:43.190
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite as real and it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 3>tangible but.</v>

4014
02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:48.700
<v Speaker 3>And people I think are also losing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing the ability to kind of like </v>

4015
02:42:49.491 --> 02:42:52.370
<v Speaker 3>interact like I like my older friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we'll sit around,</v>

4016
02:42:52.371 --> 02:42:54.500
<v Speaker 3>we'll tell stories and it's like we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>have fun.</v>

4017
02:42:54.501 --> 02:42:57.770
<v Speaker 3>And it's like the younger generation </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you watch them interact,</v>

4018
02:42:57.771 --> 02:43:02.771
<v Speaker 3>it's almost comical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like these people like socially </v>

4019
02:43:02.771 --> 02:43:05.801
<v Speaker 3>awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they don't like people don't know </v>

4020
02:43:05.801 --> 02:43:07.841
<v Speaker 3>how to like approach girls anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like in the whole thing has </v>

4021
02:43:07.841 --> 02:43:08.330
<v Speaker 3>been reduced to like online dating,</v>

4022
02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:10.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4023
02:43:10.871 --> 02:43:12.070
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a new world</v>

4024
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.820
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4025
02:43:12.821 --> 02:43:17.821
<v Speaker 4>I don't know there's a new world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I found really fascinating is </v>

4026
02:43:17.821 --> 02:43:21.331
<v Speaker 4>that because I travel a lot doing stand </v>
<v Speaker 4>up is that there's no dumb places </v>

4027
02:43:21.331 --> 02:43:22.510
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can go to,</v>

4028
02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:27.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blank some place in the </v>

4029
02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:27.780
<v Speaker 4>middle of the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boise,</v>

4030
02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:30.991
<v Speaker 4>Idaho or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'll do a show there and the </v>

4031
02:43:30.991 --> 02:43:34.231
<v Speaker 4>fucking people are on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know what the fuck's going on </v>

4032
02:43:34.231 --> 02:43:34.231
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much more informed.</v>

4033
02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:39.420
<v Speaker 4>When I used to travel on the road in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nineties when I used to do stand up in </v>

4034
02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:40.660
<v Speaker 4>the nineties and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fly into Ohio or sorry Jamie,</v>

4035
02:43:41.050 --> 02:43:45.100
<v Speaker 4>fly into someplace in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country is fucking people were apes.</v>

4036
02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:47.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean they didn't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

4037
02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:51.250
<v Speaker 4>what's it like to be on an airplane?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mean fucking didn't know anything.</v>

4038
02:43:51.251 --> 02:43:51.580
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

4039
02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:56.610
<v Speaker 4>But now it's like you run into the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of people in la that you can run </v>

4040
02:43:56.610 --> 02:43:58.360
<v Speaker 4>into in fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4041
02:43:58.361 --> 02:44:00.220
<v Speaker 4>Phoenix or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck it is.</v>

4042
02:44:00.221 --> 02:44:02.910
<v Speaker 4>There's no dumb cities anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still gonna.</v>

4043
02:44:02.930 --> 02:44:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Find some dumb people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think overall the awareness level </v>

4044
02:44:07.930 --> 02:44:12.091
<v Speaker 4>of people has changed and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot due to the internet,</v>

4045
02:44:12.310 --> 02:44:13.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honest that accident.</v>

4046
02:44:13.561 --> 02:44:14.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid,</v>

4047
02:44:14.881 --> 02:44:16.450
<v Speaker 4>if I wanted to know something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her mom's like,</v>

4048
02:44:16.451 --> 02:44:21.451
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look it up and the encyclopedia </v>

4049
02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:21.451
<v Speaker 4>Britannica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like fuck that.</v>

4050
02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:25.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we literally would have like </v>

4051
02:44:25.490 --> 02:44:26.640
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of encyclopedias around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and like,</v>

4052
02:44:27.150 --> 02:44:28.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we thought that was great,</v>

4053
02:44:28.601 --> 02:44:30.760
<v Speaker 4>but now it's like you want to know </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

4054
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:32.890
<v Speaker 4>you google it and you just instantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>know it.</v>

4055
02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:35.290
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't even have to press it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just talk into your phone.</v>

4056
02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:36.660
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to type,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4057
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just ask Siri.</v>

4058
02:44:38.281 --> 02:44:42.880
<v Speaker 4>It's like google cold fusion shows you </v>
<v Speaker 4>instantaneously.</v>

4059
02:44:42.881 --> 02:44:47.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so freaky that they didn't even </v>

4060
02:44:47.881 --> 02:44:47.881
<v Speaker 4>think about it in star trek or star </v>
<v Speaker 4>wars.</v>

4061
02:44:47.881 --> 02:44:51.190
<v Speaker 4>None of those places had the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of those visions of science fiction</v>

4062
02:44:51.191 --> 02:44:52.410
<v Speaker 4>in the future had the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4063
02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:53.480
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

4064
02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:56.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to be when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when history is all said and done,</v>

4065
02:44:56.351 --> 02:45:01.351
<v Speaker 4>when people look back on this era as </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be one of the biggest </v>

4066
02:45:01.351 --> 02:45:02.140
<v Speaker 4>changes in the human race ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're in the middle of it.</v>

4067
02:45:02.141 --> 02:45:04.180
<v Speaker 4>It's a storm and we're just caught up in</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4068
02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:09.450
<v Speaker 4>And like you were talking about when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were saying how you're so wealthy and </v>

4069
02:45:09.450 --> 02:45:12.751
<v Speaker 4>it's just normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just becomes normal to you to have </v>

4070
02:45:12.751 --> 02:45:12.751
<v Speaker 4>all this money and someone gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lamborghini.</v>

4071
02:45:12.751 --> 02:45:12.910
<v Speaker 4>It's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4072
02:45:12.911 --> 02:45:15.550
<v Speaker 4>this wealth of information is normal to </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

4073
02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:17.440
<v Speaker 4>It just seems normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4074
02:45:17.441 --> 02:45:19.060
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kids are young,</v>

4075
02:45:19.061 --> 02:45:21.100

<v Speaker 4>whole life.</v>

4076
02:45:21.130 --> 02:45:22.990
<v Speaker 4>They've never experienced anything but </v>
<v Speaker 4>the internet.</v>

4077
02:45:22.991 --> 02:45:27.991
<v Speaker 4>So it's to them they're not gonna know </v>
<v Speaker 4>how weird it was to run into bullshit </v>

4078

<v Speaker 4>artists now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just lied about stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 4>we started talking about psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you started talking about some </v>

4087

<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experiences that you had.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the DMT.</v>

4093
02:46:01.410 --> 02:46:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

4094
02:46:02.410 --> 02:46:07.410
<v Speaker 4>the first time I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at burning man and I smoked a </v>

4095
02:46:07.410 --> 02:46:07.610
<v Speaker 4>small amount of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4096

<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

4098
02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was a pretty enlightening</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

4099
02:46:12.470 --> 02:46:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried it a second time.</v>

4100
02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:18.350
<v Speaker 3>We had this small Malik,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many hits?</v>

4101
02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Just one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just one.</v>

4102
02:46:19.911 --> 02:46:20.620
<v Speaker 3>So I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4103
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:23.390
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like deep in it or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to the doorway.</v>

4104
02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:24.980
<v Speaker 3>Took a look inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4105
02:46:24.981 --> 02:46:26.000
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

4106
02:46:26.001 --> 02:46:28.490
<v Speaker 3>it felt like a little bit of sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>peace and clarity,</v>

4107
02:46:28.491 --> 02:46:30.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was all I really got from it.</v>

4108
02:46:30.351 --> 02:46:32.320
<v Speaker 3>The second time I did not have a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

4109
02:46:32.350 --> 02:46:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Shaolin monk come over and he a priest</v>

4110
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:39.860
<v Speaker 3>or whatever you call them and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we did too much,</v>

4111
02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:45.370
<v Speaker 3>but I just didn't really get too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually got more out of it after,</v>

4112
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:50.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but during the experience it was like,</v>

4113
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:53.390
<v Speaker 3>it was just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really get anything.</v>

4114
02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:55.910
<v Speaker 3>It was just almost like overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4115
02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just overwhelming where like,</v>

4116
02:46:58.650 --> 02:46:59.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was almost like a,</v>

4117
02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:04.600
<v Speaker 3>almost like a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of the best way to describe it </v>

4118
02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:08.681
<v Speaker 3>where I just like kinda almost seemed </v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything was kind of like </v>

4119
02:47:08.681 --> 02:47:08.890
<v Speaker 3>separating apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4120
02:47:08.891 --> 02:47:11.570
<v Speaker 3>but didn't really get too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4121
02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:15.500
<v Speaker 3>and then the third time I had a similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

4122
02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was,</v>

4123
02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:24.080
<v Speaker 3>that was just a smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done Iowasca or anything like </v>

4124
02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:24.410
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did mushrooms three times.</v>

4125
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny.</v>

4126
02:47:26.391 --> 02:47:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a couple,</v>

4127
02:47:29.090 --> 02:47:31.930
<v Speaker 3>so the first time I did mushrooms I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think goes was in high school and I just</v>

4128
02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:35.150
<v Speaker 3>never forget because it was like 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning or whatever.</v>

4129
02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:40.510
<v Speaker 3>And I just wanted to call all my friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tell them how great it was and have </v>

4130
02:47:40.510 --> 02:47:40.510
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember them picking up the phone,</v>

4131
02:47:40.510 --> 02:47:43.580
<v Speaker 3>like Cheetahs 30 fuck off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was just like,</v>

4132
02:47:43.581 --> 02:47:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to everybody.</v>

4133
02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having a good time and then I did </v>

4134
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:53.231
<v Speaker 3>an Amsterdam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got sick and it was funny because I </v>

4135
02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:55.940
<v Speaker 3>actually did it four times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third time I did it,</v>

4136
02:47:55.941 --> 02:48:00.941
<v Speaker 3>we were in Amsterdam and we were walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>down this long alleyway and we were </v>

4137
02:48:01.521 --> 02:48:06.521
<v Speaker 3>probably about 75 yards down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alleyway and a buddy of mine,</v>

4138
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:07.760
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4139
02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:13.100
<v Speaker 3>give me a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we kept walking and we turn around </v>

4140
02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:15.610
<v Speaker 3>about five seconds later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 seconds later,</v>

4141
02:48:15.611 --> 02:48:19.390
<v Speaker 3>and he was gone and it was probably like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 200 yard.</v>

4142
02:48:19.391 --> 02:48:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Allie,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He couldn't have made.</v>

4144
02:48:22.541 --> 02:48:24.320
<v Speaker 3>It was like a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long alleyway there.</v>

4145
02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:27.010
<v Speaker 3>If he was in a dead sprint is a fast guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

4146
02:48:27.011 --> 02:48:30.550
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't have made it the end and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no like no ladders,</v>

4147
02:48:30.551 --> 02:48:31.840
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>really started tripping,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what the fuck happened?</v>

4155
02:48:48.370 --> 02:48:50.340
<v Speaker 3>And we knew these mushrooms are gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit soon.</v>

4156
02:48:50.341 --> 02:48:52.600
<v Speaker 3>So we're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't feel it.</v>

4157
02:48:52.601 --> 02:48:53.710
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mushrooms ain't hit.</v>

4158
02:48:53.711 --> 02:48:54.700
<v Speaker 3>We just ate it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4159

<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4161
02:48:56.051 --> 02:48:59.380
<v Speaker 3>And it hadn't hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walked around the corner and there was a</v>

4162
02:48:59.381 --> 02:49:00.790
<v Speaker 3>police station were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

4163
02:49:00.791 --> 02:49:04.270
<v Speaker 3>like I guess we should ask them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we went in there and we're like,</v>

4164
02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:06.250
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what happened or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And so there's this long alleyway,</v>

4167
02:49:12.901 --> 02:49:16.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this motherfucker chose the one spot</v>

4168
02:49:16.711 --> 02:49:21.711
<v Speaker 3>to piss where apparently there was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a secret door that opened inward into </v>

4169
02:49:21.711 --> 02:49:25.260
<v Speaker 3>the police station and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera facing down and he was pissing on</v>

4170
02:49:25.261 --> 02:49:25.650
<v Speaker 3>the door.</v>

4171
02:49:25.650 --> 02:49:30.650
<v Speaker 3>The police station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grabbed a mid pissed stick still </v>

4172
02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:33.030
<v Speaker 3>out in the fucking police station and </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw them in jail.</v>

4173
02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:35.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we get this information,</v>

4174
02:49:35.911 --> 02:49:36.970
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

4175
02:49:36.971 --> 02:49:39.090
<v Speaker 3>like what do we gotta do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we got to pay this guy,</v>

4176
02:49:39.091 --> 02:49:41.580
<v Speaker 3>like we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dude never done mushrooms before.</v>

4177
02:49:41.581 --> 02:49:44.280
<v Speaker 3>His first experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be in a jail in Amsterdam.</v>

4178
02:49:44.281 --> 02:49:46.260
<v Speaker 3>This guy's my gonna fucking lose his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

4179
02:49:46.530 --> 02:49:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Like we gotta get them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we ended up paying these people and </v>

4180
02:49:51.530 --> 02:49:51.530
<v Speaker 3>then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>

4181
02:49:51.530 --> 02:49:52.980
<v Speaker 3>we've got to pay them a lot because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in college.</v>

4182
02:49:52.981 --> 02:49:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I remember it was like a significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of money for us,</v>

4183
02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:57.660
<v Speaker 3>but we bailed them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I ended up.</v>

4184
02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I remember I offered like the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the counter.</v>

4185
02:50:00.811 --> 02:50:05.811
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you 100 bucks if you'll mail </v>

4186
02:50:05.811 --> 02:50:07.671
<v Speaker 3>this to his parents or the video of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pissing and getting arrested if you met </v>

4187
02:50:07.671 --> 02:50:08.950
<v Speaker 3>his parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out.</v>

4188
02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:14.370
<v Speaker 3>So that was number three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the fourth time I did it,</v>

4189
02:50:14.371 --> 02:50:15.160
<v Speaker 3>I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4190
02:50:15.210 --> 02:50:17.790
<v Speaker 3>it was that trip that I took to Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vallarta.</v>

4191
02:50:18.570 --> 02:50:20.340
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I took my buddy that one,</v>

4192
02:50:20.341 --> 02:50:23.490
<v Speaker 3>the or he got second in the world series</v>
<v Speaker 3>of poker and I,</v>

4193
02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:25.680
<v Speaker 3>and I'll never forget it because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4194
02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:28.710
<v Speaker 3>I was downstairs and we had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4195
02:50:28.730 --> 02:50:33.730
<v Speaker 3>this big villa on the edge of a cliff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I remember not wanting to have sex </v>

4196
02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:38.790
<v Speaker 3>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the greatest thing for the first</v>

4197
02:50:38.791 --> 02:50:40.800
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my Dick doesn't control me.</v>

4198
02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Like I like this is so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4199
02:50:43.291 --> 02:50:48.291
<v Speaker 3>this is so nice to just be able to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>relax and not like because we had all </v>

4200
02:50:48.291 --> 02:50:52.791
<v Speaker 3>these chicks running around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like banging on the whole weekend </v>

4201
02:50:52.791 --> 02:50:54.921
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not even like half to like think </v>

4202
02:50:54.921 --> 02:50:54.921
<v Speaker 3>about it because I have no desire to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have sex right now.</v>

4203
02:50:54.921 --> 02:50:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I remember having that thought and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4204
02:50:56.311 --> 02:51:01.311
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great and I'm so fucked up that </v>

4205
02:51:01.311 --> 02:51:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I like took that as a personal challenge</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like see if I can have sex.</v>

4206
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking this girl for like 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes on mushrooms on mushrooms.</v>

4207
02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:11.280
<v Speaker 3>It was the craziest bucket experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

4208
02:51:11.790 --> 02:51:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even really enjoy it that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just remember at the end of it I </v>

4209
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.790
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4210
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:21.621
<v Speaker 3>like you had this opportunity where like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were not consumed with wanting to </v>

4211
02:51:21.621 --> 02:51:25.401
<v Speaker 3>have sex and he could put the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruined it foot.</v>

4212
02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:29.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a mushroom trip.</v>

4213
02:51:29.401 --> 02:51:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4214
02:51:30.630 --> 02:51:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I was with my friend Eddie and we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>near a mountain.</v>

4215
02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:37.830
<v Speaker 4>It was a very high hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were below it and we were laying down</v>

4216
02:51:37.831 --> 02:51:42.300
<v Speaker 4>in the grass just laughing and giggling </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know if you've ever,</v>

4217
02:51:42.301 --> 02:51:47.301
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've ever been like lying down </v>

4218
02:51:47.301 --> 02:51:50.430
<v Speaker 4>looking up at a mountain range and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>see the sky and the clouds go overhead.</v>

4219
02:51:50.970 --> 02:51:55.970
<v Speaker 4>It was the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in my life that I really took in</v>

4220
02:51:57.330 --> 02:52:02.330
<v Speaker 4>the concept of an atmosphere of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>shape of the earth being round and that </v>

4221
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:06.180
<v Speaker 4>behind that atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm to look it up as blue sky.</v>

4222
02:52:06.181 --> 02:52:08.590
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't see the blue sky anymore.</v>

4223
02:52:08.591 --> 02:52:09.880
<v Speaker 4>Saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew it was there,</v>

4224
02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.370
<v Speaker 4>but I realized that it's just this </v>
<v Speaker 4>layer.</v>

4225
02:52:12.610 --> 02:52:17.020
<v Speaker 4>And then beyond that is the vast </v>
<v Speaker 4>infinity of space.</v>

4226
02:52:17.350 --> 02:52:22.350
<v Speaker 4>And I remember looking at it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking for the first time because of </v>

4227
02:52:22.350 --> 02:52:22.570
<v Speaker 4>this hill I could see like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4228
02:52:22.571 --> 02:52:24.820
<v Speaker 4>like oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like in a convertible spaceship.</v>

4229
02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:27.520
<v Speaker 4>Like this whole thing is a space ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is an illusion.</v>

4230
02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:28.290
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

4231
02:52:28.291 --> 02:52:30.340
<v Speaker 4>we're standing here like we're on </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>

4232
02:52:30.341 --> 02:52:32.950
<v Speaker 4>we're laying down on the grass looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>up at the sky,</v>

4233
02:52:33.370 --> 02:52:35.620
<v Speaker 4>but this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not sky,</v>

4234
02:52:35.621 --> 02:52:40.621
<v Speaker 4>this is a thin layer of atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's protecting you from space.</v>

4235
02:52:41.350 --> 02:52:44.830
<v Speaker 4>And then above that is there's no end to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4236
02:52:44.890 --> 02:52:49.890
<v Speaker 4>And it fucking stuck in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That idea for the very first time.</v>

4237
02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:55.830
<v Speaker 4>And it's something about being below a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain and laying down and looking up </v>

4238
02:52:55.830 --> 02:52:59.880
<v Speaker 4>and seeing them out and seeing the air </v>
<v Speaker 4>and seeing the clouds go where it just </v>

4239
02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:00.850
<v Speaker 4>said into my mind like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's an atmosphere.</v>

4240
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:03.790
<v Speaker 4>This isn't just the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a.</v>

4241
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:06.760
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from that moment on,</v>

4242
02:53:06.761 --> 02:53:10.240
<v Speaker 4>I can look up at a mountain now and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>get this weird,</v>

4243
02:53:10.241 --> 02:53:15.241
<v Speaker 4>almost like half trippy feeling that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing that I've heard </v>

4244
02:53:15.241 --> 02:53:17.600
<v Speaker 4>actually about a lot of psychedelics is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it is not like,</v>

4245
02:53:17.601 --> 02:53:22.601
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't like rewire you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just makes you think about </v>

4246
02:53:22.601 --> 02:53:23.800
<v Speaker 4>certain things differently and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>

4247
02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:28.920
<v Speaker 4>they explained that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical thing or kind of like almost </v>

4248
02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:33.271
<v Speaker 4>like resets you to like where you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a new perspective on certain </v>

4249
02:53:33.271 --> 02:53:33.480
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that I read.</v>

4250
02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:36.220
<v Speaker 4>I was considering doing acid at burning </v>
<v Speaker 4>man this last year,</v>

4251
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:41.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've heard from a lot of people </v>

4252
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:43.891
<v Speaker 4>that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more like clean form of the </v>

4253
02:53:43.891 --> 02:53:48.111
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms and they kinda like got more </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of it and I had like 10 people tell </v>

4254
02:53:48.111 --> 02:53:49.600
<v Speaker 4>me that it was like the best experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>or life.</v>

4255
02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:52.720
<v Speaker 4>And so that's like a pretty strong </v>
<v Speaker 4>statement of 10 people tell you that.</v>

4256
02:53:52.721 --> 02:53:55.420
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it this year for the first time.</v>

4257
02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:58.750
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say it's like a,</v>

4258
02:53:58.990 --> 02:54:00.070
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's powerful.</v>

4259
02:54:00.130 --> 02:54:05.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're all amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all have their own little thing </v>

4260
02:54:05.130 --> 02:54:05.130
<v Speaker 4>that goes on with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the um,</v>

4261
02:54:05.130 --> 02:54:10.050
<v Speaker 4>the changing of perspective is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial to people that have </v>

4262
02:54:10.050 --> 02:54:13.231
<v Speaker 4>addictions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like apparently people that smoke </v>

4263
02:54:13.231 --> 02:54:15.301
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they'll have a powerful mushroom </v>

4264
02:54:15.301 --> 02:54:15.301
<v Speaker 4>trip and they don't have any desire to </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke cigarettes anymore.</v>

4265
02:54:15.301 --> 02:54:18.610
<v Speaker 4>It's a really common experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drug addicts and you know,</v>

4266
02:54:18.611 --> 02:54:23.611
<v Speaker 4>even people that probably have other </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird addictions like gambling </v>

4267
02:54:23.611 --> 02:54:23.611
<v Speaker 4>addictions or sex addictions like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4268
02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:28.910
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I had a small experience like </v>

4269
02:54:28.910 --> 02:54:31.330
<v Speaker 4>that with the sex thing on the mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was pretty liberating.</v>

4270
02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:36.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think for a lot of people they </v>

4271
02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:36.840
<v Speaker 4>get trapped in the momentum of the life </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're in,</v>

4272
02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:42.160
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes psychedelic trips or you </v>

4273
02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:46.621
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes for people it's just a near </v>

4274
02:54:46.621 --> 02:54:46.621
<v Speaker 4>death experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You almost drowned.</v>

4275
02:54:46.621 --> 02:54:46.621
<v Speaker 4>You don't drown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get out of there and you're like,</v>

4276
02:54:46.621 --> 02:54:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to rethink my whole life.</v>

4277
02:54:48.370 --> 02:54:51.940
<v Speaker 4>And he just just changes who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the reset.</v>

4278
02:54:52.650 --> 02:54:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4279
02:54:53.271 --> 02:54:55.660
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've preached this for a long time.</v>

4280
02:54:55.661 --> 02:54:58.750
<v Speaker 4>I think just so much of your life is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just perspective.</v>

4281
02:54:58.751 --> 02:54:59.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>

4282
02:54:59.741 --> 02:55:00.480
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4283
02:55:00.481 --> 02:55:01.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times I have these,</v>

4284
02:55:01.901 --> 02:55:04.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy part is on</v>

4285
02:55:04.050 --> 02:55:06.870
<v Speaker 3>white disabled veterans out or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>and try and show them a good time.</v>

4286
02:55:06.871 --> 02:55:08.480
<v Speaker 3>And it's one time I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4287
02:55:08.610 --> 02:55:13.610
<v Speaker 3>had this one guy who got both his legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>blown off in Afghanistan and super cool </v>

4288

4289

<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

4290
02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:19.030
<v Speaker 3>there's this like super hot chick that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was at the,</v>

4291
02:55:19.050 --> 02:55:20.690
<v Speaker 3>at the party and I really wanted to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

4292
02:55:20.691 --> 02:55:21.520
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

4325

<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing my legs.</v>

4326
02:56:18.110 --> 02:56:23.110
<v Speaker 3>The best thing that ever happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll just never forget it because </v>

4327

<v Speaker 3>that statement was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this guy to say.</v>

4329
02:56:27.231 --> 02:56:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he followed it up with,</v>

4330
02:56:29.330 --> 02:56:30.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that never happened to me,</v>

4331

<v Speaker 3>I'd be over in fucking some sand pit and</v>

4332
02:56:32.951 --> 02:56:37.951

4333
02:56:37.951 --> 02:56:37.951
<v Speaker 3>gives a shit about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

4334

<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

4337
02:56:43.401 --> 02:56:48.401
<v Speaker 3>now he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go and I motivate people and I give </v>

<v Speaker 3>And then it was just like funny though </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like his whole thought process </v>

4347
02:57:07.911 --> 02:57:12.440
<v Speaker 3>about it was so great and I could just </v>
<v Speaker 3>see how another guy,</v>

4348

<v Speaker 3>if that happened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could easily like get into like the woe </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4352
02:57:18.921 --> 02:57:21.080
<v Speaker 3>think about all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how could this have gone,</v>

4353
02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:23.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy just like accepted it,</v>

4354
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:26.300

<v Speaker 3>And I was just like,</v>

4355
02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:30.980
<v Speaker 3>he viewed it as like a huge positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that was great.</v>

4356
02:57:31.050 --> 02:57:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4357
02:57:33.470 --> 02:57:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I got this youtube thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the story of the Chinese </v>

4358
02:57:38.470 --> 02:57:38.470
<v Speaker 3>farmer.</v>

4359
02:57:38.470 --> 02:57:38.470
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4360
02:57:38.470 --> 02:57:42.400
<v Speaker 3>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he loses his horse and everybody in </v>

4361
02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:42.400
<v Speaker 3>the town comes over and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4362
02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:43.430
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's terrible.</v>

4363
02:57:43.460 --> 02:57:44.470
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

4364
02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:46.160
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4365
02:57:46.161 --> 02:57:47.570
<v Speaker 3>well that's terrible now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

4366
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:49.190
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

4367
02:57:49.730 --> 02:57:54.730
<v Speaker 3>And then the next day seven wild horses </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back and they all come over and </v>

4368
02:57:54.730 --> 02:57:54.730
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4369
02:57:54.730 --> 02:57:55.970
<v Speaker 3>well that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

4370
02:57:55.971 --> 02:57:58.820
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the next day his kid is taken out,</v>

4371
02:57:58.821 --> 02:58:03.821
<v Speaker 3>one of the wild horses and breaks his </v>
<v Speaker 3>leg and the whole town comes over and </v>

4372
02:58:03.821 --> 02:58:03.821
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4373
02:58:03.821 --> 02:58:03.821
<v Speaker 3>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in it.</v>

4374
02:58:04.230 --> 02:58:09.230
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the next day the conscription </v>

4375
02:58:09.230 --> 02:58:09.630
<v Speaker 3>officers come over and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4376
02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:14.840
<v Speaker 3>taking people into the military to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and they pass by his son because </v>

4377
02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:15.810
<v Speaker 3>he's got a broken leg and the whole town</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes over and they say,</v>

4378
02:58:15.930 --> 02:58:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>

4379
02:58:16.621 --> 02:58:17.490
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great now.</v>

4380
02:58:17.490 --> 02:58:18.510
<v Speaker 3>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

4381
02:58:19.170 --> 02:58:24.170
<v Speaker 3>And the point of it is that you never </v>
<v Speaker 3>really know if something is bad or good </v>

4382
02:58:25.111 --> 02:58:29.100
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know how that's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect the rest of your life.</v>

4383
02:58:29.101 --> 02:58:30.190
<v Speaker 3>Like back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4384
02:58:30.270 --> 02:58:33.570
<v Speaker 3>when I fuck up two days before graduated</v>
<v Speaker 3>seal training,</v>

4385
02:58:33.571 --> 02:58:38.571
<v Speaker 3>I've done 510 days of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put my fucking heart and soul into </v>

4386
02:58:38.571 --> 02:58:42.081
<v Speaker 3>this fucking thing and I get kicked out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because some fucking guy doesn't like </v>

4387
02:58:42.081 --> 02:58:42.510
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4388
02:58:42.511 --> 02:58:44.850
<v Speaker 3>it's kind kinda hard to look at that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>any way other than,</v>

4389
02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:46.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking terrible.</v>

4390
02:58:46.650 --> 02:58:49.170
<v Speaker 3>But as I'm older and I've experienced a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>

4391
02:58:49.171 --> 02:58:50.640
<v Speaker 3>I can look at that and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4392
02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:55.140
<v Speaker 3>half of my class died right in combat so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have fucking died.</v>

4393
02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I would have became a navy seal,</v>

4394
02:58:58.261 --> 02:59:00.960
<v Speaker 3>then that might've just been like what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hung my hat on,</v>

4395
02:59:00.961 --> 02:59:01.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was just like,</v>

4396
02:59:01.861 --> 02:59:06.861
<v Speaker 3>for the rest of my life I didn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I really needed to fucking prove </v>

4397
02:59:06.861 --> 02:59:08.440
<v Speaker 3>anything or excel or do anything because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done this thing that everybody uses</v>

4398
02:59:08.460 --> 02:59:11.370
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4399
02:59:11.410 --> 02:59:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I would've been as </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated.</v>

4400
02:59:13.740 --> 02:59:18.740
<v Speaker 3>And so there's just a lot of things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and your life that in the short </v>

4401
02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:21.400
<v Speaker 3>term you look at them as being extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>negatives or you know,</v>

4402
02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:23.430
<v Speaker 3>something that you view as positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

4403
02:59:23.431 --> 02:59:25.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just hard to say until,</v>

4404
02:59:25.830 --> 02:59:30.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda like run its course and you </v>
