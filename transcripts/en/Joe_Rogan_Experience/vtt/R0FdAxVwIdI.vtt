00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.580
<v Speaker 1>It makes you really like,</v>

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>just like the way people are abused in other places and the way they don't have</v>

4
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>rights of life.</v>

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.661
<v Speaker 1>The value a lot there.</v>

6
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're abused,</v>

7
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and you're just taken advantage of by whatever the government,</v>

9
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 1>the local city,</v>

10
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>you're just the situation,</v>

11
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:19.634
<v Speaker 1>your plight in the world.</v>

12
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.811
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

13
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:20.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:21.291
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

15
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.490
<v Speaker 1>well there's no value of life.</v>

16
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:23.324
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

17
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

18
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

20
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

21
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I watched one time a guy didn't want to spend</v>

22
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>40 bucks to keep his kid alive and let him die.</v>

23
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.080
<v Speaker 1>He said he'd already spent a hundred and that was enough.</v>

24
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.021
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>You're getting into real situations,</v>

26
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:41.031
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

27
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:41.691
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

28
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:46.691
<v Speaker 1>You see different ways people look at it and Christ and so now look,</v>

29
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>is this every person there?</v>

30
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:49.401
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

31
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's situations that happen.</v>

32
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Those are choices they had to make.</v>

33
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

34
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.521
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

35

<v Speaker 1>like absolutely.</v>

36

<v Speaker 1>It makes me appreciate America.</v>

37
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>It makes me appreciate our bill of rights and makes me appreciate our political</v>

38
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:01.311
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

39
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.144
<v Speaker 1>Makes me appreciate,</v>

40
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

42
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>we pitch about things here that</v>

43
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>the other world would die to have as a complaint.</v>

44
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

45
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.071
<v Speaker 1>we're upset,</v>

46
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>the traffic's bad.</v>

47
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>We're upset that,</v>

48
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>my wife is mad at me that I'd come home at five 30 and I said,</v>

50
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll be all right.</v>

51
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>No cannibals.</v>

52
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>people are upset about,</v>

56
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>this transgender situation.</v>

58
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.303
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

60
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

61
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>You get to go home and hug your kid and you got a whole,</v>

62
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the world's biggest army dying for your rights,</v>

63
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 1>dying for you.</v>

64
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>You have a giant system that's protecting your life.</v>

65
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>You have people dying for you every day.</v>

66
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>There's one way to look at it.</v>

67
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Another way to look at it,</v>

68
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>people would say is that giant system is set up by the military industrial</v>

69
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>complex to steal resources was another country.</v>

70
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.861
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

71
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody's coming over here,</v>

72
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

74
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>

75
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

77
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>This is the best possible situation in the camera,</v>

78
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean you and I are on a boat to get to that better live.</v>

79
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>we know that it can be better.</v>

81
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

82
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think what the argument is.</v>

83
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.561
<v Speaker 1>The argument isn't,</v>

84
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>we should stop complaining.</v>

85
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

86
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:18.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

87
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

88
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we know it can get better,</v>

89
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying when you see it right,</v>

90
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>it's far better than New Guinea.</v>

91
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It's far better than Somalia.</v>

92
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>It's far better than a lot of the places you've traveled to.</v>

93
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.901
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

94
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:29.734
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

95
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.421
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

96
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:35.421
<v Speaker 1>when you do travel to these places and you do go over there and you experience</v>

97
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.354
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>

98
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>does it give you this feeling of like,</v>

99
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>like almost like helplessness.</v>

100
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>

101
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>you can't do enough to help these people.</v>

102
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>The system that they're involved in the life that they lived in the community</v>

103
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and there we sort of entangled in.</v>

104
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.931
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you,</v>

105
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:52.201
<v Speaker 1>Hans,</v>

106
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I've gone on with my dad and he brought it 20 full giant Cabella's bags,</v>

107
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>just worth of gifts for him.</v>

108
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

109
00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>just given stuff at the very,</v>

110

<v Speaker 1>my dad's name,</v>

112
00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:00.491
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>

113
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>we called it Larry Mart.</v>

114
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 1>We just let them all come in and just pick everything they want,</v>

115
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>and giving them things to hunt with.</v>

117
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

118
00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>just soccer balls,</v>

119
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:10.241
<v Speaker 1>frisbees,</v>

120
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>close toothbrushes,</v>

121
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.063
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

122
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and these are people that like need it.</v>

124
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a show like that covers Gilligan's island,</v>

125
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>although no one fucked ginger or Maryanne,</v>

127
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

128
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>no one fucked at all.</v>

129
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>If you want to talk about like one of the most unrealistic shows of all time,</v>

130
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Gilligan's island had to be because there was no sex,</v>

131
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.931
<v Speaker 1>there was no Saxon.</v>

132
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:38.540
<v Speaker 1>And yet how old are they?</v>

133
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>They're basic human needs are pretty well met because the professor belt,</v>

134
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>these kickass hots,</v>

135
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.040
<v Speaker 1>anal lagoons,</v>

136
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>stuffed with fish.</v>

137
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Now he was like,</v>

138
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>they were in Eden,</v>

139
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.071
<v Speaker 1>so they had plenty.</v>

140
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they didn't have time to hit on ginger,</v>

141
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>make her a fucking,</v>

142
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>make her a necklace out of some coral.</v>

143
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And they were always trying to leave and go back to civilization.</v>

144
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And all the people in civilization would watch that show go,</v>

145
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.131
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

146
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you're in paradise.</v>

147
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 1>This girl can't do any better than you cause there's no one else.</v>

148
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:05.140

00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:47.070
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

298
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.281
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

299
00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:47.651
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

300
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:47.941
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

301
00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:48.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

302
00:07:48.121 --> 00:07:48.760
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you.</v>

303
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.140
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

304
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.500
<v Speaker 2>after he was out of the eagles,</v>

305
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>he had a real low spot where he is partying hard and canceling gigs all the</v>

306
00:07:57.001 --> 00:07:57.630
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

307
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.560
<v Speaker 2>So he cleaned up and uh,</v>

308
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Amanda said we're booking a tour,</v>

309
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.540
<v Speaker 2>but if you cancel one show,</v>

310
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:05.010
<v Speaker 2>all the shows will be gone.</v>

311
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.750
<v Speaker 2>So the first night of the tour,</v>

312
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.350
<v Speaker 2>he's backstage eaten on the Deli tray after sound check.</v>

313
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 2>And about a couple of hours later he gets mad food poisoning and he starts just</v>

314
00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:18.090
<v Speaker 2>shitting and shitting.</v>

315
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:18.601
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

316
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:19.680
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to cancel?</v>

317
00:08:19.681 --> 00:08:20.341
<v Speaker 2>And the manager goes,</v>

318
00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you cancel this Gig.</v>

319
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.100
<v Speaker 2>The entire tourist gone.</v>

320
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 2>So they go to Kmart or whenever was open and they get the rubber fishing waders.</v>

321
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.520
<v Speaker 2>He puts him on the ones that go up to your tits.</v>

322
00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:33.030
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

323
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.140
<v Speaker 2>we river runs through it,</v>

324
00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:34.980
<v Speaker 2>fly fishing.</v>

325
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.510
<v Speaker 2>He gets on stage and just start going at it.</v>

326
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Why are you shitting?</v>

327
00:08:40.651 --> 00:08:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Like every couple,</v>

328
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 2>like every few minutes.</v>

329
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

330
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

331
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 2>and he's shitting into rubber when?</v>

332
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 2>When does,</v>

333
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 2>then he said mid show.</v>

334
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 2>He didn't expect this,</v>

335
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 2>but the heat from the lamp started burning the,</v>

336
00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>the diarrhea acid on his legs.</v>

337
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 2>And as I looked at Joe Walsh,</v>

338
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 2>we're wearing those cause he wore weird shit all the time.</v>

339
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.960
<v Speaker 2>It was a wacky show.</v>

340
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Denied shitting himself with weirs on first for him though.</v>

341
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 2>First Minute I met him.</v>

342
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the story he told me and I hope it's true.</v>

343
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.580
<v Speaker 2>It's so great.</v>

344
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

345
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 2>What a great story you're talking about the eagles,</v>

346
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
