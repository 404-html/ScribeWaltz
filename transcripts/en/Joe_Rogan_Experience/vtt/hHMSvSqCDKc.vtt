1
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you sir?</v>

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask you this because I was </v>

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>reading this today and I started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>freak out a NASA is planning on drilling</v>

8
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>into yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>To save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about this.</v>

10
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the relieving pressure.</v>

11
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

12
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the practice.</v>

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about chiropractors for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the startup folks.</v>

14
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they plan on like a,</v>

15
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>you know how like if you have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant cyst and you sort of make a slice </v>

16
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.111
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of squeeze everything out </v>

17
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:42.111
<v Speaker 1>of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see a doctor do that.</v>

18
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>I've seen doctors do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen this.</v>

19
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:47.651
<v Speaker 1>I do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea NASA wants to send </v>

20
00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA wants to spend $3,000,000,000</v>

21
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:52.911
<v Speaker 1>drilling into a volcano to save the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and a presumably a large </v>

22
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:57.831
<v Speaker 1>chunk of the world to write because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be some sort of a nuclear </v>

23
00:00:57.831 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>winter type scenario where the guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be covered with.</v>

24
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>This is not your area of expertise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry to throw this out,</v>

25
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder about the providence of this,</v>

26
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>these are things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some people's areas of expertise,</v>

28
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>but no one has figured everything out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't know all the forces that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are pushing around to make volcanoes and</v>

30
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

31
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So back to that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this picture.</v>

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>That picture freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's realistic.</v>

33
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every six to 800,000</v>

34
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

35
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Blow Sky High.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft paint version of geophysics.</v>

36
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It's from like a geocities site from </v>
<v Speaker 1>1994.</v>

38
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to think about it,</v>

40
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he keeps this up close to you.</v>

41
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

42
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it.</v>

43
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of disasters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could happen to us that we don't really </v>

45
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>plan for because human lifetimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years.</v>

46
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Technology is a few hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there are disasters that </v>

47
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>happen every thousand or 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and they could be very bad.</v>

48
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:03.111
<v Speaker 1>I think solar flares are the one to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really worry about it because that what </v>

49
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>you you're concerned with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not my pressure professional </v>

50
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.541
<v Speaker 1>concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was once sitting next to a hot </v>

51
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:11.271
<v Speaker 1>shot lawyer who had just been finished a</v>
<v Speaker 1>visiting Washington DC to campaign for.</v>

52
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:16.491
<v Speaker 1>We got to start hardening up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical grid because one kind of </v>

53
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:21.651
<v Speaker 1>solar flare that he says happens every </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years could wipe out </v>

54
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>electricity in the United States or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world for weeks or months.</v>

55
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Millions of people would die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>So a few billion dollars and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>harden it and fix things,</v>

57
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but who's going to spend a few billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars for something that happens once </v>

58
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>every thousand years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the issue?</v>

59
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.741
<v Speaker 1>It's like even with preventing asteroids</v>
<v Speaker 1>or doing something to avoid collisions.</v>

60
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>It's right now we don't have an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have other things to worry about.</v>

61
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>We have a terrible president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a global warming.</v>

62
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>We have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have that.</v>

63
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>There's always something that keeps us </v>
<v Speaker 1>from being rational about the future.</v>

64
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

65
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>And with the good news with asteroids is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's other good reasons to look </v>

66
00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>at this guy and map things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

67
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:04.381
<v Speaker 1>So the what astronomers are doing are </v>
<v Speaker 1>piggybacking asteroid mapping strategies</v>

68
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>off of things they can actually get </v>
<v Speaker 1>money for it.</v>

69
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because yeah,</v>

70
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>no one is going to pony up that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to look at the asteroid.</v>

71
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Why would think that that would be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good use of money?</v>

72
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep an eye on the rocks that </v>

73
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.671
<v Speaker 1>might kill everything you would think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone would say for their </v>

74
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:23.671
<v Speaker 1>retirement and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>This avilia planning for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what we have all four.</v>

76
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a big ability.</v>

77
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a big plan for the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

78
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:34.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't there one that just whiz </v>

79
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>by that was three miles wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>But was by means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something like eight times as far</v>

81
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>away as the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that what it was?</v>

82
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not.</v>

83
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>There's the chances of an asteroid even </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be very bad.</v>

84
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>The chances of a bad one or are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller than some of these other thing.</v>

85
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't come from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

86
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>For Comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear the truth is I take the comfort </v>

87
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.381
<v Speaker 1>as you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't there like there's a lot of </v>

88
00:03:58.381 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>areas they can come from like behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun where the,</v>

89
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>the gravity of the sun sort of distorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>the view.</v>

90
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Not really high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to orbit,</v>

91
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't stay behind the sun.</v>

92
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

93
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>

94
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's what's called the garage point.</v>

95
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a place exactly the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the earth is going to have to hang</v>

96
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:18.571
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to be hidden from us for a </v>

97
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>long time and you can hang out there but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would never leave there.</v>

98
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So there probably are some asteroids </v>
<v Speaker 1>right opposite the earth,</v>

99
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>just like most planets have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just sort of orbiting.</v>

100
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

101
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:32.191
<v Speaker 1>they're opening once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 180 degrees away from the earth and </v>

102
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:32.810
<v Speaker 1>that's what they will be doing until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are possible.</v>

103
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>That one can come up and hit us from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

104
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>And we're not looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

105
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

106
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

107
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:44.491
<v Speaker 1>part of the danger is something from far</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the distance holders that we </v>

108
00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:48.721
<v Speaker 1>just haven't just too far away to dim </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't come from like in where </v>

109
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 1>the South Pole is very roughly speaking.</v>

110
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at the whole sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a,</v>

111
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see below the South Pole if </v>

112
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you're in Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

113
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>with lots and lots of telescopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they have that.</v>

114
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the giant one that they put in Chile </v>

115
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>recently that's not totally operational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

116
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

117
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole generation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>telescopes.</v>

118
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I forget which one it is that's there </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

119
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is it the giant Magellan</v>
<v Speaker 1>telescope?</v>

120
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe essential one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just still working on it</v>

121
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>now and Chili's because it's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a high altitude and the environment</v>

122
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.680
<v Speaker 1>is very flat and dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a good place to put telescopes,</v>

124
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:31.081
<v Speaker 1>but that's gotten in trouble with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>local resistance and astronomer is just </v>

125
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.630
<v Speaker 1>not even trying to take that into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration and therefore getting </v>

126
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>themselves in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canary Islands are okay.</v>

127
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

128
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>two ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best places,</v>

129
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Chilean Antarctica.</v>

130
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the Keck observatory couple</v>

131
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been three times and every time I </v>

132
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.971
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I nailed it and every </v>

133
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>time I've been since then I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten like,</v>

134
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>one time we went and I didn't plan for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon and I was like,</v>

135
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too much moon out.</v>

136
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

137
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>it was just too bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was too bright.</v>

138
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.440
<v Speaker 1>And then the next time unfortunately we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got it when it was raining,</v>

139
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>kind of cloudy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't get a good vision,</v>

140
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>but the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time changed my life.</v>

141
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really felt like I was on a </v>

142
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.540
<v Speaker 1>spaceship looking through a window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>what they were observing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

144
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>but we were actually just at the visitor</v>
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

145
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>just looking at the visitor center to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky is so magnificent at night,</v>

146
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no light pollution.</v>

147
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>They use diffused lighting on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island,</v>

148
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>

149
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.710
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

150
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:29.290
<v Speaker 1>the image that you got from just looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

151
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just with the naked eye,</v>

152
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:35.651
<v Speaker 1>it's just spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an amazing view of the Milky </v>

153
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:35.651
<v Speaker 1>Way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the telescope through there,</v>

154
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:35.651
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

155
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gives you a perspective that I </v>

156
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.131
<v Speaker 1>think I think we're missing with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities and I think we've done something </v>

157
00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:43.300
<v Speaker 1>amazing by creating these cities were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

158
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just walk down the street and get </v>

159
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>some food delivered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you can go get a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

161
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go buy a TV.</v>

162
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>There's all this stuff and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>congested areas.</v>

163
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>But in putting all this artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

164
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>we've removed our connection with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of the cosmos.</v>

165
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

166
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm the biggest booster of cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love cities.</v>

167
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I love living in them.</v>

168
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that they're good for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

169
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

170
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does exactly like you said,</v>

171
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>it sort of makes our environment so </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial that we forget.</v>

172
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember a great story a friend of </v>

173
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>mine told me she worked for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization called project exploration,</v>

174
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.050
<v Speaker 1>which is based in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were devoted to bringing the </v>

175
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>wonders of science to kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities and so forth,</v>

176
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>and they do these trips from Chicago on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the train out to Montana to dig up </v>

177
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

178
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 1>And so they are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to go on a ranch,</v>

179
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>they get to dig up real fossils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them back,</v>

180
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 1>and she said the thing that got them the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most that was most effective to them was</v>

181
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 1>they saw stars for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

182
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd grown up in Chicago,</v>

183
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>they'd never seen a star in the sky.</v>

184
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>You see these faint little flickering </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't see like a full.</v>

186
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 1>The view of the Milky Way where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually look up and you see that white </v>

187
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>sort of stripe across the sky and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

188
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:56.210
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that star.</v>

189
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>So those are all stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Milky Way is the best.</v>

190
00:07:58.251 --> 00:07:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I get dizzy looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

191
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that we're at the edge of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning disk whirling around,</v>

192
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't get vertigo,</v>

193
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.740
<v Speaker 1>As a person who studies space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever take time to like go out </v>

195
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.600
<v Speaker 1>into the desert and just to stare at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>space with nothing out there?</v>

196
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>No light pollution that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I study are equations and</v>

198
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:24.551
<v Speaker 1>formulas and theories and I use space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends who are observers go out </v>

199
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:29.291
<v Speaker 1>there and collect the data and figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what ideas we have are right and </v>

200
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:29.291
<v Speaker 1>which ones are wrong.</v>

201
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And I'd love it when I get the chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't go out of my way anymore </v>

202
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.060
<v Speaker 1>than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

203
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>you were saying that people were asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about general relativity.</v>

204
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

205
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 1>the quantum and quantum mechanics people</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter say,</v>

206
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope to figure out quantum mechanics,</v>

207
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 1>but the first time here they look up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for this.</v>

208
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem is not impossible.</v>

209
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm just joking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

210
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:54.881
<v Speaker 1>I'm very touchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things where </v>

211
00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:58.670
<v Speaker 1>everyone is hoping that someone is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to boil it down and simple.</v>

212
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>And Neil degrasse Tyson does a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>job of doing that with the cosmos.</v>

213
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.250
<v Speaker 1>He's been able to boil down quite a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>things on this show where a lot of </v>

214
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.250
<v Speaker 1>people went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks man.</v>

215
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Finally I kind of get it sorta yet.</v>

216
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has an amazing ability,</v>

217
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 1>especially off the cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

218
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like off the cuff I,</v>

219
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I had this vision that he goes home </v>
<v Speaker 1>every night and plans out answers to </v>

220
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.851
<v Speaker 1>every possible question because there so</v>
<v Speaker 1>slick when he delivers that does a </v>

221
00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:25.731
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've heard him give the exact </v>

222
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 1>same semi off the cuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're great.</v>

223
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like it's like a stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian delivering a line.</v>

224
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>It's new to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

225
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>So what is it about it that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand?</v>

227
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 1>You think quantum mechanics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

228
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the subject of the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>book that I'm writing a book I'm working</v>

229
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 1>on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just starting thinking about it,</v>

230
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

231
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.610
<v Speaker 1>it's my professional colleagues with </v>
<v Speaker 1>phds in physics who don't understand </v>

232
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.451
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And rather than being embarrassed by </v>

233
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:53.451
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>rather than thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

235
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:59.151
<v Speaker 1>this is a terrible thing that we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>devote all our resources to </v>

236
00:09:59.151 --> 00:09:59.550
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they flip it,</v>

237
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a aesop's Fox and the grapes,</v>

238
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parable where the Fox is trying to </v>

239
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:07.940
<v Speaker 1>get the grapes and you realize that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't reach,</v>

240
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:07.940
<v Speaker 1>reach them.</v>

241
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never wanted them anyway.</v>

242
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 1>They're probably sour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

243
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's a physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like with quantum mechanics,</v>

244
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 1>like now if you try to understand it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep level,</v>

245
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 1>they disrespect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

246
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:21.621
<v Speaker 1>why are you wasting your time doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we could be calculating some </v>

247
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:21.621
<v Speaker 1>numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

248
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Ego and knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always a weird combination.</v>

249
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I would always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

250
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I've always assumed when I was younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>that well,</v>

251
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:31.401
<v Speaker 1>when you get to the highest levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science or any sort of intellectual </v>

252
00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 1>pursuit that the people that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

253
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be any ego issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would all,</v>

254
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an outsider,</v>

255
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's ego and every other part of</v>

256
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:47.391
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those super smart dudes that are </v>

257
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:47.391
<v Speaker 1>figuring everything out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got all that stuff locked down.</v>

258
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Kind of the opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

259
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>

260
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>These are my people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

262
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

263
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll explain quantum mechanics </v>

264
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please.</v>

265
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 1>But you are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

266
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

267
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ego thing.</v>

268
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the thing about academia being a </v>

269
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.550
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

270
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.141
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's science or anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you are constantly being </v>

271
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>evaluated by every other person you </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet.</v>

272
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a rank,</v>

273
00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:16.050
<v Speaker 1>how good you are at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

274
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's not written down necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a rankings that appeared in </v>

275
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>the sports pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone is judging you all the time</v>

276
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my students and so forth,</v>

277
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

278
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to ask questions in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>seminar because I worry that someone's </v>

279
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>going to be judging me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all I can say is that yes,</v>

280
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>they are going to be judging you at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

281
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

282
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:35.970
<v Speaker 1>very tippy top.</v>

283
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Am I number two or number three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

284
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

285
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 1>it's very sad and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everyone's like that,</v>

286
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:46.851
<v Speaker 1>but a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people in the field get to be like </v>

287
00:11:46.851 --> 00:11:50.250
<v Speaker 1>that and probably it helps forward the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance of science.</v>

288
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The competitive nature of it.</v>

289
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:56.721
<v Speaker 1>It's competitive and egotistical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to do better than everybody </v>

290
00:11:56.721 --> 00:11:59.101
<v Speaker 1>else and prove that they're better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure Einstein and Newton where </v>

291
00:11:59.101 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 1>justice driven by that is that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

292
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like human beings need that </v>

293
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.850
<v Speaker 1>comparative sort of competition thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in order to afford whatever </v>

294
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need peers.</v>

295
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>They need some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps it's there.</v>

296
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:19.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we live in a world with scarce </v>

297
00:12:19.381 --> 00:12:19.381
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:12:19.381 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are going to live longer than</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

299
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are going to get tenure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of us are not.</v>

300
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are gonna be Nobel Prize </v>
<v Speaker 1>winners and some are not.</v>

301
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>So no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be competition.</v>

302
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

303
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your field is there is a big issue,</v>

304
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:36.631
<v Speaker 1>I guess with people disregarding other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's discoveries or wanting to </v>

305
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:41.701
<v Speaker 1>rather like saying like wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>poopoo things and I think this a very </v>

306
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:47.161
<v Speaker 1>complicated issue that I don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have clear because certainly scientists </v>

307
00:12:47.161 --> 00:12:51.001
<v Speaker 1>can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very supportive of each other under the </v>

308
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:51.001
<v Speaker 1>right circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

309
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there human beings,</v>

310
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of cognitive biases </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have prejudices,</v>

311
00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 1>basie and priors for what's likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

312
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 1>what's not likely to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just perfect reasoning,</v>

313
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:05.140
<v Speaker 1>perfect rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

314
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:10.141
<v Speaker 1>People come in with their prejudices and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go and tickle their a </v>

315
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 1>preconceived notions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll think you're great.</v>

316
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you say something that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite fit into what they're thinking </v>

317
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.310
<v Speaker 1>about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll sort of look somewhere else.</v>

318
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Your ministry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

319
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:19.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you teach this?</v>

320
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:24.330
<v Speaker 1>When you're teaching classes and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're addressing potential future </v>

321
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.180
<v Speaker 1>cosmologists and quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics now committed.</v>

322
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no person who does quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist as good.</v>

323
00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

324
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.880
<v Speaker 1>do you tell them about the potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitfalls?</v>

325
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe plant a seed in their head like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

326
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 1>you can avoid this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can still be competitive,</v>

327
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.640
<v Speaker 1>but avoid all these traps that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially like these intellectual </v>

328
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 1>rabbit hole you can go down that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really not beneficial to anybody.</v>

329
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I'm formally teaching class </v>

330
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.050
<v Speaker 1>and I'm standing up there in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture hall,</v>

331
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.360
<v Speaker 1>a 98 percent is teaching the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty straightforwardly.</v>

332
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I try to dribble in little words of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom here and there and especially if </v>

333
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.551
<v Speaker 1>I think that there is a way that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>always teach the subject that is wrong </v>

334
00:14:05.551 --> 00:14:06.820
<v Speaker 1>and wrongheaded and we should be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it right.</v>

335
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I tried to highlight the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm advising students like my </v>

336
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 1>graduate students or my undergraduates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>

337
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay on very hard the,</v>

338
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own perspective on how it is to be a </v>

339
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 1>scientist and what is the good way to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the bad way to do it.</v>

340
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:23.050
<v Speaker 1>What are the pitfalls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also just,</v>

341
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:28.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to not make mistakes and trip up </v>

342
00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:28.051
<v Speaker 1>your own career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 1>That's critically important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

344
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 1>what is it about quantum mechanics that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think people don't understand?</v>

345
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

346
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Everyone agrees on what we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand this the thing that makes </v>

347
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.351
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is our single best theory of the </v>

348
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:46.501
<v Speaker 1>universe in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that makes it difficult to </v>

349
00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>understand is that as the only theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever invented,</v>

350
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>where there is a difference between what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is</v>

351
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 2>and what we see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we look at the world,</v>

352
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In every other theory,</v>

353
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 2>if we look closely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would see the world as it is,</v>

354
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:04.781
<v Speaker 2>and quantum mechanics has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental rule that says you can't see</v>

355
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>the world as it is you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have an electron,</v>

356
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:12.941
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particle that can be spinning </v>

357
00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 2>clockwise or counterclockwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that's what can happen,</v>

358
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 2>because every time you look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

359
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 2>is it spinning clockwise or spinning </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterclockwise?</v>

360
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:20.370
<v Speaker 2>You get one answer or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rules of quantum mechanics,</v>

361
00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're not looking at it,</v>

362
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.940
<v Speaker 2>it's in a super position of both and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can calculate the probability that </v>

363
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.811
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get one answer or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and this drives people crazy </v>

364
00:15:31.811 --> 00:15:36.431
<v Speaker 2>because they think that what they see is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is real and therefore they have </v>

365
00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:37.730
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult times figuring out how to</v>

366
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:42.731
<v Speaker 2>make a sensible theory of quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics that explains what you </v>

367
00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:42.731
<v Speaker 2>actually see.</v>

368
00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even you just explaining that.</v>

369
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm circling around and signed my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for like a Cabi to put place</v>

370
00:15:48.811 --> 00:15:50.400
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does this go?</v>

371
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Superposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was he saying?</v>

372
00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:57.861
<v Speaker 3>He's saying that it's in two different </v>
<v Speaker 3>places at the same time or that it's </v>

373
00:15:57.861 --> 00:15:59.100
<v Speaker 3>still an emotion at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

374
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's right.</v>

375
00:16:00.181 --> 00:16:03.580
<v Speaker 3>So exactly what you're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that you know,</v>

376
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 3>there are things that it can be still in</v>
<v Speaker 3>motion,</v>

377
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.890
<v Speaker 2>this place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place and somehow it's in both at </v>

378
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.430
<v Speaker 2>once or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with quantum mechanics says it's not</v>

379
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:18.431
<v Speaker 2>an either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you ask where's the position of </v>

380
00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:19.130
<v Speaker 2>the electron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as the position of</v>

381
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 2>the electron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the electron,</v>

382
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:26.801
<v Speaker 2>you will see it in a position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is not the fundamental essence </v>

383
00:16:26.801 --> 00:16:30.791
<v Speaker 2>of the electron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something called the quantum </v>

384
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:32.771
<v Speaker 2>state where the wave function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a mathematical way that we have </v>

385
00:16:32.771 --> 00:16:36.190
<v Speaker 2>representing the reality of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the answers that gives us two </v>

386
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 2>questions are just not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

387
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 2>There has how fast it's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

388
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we calculate using the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

389
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Does this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this sort of.</v>

390
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

391
00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:52.941
<v Speaker 3>And it's very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is this sort of lend itself to get </v>

392
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:54.510
<v Speaker 3>hijacked by Woo folks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh totally.</v>

393
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Which is why like what the bleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the what the bleep do we know?</v>

394
00:16:57.661 --> 00:17:02.661
<v Speaker 3>That was when I first started really </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to this stuff and then </v>

395
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I was reading criticisms of what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bleep and that's when I got an </v>

396
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 3>understanding like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

397
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.881
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is kind of horseshit and this </v>

398
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:10.881
<v Speaker 3>lady is kind of a channeler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

399
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:11.820
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a kind of a cult,</v>

400
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.280
<v Speaker 3>sort of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

401
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when she was saying her name was </v>

402
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 3>ramp though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like that's her real name.</v>

403
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Ten thousand year old warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that.</v>

404
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.600
<v Speaker 3>How come they didn't put that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie?</v>

405
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lady in the movie,</v>

406
00:17:23.731 --> 00:17:28.731
<v Speaker 3>if you've seen what and so many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in my God that changed my life and </v>

407
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 3>we were training because all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought that like magic was real </v>

408
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.060
<v Speaker 3>and it is kind of right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's something magic,</v>

409
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.560
<v Speaker 3>but magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world is not magic,</v>

410
00:17:37.561 --> 00:17:40.860
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at an atom and realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>that most of it is space,</v>

411
00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:45.861
<v Speaker 3>like most of the things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at are mostly space and that </v>

412
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:48.990
<v Speaker 3>subatomic particles really do kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>blink in and out of existence.</v>

413
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.590
<v Speaker 3>You look at all the various quantum </v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdness that is real and observable by</v>

414
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:58.320
<v Speaker 3>people like you that actually studied </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

415
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 3>It looks crazy.</v>

416
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

417
00:18:01.221 --> 00:18:05.000
<v Speaker 2>so I hate to be that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but both the claim that atoms are mostly</v>

418
00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:10.001
<v Speaker 2>space and the claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the particles pumping out of existence </v>

419
00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:10.001
<v Speaker 2>are both entirely bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

420
00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:14.081
<v Speaker 2>please educate me more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people say that all the time </v>

421
00:18:14.081 --> 00:18:17.441
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they are privileging what you </v>

422
00:18:17.441 --> 00:18:20.441
<v Speaker 2>see when you look right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Privileging like white privilege or </v>

423
00:18:20.441 --> 00:18:20.441
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like that.</v>

424
00:18:20.441 --> 00:18:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Know they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a view of what should be.</v>

425
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you have an electron in an </v>

426
00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.770
<v Speaker 2>atom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a mathematical way of describing</v>

427
00:18:30.771 --> 00:18:33.500
<v Speaker 2>it and it's a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not located anywhere.</v>

428
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:38.501
<v Speaker 2>It's not empty space and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electron and most of the rest of it's </v>

429
00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:39.050
<v Speaker 2>empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a little miniature version</v>

430
00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.630
<v Speaker 2>of the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The solar system is mostly empty.</v>

431
00:18:41.631 --> 00:18:45.260
<v Speaker 2>There's empty space in between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planets and if you draw a picture of the</v>

432
00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:50.261
<v Speaker 2>atom or look at one from your high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school science book and Adam looks just </v>

433
00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:50.261
<v Speaker 2>like the solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

434
00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is at the center and these things moving</v>

435
00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:53.120
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it is.</v>

436
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.180
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a smooth cloud that is everywhere </v>

437
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.930
<v Speaker 2>inside the atom and that cloud is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to the question where I do look </v>

438
00:19:02.691 --> 00:19:04.910
<v Speaker 2>for the electron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where would I most likely see it?</v>

439
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the leap that is very,</v>

440
00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:12.500
<v Speaker 2>very hard to make is what the electron </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly is,</v>

441
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.230
<v Speaker 2>is that cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what you see.</v>

442
00:19:15.231 --> 00:19:16.880
<v Speaker 2>You never see the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at it,</v>

443
00:19:16.881 --> 00:19:21.881
<v Speaker 2>you see the electron position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what it is is that cloud and people </v>

444
00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:22.670
<v Speaker 2>just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what they talk about.</v>

445
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Particles popping in and out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

446
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:29.771
<v Speaker 2>What there is is this wave function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this probability cloud that tells you </v>

447
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.360
<v Speaker 2>how likely is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a particle,</v>

448
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.100
<v Speaker 2>and if the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

449
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.320
<v Speaker 2>it's very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's point zero,</v>

450
00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:37.490
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one percent chance.</v>

451
00:19:37.491 --> 00:19:39.650
<v Speaker 2>If I look here and look here again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look here again.</v>

452
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Then when you do see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tempted to say,</v>

453
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Aha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particle has popped into existence.</v>

454
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.720
<v Speaker 2>The reality is there was the cloud that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there all along.</v>

455
00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:49.520
<v Speaker 2>It was sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not fluctuating,</v>

456
00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:52.400
<v Speaker 2>he was not changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not what you see.</v>

457
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.940
<v Speaker 2>And everyone from Einstein on down has </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a real tough time wrapping their </v>

458
00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:57.940
<v Speaker 2>heads around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

459
00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I still don't get it.</v>

460
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

461
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:07.090
<v Speaker 3>so when people say that an atom is </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly empty space,</v>

462
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly this wave function for the </v>

463
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.120
<v Speaker 3>electron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

464
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 3>So there's this sort of very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>to describe property to it yet.</v>

465
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 3>And they were trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are we looking at things sort of </v>

466
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.150
<v Speaker 3>in a very material sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

467
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.960
<v Speaker 3>this mug is ceramic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this table is wood,</v>

468
00:20:25.961 --> 00:20:27.640
<v Speaker 3>and we think about the composition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

469
00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:29.560
<v Speaker 3>If we cut into the ceramic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know what it looks like.</v>

470
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.470
<v Speaker 3>So we're trying to apply those </v>
<v Speaker 3>principles to like maybe an Adam.</v>

471
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

472
00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 2>They just don't apply because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other way around.</v>

473
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:41.301
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think that our world that we see </v>

474
00:20:41.301 --> 00:20:43.851
<v Speaker 2>every day is sort of basically how </v>
<v Speaker 2>things work and we're going to sort of </v>

475
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:46.260
<v Speaker 2>translate other extremes of existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that language,</v>

476
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 2>whether it's far or way back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're very,</v>

477
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:54.301
<v Speaker 2>very small or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no reason to think that our </v>

478
00:20:54.301 --> 00:20:57.961
<v Speaker 2>everyday life experience has equipped us</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the vocabulary to talk about these </v>

479
00:20:57.961 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 2>things in any sensible way and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't,</v>

480
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 2>so we have a very completely viable way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of talking about the atom.</v>

481
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:10.110
<v Speaker 2>We have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rigorous mathematical ways of </v>

482
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.351
<v Speaker 2>describing what happens and then quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics says what you see when you </v>

483
00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:17.341
<v Speaker 2>look at the Adam is different and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sit there and insist that what we </v>

484
00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:21.181
<v Speaker 2>see is the real way to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter how anti quantum mechanical </v>

485
00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 2>that viewpoint really is.</v>

486
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.660
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be incredibly frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you because I've heard like </v>

487
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.821
<v Speaker 2>legitimate mainstream scientists on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television talking about the Adam and </v>

488
00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:29.821
<v Speaker 2>describing it in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

489
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

490
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is to be,</v>

491
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.060
<v Speaker 2>to be super fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People disagree.</v>

492
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that people disagree about </v>

493
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.511
<v Speaker 2>what the fundamental nature of quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics is and I have no problem with </v>

494
00:21:45.511 --> 00:21:45.760
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

495
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:50.761
<v Speaker 2>I have a point of view and I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the many worlds </v>

496
00:21:50.761 --> 00:21:53.551
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of quantum mechanics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can explain that and I think it was </v>

497
00:21:53.551 --> 00:21:54.280
<v Speaker 2>perfectly sensible and coherent and fits</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

498
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you have another point of view on</v>

499
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics that is also perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensible and coherent fits together,</v>

500
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:05.581
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can disagree and we can ask about </v>

501
00:22:05.581 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 2>what experiments to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sad thing is that most physicists,</v>

502
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 2>especially ones that go on tv and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this stuff,</v>

503
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.730
<v Speaker 2>just don't think about it that hard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore they're sloppy when they talk </v>

504
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 2>about it and therefore people come away </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

505
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really get it.</v>

506
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 2>It's very gettable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally understandable.</v>

507
00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:24.601
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can disagree about what the </v>

508
00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 2>understanding will ultimately be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but physicists contribute just as much,</v>

509
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on purpose,</v>

510
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they allow,</v>

511
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:32.791
<v Speaker 2>they opened up the space for what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bleep do we know people to insert their </v>

512
00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:37.261
<v Speaker 2>woo in there because they're not doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good job of measuring up to the </v>

513
00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:37.960
<v Speaker 2>reality themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

514
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:43.020
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensely complex that almost needs to </v>

515
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.891
<v Speaker 2>be described with mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would require you to have a deep </v>

516
00:22:46.891 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 2>understanding of mathematics to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely grasp.</v>

517
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Is that a fair assessment until my book </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out?</v>

518
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

519
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 2>What is the book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

520
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the title of the book is something </v>

521
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.531
<v Speaker 2>deeply hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a phrase from Einstein and the </v>

522
00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:04.351
<v Speaker 2>idea is that there is something real </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can get a handle on is just </v>

523
00:23:04.351 --> 00:23:08.071
<v Speaker 2>different than what we see and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that we need the </v>

524
00:23:08.071 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 2>mathematical details to get it right.</v>

525
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.670
<v Speaker 2>What we need is to have the willingness </v>
<v Speaker 2>to let go of our intuition a little bit </v>

526
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:14.910
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

527
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:20.100
<v Speaker 2>to accept the idea that the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world works at a fundamental level is </v>

528
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.991
<v Speaker 2>very different than the typical ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>about space and time and stuff that we </v>

529
00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:27.010
<v Speaker 2>are born with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were you when that,</v>

530
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:29.560
<v Speaker 2>what the bleep moving was out where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a professor yet?</v>

531
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

532
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:36.631
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost a perspective girlfriend over </v>

533
00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:38.341
<v Speaker 2>that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we met and we went on a date and </v>

534
00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:42.451
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the best movie for you to say I </v>

535
00:23:42.451 --> 00:23:42.451
<v Speaker 2>don't think I'm gonna like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

536
00:23:42.451 --> 00:23:43.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be open minded gotta.</v>

537
00:23:43.481 --> 00:23:44.880
<v Speaker 2>At least watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it.</v>

538
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness.</v>

539
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Did you try to explain to her that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not true?</v>

540
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 2>But there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not a close call.</v>

541
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 2>It was not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

542
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:53.580
<v Speaker 2>if I explained this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll get it.</v>

543
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Is Love this movie</v>

544
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

545
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 3>And I have a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a really sad story.</v>

546
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who was really into the </v>

547
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.081
<v Speaker 3>secret and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was actually a friend of a friend </v>

548
00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:12.370
<v Speaker 3>more than a friend and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran into her at the comedy store and </v>

549
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.541
<v Speaker 3>we were talking and she was explaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me how she has sort of use the power </v>

550
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.470
<v Speaker 3>of the secret to map out her life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was all gonna take place.</v>

551
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't see her again for like,</v>

552
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 3>like a year or so later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe more.</v>

553
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.720
<v Speaker 3>And then the next time I saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

554
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

555
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:36.521
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really thought this was going to work </v>

556
00:24:36.521 --> 00:24:38.680
<v Speaker 3>and my life is still a mess and my dad </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a loser and every guy date is a piece</v>

557
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:39.670
<v Speaker 3>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was just like,</v>

558
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she just couldn't,</v>

559
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 3>she couldn't get it right.</v>

560
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 3>And she was convinced that this law of </v>
<v Speaker 3>attraction,</v>

561
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.280
<v Speaker 3>which in my eyes is very similar and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways,</v>

562
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:51.260
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea behind it is,</v>

563
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking a bunch of people that are</v>

564
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 3>extremely successful and you're asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>them how'd you do it?</v>

565
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

566
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 3>I visualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit has got to be the answer.</v>

567
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

568
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.720
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one part of a giant thing that </v>

569
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:03.720
<v Speaker 3>makes someone successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

570
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.151
<v Speaker 3>And luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it even bigger for a lot going on </v>

571
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:08.151
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

572
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:10.811
<v Speaker 3>Like did you imagine that you were born </v>
<v Speaker 3>with two legs because some people </v>

573
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:10.811
<v Speaker 3>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

574
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you deal with something like the</v>

575
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 3>secret or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

576
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

577
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 3>the rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

578
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:24.221
<v Speaker 3>you know what the bleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this desire that people have to </v>

579
00:25:24.221 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 3>find like some secret message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>

580
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:33.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a magical quality to the world and all </v>

581
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.391
<v Speaker 3>you have to do is think about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look about it in a certain way and your </v>

582
00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:36.391
<v Speaker 3>life will take on this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>

583
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

584
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

585
00:25:38.141 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

586
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 2>So my last book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big picture I actually devoted,</v>

587
00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:47.341
<v Speaker 2>even though it was mostly about physics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and philosophy and cosmology and </v>

588
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:50.551
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I devoted a little bit to the </v>

589
00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:51.730
<v Speaker 2>fundamental principles of reasoning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially basie and reasoning.</v>

590
00:25:51.731 --> 00:25:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever heard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>basie and reasoning.</v>

591
00:25:53.441 --> 00:25:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you describe it?</v>

592
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

593
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.400
<v Speaker 2>it's basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essence of it is the following idea.</v>

594
00:25:59.401 --> 00:26:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Someone tells you a good idea or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a good idea yourself?</v>

595
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.560
<v Speaker 2>The usual thing that people will do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>either say,</v>

596
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.360
<v Speaker 2>that sounds right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true,</v>

597
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.430
<v Speaker 2>or that sounds wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's false.</v>

598
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:14.020
<v Speaker 2>And what Phase II and reasoning says no </v>
<v Speaker 2>to every possibility you say,</v>

599
00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:15.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's true.</v>

600
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will assign a probability to it being </v>

601
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:21.430
<v Speaker 2>true or false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called that the prior probability.</v>

602
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And then I will go collect data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say,</v>

603
00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:25.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will the world be like if this were</v>

604
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:27.250
<v Speaker 2>true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll go look right?</v>

605
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Does this a woman over here like me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she romantically attracted to me?</v>

606
00:26:31.661 --> 00:26:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe that would affect what she </v>
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>

607
00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:37.390
<v Speaker 2>If I say hi to her and therefore I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do the experiment.</v>

608
00:26:37.391 --> 00:26:42.391
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is everything from going </v>

609
00:26:42.391 --> 00:26:42.391
<v Speaker 2>through your everyday life to being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional scientist.</v>

610
00:26:42.391 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>So look fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read the secret.</v>

611
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Be told that there's this law of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attraction.</v>

612
00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>If you understand how physics works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that it's completely nonsense.</v>

613
00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 2>But if you were tempted to believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say to yourself,</v>

614
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:54.590
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me test it.</v>

615
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Let me figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's true or false by saying if </v>

616
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.850
<v Speaker 2>it were true with the following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things would happen.</v>

617
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:01.530
<v Speaker 2>If it were false,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the following things would happen.</v>

618
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And that I think that everyone thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>they work that way,</v>

619
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:07.880
<v Speaker 2>but almost no one really does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

620
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have these preconceived notions that </v>

621
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 2>we really like to clean code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 2>We really like to imagine that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>right about things we hate to be wrong.</v>

623
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.840
<v Speaker 2>And if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you were on a path like I believe </v>

624
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super hard for people to shake that</v>

625
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:26.301
<v Speaker 2>loose and people generally think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that something is true </v>

626
00:27:26.301 --> 00:27:29.001
<v Speaker 2>is either zero or 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like the idea that there's </v>

627
00:27:29.001 --> 00:27:32.721
<v Speaker 2>something as 70 percent true and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore they can sort of improve that </v>

628
00:27:32.721 --> 00:27:34.200
<v Speaker 2>or deep or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or disprove that or whatever.</v>

629
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:39.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just hard going through life </v>

630
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 2>thinking about probability distributions</v>
<v Speaker 2>for every possible version of reality.</v>

631
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:44.940
<v Speaker 2>But that is the best way to do it if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can probability distributions.</v>

632
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you do when you walked on </v>

633
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:49.940
<v Speaker 2>the street?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

634
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.120
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I long list of numbers in my head.</v>

635
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean the good news is you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a certain threshold,</v>

636
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:59.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something is 99 percent true or 99 </v>

637
00:27:59.811 --> 00:27:59.811
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 point nine,</v>

638
00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 2>nine percent likely to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on with your life.</v>

639
00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.950
<v Speaker 2>You just accept that as true and don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep trying to come up.</v>

640
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Come up with evidence for it against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless it's forced itself on you.</v>

641
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people say that the universe is not</v>

642
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:14.640
<v Speaker 2>really expanding my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my field,</v>

643
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:19.641
<v Speaker 2>I get this right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we've had evidence since the 19 </v>

644
00:28:19.641 --> 00:28:19.641
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe is expanding well,</v>

645
00:28:19.641 --> 00:28:23.090
<v Speaker 2>who says it's not everyone who emails me</v>
<v Speaker 2>every like I get emails and letters and </v>

646
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:28.911
<v Speaker 2>they have their own theories and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light just got tired coming from these </v>

647
00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 2>other galaxies that gets tired.</v>

648
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:33.210
<v Speaker 2>There's literally something called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired light theory like fatigue.</v>

649
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

650
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.820
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

651
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:42.410
<v Speaker 2>so there's some version of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific method that says every idea </v>

652
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.401
<v Speaker 2>should be treated seriously and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should sort of write down what the </v>

653
00:28:46.401 --> 00:28:47.070
<v Speaker 2>evidence for and against this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But come on,</v>

654
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the universe is expanding.</v>

655
00:28:49.111 --> 00:28:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to waste my time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

656
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 2>That's why we can get through our </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday lives perfectly well without </v>

657
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:59.001
<v Speaker 2>being very good Bayesians at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had many flat earthers email </v>

658
00:28:59.001 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had flat earthers email me.</v>

659
00:29:01.501 --> 00:29:06.501
<v Speaker 2>I did once tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one tweet mentioning the phrase </v>

660
00:29:06.501 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 2>flat earth and I did get an invitation </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come on a podcast,</v>

661
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>a flat earth podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a flatter with podcast.</v>

662
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

663
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

664
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 2>They're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are they going to try to school?</v>

665
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:16.370
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

666
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was to their credit,</v>

667
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.310
<v Speaker 2>it was quite polite and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know you don't believe this,</v>

668
00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:28.311
<v Speaker 2>but let's come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on and have a conversation and </v>

669
00:29:28.311 --> 00:29:31.071
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're just about questioning things </v>

670
00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:34.311
<v Speaker 2>and getting at the truth and getting an </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and actual astronomy or </v>

671
00:29:34.401 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>astrophysicist that the crucial thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you notice whenever you talk to the</v>

672
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many physics and astronomy crackpots out</v>

673
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

674
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 1>they're never asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always here.</v>

675
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you the truth if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

676
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:48.820
<v Speaker 1>They're never like helped me learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

677
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 1>If people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people email me and say,</v>

678
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:55.591
<v Speaker 1>help me learn that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually very happy to converse with </v>

679
00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:55.591
<v Speaker 1>them one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

680
00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:56.080
<v Speaker 1>it's super easy to start questioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

681
00:29:56.081 --> 00:30:01.081
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult to get a degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>in astrophysics or to get a degree in </v>

682
00:30:01.081 --> 00:30:01.750
<v Speaker 1>astronomy or to really read books about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

683
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I getting through Lawrence Krause's</v>
<v Speaker 1>last book,</v>

684
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's chapters that I had to like go.</v>

685
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go through this one more time.</v>

686
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Like when he came here I had to ask him </v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the first things we did,</v>

687
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a mistake because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so complex.</v>

688
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get him to explain gauge </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetry to me.</v>

689
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

690
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And it was just like he did it like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>or three times.</v>

691
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

692
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 1>there's certain parts about it that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

693
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we can try that again if you </v>

694
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:32.990
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

695
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:32.990
<v Speaker 1>There are hard things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

696
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 1>You would be surprised if there weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

697
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:39.091
<v Speaker 1>Like if you spend 500 years learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the universe and everything made </v>

698
00:30:39.091 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 1>perfect sense the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be kind of remarkable.</v>

699
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

700
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:44.530
<v Speaker 1>it's super complex and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that makes sense.</v>

701
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when someone boils it down to </v>

702
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:49.560
<v Speaker 1>something that's really woo woo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

703
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the bleep do we know,</v>

704
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.620
<v Speaker 1>how is that frustrating to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

705
00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.630
<v Speaker 1>That must make you communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have seen that and have </v>

706
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.530
<v Speaker 1>these ideas that are false assumptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on it.</v>

707
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like I said to you that atoms </v>
<v Speaker 1>are mostly hollow.</v>

708
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 1>What does that frustrating?</v>

709
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that line gets frustrating at </v>

710
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:12.270
<v Speaker 1>different levels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

711
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

712
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first impulse is to be charmed and </v>

713
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.420
<v Speaker 1>happy when people care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are even interested on a very </v>

714
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:21.420
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you?</v>

715
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

716
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:26.380
<v Speaker 1>like I first want to give people credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see if there's something inside them</v>

717
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:29.080
<v Speaker 1>with that we can work with and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work toward the truth.</v>

718
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

719
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

720
00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think most people maybe are like </v>

721
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.401
<v Speaker 1>that and there's some hardcore people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have made up their minds about the </v>

722
00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:38.401
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

723
00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you see where it would come from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

724
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:43.981
<v Speaker 1>Because quantum mechanics says what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is is different than what we see </v>

725
00:31:43.981 --> 00:31:48.391
<v Speaker 1>when we look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a small leap from that correct </v>

726
00:31:48.391 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 1>statement to we bring the world into </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence by looking at it.</v>

727
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're deepak chopra and DM me on </v>

728
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

729
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 1>So whenever I tweet something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics,</v>

730
00:31:56.981 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 1>he retweets it with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's all in your mind.</v>

731
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>It's all consciousness bringing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world into existence.</v>

732
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.100
<v Speaker 1>He loves word Salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

733
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:09.180
<v Speaker 1>That guy is the biggest like dealer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds word salad.</v>

734
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is ever changing.</v>

735
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 1>This is putting them the word salad into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recipe that people think is nutritious</v>

736
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:16.300
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

737
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.930
<v Speaker 1>They really liked to eat even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no actual nutritional value.</v>

738
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a lot of that from like certain </v>

739
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:24.960
<v Speaker 1>yoga classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain yoga classes that I</v>

740
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.090
<v Speaker 1>go to where like the yoga teacher will </v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking some woo woo shit and like</v>

741
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you're being in the middle of the pose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

742
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this guy going on about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

743
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as the pose is helping me,</v>

744
00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put up with that smile my </v>
<v Speaker 1>way through it,</v>

745
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>debate them</v>

746
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
<v Speaker 3>right in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's weird that that stuff is all </v>

747
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.531
<v Speaker 3>can sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all sort of kind of in that sort </v>

748
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:51.791
<v Speaker 3>of genre of people that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve their life or be spiritual or </v>

749
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 3>they love that deep rock show up or </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

750
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this conversation with a friend of</v>

751
00:32:56.151 --> 00:33:01.151
<v Speaker 3>mine who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gave me a Deepak Chopra book and I </v>

752
00:33:01.151 --> 00:33:02.730
<v Speaker 3>started going through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now was like,</v>

753
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

754
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 3>this guy's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

755
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Probably wants to do well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not a terrible person </v>

756
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:13.900
<v Speaker 3>probably wants to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's also ignoring the actual </v>

757
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.190
<v Speaker 3>scientists that study all this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

758
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:20.220
<v Speaker 3>he's sort of pitching this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is like this Deepak Chopra ism </v>

759
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:25.990
<v Speaker 3>this sort of like spiritual pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual view of the world that he's </v>

760
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 3>pitching to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

761
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.620
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these middle aged housewives.</v>

762
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 3>They're like looking for some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning to life,</v>

763
00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 3>but they don't like going to church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

764
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:36.350
<v Speaker 3>And Daniel Dennett,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the philosopher,</v>

765
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 3>came up with a great word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He calls them deep at ease.</v>

766
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 3>When you string some words together in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that sounds extremely profound,</v>

767
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:48.191
<v Speaker 3>but you look closely at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't actually mean anything at </v>

768
00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:50.531
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a website that will do </v>

769
00:33:50.531 --> 00:33:50.531
<v Speaker 3>that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the Deepak Chopra quote general.</v>

770
00:33:50.531 --> 00:33:51.330
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that hard.</v>

771
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.800
<v Speaker 3>I would like to laugh at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another website that comes up </v>

772
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:56.800
<v Speaker 3>with brandon physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paper titles.</v>

773
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that different.</v>

774
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Usually tell when it's a random visitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the physics stuff is.</v>

775
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.730
<v Speaker 3>It's almost be I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar issues with the reason why deep </v>

776
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:11.580
<v Speaker 3>bra can do that is because most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand what he's talking </v>

777
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.831
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you say a lot of stuff about </v>

778
00:34:14.831 --> 00:34:14.831
<v Speaker 3>things that people don't understand like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>

779
00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:15.090
<v Speaker 3>we've.</v>

780
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:20.140
<v Speaker 3>There's been a bunch of videos that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>played on this podcast about a fake </v>

781
00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.430
<v Speaker 3>martial arts practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole business and these </v>

782
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:30.281
<v Speaker 3>people that have these fake martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques and they use all these huge </v>

783
00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:34.961
<v Speaker 3>words that are rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rare about the central nervous </v>

784
00:34:34.961 --> 00:34:35.210
<v Speaker 3>system and about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

785
00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:40.010
<v Speaker 3>the structure of the body and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll use all this stuff to try to get</v>

786
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:40.730
<v Speaker 3>you to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

787
00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:45.731
<v Speaker 3>well this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's an enormous vocabulary </v>

788
00:34:45.731 --> 00:34:48.670
<v Speaker 3>and a deep understanding of anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must therefore be this she master </v>

789
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.630
<v Speaker 3>that he's pretending to be and it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of very similar.</v>

790
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:53.530
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of recognize that pattern in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the EU.</v>

791
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 3>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

792
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:59.501
<v Speaker 3>I kind of see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're throwing a bunch of very </v>

793
00:34:59.501 --> 00:35:02.021
<v Speaker 3>complicated word that aren't in most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's vernacular and you're saying </v>

794
00:35:02.021 --> 00:35:05.381
<v Speaker 3>them in a way that makes me feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some sort of a connection to </v>

795
00:35:05.381 --> 00:35:09.590
<v Speaker 3>the CI and to the shock rose into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inner whatever that everybody's trying </v>

796
00:35:09.591 --> 00:35:11.140
<v Speaker 3>to reach to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

797
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 3>and another problem is just that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever there is a field,</v>

798
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 3>whether it's physics or medicine or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

799
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 3>where we know something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard,</v>

800
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:20.300
<v Speaker 3>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>counter intuitive.</v>

801
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.940
<v Speaker 3>When we explained that we translate it </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

802
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:27.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in physics we have mathematical </v>

803
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:27.970
<v Speaker 3>equations that are quite an ambiguous as</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what they say,</v>

804
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 3>but then we use words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we say,</v>

805
00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:31.040
<v Speaker 3>well there's a cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a probability,</v>

806
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:36.070
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every translation is inaccurate in </v>

807
00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:39.581
<v Speaker 3>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're bAsing beliefs off the </v>

808
00:35:39.581 --> 00:35:39.581
<v Speaker 3>translations,</v>

809
00:35:39.581 --> 00:35:44.300
<v Speaker 1>then you can fudge them a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more to get almost wherever you want to </v>

810
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.300
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

811
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you're confused me more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was good with the cloud up until now.</v>

812
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

813
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Why is it a cloud like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you describing where the electron </v>

814
00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>in habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it a cloud?</v>

815
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's if you're thinking about the </v>

816
00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.020
<v Speaker 1>electron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

817
00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the wave function is sort of how we</v>

818
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:04.971
<v Speaker 1>use it is you asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to look for the location of </v>

819
00:36:04.971 --> 00:36:09.741
<v Speaker 1>the electron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a machine that tells me the </v>

820
00:36:09.741 --> 00:36:10.290
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability of seeing it here with a</v>

821
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 1>certain number of probability of seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

822
00:36:12.391 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 1>their probability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing it somewhere else.</v>

823
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And so at every point in space there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>

824
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.250
<v Speaker 1>the probability you will see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electron there,</v>

825
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:25.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you visualize all those </v>

826
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:25.340
<v Speaker 1>probabilities all at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a cloud that is filling up</v>

827
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:30.291
<v Speaker 1>all of space and then the leap is to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as where the </v>

828
00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:32.190
<v Speaker 1>electron is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'S only the cloud.</v>

829
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:37.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the cloud is expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ignorance of where the electron </v>

830
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cloud is what there really is.</v>

831
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And I sound exactly like deepak chopra </v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's no way.</v>

832
00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

833
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't bore versus electron cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

834
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visualization of it.</v>

835
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

836
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the left,</v>

837
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.640
<v Speaker 1>these are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the picture we like to draw </v>

838
00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.980
<v Speaker 1>electrons orbiting around as if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were little planets in the solar system </v>

839
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.480
<v Speaker 1>on the right is closer to reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see even there they couldn't </v>

840
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:10.761
<v Speaker 1>quite resist the temptation to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>point to list and little dots and it's </v>

841
00:37:10.921 --> 00:37:13.560
<v Speaker 1>really should be some smooth </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

842
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:18.561
<v Speaker 1>This is what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physicist would call the thing on </v>

843
00:37:18.561 --> 00:37:21.441
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wave function or the quantum state </v>

844
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 1>of the electron and it is that cloud and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it answers the question.</v>

845
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:26.370
<v Speaker 1>What's the likelihood that we see it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different places?</v>

846
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.450
<v Speaker 1>The hard part to mentally get to is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud is what is real,</v>

847
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.350
<v Speaker 1>is it almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

848
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:38.390
<v Speaker 1>what we're looking at here with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these dots here and it says jamie would </v>

849
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.750
<v Speaker 1>go back to where it wasn't pleased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

850
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 1>where it says the probability of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>density of electron and then you see all</v>

851
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:47.661
<v Speaker 1>those dots is the issue like making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual representation of it.</v>

852
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I asked someone to draw a visual</v>

853
00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:52.540
<v Speaker 1>representation of a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

854
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

855
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Because we're used to stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee cups,</v>

856
00:37:57.111 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 1>bottles of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like they have locations in space.</v>

857
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:02.490
<v Speaker 1>They have a shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a size thoughts.</v>

858
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

859
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:04.720
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to draw them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

860
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Where's that going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the hell is that?</v>

861
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:11.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important thing that </v>

862
00:38:11.691 --> 00:38:11.691
<v Speaker 1>we've ever had when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of civilization,</v>

863
00:38:11.691 --> 00:38:12.840
<v Speaker 1>inventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>

864
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:17.990
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things are just thoughts and </v>

865
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:17.990
<v Speaker 1>try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw thought.</v>

866
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you were intuitive,</v>

867
00:38:20.151 --> 00:38:20.530
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

868
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.590
<v Speaker 1>we get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean when you say he's hard to draw </v>

869
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:25.590
<v Speaker 1>a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

870
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:25.590
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

871
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 1>what it is you can draw the musical </v>
<v Speaker 1>notes and then.</v>

872
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.100
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

873
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>and so if you talk about an electron </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to be a thing I was </v>

874
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.830
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be somewhere that I can like</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it and someone comes along and </v>

875
00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nature is totally different than that</v>

876
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.540
<v Speaker 1>and you will never in your life be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see with perfectly clear eyeglasses </v>

877
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 1>what nature is really like.</v>

878
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>They get a little annoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the truth.</v>

879
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:57.990
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the very uber </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre theory that the universe is </v>

880
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 1>incredibly fractal in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're looking at when we're looking</v>

881
00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:06.880
<v Speaker 1>at the universe is essentially some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of subatomic particles for a much larger</v>

882
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:10.960
<v Speaker 1>adam and then it goes bigger and bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a human out there.</v>

883
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I think also a part of another galaxy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also part of another universe.</v>

884
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:18.410
<v Speaker 1>It's also part of another atom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also right.</v>

885
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

886
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:20.490
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think no,</v>

887
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 1>the closest thing that is a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more reasonable to that.</v>

888
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's go the other way around.</v>

889
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

890
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 1>well let me ask me or let me ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it no.</v>

891
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's go the other way around.</v>

892
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

893
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:37.290
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's ask if maybe what we think of as </v>

894
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:40.051
<v Speaker 1>adams could be alive with like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and substructure that we just </v>

895
00:39:40.051 --> 00:39:40.051
<v Speaker 1>don't know about.</v>

896
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So if you're an honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious scientists,</v>

897
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:45.660
<v Speaker 1>you always say we don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

898
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:51.090
<v Speaker 1>But what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that we think we know about </v>

899
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.461
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics says that things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrons and quarks are completely </v>

900
00:39:53.461 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 1>featureless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if yOu tried to put little wrinkles</v>

901
00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:01.190
<v Speaker 1>and make them different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the earth and venus and mars are </v>

902
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.261
<v Speaker 1>very different from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every electron is exactly the same as </v>

903
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:07.441
<v Speaker 1>every other electronic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you tried to give it any </v>

904
00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:09.961
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would cost an enormous amount of </v>

905
00:40:09.961 --> 00:40:09.961
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Energy that's just not there,</v>

906
00:40:09.961 --> 00:40:14.850
<v Speaker 1>so there's fundamental principles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics that says that there are no </v>

907
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.851
<v Speaker 1>people living on adam's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what we're like with our solar </v>

908
00:40:17.851 --> 00:40:19.300
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it kind of vaguely resembles</v>

909
00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and adam in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are nothing like real adams.</v>

910
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.540
<v Speaker 1>We could not be patched together to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a solid object in this bigger world or </v>

911
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:27.540
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

912
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our exIstence sufficiently different </v>

913
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.730
<v Speaker 1>from the summit atomic realm that I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>no way that we could be the same thing </v>

914
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.720
<v Speaker 1>as the subatomic realm to some bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

915
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I do think we could be living in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation as elon musk famously a </v>

916
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.710
<v Speaker 1>suggested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could be all living in a computer </v>

917
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.710
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's likely,</v>

918
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's completely plausible given what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know right now.</v>

919
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is that one day we most </v>

920
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.291
<v Speaker 1>likely will have something as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology continues to exponentially </v>

921
00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:59.700
<v Speaker 1>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will one day have something that's </v>

922
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.401
<v Speaker 1>indiscernible from the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be able to interface more than </v>

923
00:41:02.401 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Speaker 1>likely to be able to interface with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>senses,</v>

924
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:09.180
<v Speaker 1>with the way the mind perceives reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and create something that passes that </v>

925
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:14.390
<v Speaker 1>uncanny valley and literally feels like </v>
<v Speaker 1>like real life matrix.</v>

926
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that we might be very far or we </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be pretty close.</v>

927
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard to tell because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much We don't know right now.</v>

928
00:41:19.121 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not like this is coming in the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>

929
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.720
<v Speaker 1>but it could be a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

930
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:23.740
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could.</v>

931
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.940
<v Speaker 1>You know the thought experiment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps people accept this is you </v>

932
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.520
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single neuron in your brain,</v>

933
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you have something like 100 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons in your,</v>

934
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>but every</v>

935
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 2>single one is not that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes in some inputs,</v>

936
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:41.850
<v Speaker 2>outputs in some outputs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be work to figure out exactly </v>

937
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.110
<v Speaker 2>what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not mysterious.</v>

938
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So We couldn't imagine replacing one </v>

939
00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 2>neuron in your brain with a solid state </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro,</v>

940
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 2>a device that does exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as that neuron,</v>

941
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.110
<v Speaker 2>and you will be the same person roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

942
00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

943
00:41:58.131 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you believe that,</v>

944
00:41:59.511 --> 00:42:04.511
<v Speaker 2>then do that With 202 neurons and do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with three neurons and you're gradually </v>

945
00:42:04.511 --> 00:42:08.501
<v Speaker 2>building up who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just replacing your brain with </v>

946
00:42:08.501 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>something that is a machine made and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe that can happen,</v>

947
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to think that machines</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be as human as we want them to be.</v>

948
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.870
<v Speaker 2>do you follow any ray kurzweil stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

949
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

950
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 2>he's and especially deep thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a good one.</v>

951
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.740
<v Speaker 3>How are you counting on his desk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be this mother fucker.</v>

952
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 3>you don't think he's an deep thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

953
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:34.850
<v Speaker 3>he's a brilliant guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Invented a bunch of really fascinating </v>

954
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:34.850
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

955
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes to extrapolate without,</v>

956
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without limit pretty fearlessly.</v>

957
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must have irritated you for you to </v>

958
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.361
<v Speaker 2>jump right out with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's a particularly deep </v>

959
00:42:46.361 --> 00:42:46.361
<v Speaker 2>thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

960
00:42:46.361 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 2>but I do think he serves a role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are people who,</v>

961
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make us think more deeply.</v>

962
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember seeing a panel </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion with,</v>

963
00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murray gilman,</v>

964
00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 2>who was a famous physicist and isaac </v>
<v Speaker 2>asimov.</v>

965
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.370
<v Speaker 2>This was like 30 years ago when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

966
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:00.450
<v Speaker 2>as well as still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was some,</v>

967
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.900
<v Speaker 2>someone else who's on the panel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

968
00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:07.901
<v Speaker 2>it was another physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the amazing thing was the science </v>

969
00:43:07.901 --> 00:43:11.921
<v Speaker 2>fiction author was by far the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative thinker up there in terms </v>

970
00:43:11.921 --> 00:43:14.900
<v Speaker 2>of what he thought would really be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening a thousand years from now.</v>

971
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The physicist had these Way out ideas </v>

972
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:19.930
<v Speaker 2>and asthma was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

973
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to be all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

974
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just hard to predict the future</v>

975
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.880
<v Speaker 2>accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a role serve both by trying </v>

976
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.331
<v Speaker 2>to be as realistic as possible and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and careful and basie and saying what </v>

977
00:43:31.331 --> 00:43:31.331
<v Speaker 2>are the probabilities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so forth.</v>

978
00:43:31.331 --> 00:43:33.590
<v Speaker 2>There's another role served by just </v>
<v Speaker 2>being the,</v>

979
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 2>a provocative in saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

980
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 2>maybe this crazy thing is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

981
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we'll cure death in the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years.</v>

982
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:42.350
<v Speaker 2>And a light bulb change for everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically.</v>

983
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 2>That seems fairly likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

984
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.700
<v Speaker 2>They'll to figure out some way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse aging.</v>

985
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:47.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's plausible.</v>

986
00:43:47.811 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 2>There's no biological reason why not.</v>

987
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Kurzweil's got some weird motivations </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

988
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.050
<v Speaker 3>he literally wants to sort of rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 3>his father.</v>

989
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

990
00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:02.910
<v Speaker 3>He wants to be able to piece together </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of an artificial intelligence </v>

991
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.020
<v Speaker 3>version of his father and go back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see him.</v>

992
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's deep.</v>

993
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

994
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.520
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks that there's gonna come a </v>

995
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:17.520
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

996
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.130
<v Speaker 3>inside his lifetime hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you'll be able to download </v>

997
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.331
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that consciousness is going to be </v>

998
00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:25.720
<v Speaker 3>something you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll transfer sort of like a code.</v>

999
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>

1000
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1001
00:44:29.741 --> 00:44:31.240
<v Speaker 3>what is potentially</v>

1002
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 2>given arbitrary amounts of time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources and what is realistic in the </v>

1003
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.880
<v Speaker 2>relatively near term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the near term we mean 50 or a hundred</v>

1004
00:44:38.881 --> 00:44:39.560
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1005
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:44.900
<v Speaker 2>And I think that people like ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>kurzweil are far a exaggerating what's </v>

1006
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:50.031
<v Speaker 2>going to be possible the next 50 or 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years because they underestimate how </v>

1007
00:44:50.031 --> 00:44:50.730
<v Speaker 2>little we know about how the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

1008
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 2>how important it is for the brain bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in our bodies,</v>

1009
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1010
00:44:55.330 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the breakthroughs in artificial </v>

1011
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.451
<v Speaker 2>intelligence over the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades was to realize that if you try </v>

1012
00:45:02.451 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 2>to build an artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

1013
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:08.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes much more realistic if you </v>

1014
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.791
<v Speaker 2>give it a body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give it a face and it can </v>

1015
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.071
<v Speaker 2>interact with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we underestimate the extent to </v>

1016
00:45:13.071 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 2>which having a body is an important part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how we think and who we are.</v>

1017
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just like such baby steps and </v>

1018
00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 2>understanding this stuff that to imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the matter of decades we'll have</v>

1019
00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:24.480
<v Speaker 2>it all figured out and have downloadable</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousnesses is not realistic to me.</v>

1020
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that we have to absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the exact way that the human </v>

1021
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 2>brain works in order to replicate its </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities?</v>

1022
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1023
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably won't step,</v>

1024
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.750
<v Speaker 2>probably won't be the way that we make </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial consciousness or artificial </v>

1025
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.041
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we won't just be reconstructing </v>

1026
00:45:46.041 --> 00:45:46.041
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when we made cars,</v>

1027
00:45:46.041 --> 00:45:47.820
<v Speaker 2>we didn't reconstruct horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1028
00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:52.821
<v Speaker 2>We just did it in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different way in cars are much </v>

1029
00:45:52.821 --> 00:45:55.431
<v Speaker 2>better than horses and in various ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>not as good in other ways like going on </v>

1030
00:45:55.521 --> 00:45:56.880
<v Speaker 2>the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going up hills.</v>

1031
00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:57.560
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 2>in the early days of cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one big complaint was.</v>

1033
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm drunk and passed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't take me home.</v>

1034
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that a complaint?</v>

1035
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 2>That was a complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

1036
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Because the horse had just take you home</v>
<v Speaker 2>and knows how to get there.</v>

1037
00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

1038
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:11.640
<v Speaker 2>we'll get the artificial and nobody gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>

1039
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Self driving cars will be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

1040
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 2>if you're driving a horse drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a shit.</v>

1041
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're passed out.</v>

1042
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.380
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.050
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like a big adjustment for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1044
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1045
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 2>More trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that the way that will </v>

1046
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.981
<v Speaker 2>make artificial intelligence is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of mimic a human being is just </v>

1047
00:46:27.981 --> 00:46:28.560
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it's going to be.</v>

1048
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it's gonna be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1049
00:46:30.931 --> 00:46:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>

1050
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:36.740
<v Speaker 2>There are problems that can be solved by</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we design or just a </v>

1051
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 2>different set of problems than the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that evolution naturally made us do.</v>

1052
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like evolution built a very,</v>

1053
00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:48.681
<v Speaker 2>very general purpose machine that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inefficient and irrational and all sorts</v>

1054
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:53.961
<v Speaker 2>of ways like anyone's pocket calculator </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the 19 seventies can multiply </v>

1055
00:46:53.961 --> 00:46:55.110
<v Speaker 2>numbers way better than your brain can </v>
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>

1056
00:46:55.470 --> 00:47:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Your brain has enormously more </v>
<v Speaker 2>computational capacity than a pocket </v>

1057
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:01.080
<v Speaker 2>calculator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we multiply numbers?</v>

1058
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.830
<v Speaker 2>That ability was not important back when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were evolving these things.</v>

1059
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:09.831
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the set of things that it is easy to </v>

1060
00:47:09.831 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 2>design is just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different than what the brain does.</v>

1061
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:12.060
<v Speaker 2>So who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what it will be,</v>

1062
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 2>what it will look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that the more important</v>

1063
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:19.170
<v Speaker 2>thing we'll be blurring the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between human beings and machines.</v>

1064
00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:20.910
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crossovers.</v>

1065
00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 2>This is another one of elon musk's </v>
<v Speaker 2>project is called the neuro link.</v>

1066
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:29.750
<v Speaker 2>The idea of basically a neural lace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is just interfacing your </v>

1067
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>brain very,</v>

1068
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fast so that you have access to the</v>

1069
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 1>entire internet or whatever peripherals </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want in real time.</v>

1070
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 1>So wikipedia is part of your memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

1071
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's just who you are and how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk around and you can multiply numbers</v>

1072
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:46.560
<v Speaker 1>as fast as you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems very likely that augmented,</v>

1073
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.340
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1074
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some sort of a weird symbiotic </v>

1075
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 1>connection to the net into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronics,</v>

1076
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a wearable thing or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>even an embedded thing.</v>

1077
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1078
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it will be embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1079
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 1>this is more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use.</v>

1080
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.390
<v Speaker 1>We will you be one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopters?</v>

1081
00:48:04.391 --> 00:48:09.391
<v Speaker 1>Are you gonna wait a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never a first generation adopt or </v>

1082
00:48:09.391 --> 00:48:09.391
<v Speaker 1>even have iphones much less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:48:09.391 --> 00:48:10.720
<v Speaker 1>things embedded in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

1084
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I just adopted two kittens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get microchip implants.</v>

1085
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You adopt a cat that gets a microchip </v>

1086
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:19.110
<v Speaker 1>inside so you can't lose it.</v>

1087
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to think that we're very far away</v>

1088
00:48:20.261 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 1>from doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think is right.</v>

1089
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're going to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1090
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking at a a laptop bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a laptop bag that also is a.</v>

1091
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:34.410
<v Speaker 1>You have a passport bag and a laptop bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a carry on and then a check and</v>

1092
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.520
<v Speaker 1>sto for airport airplane luggage and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is bluetooth and all of it is </v>

1093
00:48:41.381 --> 00:48:46.060
<v Speaker 1>location coordinated with gps so that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another your bag gets lost,</v>

1094
00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 1>you literally can go on a computer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you where your bag is.</v>

1095
00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1096
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.530
<v Speaker 1>how long are we going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are we going to do that with people</v>

1097
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.060
<v Speaker 1>and I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1098
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in privacy rights and</v>

1099
00:48:57.491 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her dilemma,</v>

1100
00:48:58.871 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 1>do I let my employer microchipping what </v>
<v Speaker 1>does this.</v>

1101
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:06.150
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a company in Wisconsin that had </v>

1102
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 1>microchip day on August 1st and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>implanted microchips and people first of</v>

1103
00:49:08.831 --> 00:49:11.530
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude with his ears in that,</v>

1104
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.590
<v Speaker 1>those fucking earplugs and the lower ear</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobe thing.</v>

1105
00:49:14.591 --> 00:49:17.560
<v Speaker 1>You ain't doing nothing buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sticking that in me.</v>

1106
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Look what you've done in your ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fellow Wisconsin company becomes first </v>

1107
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.350
<v Speaker 1>us employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1108
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and these are very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just location tracking things.</v>

1109
00:49:25.751 --> 00:49:30.751
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you allow the company to do </v>

1110
00:49:30.751 --> 00:49:32.671
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't allow my company to tattoo </v>

1111
00:49:32.671 --> 00:49:34.561
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I allow my company to </v>

1112
00:49:34.561 --> 00:49:35.881
<v Speaker 1>microchip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for tracking and you can also like </v>

1113
00:49:35.881 --> 00:49:35.881
<v Speaker 1>they can buy stuff in the cafeteria and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1114
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you know what else you could do use your</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallet.</v>

1115
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.740
<v Speaker 1>You say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1116
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 1>do you turn off all cookies when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your laptop on and your browser.</v>

1117
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So I do know.</v>

1118
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.890
<v Speaker 1>No I don't because it's convenient and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys they like,</v>

1119
00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:52.891
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can buy their snacks with their </v>

1120
00:49:52.891 --> 00:49:52.891
<v Speaker 1>microchip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well wasn't the machine and get a snack,</v>

1121
00:49:52.891 --> 00:49:57.570
<v Speaker 1>but here's where therefore separation </v>
<v Speaker 1>every last this laptop I can go like </v>

1122
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:01.890
<v Speaker 1>that and then I could walk out the door </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that laptop stays here and all the </v>

1123
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Speaker 1>cookies and all my browser history stays</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1124
00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an estimate.</v>

1125
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.440
<v Speaker 1>They want you to think now you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking me out.</v>

1126
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Another thing I wanted to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about with quantum mechanics that came </v>

1127
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 1>out of that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the bleep.</v>

1128
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:19.740
<v Speaker 1>That was very confusing to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people was the whole observer effect.</v>

1129
00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Now that is something that I've tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain to people that the issue is,</v>

1130
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.720
<v Speaker 1>well please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could explaIn it like this is the</v>

1131
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:34.721
<v Speaker 1>thing is that people believe that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics it's been proven that if</v>

1132
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:39.560
<v Speaker 1>you look at things that you looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things changes those things,</v>

1133
00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.440
<v Speaker 1>but the way it's been described to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1134
00:50:42.441 --> 00:50:47.441
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually because you are measuring </v>

1135
00:50:47.441 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 1>those things and that's what changes it.</v>

1136
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.470
<v Speaker 1>The act of measuring in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1137
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:55.630
<v Speaker 1>and that there's some sort of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction when you're measuring </v>

1138
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:56.270
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's changing the effect.</v>

1139
00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1140
00:50:57.261 --> 00:51:02.261
<v Speaker 1>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The this is a legacy of the battle days </v>

1141
00:51:02.261 --> 00:51:05.411
<v Speaker 1>of quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people were a little bit fuzzy </v>

1142
00:51:05.411 --> 00:51:05.630
<v Speaker 1>about these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was better at it.</v>

1143
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:10.660
<v Speaker 1>The bad old days like battle rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle days maybe like see einstein and </v>

1144
00:51:10.761 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>bohr going at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rap battle,</v>

1145
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.770
<v Speaker 1>the bad old days when people had a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited understanding of what quantum </v>

1146
00:51:18.051 --> 00:51:21.740
<v Speaker 1>mechanics really is and spoke about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and slightly sloppy ways,</v>

1147
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:26.830
<v Speaker 1>so there is the truth that if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to describe what you see when you look </v>

1148
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:33.011
<v Speaker 1>at an electron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see is different than what it </v>

1149
00:51:33.011 --> 00:51:35.111
<v Speaker 1>is like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do change it by looking at it and </v>

1150
00:51:35.111 --> 00:51:39.011
<v Speaker 1>therefore back in the battle days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people wondered whether there </v>

1151
00:51:39.011 --> 00:51:42.851
<v Speaker 1>was something special about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness or human perception or </v>

1152
00:51:42.851 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 1>something that was helping us explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>the laws of quantum mechanics.</v>

1153
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So as you are pointing toward no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer's no.</v>

1154
00:51:49.211 --> 00:51:52.520
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing special about quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics and consciousness in any way.</v>

1155
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 1>A rock could do the same thing or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video camera or a speck of dust.</v>

1156
00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:02.240
<v Speaker 1>The the quantum mechanics rules says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that things change when systems interact</v>

1157
00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:05.150
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that you described the system is</v>

1158
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:10.151
<v Speaker 1>different when it's all by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when it interacts in some </v>

1159
00:52:10.151 --> 00:52:10.820
<v Speaker 1>interesting way with some other system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that system can be a person,</v>

1160
00:52:10.821 --> 00:52:15.821
<v Speaker 1>but it can be anything else also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that famous experiment that's in </v>

1161
00:52:15.821 --> 00:52:19.601
<v Speaker 1>that cartoon that gets passed around by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people every two or three years when </v>

1162
00:52:19.601 --> 00:52:19.760
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1163
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 1>the world's made the magic and they pass</v>
<v Speaker 1>this around.</v>

1164
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It's usually a yoga teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1165
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1166
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 1>that shows that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1167
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.850
<v Speaker 1>there's the particles in the waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

1168
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the saving and funding?</v>

1169
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I know it's dr quantum when we get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble playing that be maybe for </v>

1170
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:41.270
<v Speaker 1>shitting on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will get mad at us.</v>

1171
00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 1>We might get pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get pulled from you had a good run.</v>

1172
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 1>What people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:49.460
<v Speaker 1>they own these videos and so it's a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue is wildlife videos.</v>

1174
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Those suckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1175
00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 1>they're so quick to pull the trigger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1176
00:52:53.361 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 1>they have a claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their video.</v>

1177
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So if you use working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.930
<v Speaker 1>So if you use it in mock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever is happening,</v>

1179
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:01.520
<v Speaker 1>or even if you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1180
00:53:01.521 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 1>go watch this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on youtube,</v>

1181
00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 1>here's the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1182
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 1>You would think that'd be like good </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising,</v>

1183
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get here.</v>

1184
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring it up and I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can like talk about it a little bit.</v>

1185
00:53:12.431 --> 00:53:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So give,</v>

1186
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.810
<v Speaker 1>give me some volume so I could hear what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say.</v>

1187
00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1188
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The double slit experiment,</v>

1189
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:25.690
<v Speaker 1>right see is similar to</v>

1190
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.980
<v Speaker 4>the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The marbles make bar when we add the </v>

1191
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 4>second slip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something different.</v>

1192
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:40.110
<v Speaker 4>If the top of one wave meets the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 4>of another way,</v>

1193
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:45.920
<v Speaker 4>they cancel each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now there is an interference pattern </v>

1194
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.560
<v Speaker 4>on the back wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Places where the two tops meet are the </v>

1195
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:56.091
<v Speaker 4>highest intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bright lines and where they cancel </v>

1196
00:53:56.091 --> 00:54:00.690
<v Speaker 4>there is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when we throw things that is matter </v>

1197
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:06.590
<v Speaker 4>through two slits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get this two vans and hits and with </v>

1198
00:54:07.741 --> 00:54:12.060
<v Speaker 4>waves we get an interference pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 4>many bands.</v>

1199
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Good so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let's go quantum.</v>

1200
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.960
<v Speaker 4>So now you're going to freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is where you start getting mad </v>

1201
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.210
<v Speaker 4>quantum quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1202
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 4>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny bit of matter,</v>

1203
00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:33.940
<v Speaker 4>like a tiny marble fire street already </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaking his head folks.</v>

1204
00:54:34.031 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 4>It's not a tiny marbles.</v>

1205
00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.660
<v Speaker 2>You got to do a little bit of commentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>on we can't just play the whole video.</v>

1206
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I can do the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what they're talking </v>

1207
00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:44.290
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very famous experiment.</v>

1208
00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:47.411
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you have two slits that you let </v>

1209
00:54:47.411 --> 00:54:51.640
<v Speaker 2>marbles go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get two slits in the receiving </v>

1210
00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.050
<v Speaker 2>screen on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1211
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you let a wave go through two</v>
<v Speaker 2>slits,</v>

1212
00:54:54.981 --> 00:54:56.600
<v Speaker 2>you get this interference pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1213
00:54:56.810 --> 00:55:00.680
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens when you let an </v>
<v Speaker 2>electron go through?</v>

1214
00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.690
<v Speaker 2>The answer is you get an interference </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>

1215
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a wave than a particle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the real weird thing that they're </v>

1216
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:09.080
<v Speaker 2>going to get to eventually is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1217
00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.240
<v Speaker 2>If you let an electron go through two </v>
<v Speaker 2>slits,</v>

1218
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:15.200
<v Speaker 2>but you put little detectors on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>slits,</v>

1219
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:19.040
<v Speaker 2>so you say which detect which slit did </v>
<v Speaker 2>the electron go through.</v>

1220
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Then it always says it goes through one </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the other.</v>

1221
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:27.490
<v Speaker 2>It never goes through both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the interference pattern on the </v>

1222
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:30.791
<v Speaker 2>other side disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only see the two lines that you </v>

1223
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 2>would have seen if they were marble </v>
<v Speaker 2>link.</v>

1224
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:36.490
<v Speaker 2>So the point is when you're not looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the electron is acting like a wave and </v>

1225
00:55:36.591 --> 00:55:39.590
<v Speaker 2>when you're look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the electron acts like a particle.</v>

1226
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.720
<v Speaker 2>That is the lesson of the double slit </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>

1227
00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1228
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you put that detector on </v>

1229
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.250
<v Speaker 2>the slits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you interacted with the electron and you</v>

1230
00:55:52.251 --> 00:55:53.570
<v Speaker 2>localized it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1231
00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.030
<v Speaker 2>There was no such thing as the position </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the electron.</v>

1232
00:55:56.031 --> 00:55:57.770
<v Speaker 2>There was no such thing as the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question.</v>

1233
00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Did it go through one slit or the other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was only a cloud.</v>

1234
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:05.290
<v Speaker 2>There's only a wave going through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you affected it or whatever the </v>

1235
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:09.370
<v Speaker 2>detector was affected it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it looked through the slits to see </v>

1236
00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:13.451
<v Speaker 2>did it go through this one or this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that affect changed it from being </v>

1237
00:56:13.451 --> 00:56:15.950
<v Speaker 2>going through both lists to being only </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through one and how does it affect</v>

1238
00:56:15.951 --> 00:56:16.400
<v Speaker 2>it like that?</v>

1239
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this what,</v>

1240
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:23.230
<v Speaker 2>what's called quantum entanglement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The detector becomes entangled with the </v>

1241
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:28.230
<v Speaker 2>electron and this is where you get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I my favorite version of quantum </v>

1242
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:29.440
<v Speaker 2>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the many worlds interpretation.</v>

1243
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 2>The the right wAy to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electron was that cloud,</v>

1244
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.430
<v Speaker 2>that wave going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the natural thing.</v>

1245
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:39.790
<v Speaker 2>The weird thing is that when you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different slits,</v>

1246
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 2>you only see it go through one or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and it acts like a particle.</v>

1247
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:44.980
<v Speaker 2>So how do you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>

1248
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 2>our natural intuitive way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about electrons is as particles.</v>

1249
00:56:48.161 --> 00:56:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Little marbles and quantum mechanics </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1250
00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:50.400
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1251
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.420
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's naturally a wave.</v>

1252
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:57.421
<v Speaker 2>The weird thing is when it acts like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particle and if you are many worlds </v>

1253
00:56:57.421 --> 00:57:01.171
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the answer you give is the </v>

1254
00:57:01.171 --> 00:57:03.481
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look to see to the electron go </v>

1255
00:57:03.481 --> 00:57:06.331
<v Speaker 2>through one slit or the other you or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever video camera you had or </v>

1256
00:57:06.331 --> 00:57:10.711
<v Speaker 2>whatever becomes entangled with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electron and what that means is that the</v>

1257
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:15.721
<v Speaker 2>wave function of the whole universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wave function of both the electron </v>

1258
00:57:15.721 --> 00:57:19.081
<v Speaker 2>but also your camera and you and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stars and galaxies and so forth splits </v>

1259
00:57:19.081 --> 00:57:23.671
<v Speaker 2>into and there is now one branch of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wave function which which acts like its </v>

1260
00:57:23.671 --> 00:57:28.621
<v Speaker 2>own separate world which says the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electron went through the left slit and </v>

1261
00:57:28.621 --> 00:57:33.211
<v Speaker 2>your cameras saw it go through the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>slit and it made a little line on the </v>

1262
00:57:33.211 --> 00:57:35.530
<v Speaker 2>other side and there's another branch </v>
<v Speaker 2>which says the electron went through the</v>

1263
00:57:35.531 --> 00:57:40.531
<v Speaker 2>right slipped and your cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it goes through the rites lit and it </v>

1264
00:57:40.531 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Speaker 2>makes a line on the other side and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both still there,</v>

1265
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:44.740
<v Speaker 2>but the world split into and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>only in one of them.</v>

1266
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't see the whole world anymore.</v>

1267
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.140
<v Speaker 3>You managed to make it more confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Congratulations.</v>

1268
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Screwed my head up even more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>

1269
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The less,</v>

1270
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:59.221
<v Speaker 3>now that's even more baffling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the bit you understand is actually </v>

1271
00:57:59.221 --> 00:57:59.221
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1272
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little illusion of understanding </v>

1273
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:04.520
<v Speaker 3>doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1274
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.410
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by not understanding,</v>

1275
00:58:05.411 --> 00:58:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I understand more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1276
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a weird job.</v>

1277
00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:13.240
<v Speaker 3>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very weird job.</v>

1278
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1279
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it now though in talking to you,</v>

1280
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:17.740
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1281
00:58:17.741 --> 00:58:21.610
<v Speaker 3>you have the deepak chopra's of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and why you have the,</v>

1282
00:58:21.611 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 3>what the bleeps because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>intensely confusing.</v>

1283
00:58:26.471 --> 00:58:31.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially with the limitations of </v>

1284
00:58:31.471 --> 00:58:34.440
<v Speaker 3>language of just counter intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's against every little bit of our </v>

1285
00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.551
<v Speaker 3>everyday experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a set of concepts that were not </v>

1286
00:58:38.551 --> 00:58:41.101
<v Speaker 3>equipped with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not born with that we have to </v>

1287
00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:41.101
<v Speaker 3>struggle to get into our heads over </v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1288
00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it shouldn't be surprising.</v>

1289
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:48.300
<v Speaker 3>So you as an educator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were talking to people about </v>

1290
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously you've probably done this</v>

1291
00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:51.940
<v Speaker 3>thousands of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1292
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:55.810
<v Speaker 3>And tried to have theSe kind of weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations with people like myself.</v>

1293
00:58:55.811 --> 00:58:59.770
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of lack the tools to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>truly understand what you're saying.</v>

1294
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1295
00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.530
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be frustrating in a sense or</v>

1296
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1297
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

1298
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1299
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's correct.</v>

1300
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Because what a great attitude</v>

1301
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That used to be me,</v>

1302
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 2>like it's not like my brain was born </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to understand quantum mechanics.</v>

1303
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked at it and struggled with it and</v>

1304
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:18.430
<v Speaker 2>got it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who knows,</v>

1305
00:59:18.431 --> 00:59:20.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10 years from now will think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1306
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 2>you're so stupid 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1307
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:27.280
<v Speaker 1>But I think that it can be understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people who wants to try to </v>

1308
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:32.120
<v Speaker 1>understand it a number one are already </v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of the way to being awesome.</v>

1309
00:59:32.121 --> 00:59:34.430
<v Speaker 1>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remaining 10 percent is very,</v>

1310
00:59:34.431 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 1>very achievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is understandable.</v>

1311
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't it fireman that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think you understand quantum </v>

1312
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:41.440
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand quantum mechanics.</v>

1313
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said something like that.</v>

1314
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 1>He said he can safely say that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands quantum mechanics,</v>

1315
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:51.850
<v Speaker 1>which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that you should therefore be </v>

1316
00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:52.470
<v Speaker 1>outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should not be proud of that.</v>

1317
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.040
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1318
00:59:56.041 --> 01:00:01.041
<v Speaker 1>He's being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it's certainly true </v>

1319
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:01.041
<v Speaker 1>that we don't understand quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>

1320
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>if I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean both understand and everyone </v>

1321
01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>else agrees that you understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone understands it,</v>

1322
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:09.800
<v Speaker 1>but certainly there's no consensus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right way to understand it,</v>

1323
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>no consensus in the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that.</v>

1324
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>It was a very disturbing concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like me,</v>

1325
01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>we want you to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1326
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>water is wet and oxygen is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1327
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a thousand years from now,</v>

1328
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:27.221
<v Speaker 1>historians of science will look back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century and shake their heads </v>

1329
01:00:27.221 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>in despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

1330
01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:28.120
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

1331
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics fell into your lap and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't spend any time thinking about</v>

1332
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:37.181
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't try very hard to understand </v>

1333
01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:37.181
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's embarrassing.</v>

1334
01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the general public or science </v>

1335
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>professional scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with phds in theoretical physics.</v>

1336
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:44.781
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it comes to the people that you </v>

1337
01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:49.061
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like scientists sort of dismiss quantum </v>

1338
01:00:49.061 --> 01:00:52.121
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they dismissing and how are </v>

1339
01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:52.121
<v Speaker 1>they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1340
01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:52.121
<v Speaker 1>to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear,</v>

1341
01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>they're not dismissing quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics.</v>

1342
01:00:53.211 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>They use quantum mechanics everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love quantum mechanics.</v>

1343
01:00:55.821 --> 01:01:00.821
<v Speaker 1>Quantum mechanics is a recipe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculating what's going to happen in </v>

1344
01:01:00.821 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>your experiment.</v>

1345
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:06.010
<v Speaker 1>That is an unprecedented precision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the best way we have of </v>

1346
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>knowing what's going to happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lab that we've ever invented and there's</v>

1347
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>no reason to think that it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you press them on,</v>

1348
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:13.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was really happening?</v>

1349
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>What is the description of reality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponds to the calculation you just.</v>

1350
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:23.261
<v Speaker 1>Did they get annoyed and frustrated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rather than give you an answer to </v>

1351
01:01:23.261 --> 01:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>the question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1352
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they get annoyed and frustrated with </v>

1353
01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:31.451
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you have these conversations </v>

1354
01:01:31.451 --> 01:01:31.451
<v Speaker 1>with these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With anyone?</v>

1355
01:01:31.451 --> 01:01:31.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will.</v>

1356
01:01:31.451 --> 01:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't understand this.</v>

1357
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand which is fine,</v>

1358
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>but they act as if not understanding it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is okay and to me that is not fine.</v>

1359
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.680
<v Speaker 1>They will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my job's not to understand the world is </v>

1360
01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.751
<v Speaker 1>just to make predictions and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really the job of science or </v>

1361
01:01:46.751 --> 01:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>physics at all.</v>

1362
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Their job is not understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to make predictions.</v>

1363
01:01:50.281 --> 01:01:55.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you make predictions if you </v>

1364
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:56.471
<v Speaker 1>don't understand what you're making?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A prediction that is exactly the </v>

1365
01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:56.471
<v Speaker 1>situation with quantum mechanics right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1366
01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Like we have a recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have an algorithm set of rules,</v>

1367
01:01:59.001 --> 01:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

1368
01:01:59.661 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get an answer,</v>

1369
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is verified and experiments </v>

1370
01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

1371
01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1372
01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>why is it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was happening?</v>

1373
01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:09.200
<v Speaker 1>What is the thing that is moving around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1374
01:02:09.201 --> 01:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1375
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>don't ask me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1376
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you do most of the time when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not teaching?</v>

1377
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're working on this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1378
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there's not someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you what to do.</v>

1379
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're,</v>

1380
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>when you're working on this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1381
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>like how do you structure it?</v>

1382
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to you,</v>

1383
01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this sort of a selection effect </v>

1384
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>that did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to structure on your own is,</v>

1385
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>is necessary to get to a certain stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your career.</v>

1386
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1387
01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:43.491
<v Speaker 1>I had students graduate students who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>work with as well as other colleagues </v>

1388
01:02:43.491 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>that I collaborate with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's roughly speaking,</v>

1389
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>going into the office or going to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cafe,</v>

1390
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>sitting down with a piece of paper and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pencil and writing.</v>

1391
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my job.</v>

1392
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You go to the office or a cafe and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down with like one of these yellow </v>

1393
01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>legal pads and you write all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken scratch that.</v>

1394
01:02:57.991 --> 01:03:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Nobody understands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you guys have recently changed.</v>

1395
01:03:00.871 --> 01:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Now I have an ipad pro with an apple </v>
<v Speaker 1>pencil and I do you do all that.</v>

1396
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Only very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very recently upgraded.</v>

1397
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you can get yourself onto them</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying samsung note eight,</v>

1398
01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>that it has the pen on it.</v>

1399
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty bad ass.</v>

1400
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:13.850
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1401
01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.950
<v Speaker 1>While the screen is dark like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to turn the screen on.</v>

1402
01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:20.820
<v Speaker 1>You pull out the stylists and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw notes on screen.</v>

1403
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up until I got 180 pages of notes.</v>

1404
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Like on the actual screen itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have to open it up.</v>

1405
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty cool.</v>

1406
01:03:28.381 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm invested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I got the ipad,</v>

1407
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:31.830
<v Speaker 1>so I know that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1408
01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.710
<v Speaker 1>But the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences can carry that around in</v>

1409
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:35.580
<v Speaker 1>your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1410
01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I know that is a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:42.140
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when the idea is that there's a set </v>

1412
01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 1>of questions in our brains as </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional physicists,</v>

1413
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:46.200
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at any one time you're focusing on a</v>

1414
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>couple and you have a couple of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you say to yourself,</v>

1415
01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if things are like this,</v>

1416
01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 1>then this would follow and let's try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate what that would lead to.</v>

1417
01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:59.670
<v Speaker 1>And does that lead us someplace good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is that just crashed and burned?</v>

1418
01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:04.671
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you do over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again until you get a paper you can </v>

1419
01:04:04.671 --> 01:04:04.671
<v Speaker 1>write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where do you start from?</v>

1420
01:04:04.671 --> 01:04:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Like what is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say you get to the cafe,</v>

1421
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:09.630
<v Speaker 1>like what's your starting point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1422
01:04:09.631 --> 01:04:12.510
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do quantum mechanics.</v>

1423
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So we want to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1424
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:17.340
<v Speaker 1>the many worlds interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics.</v>

1425
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So you say that the world really is some</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum wave function,</v>

1426
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:26.930
<v Speaker 1>but you and I observe things like space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tables and stuff like that.</v>

1427
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

1428
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:34.970
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to say that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a table lurking in the wave </v>

1429
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:36.150
<v Speaker 1>function of the universe or there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars and galaxies.</v>

1430
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:41.180
<v Speaker 1>So that means that there's some way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing the wave function of the </v>

1431
01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.830
<v Speaker 1>universe that is sort of here's a table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the rest of the universe.</v>

1432
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So I might write down on a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>

1433
01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:50.520
<v Speaker 1>well here is a toy model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a simple representation of the wave</v>

1434
01:04:50.521 --> 01:04:55.521
<v Speaker 1>function of the universe that includes </v>
<v Speaker 1>one piece and another piece and they're </v>

1435
01:04:55.521 --> 01:04:56.990
<v Speaker 1>interacting with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would I know that that was tabled?</v>

1436
01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would I know in tables they're not </v>

1437
01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>really what we care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is space three dimensional,</v>

1438
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:07.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the kind of question we would </v>

1439
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:09.201
<v Speaker 1>worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would a wave function look like </v>

1440
01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:09.201
<v Speaker 1>that represented three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>space?</v>

1441
01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:13.851
<v Speaker 1>Is that natural?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could I poke at it and kind of make a </v>

1442
01:05:13.851 --> 01:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>prediction for what the early universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like on the basis of that?</v>

1443
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now like when you do calculations,</v>

1444
01:05:19.601 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>like say if you were doing calculus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you study black holes at all?</v>

1445
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>A little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1446
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>A little bit reading paper right now on </v>
<v Speaker 1>black or are you?</v>

1447
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are you writing about?</v>

1448
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Like what specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1449
01:05:28.211 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>there's this famous problem in black </v>
<v Speaker 1>holes that they evaporate,</v>

1450
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give off radiation.</v>

1451
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Stephen hawking back in the 19 seventies</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that black holes weren't completely</v>

1452
01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1453
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:42.420
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quantum mechanics as they will </v>

1454
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>gradually evaporate away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine.</v>

1455
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>We think we understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1456
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.050
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not completely,</v>

1457
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:53.100
<v Speaker 1>but what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a black hole is essentially like </v>

1458
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:56.491
<v Speaker 1>the event horizon is this tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely dense area and it's sucking </v>

1459
01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:59.400
<v Speaker 1>in the galaxy around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1460
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.440
<v Speaker 1>like supermassive black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that there is this still </v>

1461
01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 1>believed that there in the center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every galaxy and they represent one half</v>

1462
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:08.920
<v Speaker 1>of one percent of the mass of the galaxy</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1463
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Tiny fraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1464
01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:14.671
<v Speaker 1>So the larger the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger the supermassive black hole </v>

1465
01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:14.671
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

1466
01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:14.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1467
01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.600
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the black,</v>

1468
01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:17.440
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1469
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:22.500
<v Speaker 1>a black hole is a region of space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a region of space where the </v>

1470
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.390
<v Speaker 1>gravitational field is so strong that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can never leave that region of space</v>

1471
01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:27.570
<v Speaker 1>to go to the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1472
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1473
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 1>So stephen hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the,</v>

1474
01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's different sort of levels of </v>

1475
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>sophistication and thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>black holes are.</v>

1476
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:40.960
<v Speaker 1>So a one level is to forget about </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics entirely.</v>

1477
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Use general relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's theory of gravity that he </v>

1478
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>invented 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1916.</v>

1479
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is gravity?</v>

1480
01:06:49.661 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>It's spacetime curving on itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what gravity is.</v>

1481
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And he has equations to tell you how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much space,</v>

1482
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:56.020
<v Speaker 1>time curves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

1483
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 1>So we can describe black holes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those terms.</v>

1484
01:06:59.381 --> 01:07:03.190
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things you find is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>black holes only ever increase in size,</v>

1485
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:03.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1486
01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:08.460
<v Speaker 1>They can suck things in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'd never shrink because they </v>

1487
01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.130
<v Speaker 1>just suck things in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then in the 19 seventies,</v>

1488
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.240
<v Speaker 1>stephen hawking says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1489
01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:13.720
<v Speaker 1>what if we take into account quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics?</v>

1490
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1491
01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.040
<v Speaker 1>there's these clouds of probability all </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the black hole.</v>

1492
01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:19.630
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at a black hole,</v>

1493
01:07:19.631 --> 01:07:24.631
<v Speaker 1>does it look completely black?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is to his great surprise </v>

1494
01:07:24.631 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 1>and still to hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1495
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look completely black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even black holes when you look at them,</v>

1496
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.400
<v Speaker 1>will be seen to gradually emit photons </v>
<v Speaker 1>to emit radiation very,</v>

1497
01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very slowly.</v>

1498
01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:41.230
<v Speaker 1>And how were you looking at them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what method are you using this as a</v>

1499
01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:45.520
<v Speaker 1>thought experiment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've never seen this in the real world.</v>

1500
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>The actual black holes we know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>emit radiation so slowly there's no </v>

1501
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:54.781
<v Speaker 1>practical way to actually observe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is entirely theoretical right </v>

1502
01:07:54.781 --> 01:07:54.781
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1503
01:07:54.781 --> 01:07:56.950
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it is entirely theoretical,</v>

1504
01:07:56.951 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>how do you measure that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not entirely black.</v>

1505
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:06.300
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We predict that they're not entirely </v>

1506
01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:06.300
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've never verified that prediction</v>

1507
01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:06.790
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking me out,</v>

1508
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:07.980
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this a lot.</v>

1509
01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 1>A lot of physics is making predictions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can't get past,</v>

1510
01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but someday we're hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why even assume that?</v>

1511
01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what the motivation </v>

1512
01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:18.240
<v Speaker 1>for assuming that they're not entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

1513
01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not an assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1514
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>If you believe what we think is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>true about general relativity,</v>

1515
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>the curvature of space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and quantum mechanics,</v>

1516
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>then hawking says it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It follows from those assumptions that </v>

1517
01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.900
<v Speaker 1>black holes are not completely black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give off radiation.</v>

1518
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what about the theory?</v>

1519
01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And then I've heard this fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

1520
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:45.071
<v Speaker 1>that there is potentially another </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe inside of a black hole that as </v>

1521
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:50.921
<v Speaker 1>you go into a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may in fact be going into another </v>

1522
01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:55.541
<v Speaker 1>universe that's filled with hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of galaxies that have hundreds </v>

1523
01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:00.640
<v Speaker 1>of millions of black holes to the center</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps hundreds of millions of </v>

1524
01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:00.640
<v Speaker 1>universes inside of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1525
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible,</v>

1526
01:09:02.331 --> 01:09:03.740
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said earlier,</v>

1527
01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:05.930
<v Speaker 1>is what you should always say in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

1528
01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:10.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to think it's likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly conceivable that that</v>

1529
01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1530
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:16.010
<v Speaker 1>the journey would not be pain free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look inside the black hole,</v>

1531
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you would die or you'd be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

1532
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:23.770
<v Speaker 1>The technical term is spaghetti </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] because the gravitational </v>

1533
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:26.000
<v Speaker 1>pull is much stronger at your head than </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your feet as you're diving headfirst.</v>

1534
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 1>So you will be pulled into a very thin </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonliving with cannon ball,</v>

1535
01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:32.210
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't help.</v>

1536
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you go crazy when you saw that movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar where,</v>

1537
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a weird thing.</v>

1538
01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I actually know a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backstory there because kip thorne,</v>

1539
01:09:41.061 --> 01:09:42.410
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who invented the idea,</v>

1540
01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.880
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My colleague at caltech.</v>

1541
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1542
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.800
<v Speaker 1>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the movie or the book contact </v>

1543
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:50.800
<v Speaker 1>carl sagan wrote that movie.</v>

1544
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.850
<v Speaker 1>So carl sagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a brilliant guy,</v>

1545
01:09:52.851 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 1>but he was not a physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a planetary scientist.</v>

1546
01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:57.080
<v Speaker 1>He studied life on other planets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1547
01:09:57.290 --> 01:10:02.290
<v Speaker 1>So in his novel he had this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted his heroin a lie to get across</v>

1548
01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:04.220
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly,</v>

1549
01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:09.221
<v Speaker 1>faster than the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in the first draft he said she </v>

1550
01:10:09.221 --> 01:10:12.461
<v Speaker 1>falls into a black hole and then she </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets spit out somewhere else in the </v>

1551
01:10:12.461 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 1>galaxy and he knew that that couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly right,</v>

1552
01:10:13.191 --> 01:10:18.191
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't sound right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he called up his friend to kip </v>

1553
01:10:18.191 --> 01:10:19.180
<v Speaker 1>thorne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose a very famous physicist at caltech</v>

1554
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:24.190
<v Speaker 1>who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way will be winning the nobel </v>

1555
01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:24.890
<v Speaker 1>prize and a couple months in october.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it rigged a.</v>

1556
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:29.891
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just such an obvious choice </v>

1557
01:10:29.891 --> 01:10:31.660
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he also helped invent lego when </v>

1558
01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:31.660
<v Speaker 1>they discovered gravitational waves.</v>

1559
01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely gonna be worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nobel lego lego.</v>

1560
01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1561
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember hearing the </v>

1562
01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:39.760
<v Speaker 1>gravitational waves were detected a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

1563
01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:39.760
<v Speaker 1>year and a half?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1564
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>So lego is the observatory that did </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1565
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1566
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:45.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's his law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the observatory.</v>

1567
01:10:45.401 --> 01:10:47.720
<v Speaker 1>So he was one of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the moving pieces,</v>

1568
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:53.110
<v Speaker 1>moving forces behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So gravitational waves were some </v>

1569
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>theoretical thing that's now been proven</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be real.</v>

1570
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:59.590
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big announcement about the new </v>

1571
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.590
<v Speaker 1>gravitational waves from ligo might </v>
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>

1572
01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:02.060
<v Speaker 1>And yet that was August 24th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty recent one hour ago.</v>

1573
01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what it is.</v>

1574
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's another.</v>

1575
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1576
01:11:06.501 --> 01:11:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell us?</v>

1577
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you because it's on the </v>

1578
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:12.640
<v Speaker 1>internet because I don't want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because it's,</v>

1579
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I should let lego tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a rumor,</v>

1580
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just say stay tuned.</v>

1581
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>When we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we saw last year,</v>

1582
01:11:20.671 --> 01:11:25.671
<v Speaker 1>the announcement was black holes were </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiraling into each other and giving off</v>

1583
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:28.770
<v Speaker 1>gravitational waves and that's what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw.</v>

1584
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1585
01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.490
<v Speaker 1>that was the source of the gravitational</v>
<v Speaker 1>waves that we saw.</v>

1586
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:38.060
<v Speaker 1>This news story is about neutron stars </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiraling into each other or spiraling </v>

1587
01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>into something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know the details.</v>

1588
01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:43.971
<v Speaker 1>They just a rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different source for the </v>

1589
01:11:43.971 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>gravitational waves than we had before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is beyond black holes.</v>

1590
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:49.941
<v Speaker 1>Could lego have detected merging neutron</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars for the first time now merging </v>

1591
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:54.060
<v Speaker 1>meaning like this infinitely slow pace </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're sort of measuring.</v>

1592
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very fast.</v>

1593
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:57.760
<v Speaker 1>It takes seconds once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they're.</v>

1594
01:11:57.810 --> 01:11:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Once they're together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:04.041
<v Speaker 1>Once they were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close and emitting gravitational </v>

1596
01:12:04.041 --> 01:12:04.041
<v Speaker 1>waves you can observe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1597
01:12:04.041 --> 01:12:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And the exciting thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1598
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:09.770
<v Speaker 1>once black holes can merge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not neutron stars the differences </v>

1599
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>that black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite everything I just said them </v>

1600
01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.130
<v Speaker 1>about not being completely black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty darn black.</v>

1601
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:19.550
<v Speaker 1>so you see gravitational waves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see them in your regular </v>

1602
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.920
<v Speaker 1>telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With neutron stars,</v>

1603
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a chance you can just see them </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as detect the gravitational.</v>

1604
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Now neutron stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now when they're doing this,</v>

1605
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you know we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about like how far away </v>

1606
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.910
<v Speaker 1>are we observing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1607
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually millions of light years.</v>

1608
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything you're observing happened </v>

1609
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.870
<v Speaker 1>millions of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

1610
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1611
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the bigger mindfox.</v>

1612
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.760
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get your head around when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look it up in the sky and you're </v>

1613
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:49.800
<v Speaker 1>seeing something that's a million light </v>
<v Speaker 1>years away.</v>

1614
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're looking through a telescope,</v>

1615
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.480
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing something that might not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even be there anymore.</v>

1616
01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1617
01:12:55.351 --> 01:13:00.351
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's not because it gave off </v>

1618
01:13:00.351 --> 01:13:00.351
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest explosions in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1619
01:13:00.351 --> 01:13:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Then that's what you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aftermath of those neutron stars are</v>

1620
01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:04.020
<v Speaker 1>no longer around.</v>

1621
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.210
<v Speaker 1>If they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're that it might've made a black</v>

1622
01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:07.860
<v Speaker 1>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be some black hole remnant.</v>

1623
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:12.920
<v Speaker 1>If we've observed the birth of a black </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole for um,</v>

1625
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've observed the birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've observed one big black hole being </v>

1626
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.560
<v Speaker 1>made out of two smaller ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a leg.</v>

1627
01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what lego saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1628
01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:25.180
<v Speaker 1>They actually observed it taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the definition of </v>

1629
01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:25.180
<v Speaker 1>observed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know That it happened.</v>

1630
01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the gravitational wave.</v>

1631
01:13:26.471 --> 01:13:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1632
01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 1>That we observed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1633
01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:33.201
<v Speaker 1>So you have a signature that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniably the evidence of this.</v>

1634
01:13:34.341 --> 01:13:39.341
<v Speaker 1>Now this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the details here with a </v>

1635
01:13:39.341 --> 01:13:39.341
<v Speaker 1>neutron stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1636
01:13:39.341 --> 01:13:40.440
<v Speaker 1>they might be able to say there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>black hole left behind.</v>

1637
01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be surprised.</v>

1638
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:45.120
<v Speaker 1>That sounds very precise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very unrealistic.</v>

1639
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.880
<v Speaker 1>But that's the kind of thing we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope to be able to say someday.</v>

1640
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing.</v>

1641
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're showing if you take dmt,</v>

1642
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 1>you can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is this?</v>

1643
01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:58.641
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the animated depiction of these </v>

1644
01:13:58.641 --> 01:13:59.220
<v Speaker 1>two black holes spiraling into each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1645
01:13:59.221 --> 01:14:04.221
<v Speaker 1>And because this is another one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>caltech colleagues that do need to get </v>

1646
01:14:04.221 --> 01:14:06.150
<v Speaker 1>outside and it looks like he's just been</v>
<v Speaker 1>buried in books,</v>

1647
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.820
<v Speaker 1>then we wouldn't get good physics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people went outside.</v>

1648
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't let him outside little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>StAy inside that a lIttle bit,</v>

1649
01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.560
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kid outside of some pictures don't make </v>

1650
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1651
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:18.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they delegate.</v>

1652
01:14:18.671 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 1>He's got this fish on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's losing his mind.</v>

1653
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 1>He's drawn fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1654
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:28.590
<v Speaker 1>when like when you try to make these </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual representations of something that</v>

1655
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:34.060
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially you're,</v>

1656
01:14:34.061 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only interpreting,</v>

1657
01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:41.370
<v Speaker 1>you're getting the gravitational wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting the information that </v>

1658
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:44.671
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you try to make a visual </v>

1659
01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:44.980
<v Speaker 1>representation of this thing that's for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the general public,</v>

1660
01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:45.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1661
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not basically not really for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1662
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:51.750
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you could also though see the </v>

1663
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 1>event happened using visible light or </v>
<v Speaker 1>using your regular telescopes,</v>

1664
01:14:53.801 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 1>that will give you enormously more </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1665
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:56.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's always a good thing to aim </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1666
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>So as they do like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1667
01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 1>this array that they're putting together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chile and all these different,</v>

1668
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.440
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more advanced super telescope are </v>

1669
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.961
<v Speaker 1>raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get more and more </v>

1670
01:15:09.961 --> 01:15:13.440
<v Speaker 1>actual visual information so that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see this stuff or something.</v>

1671
01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1672
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:19.030
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much easier to detect light than it</v>

1673
01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:21.940
<v Speaker 1>is to detect gravitational waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the sound.</v>

1674
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.600
<v Speaker 1>This is the actual gravitational wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the early detection's,</v>

1675
01:15:27.641 --> 01:15:31.660
<v Speaker 1>the first ones we got last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is lygo hanford on top,</v>

1676
01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.810
<v Speaker 1>and lego livingston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the actual sound?</v>

1677
01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.090
<v Speaker 1>There is no actual sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They translate it into sound.</v>

1678
01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a gravitational wave that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1679
01:15:41.981 --> 01:15:46.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it were a sound wave instead of </v>

1680
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:46.981
<v Speaker 1>gravitational waves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how it would sound so confused.</v>

1681
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:50.880
<v Speaker 1>And I was watching a documentary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about hyper novas and </v>

1682
01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:58.351
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about the initial </v>

1683
01:15:58.351 --> 01:15:58.351
<v Speaker 1>discovery of hyper novis that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>detected this gamma radiation,</v>

1684
01:15:58.351 --> 01:16:02.620
<v Speaker 1>these bursts in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they originally had one working </v>

1685
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:06.530
<v Speaker 1>theory that there was some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alien war going on right now.</v>

1686
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like astronomers,</v>

1687
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 1>bless their hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are happy to at least contemplate.</v>

1688
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are way out speculations </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when pulse ours,</v>

1689
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:19.570
<v Speaker 1>which are just spinning neutron stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they were first detected,</v>

1690
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.330
<v Speaker 1>they were called lgm for little green </v>
<v Speaker 1>men because they were these very,</v>

1691
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:26.380
<v Speaker 1>very regular pulses and people say what </v>
<v Speaker 1>could it be alien?</v>

1692
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of not like one of those </v>

1693
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.800
<v Speaker 1>planets that we've observed recently had</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was orbiting it and they </v>

1694
01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.391
<v Speaker 1>were trying to figure out if it was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous space station that was causing </v>

1695
01:16:39.391 --> 01:16:39.400
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1696
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1697
01:16:39.841 --> 01:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a something that got labeled the</v>

1698
01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:47.671
<v Speaker 1>alien mega structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically like something that </v>

1699
01:16:47.671 --> 01:16:48.640
<v Speaker 1>is bigger and colder than you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect,</v>

1700
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:49.970
<v Speaker 1>but maybe if it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1701
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.110
<v Speaker 1>some structure surrounding a star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it would look like.</v>

1702
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And I wouldn't bet on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the reasonable.</v>

1703
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I read something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1704
01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:00.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want funding.</v>

1705
01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:02.980
<v Speaker 1>They just want to get people excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any funding for that.</v>

1706
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.200
<v Speaker 1>No anti get funding for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For really.</v>

1707
01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:07.270
<v Speaker 1>For an alien mega star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Because the people giving you funding or</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fellow scientists</v>

1709
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 3>taking cheap thrills rather than being </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>

1710
01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:18.071
<v Speaker 3>So what you Do is you get hits for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>website and you might not necessarily </v>

1711
01:17:18.071 --> 01:17:21.590
<v Speaker 3>like when you're going through some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these websites that science websites for</v>

1712
01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:26.420
<v Speaker 3>the most part really straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of titles to their articles.</v>

1713
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:29.300
<v Speaker 3>But occasionally you get a little click </v>
<v Speaker 3>baity oh yeah.</v>

1714
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:31.800
<v Speaker 3>With some stomaCh women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings,</v>

1715
01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:35.420
<v Speaker 3>they would like little more likes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their juice it up a little bit.</v>

1716
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Get people excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1717
01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when they first initially discovered </v>

1718
01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.580
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these gamma ray bursts and they thought </v>

1719
01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:49.030
<v Speaker 3>there was some sort of an alien war </v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

1720
01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 3>going on in space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1721
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1722
01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:55.130
<v Speaker 3>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

1723
01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So far there's no detectable evidence </v>

1724
01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.250
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever of anything out there other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than us.</v>

1725
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.110
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But wheN the thing,</v>

1726
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.730
<v Speaker 3>if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when an,</v>

1727
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 3>if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1728
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:10.390
<v Speaker 3>If the thing comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if one day we get some sort of </v>

1729
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 3>undeniable signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1730
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:15.200
<v Speaker 3>or we see something or how does that get</v>
<v Speaker 3>processed?</v>

1731
01:18:15.201 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Like do you have to go like straight to </v>
<v Speaker 3>president trump and go,</v>

1732
01:18:18.201 --> 01:18:20.060
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not do that.</v>

1733
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:25.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I would do is like saY </v>

1734
01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 3>if it was one of your colleagues</v>

1735
01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a procedure.</v>

1736
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not even very well publicized as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I know procedure or like a more </v>

1737
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:36.790
<v Speaker 2>self appointed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like,</v>

1738
01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:37.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have said,</v>

1739
01:18:37.991 --> 01:18:40.120
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are the alien detection network.</v>

1740
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:42.840
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to keep your mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut if you like.</v>

1741
01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:45.730
<v Speaker 2>People can't handle this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think it's,</v>

1742
01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're not very realistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>about these.</v>

1743
01:18:49.331 --> 01:18:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that it could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1744
01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:56.370
<v Speaker 2>but we're just like with quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics or artificial intelligence or </v>

1745
01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:00.571
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to put everything in the frame </v>

1746
01:19:00.571 --> 01:19:00.760
<v Speaker 2>of what we're immediately used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1747
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.360
<v Speaker 2>So we can redeem out radio signals into </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1748
01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.920
<v Speaker 2>We're really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1749
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:10.540
<v Speaker 2>So we tend to think that aliens will </v>
<v Speaker 2>either be discovered or actually contact</v>

1750
01:19:10.541 --> 01:19:15.541
<v Speaker 2>us by beaming radio signals and us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a hOrrendously wasteful way </v>

1751
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:17.680
<v Speaker 2>to do interstellar communication.</v>

1752
01:19:17.730 --> 01:19:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For one thing,</v>

1753
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.460
<v Speaker 2>radio waves move at the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you're a thousand light years</v>

1754
01:19:24.461 --> 01:19:29.461
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea what's going on on </v>

1755
01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:29.461
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you say,</v>

1756
01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:29.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

1757
01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:31.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a promising location for life to </v>
<v Speaker 2>arise.</v>

1758
01:19:31.241 --> 01:19:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I know wHat I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll beam a signal at them.</v>

1759
01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long are you going to be mad?</v>

1760
01:19:34.931 --> 01:19:36.970
<v Speaker 2>You're going to turn the telescope on </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a month.</v>

1761
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Then in the whole history of humankind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they better be listening the exact right</v>

1762
01:19:40.931 --> 01:19:42.280
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they're not going to hear it.</v>

1763
01:19:42.730 --> 01:19:47.730
<v Speaker 2>It's actually way more efficient to send</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spacecraft eVen though it's much </v>

1764
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:48.010
<v Speaker 2>slower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1765
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:53.360
<v Speaker 2>You have plenty of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Send a space craft and park it in the </v>

1766
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.181
<v Speaker 2>system that you want to know about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then wait for life to arise in that </v>

1767
01:19:57.181 --> 01:19:57.970
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So honestly,</v>

1768
01:19:57.971 --> 01:20:00.130
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to detect evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens,</v>

1769
01:20:00.131 --> 01:20:05.131
<v Speaker 2>it's much more likely we're gonna find a</v>
<v Speaker 2>monolith on the moon or something like </v>

1770
01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:07.951
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we're going to hear them in our </v>

1771
01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:07.951
<v Speaker 2>telescopes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A monolith.</v>

1772
01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:08.090
<v Speaker 2>The moon wasn't</v>

1773
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 3>that 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1774
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:14.780
<v Speaker 3>But wasn't that something that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the astronauts said they saw </v>

1775
01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.560
<v Speaker 3>something up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of those astronauts have lost their</v>

1776
01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:18.810
<v Speaker 3>mind as they got older and I've always </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondered,</v>

1777
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:24.230
<v Speaker 3>like edgar mitchell's the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the one who says he's seen some </v>

1778
01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 3>things that aliens are real and I always</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder,</v>

1779
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:30.330
<v Speaker 3>are those guys getting crazy as they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>older or they're going,</v>

1780
01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:31.500
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get some money.</v>

1781
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I need some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some attention.</v>

1782
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:36.390
<v Speaker 3>What's the best way to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened to that alien market.</v>

1783
01:20:36.391 --> 01:20:39.390
<v Speaker 3>That alien market's a big market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could be perfectly sincere,</v>

1784
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:44.391
<v Speaker 3>but look the way you want when you pick </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be an astronaut is </v>

1785
01:20:44.391 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 3>someone who can fly the spacecraft bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1786
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:49.910
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to have good judgment </v>
<v Speaker 3>about whether or not they're aliens up </v>

1787
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.910
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what you're goIng for.</v>

1788
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just need to have an understanding </v>

1789
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 3>of what the task is and how they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna perform it.</v>

1790
01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Edgar miTchell was a he.</v>

1791
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I think he might've passed away </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

1792
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Did he pass away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's one of those guys that people </v>

1793
01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.330
<v Speaker 3>always bring up when I'm not a believer </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily in.</v>

1794
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm not a believer in alien </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1795
01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not believer in anY of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that say they've seen aliens.</v>

1796
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:18.471
<v Speaker 3>Are you juSt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a show for psi phi and one of the </v>

1797
01:21:18.471 --> 01:21:23.031
<v Speaker 3>episodes we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we spent weeks talking to people that </v>

1798
01:21:23.031 --> 01:21:25.080
<v Speaker 3>are ufo researchers and studying the air</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote evidence,</v>

1799
01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing there like be a good</v>

1800
01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 3>basie and if someone sees some flashing </v>
<v Speaker 3>lights in the sky,</v>

1801
01:21:30.931 --> 01:21:35.190
<v Speaker 3>what is more likely alien civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>or they're not accurately reporting what</v>

1802
01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:37.350
<v Speaker 3>they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like eye witness testimony is terrible,</v>

1803
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:39.360
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible in this specialty,</v>

1804
01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:40.890
<v Speaker 3>in these weird cases.</v>

1805
01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IT's just very,</v>

1806
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 3>very dismissible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1807
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want to keep an open mind </v>

1808
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.331
<v Speaker 3>because if there was a unique event </v>
<v Speaker 3>where an alien spacecraft did enter our </v>

1809
01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:53.370
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere and observe us and then take </v>
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>

1810
01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:57.060
<v Speaker 3>it would be quite fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could actually get a good read on</v>

1811
01:21:57.061 --> 01:22:02.061
<v Speaker 3>some more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be hugely important to the </v>

1812
01:22:02.061 --> 01:22:02.061
<v Speaker 3>history of life on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1813
01:22:02.061 --> 01:22:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Like human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we won,</v>

1814
01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.680
<v Speaker 3>if and when we finally discover </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent life out there somewhere </v>

1815
01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.261
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will be one of the most important </v>

1816
01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:12.261
<v Speaker 3>events in our history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that it's a,</v>

1817
01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 20 foot long flying saucer that comes </v>

1818
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.810
<v Speaker 3>and visits you in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Wyoming is not very plausible.</v>

1819
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:22.260
<v Speaker 3>well also the idea of physical beings on</v>
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

1820
01:22:22.261 --> 01:22:25.090
<v Speaker 3>this thing seems counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>

1821
01:22:25.091 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we don't have to do that anymore.</v>

1822
01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Like we send the mars rover up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get amazing footage.</v>

1823
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:32.850
<v Speaker 3>It stays up there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need food.</v>

1824
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what they'll do.</v>

1825
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:35.880
<v Speaker 3>They'll send a rover here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a.</v>

1826
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Not a either a person or a radio wave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would imagine.</v>

1827
01:22:39.931 --> 01:22:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I don't know what the fuck I'm</v>

1828
01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:44.490
<v Speaker 3>parked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're getting mad right now,</v>

1829
01:22:44.491 --> 01:22:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I get rid of the aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

1830
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:51.381
<v Speaker 3>I would just assume that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>some super complicated drone and what </v>

1831
01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.470
<v Speaker 3>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1832
01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:55.230
<v Speaker 3>they would try to just take data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>observe,</v>

1833
01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:00.260
<v Speaker 3>maybe get some sort of a visual </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding and obviously with the </v>

1834
01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:03.681
<v Speaker 3>kind of telescopes that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the [inaudible] eight when they </v>

1835
01:23:03.681 --> 01:23:04.350
<v Speaker 3>were 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles out,</v>

1836
01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:09.351
<v Speaker 3>we take these incredible high resolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>detailed video and photographs of the </v>

1837
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 3>earth itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of shit to the aliens.</v>

1838
01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 3>they probably don't need to get anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>near us.</v>

1839
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that</v>

1841
01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.270
<v Speaker 2>weird thing is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1842
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:21.270
<v Speaker 2>the fermi paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should be here already,</v>

1843
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:26.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the solar system should be buzzing </v>

1844
01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:28.431
<v Speaker 2>with these drones and either a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well almost certainly it's not because </v>

1845
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:32.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear why they would try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hide from us really.</v>

1846
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:34.620
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't try to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be easily noticeable.</v>

1847
01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:39.570
<v Speaker 2>So there's something we don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>about life in the universe either.</v>

1848
01:23:39.571 --> 01:23:44.571
<v Speaker 2>it's much more rare than we might guess </v>
<v Speaker 2>or for some reason it's not very </v>

1849
01:23:44.571 --> 01:23:47.100
<v Speaker 2>gregarious that doesn't go and visit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the stars in the galaxy.</v>

1850
01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:53.340
<v Speaker 3>My thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a obviously a very </v>

1851
01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 3>controversial thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one wants to think that we're the</v>

1852
01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:57.650
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1853
01:23:57.670 --> 01:23:58.420
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1854
01:23:58.421 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 3>if there's us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's probably more right,</v>

1855
01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 3>maybe right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it has to happen once.</v>

1856
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Some it has to happen for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere,</v>

1857
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:10.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this,</v>

1858
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:15.330
<v Speaker 3>like a single celled organism had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a multicell organism and had to </v>

1859
01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:18.970
<v Speaker 3>take place through mutation and it had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take place at one point in time.</v>

1860
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Will that time on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it was the first time was one,</v>

1861
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.360
<v Speaker 3>one point eight mil billions of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1862
01:24:25.361 --> 01:24:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we have this?</v>

1863
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:33.510
<v Speaker 3>We know that we are the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ever done that as far as we know </v>

1864
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:37.411
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why would we assume that anything </v>

1865
01:24:37.411 --> 01:24:37.411
<v Speaker 3>else that we might be the tip of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spear?</v>

1866
01:24:37.411 --> 01:24:38.680
<v Speaker 2>It's completely possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1867
01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:42.580
<v Speaker 2>and it's also possible that we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That life happens all the time,</v>

1868
01:24:42.581 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 2>but it never becomes multicellular or </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>

1869
01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Mm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1870
01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Or becomes intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never build spaceships.</v>

1871
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 2>There's many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways it could happen,</v>

1872
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:54.421
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could be in the entire observable </v>

1873
01:24:54.421 --> 01:24:57.001
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only spaceship building species </v>

1874
01:24:57.001 --> 01:24:57.001
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1875
01:24:57.001 --> 01:24:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also have this weird way of defining </v>

1876
01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:00.370
<v Speaker 3>intelligence by the ability to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>your atmosphere,</v>

1877
01:25:00.371 --> 01:25:02.110
<v Speaker 3>your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or your to,</v>

1878
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:04.030
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to build things like,</v>

1879
01:25:04.031 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that's what we think of as intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas dolphins are obviously extremely</v>

1880
01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:12.331
<v Speaker 3>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really impact their </v>

1881
01:25:12.331 --> 01:25:12.790
<v Speaker 3>environment much at all other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological life,</v>

1882
01:25:12.791 --> 01:25:15.610
<v Speaker 3>like eating things and waste and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>

1883
01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:17.110
<v Speaker 3>But they don't build structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

1884
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:18.980
<v Speaker 2>they don't keep records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

1885
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.470
<v Speaker 2>And we live in a weird planet that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly,</v>

1886
01:25:21.471 --> 01:25:26.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comparable proportion of land to </v>

1887
01:25:26.471 --> 01:25:26.471
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1888
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Be very easy to imagine planets that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were all ocean that,</v>

1889
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:33.380
<v Speaker 2>that the dolphins were the apex </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators and that was right.</v>

1890
01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.400
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1891
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:37.220
<v Speaker 2>just got really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at eating fish.</v>

1892
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.580
<v Speaker 2>They played games and whistled songs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>

1894
01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well also the idea that life only has to</v>

1895
01:25:44.931 --> 01:25:47.540
<v Speaker 2>exist in this goldilocks zone has always</v>
<v Speaker 2>been weird to me.</v>

1896
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1897
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:49.220
<v Speaker 2>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1898
01:25:49.221 --> 01:25:54.221
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that we're already finding </v>

1899
01:25:54.221 --> 01:25:54.221
<v Speaker 2>exceptions to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1900
01:25:54.221 --> 01:25:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Like even here in the solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1901
01:25:54.951 --> 01:25:57.890
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't necessarily look to earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>first if you didn't already know,</v>

1902
01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:01.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moons of jupiter and saturn are very</v>

1903
01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.710
<v Speaker 2>plausible places to look for the of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1904
01:26:03.711 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>even though</v>

1905
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.530
<v Speaker 1>they're outside the goldilocks zone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just different conditions.</v>

1906
01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:11.531
<v Speaker 1>So I think we should be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very open minded about the conditions </v>

1907
01:26:11.531 --> 01:26:11.800
<v Speaker 1>around other stars where life could </v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

1908
01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we find weird life at the bottom </v>

1909
01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 1>of oceans and volcanic events insanely </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>

1910
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:22.400
<v Speaker 1>And they find these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these life forms that are able to thrive</v>

1911
01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:25.730
<v Speaker 1>in those conditions that would kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything else.</v>

1912
01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:26:26.561 --> 01:26:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is,</v>

1914
01:26:27.561 --> 01:26:28.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1915
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that the response to that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1916
01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:34.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life started in fairly benign conditions</v>

1917
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>and then evolved to survive in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsher conditions.</v>

1918
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:41.561
<v Speaker 1>But I just think that our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand chemistry and biology is not </v>

1919
01:26:41.561 --> 01:26:45.101
<v Speaker 1>that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially hypothetical speculative </v>

1920
01:26:45.101 --> 01:26:47.831
<v Speaker 1>chemistry and biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be very humble about saying </v>

1921
01:26:47.831 --> 01:26:48.010
<v Speaker 1>how life needs to be on other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1922
01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:53.040
<v Speaker 1>We always assume that it has to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and it has to get carbon based </v>

1923
01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:53.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's right,</v>

1924
01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 1>but we can't say that we know.</v>

1925
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever go through a period in life</v>

1926
01:26:56.271 --> 01:26:59.090
<v Speaker 1>where you were obsessed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are fascinated by aliens?</v>

1927
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

1928
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:03.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly not only aliens,</v>

1929
01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 1>but psychic powers and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>

1930
01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:07.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1931
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.760
<v Speaker 1>interested in all the cool stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>became more and more scientific as I </v>

1932
01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.201
<v Speaker 1>aged and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are weird things that are somehow </v>

1933
01:27:17.201 --> 01:27:18.070
<v Speaker 1>or another linked together because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1934
01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be mean in saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're bullshit.</v>

1935
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:26.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the psychic powers are aliens and </v>

1936
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.060
<v Speaker 1>when you bring up the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very likely these things are bullshit.</v>

1937
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:34.270
<v Speaker 1>People get very upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're taking away their santa </v>

1938
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.700
<v Speaker 1>claus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1939
01:27:34.701 --> 01:27:38.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a video I saw literally this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning on the web of the.</v>

1940
01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:43.871
<v Speaker 1>These people stood outside a little mark</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the corner of a street in New York </v>

1941
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:47.240
<v Speaker 1>where people were buying power ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets.</v>

1942
01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people buy powerball tickets and it's</v>

1943
01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:53.300
<v Speaker 1>like 10 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they come out and they were offered,</v>

1944
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:58.510
<v Speaker 1>can I buy your power ball ticket from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for $20 for twice what you paid for </v>

1945
01:27:58.510 --> 01:28:00.560
<v Speaker 1>it and 11 out of the 14 people that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1946
01:28:00.561 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding onto my ticket.</v>

1947
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they thought that this ticket </v>

1948
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.270
<v Speaker 1>was the winter and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is $700,000,000</v>

1949
01:28:08.271 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 1>that I'd be given you for $20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1950
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:12.920
<v Speaker 1>With no rational justification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

1951
01:28:12.921 --> 01:28:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1952
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.760
<v Speaker 1>it's in some sense innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just.</v>

1953
01:28:16.761 --> 01:28:21.761
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wishful thinking about your own </v>

1954
01:28:21.761 --> 01:28:21.761
<v Speaker 1>little ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1955
01:28:21.761 --> 01:28:23.440
<v Speaker 1>But it leads us to be not completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational and planning our futures.</v>

1956
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with the people that won't take the </v>

1957
01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:28.450
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a role it come on?</v>

1958
01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might go in and buy two more </v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets yet with the 20 would just be 20</v>

1959
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.320
<v Speaker 1>and it would just be $20.</v>

1960
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Now you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might have in your possession </v>

1961
01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you might the ticket or it might be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next one.</v>

1962
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.050
<v Speaker 1>But what if you give it to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them the ticket,</v>

1963
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you get to 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go buy some users tickets.</v>

1964
01:28:44.031 --> 01:28:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And turns out the ticket you gave them </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 700 million bucks.</v>

1965
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:50.250
<v Speaker 1>You've got to jump off a roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what if the one you buy is the worst</v>

1966
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:55.390
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that when you're a glass half </v>

1967
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.390
<v Speaker 1>full kind of guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't you?</v>

1968
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:56.050
<v Speaker 1>The probabilities work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1969
01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:01.060
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the number is going </v>

1970
01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:01.060
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1971
01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.080
<v Speaker 1>But that the randomness of it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what gets people like</v>

1972
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.910
<v Speaker 3>panicky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1973
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if it could be,</v>

1974
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to,</v>

1975
01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:08.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1976
01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.450
<v Speaker 2>calibrate your odds of winning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerball or saying,</v>

1977
01:29:11.451 --> 01:29:13.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just play the numbers.</v>

1978
01:29:13.371 --> 01:29:14.030
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1979
01:29:14.031 --> 01:29:14.720
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1980
01:29:14.721 --> 01:29:15.530
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>

1981
01:29:15.531 --> 01:29:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's never going to come up.</v>

1982
01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:19.450
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the probability of that kind of</v>

1983
01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.010
<v Speaker 2>is the same as any other one that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to pick.</v>

1984
01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter what it was.</v>

1985
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Just random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1986
01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 3>have you ever read anything compelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all that leads you to think that </v>

1987
01:29:32.681 --> 01:29:37.681
<v Speaker 3>maybe somebody might have observed </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that could potentially have </v>

1988
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:39.070
<v Speaker 3>been something from another planet or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of.</v>

1989
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1990
01:29:40.771 --> 01:29:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that a astronomers do have a set</v>

1991
01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:45.390
<v Speaker 2>of things that they don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

1992
01:29:45.391 --> 01:29:48.330
<v Speaker 2>The most recent example are these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>called fast radio bursts,</v>

1993
01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.130
<v Speaker 2>which are a little bit different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gamma burst,</v>

1994
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:52.160
<v Speaker 2>gamma ray bursts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1995
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.420
<v Speaker 2>as always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we think about it,</v>

1996
01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:55.170
<v Speaker 2>the more we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1997
01:29:55.171 --> 01:30:00.171
<v Speaker 2>actually I can come up with a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>plausible explanation for that is </v>

1998
01:30:00.171 --> 01:30:01.980
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going back to this sort of uploading</v>

1999
01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:06.981
<v Speaker 2>consciousness thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a very real possibility that </v>

2000
01:30:06.981 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 2>once civilizations or intelligence pcs </v>
<v Speaker 2>become sufficiently advanced,</v>

2001
01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.640
<v Speaker 2>they upload themselves and they realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not really any motivation to go </v>

2002
01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.280
<v Speaker 2>exploring the universe and maybe die </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2003
01:30:14.530 --> 01:30:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what my thought would be,</v>

2004
01:30:16.571 --> 01:30:20.260
<v Speaker 3>that once civilizations get sufficiently</v>
<v Speaker 3>advanced,</v>

2005
01:30:20.261 --> 01:30:25.261
<v Speaker 3>they would go per virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would figure out a way to create </v>

2006
01:30:25.261 --> 01:30:28.360
<v Speaker 3>these artificial universes to travel </v>
<v Speaker 3>into that are probably just as complex,</v>

2007
01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:34.170
<v Speaker 3>if not more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have every right to imagine </v>

2008
01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:34.170
<v Speaker 3>that given them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2009
01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:34.690
<v Speaker 3>so little about what it would be about </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2010
01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:39.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we can create artificial </v>

2011
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:39.691
<v Speaker 3>intelligence to that is the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre.</v>

2012
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:43.861
<v Speaker 3>It's like if we can create artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and somehow or another </v>

2013
01:30:43.861 --> 01:30:47.431
<v Speaker 3>corral it into existing only in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual world that we've created,</v>

2014
01:30:48.190 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 3>and then inside this virtual world </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're interacting with these </v>

2015
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:54.160
<v Speaker 3>artificially intelligent creatures that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are disembodied,</v>

2016
01:30:54.161 --> 01:30:59.161
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then in this world you would give </v>

2017
01:30:59.161 --> 01:30:59.161
<v Speaker 3>them some sort of a body and you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with them.</v>

2018
01:30:59.270 --> 01:31:01.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that we under appreciate about</v>

2019
01:31:01.881 --> 01:31:06.881
<v Speaker 2>that is what is the motivation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these artificially intelligent entities </v>

2020
01:31:07.641 --> 01:31:10.070
<v Speaker 2>would have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we human beings like it or not,</v>

2021
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:12.320
<v Speaker 2>we get hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't have sex,</v>

2022
01:31:12.321 --> 01:31:17.321
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have power or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like if you're just a virtual being </v>

2023
01:31:17.321 --> 01:31:21.191
<v Speaker 2>in an environment without these </v>
<v Speaker 2>energetic constraints or a need to eat </v>

2024
01:31:21.191 --> 01:31:23.450
<v Speaker 2>and sleep and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you do anything at all?</v>

2025
01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2026
01:31:24.411 --> 01:31:26.810
<v Speaker 2>why would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what the psychology would</v>

2027
01:31:26.811 --> 01:31:28.010
<v Speaker 2>be like for something like that.</v>

2028
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Did you see x mokena?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

2029
01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.950
<v Speaker 3>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an amazing movie.</v>

2030
01:31:33.951 --> 01:31:36.860
<v Speaker 3>I saw it twice actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw three times.</v>

2031
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:38.810
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2032
01:31:38.811 --> 01:31:43.811
<v Speaker 3>it is a very balanced take on potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and someone </v>

2033
01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.760
<v Speaker 3>making it as you can see it really well </v>
<v Speaker 3>made movie,</v>

2034
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:51.970
<v Speaker 3>but you see the story that was sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to give away too much of </v>

2035
01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:54.050
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you see the struggle in these things</v>

2036
01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:59.051
<v Speaker 3>as this guy is interacting with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you see the struggle as </v>

2037
01:31:59.051 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 3>they're to</v>

2038
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 1>interpret what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right versus what he is.</v>

2039
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.290
<v Speaker 1>But they are in bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2040
01:32:05.291 --> 01:32:05.960
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2041
01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2042
01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2043
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Gotta wonder like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2044
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 1>elon musk is terrified of this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2045
01:32:12.431 --> 01:32:17.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that we might be summoning the </v>

2046
01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:17.431
<v Speaker 1>demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his exact quote.</v>

2047
01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:17.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2048
01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And I get a trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to agree with him.</v>

2049
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2050
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 1>to get in trouble on twitter for saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I agree with him,</v>

2051
01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:28.261
<v Speaker 1>but because people who are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing artificial intelligence have this </v>

2052
01:32:28.261 --> 01:32:33.120
<v Speaker 1>very real appreciation for how far away </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are from something that you would </v>

2053
01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120
<v Speaker 1>classify as intelligent in any real </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

2054
01:32:34.121 --> 01:32:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And so therefore from their day to day </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

2055
01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:42.190
<v Speaker 1>the worry about superintelligent ai is </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking over the world is laughable.</v>

2056
01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.180
<v Speaker 1>But my argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think Illinois is that,</v>

2057
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:50.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is the percentage chance have </v>

2058
01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:50.400
<v Speaker 1>to be that this is going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you start worrying about it,</v>

2059
01:32:50.401 --> 01:32:51.850
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the consequences,</v>

2060
01:32:51.851 --> 01:32:54.170
<v Speaker 1>really the ruination of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2061
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:59.400
<v Speaker 1>There are only so many things that we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>for which the worst case scenario is </v>

2062
01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:03.991
<v Speaker 1>quite that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it a special </v>

2063
01:33:03.991 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 1>circumstance and it might be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely,</v>

2064
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.120
<v Speaker 1>but are you willing to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2065
01:33:07.121 --> 01:33:10.420
<v Speaker 1>one percent chance that all human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed?</v>

2066
01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the worry,</v>

2067
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:15.550
<v Speaker 1>but we should just do our due diligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2068
01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:18.070
<v Speaker 1>We should think about what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities are.</v>

2069
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:21.040
<v Speaker 1>We should plan for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably no big deal.</v>

2070
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:23.650
<v Speaker 1>When I said this on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people knowing that I was a physicist,</v>

2071
01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:24.730
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2072
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:29.790
<v Speaker 1>what did you think about people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried that the large hadron collider </v>

2073
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 1>was gonna destroy the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2074
01:33:29.801 --> 01:33:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2075
01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:31.570
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physicists did many,</v>

2076
01:33:31.571 --> 01:33:34.480
<v Speaker 1>many studies checking to see whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not it would destroy the world.</v>

2077
01:33:34.481 --> 01:33:39.481
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to be destroyed anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anybody else and so I think that's </v>

2078
01:33:39.481 --> 01:33:39.580
<v Speaker 1>a very sensible thing to do for </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence also.</v>

2079
01:33:40.150 --> 01:33:40.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2080
01:33:41.010 --> 01:33:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It just when you see articles like did </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the recent article or the google</v>

2081
01:33:45.671 --> 01:33:50.671
<v Speaker 1>ai that they had to shut down because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were starting to communicate which </v>

2082
01:33:50.671 --> 01:33:54.480
<v Speaker 1>with each other they invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That language was not very convincing.</v>

2083
01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:56.140
<v Speaker 1>If you ever saw it printed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2084
01:33:56.141 --> 01:34:01.141
<v Speaker 1>But to me that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a scene in a horror movie </v>

2085
01:34:01.141 --> 01:34:03.010
<v Speaker 1>where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go to 10 know blank screen.</v>

2086
01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Ten years later we're all dressed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad max.</v>

2087
01:34:06.431 --> 01:34:07.380
<v Speaker 1>We fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2088
01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:10.810
<v Speaker 1>bandannas over our face and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running from terminator bots.</v>

2089
01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know again,</v>

2090
01:34:12.401 --> 01:34:17.401
<v Speaker 1>and again we're coming to this theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our imaginations are not quite up </v>

2091
01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:20.731
<v Speaker 1>to the task because our imaginations </v>
<v Speaker 1>about superintelligent ai or something </v>

2092
01:34:20.731 --> 01:34:24.301
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SomeThing frankensteined ask it just in </v>

2093
01:34:24.301 --> 01:34:27.121
<v Speaker 1>robots or something like out of asimov,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the I think much more realistic </v>

2094
01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:32.731
<v Speaker 1>worry or things like currently existing </v>
<v Speaker 1>neural networks and deep learning </v>

2095
01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:37.921
<v Speaker 1>algorithms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically there's all sorts of </v>

2096
01:34:37.921 --> 01:34:38.650
<v Speaker 1>problems like pattern recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facial recognition,</v>

2097
01:34:38.651 --> 01:34:40.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are very,</v>

2098
01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:44.200
<v Speaker 1>very bad at sitting down and writing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>program that recognizes faces.</v>

2099
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are not very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to do that,</v>

2100
01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:52.020
<v Speaker 1>but we have ways of building programs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can teach themselves to recognize </v>

2101
01:34:52.661 --> 01:34:57.661
<v Speaker 1>faces and they're amazingly good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have programs like when you onto </v>

2102
01:34:57.661 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>google or your</v>

2103
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:02.840
<v Speaker 2>itunes or whatever and you know your ifo</v>
<v Speaker 2>is recognizing your face.</v>

2104
01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:08.380
<v Speaker 2>There is some neural net that is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and there is no human being alive </v>

2105
01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:12.431
<v Speaker 2>that understands what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All we know is that it's getting the </v>

2106
01:35:12.431 --> 01:35:12.431
<v Speaker 2>right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2107
01:35:12.431 --> 01:35:16.040
<v Speaker 2>And that can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of logic can go very,</v>

2108
01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:21.041
<v Speaker 2>very far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm not worried about like a </v>

2109
01:35:21.041 --> 01:35:23.861
<v Speaker 2>robot like ultron taking over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about are all of our </v>

2110
01:35:23.861 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure being run by programs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that no human being understands.</v>

2111
01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:27.900
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2112
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something I hadn't even </v>

2113
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 3>considered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2114
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:34.580
<v Speaker 3>that's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real issue,</v>

2115
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:36.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an actual real thing.</v>

2116
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered whether or not what</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are doing with our insane </v>

2117
01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:46.721
<v Speaker 3>lust to innovate and to constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>create new and more spectacular things </v>

2118
01:35:46.721 --> 01:35:49.310
<v Speaker 3>and to always look for the next version </v>
<v Speaker 3>of something.</v>

2119
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.340
<v Speaker 3>We're not satisfied with the iphone six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want the iphone seven.</v>

2120
01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 3>That's not a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wednesday the eight come out.</v>

2121
01:35:54.630 --> 01:35:57.800
<v Speaker 3>We always have this intense desire for </v>
<v Speaker 3>better things.</v>

2122
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:58.970
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2123
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:02.410
<v Speaker 3>unless you're a classic car advocate or </v>
<v Speaker 3>add a devote,</v>

2124
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:04.460
<v Speaker 3>we really what you want is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2125
01:36:04.461 --> 01:36:07.360
<v Speaker 3>this new car stops faster at handles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

2126
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:12.820
<v Speaker 3>accelerates quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We always want things to constantly </v>

2127
01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:15.080
<v Speaker 3>improve and I've always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at human beings,</v>

2128
01:36:15.081 --> 01:36:20.081
<v Speaker 3>like if you looked at us subjectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the main things that we </v>

2129
01:36:20.081 --> 01:36:20.081
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2130
01:36:20.081 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we produce better technology,</v>

2131
01:36:21.891 --> 01:36:24.320
<v Speaker 3>better objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better engineering.</v>

2132
01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:29.321
<v Speaker 3>It's like constantly improving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerating and then there's this </v>

2133
01:36:29.321 --> 01:36:33.191
<v Speaker 3>potential artificial intelligence thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered if that's really </v>

2134
01:36:33.191 --> 01:36:37.031
<v Speaker 3>what our focus or what our purpose is on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this planet that were like some sort of </v>

2135
01:36:37.311 --> 01:36:42.311
<v Speaker 3>an electronic caterpillar there going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>become a butterfly that we recognized </v>

2136
01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:47.570
<v Speaker 3>and some sort of a weird way or nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizes the biological limitations of</v>

2137
01:36:47.571 --> 01:36:52.571
<v Speaker 3>flesh and tissue and that it can advance</v>
<v Speaker 3>far better with something that we create</v>

2138
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:58.390
<v Speaker 3>so that we don't even realize what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing by making this cocoon that we're </v>

2139
01:36:58.390 --> 01:37:01.781
<v Speaker 3>just building it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>building enough and we're not even </v>

2140
01:37:01.781 --> 01:37:01.781
<v Speaker 3>thinking about what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just,</v>

2141
01:37:01.781 --> 01:37:01.820
<v Speaker 3>I want a new laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woo,</v>

2142
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.110
<v Speaker 3>and by buying this and buy this </v>
<v Speaker 3>materialism that we all have,</v>

2143
01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:07.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have with this,</v>

2144
01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.520
<v Speaker 3>people have this innate sort of desire </v>
<v Speaker 3>for new and shiny objects that that is </v>

2145
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:18.310
<v Speaker 3>fueling this innovation and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing along this and that one day </v>

2146
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:20.720
<v Speaker 3>we're going to give birth to this new </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of life.</v>

2147
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:24.140
<v Speaker 3>We can call it artificial life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not artificial.</v>

2148
01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.710
<v Speaker 3>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just created by human beings,</v>

2149
01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:32.860
<v Speaker 3>which obviously are created by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>intense and very long evolutionary </v>

2150
01:37:33.261 --> 01:37:38.261
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this might be a part of that </v>

2151
01:37:38.261 --> 01:37:38.261
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

2152
01:37:38.261 --> 01:37:38.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would,</v>

2153
01:37:38.261 --> 01:37:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I would tend to want to remove from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of anthropomorphic are </v>

2154
01:37:42.611 --> 01:37:47.611
<v Speaker 2>teleological aspects of the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that it's a purpose or were meant </v>

2155
01:37:47.611 --> 01:37:51.480
<v Speaker 2>to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I completely agree with the idea </v>

2156
01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.120
<v Speaker 2>that there's a threshold that has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossed,</v>

2157
01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 2>whether you want to say it's the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years or the last 10,000</v>

2158
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2159
01:37:56.850 --> 01:38:01.850
<v Speaker 2>they're human beings have developed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to do something that has never </v>

2160
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:06.141
<v Speaker 2>been done before and that has this sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of recursive self reflective thing that </v>

2161
01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:11.871
<v Speaker 2>we can build things that can build </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and we can build things that can </v>

2162
01:38:11.871 --> 01:38:12.180
<v Speaker 2>learn and we can build things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like living things.</v>

2163
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:17.480
<v Speaker 2>And we are just at the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very beginning of exploring the space of</v>

2164
01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:22.611
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that we human beings are </v>

2165
01:38:22.611 --> 01:38:25.890
<v Speaker 2>going to be around 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years to enjoy the fruits of that.</v>

2166
01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea whether that's true or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2167
01:38:28.501 --> 01:38:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2168
01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:35.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe it'll still be human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 100 years from now we'll cure </v>

2169
01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.710
<v Speaker 2>death and aging and we'll stop having </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and the people who are alive a </v>

2170
01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:41.370
<v Speaker 2>hundred years from now will different </v>
<v Speaker 2>other million years.</v>

2171
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe human beings will just become more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more,</v>

2172
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:50.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>melded with artificial things and </v>

2173
01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:50.820
<v Speaker 2>they'll have artificial bodies and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

2174
01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2175
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.980
<v Speaker 2>one another under appreciated thing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is that at the very,</v>

2176
01:38:55.981 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 2>very small scale where we do like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nanotechnology and so forth,</v>

2177
01:39:00.090 --> 01:39:04.830
<v Speaker 2>there is a whole bunch of problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have already been solved at that scale.</v>

2178
01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Namely biology cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2179
01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Like cells do many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things really,</v>

2180
01:39:10.171 --> 01:39:12.540
<v Speaker 2>really well and they also repair </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2181
01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:16.230
<v Speaker 2>They're much less brittle than things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we build using metal.</v>

2182
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So synthetic biology,</v>

2183
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:23.160
<v Speaker 2>just programming existing biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms or designing new ones,</v>

2184
01:39:23.161 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 2>but we would still recognize them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>

2185
01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:31.130
<v Speaker 2>but it might be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different than anything that </v>

2186
01:39:31.130 --> 01:39:31.740
<v Speaker 2>naturally appeared through the course of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution so far.</v>

2187
01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:34.860
<v Speaker 2>That could be the thing that takes off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 100 years from now,</v>

2188
01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:39.861
<v Speaker 2>that's all the living beings or all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings with higher intelligence left on </v>

2189
01:39:39.861 --> 01:39:39.861
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2190
01:39:39.861 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the actual thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to happen is,</v>

2191
01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.170
<v Speaker 2>but what I know is that the pace of </v>
<v Speaker 2>change is just accelerating.</v>

2192
01:39:46.171 --> 01:39:47.660
<v Speaker 2>We're just at the very start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2193
01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:49.020
<v Speaker 2>we really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2194
01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:54.050
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you ever sit around and try to </v>

2195
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:56.691
<v Speaker 2>extrapolate and trying to like look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we are now as opposed to where we </v>

2196
01:39:56.691 --> 01:40:00.591
<v Speaker 2>were at the turn of the century and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century and just thinking like </v>

2197
01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:03.250
<v Speaker 2>where is this going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>

2198
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:08.330
<v Speaker 2>it seems like any day now some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>invention can be put forth that changes </v>

2199
01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:11.760
<v Speaker 2>the way we interface with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2200
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:15.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's subtle because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniform,</v>

2201
01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's a weird fact if you </v>

2202
01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.080
<v Speaker 2>wanted to make a movie and set it 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

2203
01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the 19 sixties it wouldn't be that</v>

2204
01:40:25.111 --> 01:40:28.800
<v Speaker 2>hard to film outside and in certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas,</v>

2205
01:40:28.801 --> 01:40:33.801
<v Speaker 2>certain suburbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of looks more or less like look </v>

2206
01:40:33.801 --> 01:40:33.801
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it's actually,</v>

2207
01:40:33.801 --> 01:40:38.571
<v Speaker 2>it would be harder to make something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was in the 19 sixties look like it </v>

2208
01:40:38.571 --> 01:40:39.150
<v Speaker 2>did the 1910.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

2209
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:44.151
<v Speaker 2>There's sort of more obvious visible </v>
<v Speaker 2>change just because cars were different </v>

2210
01:40:44.151 --> 01:40:48.501
<v Speaker 2>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't see the sort of </v>

2211
01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:50.430
<v Speaker 2>technological change that might be have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a far bigger impact,</v>

2212
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:55.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in electronics and artificial </v>

2213
01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:55.460
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and so forth had happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the</v>

2214
01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:56.040
<v Speaker 3>last 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So jessica,</v>

2215
01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:01.060
<v Speaker 3>there's no visible sign of the change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean that the changes cannot be </v>

2216
01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:04.681
<v Speaker 3>eventually a very profound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always amazing to when you look </v>

2217
01:41:04.681 --> 01:41:07.951
<v Speaker 3>back and like science fiction movies </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the eighties where they were </v>

2218
01:41:07.951 --> 01:41:08.180
<v Speaker 3>predicting 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2219
01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:13.360
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought we were going to be flying </v>

2220
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:13.360
<v Speaker 3>around in space constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2221
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.850
<v Speaker 3>like the movie alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year was that supposed to be?</v>

2222
01:41:15.851 --> 01:41:19.320
<v Speaker 3>I think that's like the year $2,100</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

2223
01:41:19.321 --> 01:41:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that far,</v>

2224
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:25.790
<v Speaker 3>but what we're really good at is taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that already exist and </v>

2225
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.790
<v Speaker 3>extrapolating it to be faster and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>

2226
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you can build an airplane,</v>

2227
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:30.220
<v Speaker 3>then you can build a rocket ship and </v>
<v Speaker 3>arbitrarily fast.</v>

2228
01:41:30.221 --> 01:41:33.850
<v Speaker 3>That's easy to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But things that change culture,</v>

2229
01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:38.851
<v Speaker 3>like really curing aging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hard to imagine what that would </v>

2230
01:41:38.851 --> 01:41:43.261
<v Speaker 3>be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also greedy because like where are </v>

2231
01:41:43.261 --> 01:41:43.261
<v Speaker 3>we going to put all these goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

2232
01:41:43.261 --> 01:41:47.490
<v Speaker 3>If they live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live forever and everybody has four </v>

2233
01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:47.490
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got a real problem on our hands.</v>

2234
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:49.000
<v Speaker 3>No more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more kids.</v>

2235
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:50.590
<v Speaker 3>No ham clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have kids?</v>

2236
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:52.210
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why you say that,</v>

2237
01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not gonna live forever either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2238
01:41:54.970 --> 01:41:57.310
<v Speaker 3>if I did have kids and maybe their kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>would live forever,</v>

2239
01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:58.140
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2240
01:41:58.170 --> 01:42:01.600
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the size of the change in society</v>

2241
01:42:01.601 --> 01:42:03.160
<v Speaker 3>that will be required by something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2242
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Twenty one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>22.</v>

2243
01:42:04.890 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 3>That's When alien takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 100 years from now.</v>

2244
01:42:08.530 --> 01:42:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way it could be.</v>

2245
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had some shitty monitors for 21,</v>

2246
01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:15.090
<v Speaker 3>22.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2247
01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.250
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were terrible.</v>

2248
01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.350
<v Speaker 3>Terribly one know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:42:17.351 --> 01:42:22.351
<v Speaker 3>But the inside of the cockpit for mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that dude gets in there and finds </v>

2250
01:42:22.351 --> 01:42:26.500
<v Speaker 3>out that there's some giant plate far </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the future.</v>

2251
01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

2252
01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:28.780
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard.</v>

2253
01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're more likely looking at </v>

2254
01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.710
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a augmented a desktop sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of scenario.</v>

2255
01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2256
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:38.560
<v Speaker 3>have you seen these new products like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2257
01:42:38.630 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 3>that microsoft is working on and some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other companies,</v>

2258
01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.080
<v Speaker 3>but I think before very long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it won't be a desktop,</v>

2259
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:46.630
<v Speaker 3>it'll just be our thoughts really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just,</v>

2260
01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I remember what I had for lunch.</v>

2261
01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll remember what the population of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Malta was in the year.</v>

2262
01:42:51.191 --> 01:42:52.510
<v Speaker 3>1,500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I looking at here?</v>

2263
01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shitty movies.</v>

2264
01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:56.780
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2265
01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.670
<v Speaker 3>this is the first one said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2266
01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.410
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was googling,</v>

2267
01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:02.170
<v Speaker 3>it could of got tagged with something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else and I didn't recognize it,</v>

2268
01:43:02.171 --> 01:43:05.050
<v Speaker 3>but that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good.</v>

2269
01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:06.540
<v Speaker 3>looking pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2270
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:11.530
<v Speaker 3>that can't be the original alien is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Think that's like alien two or three.</v>

2271
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:15.320
<v Speaker 3>No dramas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2272
01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:17.960
<v Speaker 3>this is bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the first one?</v>

2273
01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:19.130
<v Speaker 3>The second one you clicked on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2274
01:43:19.131 --> 01:43:20.740
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2275
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:23.660
<v Speaker 3>they look pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's trauma.</v>

2276
01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:26.750
<v Speaker 3>What I meant was there's a white room </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2277
01:43:26.751 --> 01:43:31.751
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the actor's name in the </v>

2278
01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:31.751
<v Speaker 3>original alien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the original alien.</v>

2279
01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:32.660
<v Speaker 3>People don't even realize it was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>

2280
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:34.450
<v Speaker 3>It seemed crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2281
01:43:34.451 --> 01:43:36.560
<v Speaker 3>it's corny weaver ages very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2282
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

2283
01:43:37.821 --> 01:43:38.190
<v Speaker 3>what was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2284
01:43:38.191 --> 01:43:40.540
<v Speaker 3>the defenders here's done yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2285
01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:45.970
<v Speaker 3>because she was in that movie up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's probably in her twenties back </v>

2286
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:47.690
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that movie in 1979,</v>

2287
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:50.090
<v Speaker 3>like their idea of what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty one,</v>

2288
01:43:50.091 --> 01:43:51.890
<v Speaker 3>22 is going be like they had</v>

2289
01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:55.890
<v Speaker 1>like weird lights flashing and the cabin</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't really seem to make a lot of</v>

2290
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:57.860
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they looked electronics.</v>

2291
01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:00.530
<v Speaker 1>These might've been pictures from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new alien.</v>

2292
01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>

2293
01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they could do to kind of look </v>

2294
01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:07.680
<v Speaker 1>like a tesla is yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2295
01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it was weird because they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying this is like from actual </v>

2296
01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 1>production set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2297
01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:12.160
<v Speaker 1>that's the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

2298
01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Because they're kind of saddled down by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem that they're replicating a </v>

2299
01:44:17.170 --> 01:44:18.570
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2300
01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:23.740
<v Speaker 1>that was from the 19 seventies and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be settled down by the deavers </v>

2301
01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:25.770
<v Speaker 1>that look like you're in an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2302
01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Would not be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so?</v>

2303
01:44:28.130 --> 01:44:29.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could still be here in your head.</v>

2304
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.460
<v Speaker 1>He thinks I need buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2305
01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.290
<v Speaker 1>So even navigation while being here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2306
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I think we live in the only generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to get repetitive stress </v>

2307
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.500
<v Speaker 1>injury from poking it or devices all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2308
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:42.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most useless thing that.</v>

2310
01:44:42.011 --> 01:44:42.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very slow,</v>

2311
01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:44.990
<v Speaker 1>inefficient interface type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being on your cell phone.</v>

2312
01:44:44.991 --> 01:44:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It takes best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hardly do it anymore.</v>

2313
01:44:46.701 --> 01:44:48.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times I'm talking to my phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2314
01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 1>That's very old fashioned wri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very retro.</v>

2315
01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:51.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2316
01:44:51.921 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Using voice recognition software.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2317
01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2318
01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:59.380
<v Speaker 1>That's retro mean when to make phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls.</v>

2319
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that too.</v>

2320
01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a crazy phone call person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2321
01:45:02.991 --> 01:45:07.991
<v Speaker 1>but the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>text function ready for his recognition </v>

2322
01:45:07.991 --> 01:45:08.930
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really amazing.</v>

2323
01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't use it as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2324
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:14.150
<v Speaker 1>look how good it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you right now.</v>

2325
01:45:14.151 --> 01:45:16.940
<v Speaker 1>It's really pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can click on this,</v>

2326
01:45:16.941 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like the notes thing.</v>

2327
01:45:18.531 --> 01:45:23.531
<v Speaker 1>This is how I do a lot of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if in my car and I have an idea </v>

2328
01:45:23.531 --> 01:45:26.891
<v Speaker 1>that comes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll either record it like with the </v>

2329
01:45:26.891 --> 01:45:29.381
<v Speaker 1>voice recording function or sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to do this and when you're </v>

2330
01:45:29.381 --> 01:45:34.241
<v Speaker 1>doing this it essentially can pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you're saying in real time </v>

2331
01:45:34.241 --> 01:45:34.910
<v Speaker 1>and print it out.</v>

2332
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cut it right.</v>

2333
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:38.690
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2334
01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Bad is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything perfectly spelled.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know how well they work.</v>

2338
01:45:51.230 --> 01:45:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen him out and commercially </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatnot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>

2344
01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:06.400
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have the link inside and he </v>

2345
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:09.131
<v Speaker 1>just interface with your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then essentially you will speak every </v>

2346
01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:09.131
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 29 bucks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

2352
01:46:16.410 --> 01:46:20.000
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one I have now from waverly labs,</v>

2353
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:20.840
<v Speaker 1>it's called the pilot.</v>

2354
01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I think the pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty awesome though.</v>

2355
01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:25.790
<v Speaker 1>You just go this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's japanese.</v>

2356
01:46:25.791 --> 01:46:28.850
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On this particular one?</v>

2357
01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm 90 percent sure.</v>

2358
01:46:31.041 --> 01:46:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I've seen videos like on facebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing a japanese one.</v>

2359
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding my first trip to Japan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be very bad.</v>

2360
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Just has amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2361
01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you going to go to tokyo?</v>

2362
01:46:38.511 --> 01:46:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were flying.</v>

2363
01:46:40.251 --> 01:46:45.251
<v Speaker 1>There's a conference in food cola and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll visit a hiroshima and osaka </v>

2364
01:46:45.251 --> 01:46:46.160
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

2365
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Kyoto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

2366
01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I went to Japan a few years back and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels</v>

2367
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 3>like you're in a super polite alien </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2368
01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds good to me.</v>

2369
01:46:56.070 --> 01:47:01.070
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very polite and the food's </v>

2370
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.070
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even more one to one.</v>

2371
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:05.961
<v Speaker 3>And then using watson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watson to do more languages and I just </v>

2372
01:47:05.961 --> 01:47:07.110
<v Speaker 3>said before portuguese scroll up so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can see what it looks.</v>

2373
01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 3>So watson is an example of one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs which learns things that we </v>

2374
01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 3>don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2375
01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

2376
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:16.690
<v Speaker 3>And that speaks japanese and french.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

2377
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 3>So this one is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2378
01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:19.740
<v Speaker 3>how does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where jamie,</v>

2379
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:24.770
<v Speaker 3>what do you see the bluetooth and wifi </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the range of bluetooth and wifi </v>

2380
01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:30.200
<v Speaker 3>translate one to one can still work just</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as the first device on the </v>

2381
01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.581
<v Speaker 3>market for language translation using ai</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does not rely on connectivity to </v>

2382
01:47:34.951 --> 01:47:39.951
<v Speaker 3>operate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It offers significant potential for its </v>

2383
01:47:39.951 --> 01:47:42.351
<v Speaker 3>unique application across airlines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign government relations and even </v>

2384
01:47:42.351 --> 01:47:43.110
<v Speaker 3>not for profits working in remote areas.</v>

2385
01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2386
01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:46.230
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2387
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:49.460
<v Speaker 3>so it's different than the pilot </v>
<v Speaker 3>earpiece.</v>

2388
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:50.670
<v Speaker 3>How's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you wear that?</v>

2389
01:47:50.671 --> 01:47:55.671
<v Speaker 3>Soccer was like get over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds just like a hearing aid would </v>

2390
01:47:55.671 --> 01:48:00.031
<v Speaker 3>probably just look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll probably be big now just like </v>

2391
01:48:00.031 --> 01:48:00.031
<v Speaker 3>they use probably big gets smaller and </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller.</v>

2392
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:02.160
<v Speaker 3>This would not be sexy while you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing it,</v>

2393
01:48:02.161 --> 01:48:04.320
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're into that stuff.</v>

2394
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was saying that you download language</v>

2395
01:48:07.351 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 3>packs so it'll be off the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:48:10.261 --> 01:48:11.970
<v Speaker 3>So essentially it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2397
01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 3>there's these map applications like onyx</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps and stuff like that.</v>

2398
01:48:17.461 --> 01:48:22.461
<v Speaker 3>you can download like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of a google earth type to </v>

2399
01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.740
<v Speaker 3>topographical map of areas and you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it,</v>

2400
01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.500
<v Speaker 3>say if you're hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could look at these on your phone.</v>

2401
01:48:28.530 --> 01:48:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Even if you don't have cell service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just pull them up and get a </v>

2402
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.530
<v Speaker 3>google image of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2403
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:34.650
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the creek that we have to go down</v>

2404
01:48:34.651 --> 01:48:35.490
<v Speaker 3>to get water.</v>

2405
01:48:36.690 --> 01:48:38.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:40.590
<v Speaker 3>We're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting super slippery.</v>

2407
01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred 79 bucks and you can use </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sucker.</v>

2408
01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:45.660
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's amazing part.</v>

2409
01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take three to five seconds to translate.</v>

2410
01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most languages there's a thing called </v>

2411
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 3>google lens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty amazing too.</v>

2412
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:59.181
<v Speaker 3>I use this when I was in Italy and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>take your phone and you look at </v>

2413
01:48:59.181 --> 01:49:02.070
<v Speaker 3>something through your phone and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>translates it on the screen,</v>

2414
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:07.310
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're looking at a sign and you </v>

2415
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.310
<v Speaker 3>hold it up and it'll tell you what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>site like.</v>

2416
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.620
<v Speaker 3>We were at a train station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2417
01:49:07.621 --> 01:49:10.500
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck does that sign?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say you put your phone up there with the</v>

2418
01:49:10.501 --> 01:49:12.770
<v Speaker 3>google lens and it'll translate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I use that.</v>

2419
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.730
<v Speaker 3>The only problem was like for menus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2420
01:49:14.731 --> 01:49:17.160
<v Speaker 3>what is this out with roses chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what that is.</v>

2421
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2422
01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fortunately,</v>

2423
01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.470
<v Speaker 3>or unfortunately when you go abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2424
01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:29.500
<v Speaker 3>americans travel so much and so to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>english people from england shore.</v>

2425
01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's such a common language.</v>

2426
01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Most of the world can speak english.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2427
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would definitely have an advantage.</v>

2428
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:42.291
<v Speaker 3>That was huge in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like you barely need to </v>

2429
01:49:42.291 --> 01:49:43.890
<v Speaker 3>understand anything other than saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you and saying,</v>

2430
01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:45.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hello and good evening.</v>

2431
01:49:45.570 --> 01:49:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One to sarah,</v>

2432
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2433
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you can get by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2434
01:49:49.481 --> 01:49:54.481
<v Speaker 1>the first time I went abroad to farm </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking country was France and I was </v>

2435
01:49:54.481 --> 01:49:55.780
<v Speaker 1>just too shy to talk to anybody because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not in paris.</v>

2436
01:49:55.781 --> 01:50:00.781
<v Speaker 1>I was like out in the middle of nowhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people did not speak english and </v>

2437
01:50:00.781 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by now I'm an I.</v>

2438
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And I even had like read the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>books and things like that.</v>

2439
01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:05.350
<v Speaker 1>But by now I've just done it so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2440
01:50:05.351 --> 01:50:10.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to speak my two words of the </v>

2441
01:50:10.351 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 1>local language and then try to switch to</v>
<v Speaker 1>english and if it doesn't work,</v>

2442
01:50:11.051 --> 01:50:12.610
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CAn we just do hand gestures?</v>

2443
01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:15.850
<v Speaker 1>When you traveled a place like France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

2444
01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:20.880
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have this french people in </v>

2445
01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.391
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always the stereotype that you </v>

2446
01:50:24.391 --> 01:50:24.391
<v Speaker 1>hear that french people think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>americans are rude.</v>

2447
01:50:24.391 --> 01:50:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I would like try to go like way out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my way to make sure that no one </v>

2448
01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:28.860
<v Speaker 1>thought I was like a rude american.</v>

2449
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's always this reaction </v>

2450
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:36.331
<v Speaker 1>that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the worst case scenario is the </v>

2451
01:50:36.331 --> 01:50:39.481
<v Speaker 1>american goes over there and it's pissed</v>
<v Speaker 1>off that they don't speak english and </v>

2452
01:50:39.481 --> 01:50:42.550
<v Speaker 1>they started don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first trip I was treated very,</v>

2453
01:50:42.551 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 1>very well in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2454
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:49.261
<v Speaker 1>very politely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even like I bought something in a </v>

2455
01:50:49.261 --> 01:50:49.480
<v Speaker 1>store and I didn't understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>price was,</v>

2456
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:54.510
<v Speaker 1>so I just sort of kept gIving money </v>
<v Speaker 1>until they nodded and by mistake I had </v>

2457
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:58.231
<v Speaker 1>given too much and the guy like ran out </v>
<v Speaker 1>after me to catch me leaving to give me </v>

2458
01:50:58.751 --> 01:51:01.480
<v Speaker 1>my money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was uniform.</v>

2459
01:51:01.481 --> 01:51:06.481
<v Speaker 1>except in transportation industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like whenever I wanted to buy a </v>

2460
01:51:06.481 --> 01:51:06.760
<v Speaker 1>plane ticket or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very,</v>

2461
01:51:06.761 --> 01:51:11.761
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ironic enough with a rude or were </v>

2462
01:51:11.761 --> 01:51:13.750
<v Speaker 1>they just definitely tired of dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with tourists,</v>

2463
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2464
01:51:15.230 --> 01:51:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I would say in french I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2465
01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:18.220
<v Speaker 1>do you speak english?</v>

2466
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I do in french.</v>

2467
01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2468
01:51:21.761 --> 01:51:24.860
<v Speaker 1>well then can we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2469
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:26.800
<v Speaker 1>they're probably just exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just exists.</v>

2470
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:28.210
<v Speaker 1>But that's how it is in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2471
01:51:28.211 --> 01:51:29.770
<v Speaker 1>you deal with people at the airline </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter.</v>

2472
01:51:29.771 --> 01:51:31.060
<v Speaker 1>They always had this look in their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2473
01:51:31.061 --> 01:51:32.340
<v Speaker 1>what time is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do I don't,</v>

2474
01:51:32.341 --> 01:51:37.341
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to doing something you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not passionate about unlike you with </v>

2475
01:51:37.961 --> 01:51:39.550
<v Speaker 1>your legal notepad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2476
01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:41.310
<v Speaker 1>In the alien languages and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2477
01:51:41.311 --> 01:51:46.311
<v Speaker 1>I can find somewhere it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great privilege what I do for </v>

2478
01:51:46.311 --> 01:51:46.311
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2479
01:51:46.311 --> 01:51:50.221
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that I get paid to do </v>

2480
01:51:50.221 --> 01:51:51.691
<v Speaker 1>this and it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell my incoming graduate </v>

2481
01:51:51.691 --> 01:51:55.111
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get a phd in theoretical physics </v>

2482
01:51:55.111 --> 01:51:57.571
<v Speaker 1>from caltech and you probably want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physics professor because that's the </v>

2483
01:51:57.571 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 1>only thing you can do with that degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your chances are maybe 25 percent of</v>

2484
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:01.270
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty damn good.</v>

2485
01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after You,</v>

2486
01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you're like 26 years old and putting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of work to still only knows the 25 </v>

2487
01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.140
<v Speaker 1>percent chance of succeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's still pretty amazing.</v>

2488
01:52:11.141 --> 01:52:16.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to be a standup </v>

2489
01:52:16.141 --> 01:52:16.141
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your odds are like one percent if you're</v>

2490
01:52:16.141 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 1>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2491
01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:21.540
<v Speaker 1>the very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good thing about academia is it's </v>

2492
01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:21.540
<v Speaker 1>very clearly upper out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2493
01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:23.740
<v Speaker 1>there's time limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you haven't succeeded by now,</v>

2494
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can to be discovered tomorrow.</v>

2495
01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you usually go to wall street and make a</v>

2496
01:52:28.721 --> 01:52:30.190
<v Speaker 1>lot more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2497
01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:33.910
<v Speaker 1>so hE's to be in physics from caltech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to start praying.</v>

2498
01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 1>People will hire you to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2499
01:52:36.730 --> 01:52:41.730
<v Speaker 1>So what would you do on wall to wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>street with a phd from caltech these </v>

2500
01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:44.340
<v Speaker 1>days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the money's being made by algorithms</v>

2501
01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>that study of the stock market</v>

2502
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 2>and destroy human beings picking stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2503
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Renaissance technologies and places like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2504
01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2505
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:57.310
<v Speaker 2>like we were just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but soon the entire stock market will </v>

2506
01:52:57.310 --> 01:53:00.701
<v Speaker 2>just be dueling algorithms trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell something a microsecond before </v>

2507
01:53:00.701 --> 01:53:00.701
<v Speaker 2>something else does.</v>

2508
01:53:00.701 --> 01:53:04.350
<v Speaker 3>Now you are involved in a hard science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2509
01:53:04.351 --> 01:53:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2510
01:53:04.861 --> 01:53:09.861
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're involved in this trying to </v>

2511
01:53:09.861 --> 01:53:11.310
<v Speaker 3>understand the world and the universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

2512
01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you see any of the identity politics </v>

2513
01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.220
<v Speaker 3>issues that are going on on campuses </v>
<v Speaker 3>today?</v>

2514
01:53:17.221 --> 01:53:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a hot subject,</v>

2515
01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:19.770
<v Speaker 3>whereas</v>

2516
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:21.260
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2517
01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my job at caltech is research professor,</v>

2518
01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.560
<v Speaker 2>so I don't even teach a lot of courses </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest.</v>

2519
01:53:27.561 --> 01:53:30.110
<v Speaker 2>And caltech is not the typical campus in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2520
01:53:30.111 --> 01:53:31.550
<v Speaker 2>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2521
01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:36.580
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just had a professor who was </v>

2522
01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:36.580
<v Speaker 2>basically fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2523
01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:37.250
<v Speaker 2>for harassing students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2524
01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.140
<v Speaker 2>it does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexual harassment.</v>

2525
01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's trying to get laid.</v>

2526
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.010
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more complicated than that.</v>

2527
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:46.130
<v Speaker 2>He fell in love with a student and fired</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

2528
01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:49.810
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

2529
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:51.650
<v Speaker 2>there's just no question that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2530
01:53:51.651 --> 01:53:56.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm in an area of theoretical physics </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a very tiny fraction of </v>

2531
01:53:56.651 --> 01:53:56.651
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2532
01:53:56.651 --> 01:53:59.750
<v Speaker 2>and even tinier fraction of african </v>
<v Speaker 2>americans and so forth,</v>

2533
01:53:59.751 --> 01:54:04.751
<v Speaker 2>but that's kind of less surprising </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they just don't come up usually </v>

2534
01:54:04.751 --> 01:54:09.191
<v Speaker 2>in economic circumstances that put </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical physics is one of the </v>

2535
01:54:09.191 --> 01:54:09.290
<v Speaker 2>plausible future research careers.</v>

2536
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2537
01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I see an enormous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination against women in my field</v>

2538
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:19.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's there and women leave and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the complaints against it or are </v>

2539
01:54:20.690 --> 01:54:22.280
<v Speaker 2>overblown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many of them are very,</v>

2540
01:54:22.281 --> 01:54:24.500
<v Speaker 2>very real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a real problem for us.</v>

2541
01:54:24.501 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fixing,</v>

2542
01:54:25.911 --> 01:54:27.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of discrimination do you see?</v>

2543
01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:32.780
<v Speaker 2>It's these days it's usually very </v>
<v Speaker 2>subtle.</v>

2544
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:37.870
<v Speaker 2>It's usually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking a little bit less </v>

2545
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:40.451
<v Speaker 2>seriously if you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's all sorts of tests that </v>

2546
01:54:40.451 --> 01:54:40.451
<v Speaker 2>have been done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2547
01:54:40.451 --> 01:54:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Like people handed out a mathematics </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers and with,</v>

2548
01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:48.920
<v Speaker 2>and then all they did was change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>name of the author James Smith versus </v>

2549
01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:53.441
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were always ranked much worse </v>

2550
01:54:53.441 --> 01:54:53.441
<v Speaker 2>when it was Jennifer Smith who was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>author even.</v>

2551
01:54:53.441 --> 01:54:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same paper grilling </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2552
01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and know there's a certain style of </v>

2553
01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:04.010
<v Speaker 2>aggressive in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>egotism that serves you well in academia</v>

2554
01:55:04.011 --> 01:55:04.520
<v Speaker 2>generally.</v>

2555
01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.330
<v Speaker 2>And in physics in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2556
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.570
<v Speaker 2>putting yourself forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking questions,</v>

2557
01:55:08.571 --> 01:55:13.250
<v Speaker 2>being loud and noisy and a women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>less good at that for whatever reason.</v>

2558
01:55:13.251 --> 01:55:14.750
<v Speaker 2>They're not trained to do that or it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an eight.</v>

2559
01:55:14.751 --> 01:55:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2560
01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:21.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can sort of get bullied into </v>

2561
01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:21.520
<v Speaker 2>silence or just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not worth it.</v>

2562
01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go to wall street to make money.</v>

2563
01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Also a woman who does that is not likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be received as well as a man who does</v>

2564
01:55:28.101 --> 01:55:29.900
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>held against them.</v>

2565
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're deemed to be like a bitch.</v>

2566
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my guy was aggressive at caltech.</v>

2567
01:55:34.821 --> 01:55:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the fourth floor of a building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the theoretical physics,</v>

2568
01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 2>theoretical high energy physics group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2569
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:43.470
<v Speaker 2>so there's maybe 30 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>total professors,</v>

2570
01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.340
<v Speaker 2>post docs,</v>

2571
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.090
<v Speaker 1>graduate students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2572
01:55:46.091 --> 01:55:49.500
<v Speaker 1>and until this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were zero women out of 30,</v>

2573
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.960
<v Speaker 1>which is just embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just bad.</v>

2574
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who would want to be the one woman?</v>

2575
01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2576
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2577
01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially there's two like men either </v>

2578
01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:05.400
<v Speaker 1>who thinks they can have sex with you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>amanda can never have sex with you.</v>

2579
01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

2580
01:56:06.170 --> 01:56:11.170
<v Speaker 1>we both annoying and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky you get a guy who </v>

2581
01:56:11.170 --> 01:56:14.120
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to have sex with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just wants to be your friend and </v>

2582
01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:14.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all right.</v>

2583
01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that,</v>

2584
01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

2585
01:56:16.111 --> 01:56:21.111
<v Speaker 1>if I were giving advice to young women </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose primary goal was to become a </v>

2586
01:56:21.111 --> 01:56:23.300
<v Speaker 1>successful theoretical physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2587
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:28.310
<v Speaker 1>if that was your only goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then don't raise a fuss about sexism or </v>

2588
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:33.201
<v Speaker 1>discrimination because just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about the interpretation of </v>

2589
01:56:33.201 --> 01:56:37.911
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics counts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's points against you when you're </v>

2590
01:56:37.911 --> 01:56:41.120
<v Speaker 1>being judged as a theoretical physicist </v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about discrimination against </v>

2591
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:41.120
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2592
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Key accounTs as points against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think like,</v>

2593
01:56:43.051 --> 01:56:43.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2594
01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:47.300
<v Speaker 1>you're not really interested in physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to make a political fuss.</v>

2595
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unfortunate.</v>

2596
01:56:49.621 --> 01:56:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Keep quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2597
01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that what you're saying is </v>

2598
01:56:55.670 --> 01:56:57.261
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people don't want to hear </v>

2599
01:56:57.261 --> 01:56:57.261
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like keep quiet.</v>

2600
01:56:57.261 --> 01:56:57.261
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep quiet.</v>

2601
01:56:57.261 --> 01:57:01.581
<v Speaker 1>When you tell women too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about </v>

2602
01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:03.770
<v Speaker 1>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe your only goal in life is not </v>

2603
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 1>to personally become a successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical physicists.</v>

2604
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a.</v>

2605
01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my advice is not keep quiet.</v>

2606
01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:13.010
<v Speaker 1>My advice is if that's your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to achieve that goal is to keep </v>

2607
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gross though,</v>

2608
01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2609
01:57:13.681 --> 01:57:18.681
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that it's the job of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys to raise a little bit of a fuss </v>

2610
01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:23.841
<v Speaker 1>about this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that at caltech where this guy </v>

2611
01:57:23.841 --> 01:57:23.841
<v Speaker 1>recently got fired.</v>

2612
01:57:23.841 --> 01:57:26.670
<v Speaker 1>How many people were willing to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuses for his really,</v>

2613
01:57:26.671 --> 01:57:28.200
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad behavior.</v>

2614
01:57:28.730 --> 01:57:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2615
01:57:29.911 --> 01:57:34.911
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unseemly to talk about these </v>

2616
01:57:34.911 --> 01:57:34.911
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hope it's not true like these,</v>

2617
01:57:34.911 --> 01:57:36.600
<v Speaker 1>this is our friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is someone we worked with.</v>

2618
01:57:36.601 --> 01:57:37.940
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to believe this about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2619
01:57:37.941 --> 01:57:40.410
<v Speaker 1>We want to protect him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So physics,</v>

2620
01:57:40.411 --> 01:57:41.640
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomy,</v>

2621
01:57:41.641 --> 01:57:46.641
<v Speaker 1>all these areas are now having these </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of famous big name professors </v>

2622
01:57:48.421 --> 01:57:53.421
<v Speaker 1>that it's finally being revealed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years had been regularly </v>

2623
01:57:53.421 --> 01:57:54.570
<v Speaker 1>harassing graduate students and pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out of the field.</v>

2624
01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe finally that's coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>light enough that it's hopefully will go</v>

2625
01:57:59.941 --> 01:58:01.980
<v Speaker 1>away a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human folly,</v>

2626
01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

2627
01:58:02.791 --> 01:58:07.791
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of what we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier with the people that don't </v>

2628
01:58:07.791 --> 01:58:11.361
<v Speaker 1>necessarily understand quantum physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they sort of dismiss what's </v>

2629
01:58:11.361 --> 01:58:13.790
<v Speaker 1>important about it or people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2630
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:16.340
<v Speaker 1>just use their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2631
01:58:16.341 --> 01:58:19.100
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rely too much on ego or they,</v>

2632
01:58:19.130 --> 01:58:20.670
<v Speaker 1>it's too much of a part of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2633
01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:25.680
<v Speaker 1>they human folly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of make excuses and gets </v>

2634
01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.010
<v Speaker 1>involved in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2635
01:58:26.011 --> 01:58:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2636
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:32.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the broader question of identity </v>

2637
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.830
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

2638
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2639
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty lefty justice warrior about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

2640
01:58:34.801 --> 01:58:35.970
<v Speaker 1>To be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2641
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:38.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of women,</v>

2642
01:58:38.761 --> 01:58:43.761
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are just the most obvious example </v>

2643
01:58:43.761 --> 01:58:43.761
<v Speaker 1>in my field who have been</v>

2644
01:58:43.761 --> 01:58:46.510
<v Speaker 2>pushed out of my field because of bias </v>
<v Speaker 2>and discrimination in very,</v>

2645
01:58:46.511 --> 01:58:48.950
<v Speaker 2>very obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2646
01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:51.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verifiable ways is just,</v>

2647
01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:53.630
<v Speaker 2>that's the big embarrassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2648
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:58.950
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I'm kind of a free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech absolutist if some crazy person </v>

2649
01:58:58.950 --> 01:59:01.200
<v Speaker 2>who has very retro grade views wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say those retrograde views.</v>

2650
01:59:01.201 --> 01:59:04.210
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if someone else wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to invite them on campus to do it,</v>

2651
01:59:04.211 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I think they should be allowed to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the craziness that they want.</v>

2652
01:59:07.961 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the right solution </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these problems.</v>

2653
01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the solution in those cases,</v>

2654
01:59:12.201 --> 01:59:15.410
<v Speaker 3>for someone who's got a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint to debate them,</v>

2655
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:17.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The marketplace of free ideas.</v>

2656
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Actually the chancellor at berkeley just</v>
<v Speaker 3>put out a very good statement saying </v>

2657
01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.870
<v Speaker 3>exactly that and I gave her credit for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2658
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

2659
01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know that they have an issue </v>

2660
01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:32.201
<v Speaker 3>there with ben shapiro coming who is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very reasonable guy and sometimes gets </v>

2661
01:59:32.361 --> 01:59:35.090
<v Speaker 3>lumped into the alt right and gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>lumped into these fees.</v>

2662
01:59:35.091 --> 01:59:40.091
<v Speaker 3>Not that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just happens to be conservative and </v>

2663
01:59:40.091 --> 01:59:41.690
<v Speaker 3>young and very articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for awhile they were trying to limit</v>

2664
01:59:41.691 --> 01:59:44.960
<v Speaker 3>his participation there and putting them</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the same category that they would put</v>

2665
01:59:44.961 --> 01:59:47.330
<v Speaker 3>milo yiannopoulos or of these other guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2666
01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:52.370
<v Speaker 3>which it's we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're very weird with free speech and </v>

2667
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:55.931
<v Speaker 3>that we love free speech as long as it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>in line with how we defend free speech </v>

2668
01:59:55.931 --> 01:59:57.030
<v Speaker 3>for people we agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2669
01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2670
01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know ben shapiro,</v>

2671
01:59:59.431 --> 02:00:04.431
<v Speaker 2>but Larry Summers is another example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave this famous speech at harvard.</v>

2672
02:00:04.831 --> 02:00:09.831
<v Speaker 2>He was the president of harvard and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world famous economist and he gave this </v>

2673
02:00:09.831 --> 02:00:09.831
<v Speaker 2>speech saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2674
02:00:09.831 --> 02:00:14.121
<v Speaker 2>maybe the reason why we don't have as </v>
<v Speaker 2>many women physicists as male physicist </v>

2675
02:00:14.121 --> 02:00:18.171
<v Speaker 2>is because of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different distribution of innate </v>

2676
02:00:18.171 --> 02:00:18.870
<v Speaker 2>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think that you could make a veRy,</v>

2677
02:00:18.871 --> 02:00:23.070
<v Speaker 2>very good case that his substantive </v>
<v Speaker 2>claims were entirely bullshit.</v>

2678
02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Like he misread the data and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>making excuses and that's one thing.</v>

2679
02:00:28.381 --> 02:00:30.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another thing if it's the president</v>

2680
02:00:30.811 --> 02:00:32.130
<v Speaker 2>of harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2681
02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.550
<v Speaker 2>But then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people were saying,</v>

2682
02:00:35.551 --> 02:00:40.551
<v Speaker 2>well he shouldn't be invited to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about economics at other </v>

2683
02:00:40.551 --> 02:00:41.040
<v Speaker 2>universities because he said this bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2684
02:00:41.041 --> 02:00:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2685
02:00:42.570 --> 02:00:47.570
<v Speaker 2>we're world class economist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was wrong and you should </v>

2686
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:49.971
<v Speaker 2>criticize him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to hear what he has to say </v>

2687
02:00:49.971 --> 02:00:49.971
<v Speaker 2>about economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that</v>

2688
02:00:49.971 --> 02:00:54.340
<v Speaker 3>entirely different because it also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never an issue with someone </v>

2689
02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:57.461
<v Speaker 3>who's a professor who's constantly used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to really not being questioned and been </v>

2690
02:00:57.461 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 3>giving lectures and being able to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of students and you develop </v>

2691
02:01:02.230 --> 02:01:04.370
<v Speaker 3>sort of a general hubris about your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

2692
02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hope that,</v>

2693
02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my areas of academia,</v>

2694
02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:14.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't get through lunchtime without </v>
<v Speaker 2>having all of your opinions at the time.</v>

2695
02:01:14.701 --> 02:01:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Like that's just what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2696
02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

2697
02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:21.230
<v Speaker 2>you never sit around and say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone agrees.</v>

2698
02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:22.830
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a very healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>profession.</v>

2699
02:01:22.831 --> 02:01:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Then that's hoW to get things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

2700
02:01:25.771 --> 02:01:30.771
<v Speaker 2>make progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course usually we're talking </v>

2701
02:01:30.771 --> 02:01:30.771
<v Speaker 2>about the wave function of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark matter.</v>

2702
02:01:30.771 --> 02:01:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2703
02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:33.540
<v Speaker 2>to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fair.</v>

2704
02:01:33.541 --> 02:01:34.590
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we said before,</v>

2705
02:01:34.591 --> 02:01:39.591
<v Speaker 2>there's still prejudices about purely </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics topics like you talk about </v>

2706
02:01:39.741 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 2>quantum</v>

2707
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>mechanics or the nature of the dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter and in discussions get very,</v>

2708
02:01:43.071 --> 02:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>very heated and emotional and people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs depend on it and the whole bit.</v>

2709
02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that things go unchallenged</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a.</v>

2710
02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>That's just doesn't fly very far in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

2711
02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beautiful.</v>

2712
02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to you about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just said,</v>

2713
02:01:58.670 --> 02:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>dark matter because that's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would imagine if you went out and</v>

2714
02:02:03.981 --> 02:02:08.981
<v Speaker 1>just randomly polled a thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all 1000 would have no idea what dark </v>

2715
02:02:09.651 --> 02:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>matter is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2716
02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>There may be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2717
02:02:12.441 --> 02:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like part of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>

2718
02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>We can't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

2719
02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it was rick and morty recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had a silly episode about dark </v>

2720
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2721
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cartoon network.</v>

2722
02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Show a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hilarious,</v>

2723
02:02:25.221 --> 02:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>silly thing that uses science fiction to</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2724
02:02:28.730 --> 02:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>to actually do that.</v>

2725
02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I know what you're talking </v>

2726
02:02:35.710 --> 02:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark matter is real.</v>

2727
02:02:35.710 --> 02:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>It exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2728
02:02:35.710 --> 02:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we measure it?</v>

2729
02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>We measure its gravitational force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pushes things around in the universe.</v>

2730
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>So what do we think it is that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>

2731
02:02:43.791 --> 02:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

2732
02:02:44.781 --> 02:02:48.080
<v Speaker 1>We know certain things about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's dark.</v>

2733
02:02:48.710 --> 02:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>We know how much of it there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about five times as much mass in </v>

2734
02:02:54.021 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 1>dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is an ordinary matter.</v>

2735
02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Ordinary matter is every particle we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen ever,</v>

2736
02:02:58.910 --> 02:03:00.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of the atoms,</v>

2737
02:03:00.591 --> 02:03:05.591
<v Speaker 1>all the stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the galaxies that we see in our </v>

2738
02:03:05.591 --> 02:03:05.591
<v Speaker 1>telescopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's five percent of the mass,</v>

2739
02:03:05.770 --> 02:03:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and then dark matter is 25 percent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark energy,</v>

2740
02:03:09.831 --> 02:03:14.831
<v Speaker 1>which is something completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the other 70 percent of the universe </v>

2741
02:03:14.831 --> 02:03:15.770
<v Speaker 1>and these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are facts.</v>

2742
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Those that's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2743
02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:20.180
<v Speaker 1>99 percent likely to be true.</v>

2744
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:22.160
<v Speaker 1>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark matter,</v>

2745
02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:27.161
<v Speaker 1>the dark energy that is much more up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air that we have lots of candidates </v>

2746
02:03:27.161 --> 02:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>and we're not sure which one is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

2747
02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

2748
02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2749
02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>so I went on science friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2750
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.700
<v Speaker 1>science friday with a ira playdough npr </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2751
02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2752
02:03:36.110 --> 02:03:38.300
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says like you,</v>

2753
02:03:38.301 --> 02:03:39.410
<v Speaker 1>cosmologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2754
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't you be embarrassed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only understand five percent of </v>

2755
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>what's in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2756
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>They know that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know five percent of us,</v>

2757
02:03:45.630 --> 02:03:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 100 years ago we didn't know </v>

2758
02:03:50.630 --> 02:03:52.901
<v Speaker 1>anything about the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know the universe was </v>

2759
02:03:52.901 --> 02:03:52.901
<v Speaker 1>expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't really ever other galaxies,</v>

2760
02:03:52.901 --> 02:03:52.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

2761
02:03:52.901 --> 02:03:57.761
<v Speaker 1>This stuff takes more than a few months </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out five percent I think is </v>

2762
02:03:57.761 --> 02:03:57.761
<v Speaker 1>pretty healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2763
02:03:57.761 --> 02:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we're getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the current theory as to like </v>

2764
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>where it resides and how it's formed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what its properties are and what impact </v>

2765
02:04:07.251 --> 02:04:09.350
<v Speaker 1>it has on the galaxies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a really,</v>

2766
02:04:09.351 --> 02:04:14.351
<v Speaker 1>really good question because we might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in flux right now for a long time.</v>

2767
02:04:14.511 --> 02:04:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Like basically from the 19 eighties to </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2768
02:04:17.090 --> 02:04:19.970
<v Speaker 1>there was a leading candidate for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark matter was,</v>

2769
02:04:19.971 --> 02:04:23.930
<v Speaker 1>something called the wimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakly interacting massive particle.</v>

2770
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:28.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you indulge me for just a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the particles we know and love.</v>

2771
02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are four forces that push these </v>

2772
02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>particles around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gravity,</v>

2773
02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the strong and weak </v>

2774
02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>nuclear forces to nuclear forces.</v>

2775
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:40.920
<v Speaker 2>And the nuclear forces are distinguished</v>
<v Speaker 2>by being short range,</v>

2776
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:42.330
<v Speaker 2>like you don't notice it in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday life.</v>

2777
02:04:42.331 --> 02:04:44.370
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be down there at the atomic </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>

2778
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:49.910
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out that if you imagine a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new particle that obviously interacts </v>

2779
02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:55.371
<v Speaker 2>through gravity because everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacts through gravity but doesn't </v>

2780
02:04:55.371 --> 02:04:57.570
<v Speaker 2>interact through the strong nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>force like a proton does,</v>

2781
02:04:57.571 --> 02:04:59.910
<v Speaker 2>or through electromagnetism that will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>charged,</v>

2782
02:05:00.210 --> 02:05:02.610
<v Speaker 2>but it interacts through the weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear force.</v>

2783
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you imagine a particle interacts with</v>

2784
02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:10.640
<v Speaker 2>the weak nuclear force relatively heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you calculate how much of those </v>

2785
02:05:10.771 --> 02:05:15.771
<v Speaker 2>should be leftover from the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the right amount to be the dark </v>

2786
02:05:15.771 --> 02:05:19.050
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is called the wimp miracle.</v>

2787
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:22.200
<v Speaker 2>The idea that if you just hypothesize </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the blue,</v>

2788
02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:27.260
<v Speaker 2>a new particle that is invisible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable and interacts through the known </v>

2789
02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:29.250
<v Speaker 2>force of nature that we call the weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear force,</v>

2790
02:05:29.251 --> 02:05:30.750
<v Speaker 2>that could easily be the dark matter.</v>

2791
02:05:31.410 --> 02:05:33.990
<v Speaker 2>So that was seemed so natural and </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple,</v>

2792
02:05:33.991 --> 02:05:38.991
<v Speaker 2>and there were many more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories that predicted that such </v>

2793
02:05:38.991 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 2>particles would exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that many people,</v>

2794
02:05:40.530 --> 02:05:45.530
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have said there's a 90 percent </v>

2795
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:46.020
<v Speaker 2>chance that wimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakly interacting massive particles are</v>

2796
02:05:46.021 --> 02:05:48.240
<v Speaker 2>the dark manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

2797
02:05:49.110 --> 02:05:51.360
<v Speaker 2>If the wimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the dark matter is wimps,</v>

2798
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:54.000
<v Speaker 2>we can build detectors and look for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2799
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:57.840
<v Speaker 2>And we have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've built these giant detectors,</v>

2800
02:05:57.841 --> 02:06:01.050
<v Speaker 2>deep underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're shielded from all the cosmic rays</v>

2801
02:06:01.051 --> 02:06:03.660
<v Speaker 2>that are just noise and contaminating </v>
<v Speaker 2>your experiment,</v>

2802
02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:09.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you wait for a little weakly </v>

2803
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:11.181
<v Speaker 2>interacting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive particle to pass through your </v>

2804
02:06:11.181 --> 02:06:11.970
<v Speaker 2>detector and bump into an atom </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground underground.</v>

2805
02:06:12.890 --> 02:06:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually these are in minds,</v>

2806
02:06:15.090 --> 02:06:16.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're an old gold mines,</v>

2807
02:06:16.921 --> 02:06:18.880
<v Speaker 2>a mile underground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counterintuitive.</v>

2808
02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:22.860
<v Speaker 2>So you're going a mile underground to </v>
<v Speaker 2>search for something that's in space.</v>

2809
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:24.210
<v Speaker 2>I made up the mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might want to,</v>

2810
02:06:24.211 --> 02:06:28.430
<v Speaker 2>if you can get even 100 feet underground</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a deep mine,</v>

2811
02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:33.520
<v Speaker 2>it seems so counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd think you'd have to throw </v>

2812
02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:36.381
<v Speaker 2>something into the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in a noisy environment that the </v>

2813
02:06:36.381 --> 02:06:37.260
<v Speaker 2>trouble is not detecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trouble is seeing them peek out over</v>

2814
02:06:37.261 --> 02:06:39.420
<v Speaker 2>the noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're trying to do.</v>

2815
02:06:39.421 --> 02:06:41.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like going into a quiet room to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to something very,</v>

2816
02:06:41.611 --> 02:06:46.611
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was the initial discovery that led to </v>

2817
02:06:46.611 --> 02:06:50.340
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion that dark matter is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>preeminent mass of the universe.</v>

2818
02:06:50.341 --> 02:06:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of the masses?</v>

2819
02:06:51.930 --> 02:06:52.430
<v Speaker 2>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2820
02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:55.380
<v Speaker 2>let me just finish this up very quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this point is that we have built</v>

2821
02:06:55.381 --> 02:06:57.090
<v Speaker 2>these detectors and we haven't seen the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wimps.</v>

2822
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2823
02:06:57.841 --> 02:07:02.841
<v Speaker 2>So for the first time people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning to shake their belief that </v>

2824
02:07:02.841 --> 02:07:04.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe wimps are the most likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>

2825
02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:06.120
<v Speaker 2>There are other candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other kinds of particles.</v>

2826
02:07:06.121 --> 02:07:08.420
<v Speaker 2>That could be the dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's still winds.</v>

2827
02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.920
<v Speaker 2>We just haven't found them yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's still possible,</v>

2828
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:14.340
<v Speaker 2>but I would say if five years from now </v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't found the wimps,</v>

2829
02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:16.530
<v Speaker 2>then people are gonna start saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

2830
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first evidence,</v>

2831
02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2832
02:07:20.011 --> 02:07:21.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes in drips and drabs.</v>

2833
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:23.670
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my caltech predecessor,</v>

2834
02:07:23.671 --> 02:07:27.870
<v Speaker 2>fritz zwicky famous astrophysicist back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 thirties,</v>

2835
02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:33.440
<v Speaker 2>pointed out that galaxies were orbiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other too fast in what are called </v>

2836
02:07:33.601 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>clusters of galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look out there in the sky,</v>

2837
02:07:35.861 --> 02:07:40.861
<v Speaker 2>you see like these bunches of galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are orbiting each other and you </v>

2838
02:07:40.861 --> 02:07:42.250
<v Speaker 2>calculate how heavy the galaxies should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be from what you see.</v>

2839
02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:45.460
<v Speaker 2>You can calculate using newtonian laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>of physics,</v>

2840
02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:49.180
<v Speaker 2>how fast they should be orbiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually orbiting much faster.</v>

2841
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:54.600
<v Speaker 2>And he said the only way for that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen is if they're much more massive </v>

2842
02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:54.600
<v Speaker 2>than youth on.</v>

2843
02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:57.400
<v Speaker 2>if there's much more mass in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some missing mass.</v>

2844
02:07:57.550 --> 02:08:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the time we didn't know it could </v>

2845
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>just be stars that we didn't see or gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>or dust or whatever.</v>

2846
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:08.370
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really until the 19 seventies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that vera rubin famous astrophysicist </v>

2847
02:08:08.370 --> 02:08:13.290
<v Speaker 2>looked at how individual galaxies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>rotating and she found that it's a </v>

2848
02:08:13.290 --> 02:08:16.450
<v Speaker 2>similar kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The edges of the galaxies are moving way</v>

2849
02:08:16.451 --> 02:08:20.440
<v Speaker 2>faster than they should be given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of matter that is inside.</v>

2850
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:25.390
<v Speaker 2>And she concluded that a lot of dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter causing a gravitational pull that</v>

2851
02:08:25.391 --> 02:08:29.230
<v Speaker 2>we didn't see but is causing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the edges of the galaxies to spend a lot</v>

2852
02:08:29.231 --> 02:08:31.420
<v Speaker 2>faster than they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2853
02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:36.480
<v Speaker 2>so that is the reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a possibility that some new </v>

2854
02:08:36.641 --> 02:08:41.641
<v Speaker 2>discovery could happen or could come </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth where you would re examine this </v>

2855
02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:45.850
<v Speaker 2>idea that there's some missing mass is </v>
<v Speaker 2>always a possibility.</v>

2856
02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2857
02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:52.260
<v Speaker 2>so there's certainly this idea that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the market that because all of our </v>

2858
02:08:53.291 --> 02:08:58.291
<v Speaker 2>evidence for dark matter is indirect </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's through it's gravitational </v>

2859
02:08:58.291 --> 02:09:02.761
<v Speaker 2>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not by directly touching it or seeing </v>

2860
02:09:02.761 --> 02:09:02.761
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we just don't understand gravity.</v>

2861
02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe gravity is a little bit different </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2862
02:09:06.521 --> 02:09:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think I'm right,</v>

2863
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:10.330
<v Speaker 2>not everyone agrees with me sadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2864
02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:15.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea has basically been killed off </v>

2865
02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:18.190
<v Speaker 2>by our observations of the microwave </v>
<v Speaker 2>background radiation.</v>

2866
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:23.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are 14 billion years after the big </v>

2867
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.310
<v Speaker 2>bang there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2868
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:25.120
<v Speaker 2>the big bang was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hot and dense.</v>

2869
02:09:25.121 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And is glowing to beat the band </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

2870
02:09:27.191 --> 02:09:32.191
<v Speaker 2>but it was also opaque.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The light didn't get very far and about </v>

2871
02:09:32.191 --> 02:09:36.780
<v Speaker 2>400,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years after the big bang it cooled down </v>

2872
02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:36.780
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became transparent.</v>

2873
02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:38.010
<v Speaker 2>And then these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2874
02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:42.130
<v Speaker 2>these photons of light just stretched </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel through the universe unimpeded.</v>

2875
02:09:42.130 --> 02:09:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And we can see that the leftoveR </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation,</v>

2876
02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>we can see these faint patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these oscillations in the microwave </v>

2877
02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:54.001
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which look exactly like they would look </v>

2878
02:09:54.001 --> 02:09:57.031
<v Speaker 2>if dark matter we're causing them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't look what they would look </v>

2879
02:09:57.031 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 2>like if gravity were modified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a much longer version of that</v>

2880
02:10:00.221 --> 02:10:01.980
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the basic thing is if you,</v>

2881
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:04.330
<v Speaker 2>if I can just pull authority and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust me on this,</v>

2882
02:10:04.590 --> 02:10:05.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2883
02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I was totally on board with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was something wrong about </v>

2884
02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be very cool thing.</v>

2885
02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:15.421
<v Speaker 2>If it were true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a big mind bending </v>

2886
02:10:15.421 --> 02:10:17.821
<v Speaker 2>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've tested that and the microwave </v>

2887
02:10:17.821 --> 02:10:17.821
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were predictions.</v>

2888
02:10:17.821 --> 02:10:19.870
<v Speaker 2>It would look this way if you modified </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity that way,</v>

2889
02:10:19.871 --> 02:10:24.871
<v Speaker 2>if there were dark matter and the answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>is spot on to the dark matter of </v>

2890
02:10:24.871 --> 02:10:25.960
<v Speaker 2>predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very different from the modified gravity</v>

2891
02:10:25.961 --> 02:10:27.970
<v Speaker 2>predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So dark matter exists.</v>

2892
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:33.030
<v Speaker 2>So dark matter exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what percentage of the universe is </v>

2893
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 2>currently believed to be matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five percent.</v>

2894
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read once that they had discovered</v>

2895
02:10:38.301 --> 02:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>in entire galaxy that was made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark matter.</v>

2896
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty close.</v>

2897
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:46.610
<v Speaker 1>MayBe not entirely because then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't see it,</v>

2898
02:10:46.890 --> 02:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to discover it.</v>

2899
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That was what I was going to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you see this stuff?</v>

2900
02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Like how does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how if you can't detect it,</v>

2901
02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:56.630
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it exists,</v>

2902
02:10:56.631 --> 02:10:57.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2903
02:10:57.261 --> 02:10:58.750
<v Speaker 1>because of its effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2904
02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:00.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't like point to it.</v>

2905
02:11:00.681 --> 02:11:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Like you can point to the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2906
02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:07.450
<v Speaker 1>So you need some tracers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need something that tells you that </v>

2907
02:11:07.450 --> 02:11:08.110
<v Speaker 1>dark matter is influencing the motion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in this,</v>

2908
02:11:08.130 --> 02:11:11.090
<v Speaker 1>this mdm space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a galaxy,</v>

2909
02:11:11.091 --> 02:11:16.091
<v Speaker 1>it's just like the stars at the edges of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy and most of the mass in our </v>

2910
02:11:16.091 --> 02:11:20.711
<v Speaker 1>galaxy is dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we see the pictures of galaxies </v>

2911
02:11:20.711 --> 02:11:20.711
<v Speaker 1>that you see that look very beautiful.</v>

2912
02:11:20.711 --> 02:11:23.120
<v Speaker 1>The actual size of the galaxy is much </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than that,</v>

2913
02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:28.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's all dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The galaxy you see is a tiny little </v>

2914
02:11:28.330 --> 02:11:28.330
<v Speaker 1>puddle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2915
02:11:28.330 --> 02:11:33.040
<v Speaker 1>one fifth of the total mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it sort of settled down to the </v>

2916
02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:34.700
<v Speaker 1>center of this big puffy cloud of dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

2917
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the.</v>

2918
02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:37.940
<v Speaker 1>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2919
02:11:37.941 --> 02:11:40.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a galaxy that is only dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

2920
02:11:40.221 --> 02:11:43.280
<v Speaker 1>What they really mean is it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>only dark matter.</v>

2921
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:48.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a puffy coat or dark matter where </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the stars have been pushed out </v>

2922
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>by something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of the stars or the gas you can</v>

2923
02:11:49.971 --> 02:11:53.480
<v Speaker 1>still see orbiting around and that tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>you there's a some concentration of dark</v>

2924
02:11:53.481 --> 02:11:56.980
<v Speaker 1>matter there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we know what dark matter is or does?</v>

2925
02:11:56.981 --> 02:11:57.710
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>

2926
02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.620
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps were the biggest theory,</v>

2927
02:12:00.650 --> 02:12:03.350
<v Speaker 1>but there's alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one alternative.</v>

2928
02:12:03.351 --> 02:12:08.351
<v Speaker 1>It could be small black holes that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>made in the very early universe that </v>

2929
02:12:08.351 --> 02:12:09.050
<v Speaker 1>seems unlikely.</v>

2930
02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:12.920
<v Speaker 1>There's another kind of subatomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>particle called the axion,</v>

2931
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:18.310
<v Speaker 1>which is nice because people invented it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for totally different reasons and they </v>

2932
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:21.911
<v Speaker 1>also worked out that could give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the right abundance to be the </v>

2933
02:12:21.911 --> 02:12:21.911
<v Speaker 1>dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a whole,</v>

2934
02:12:21.911 --> 02:12:21.950
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2935
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:24.680
<v Speaker 1>dozens of different theories out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for what it could be.</v>

2936
02:12:24.681 --> 02:12:29.681
<v Speaker 1>So we're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out which one is </v>

2937
02:12:29.681 --> 02:12:31.421
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird thing to have something </v>

2938
02:12:31.421 --> 02:12:34.511
<v Speaker 1>that's invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant percentage of the entire </v>

2939
02:12:34.511 --> 02:12:35.570
<v Speaker 1>universe in a large percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>

2940
02:12:35.571 --> 02:12:35.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2941
02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Percentage of galaxies as dark matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>most nineties in the nineties.</v>

2942
02:12:40.911 --> 02:12:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2943
02:12:41.571 --> 02:12:43.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 75 percent,</v>

2944
02:12:43.341 --> 02:12:48.341
<v Speaker 1>80 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that depends on the </v>

2945
02:12:48.341 --> 02:12:48.341
<v Speaker 1>galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2946
02:12:48.341 --> 02:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what right to be think that we have to </v>

2947
02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:53.450
<v Speaker 1>think that most of the universe should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be readily visible to us.</v>

2948
02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does dark matter exists on earth or is </v>

2949
02:12:58.540 --> 02:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>it only in deep space?</v>

2950
02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what the right theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark matter is.</v>

2951
02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:06.720
<v Speaker 1>But in most theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are dark matter particles passing </v>

2952
02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.581
<v Speaker 1>through your body right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this wimps detection theory of </v>

2953
02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:12.560
<v Speaker 1>where they've developed these detectors </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep in the ground,</v>

2954
02:13:13.070 --> 02:13:16.910
<v Speaker 1>would that would be able to detect </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's actually prevalent here</v>

2955
02:13:16.911 --> 02:13:17.780
<v Speaker 1>on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2956
02:13:18.230 --> 02:13:19.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that they're stuck to here </v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth,</v>

2957
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:21.860
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth is just moving through space,</v>

2958
02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:27.020
<v Speaker 1>so there's a wind of dark matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles that were passing through and </v>

2959
02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>occasionally bumping into and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving in some sort of a spiral through </v>

2960
02:13:31.690 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>the moving and we're orbiting</v>

2961
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.790
<v Speaker 3>around the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2962
02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the,</v>

2963
02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:37.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Big bang one is another weird one.</v>

2964
02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:42.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was watching this thing on </v>

2965
02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.580
<v Speaker 3>television that was proposing </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative theories to the big bang and</v>

2966
02:13:44.581 --> 02:13:49.581
<v Speaker 3>one of them was that the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 3>next to another universe and that </v>

2967
02:13:49.581 --> 02:13:52.290
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another it collided with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

2968
02:13:52.590 --> 02:13:56.100
<v Speaker 3>And that this is a probably a process </v>
<v Speaker 3>that repeats itself.</v>

2969
02:13:56.130 --> 02:13:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I know we get paid to come up with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and that's what we're doing.</v>

2970
02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:00.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in starbucks with the pencil and</v>

2971
02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:01.680
<v Speaker 3>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2972
02:14:01.710 --> 02:14:03.570
<v Speaker 3>What do you buy iNto that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like which one do you</v>

2973
02:14:03.590 --> 02:14:05.080
<v Speaker 2>by handling it works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2974
02:14:05.150 --> 02:14:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't personally think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very likely.</v>

2975
02:14:07.101 --> 02:14:08.780
<v Speaker 2>It's on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reasonable.</v>

2976
02:14:08.810 --> 02:14:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Is it still on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a recent.</v>

2977
02:14:10.551 --> 02:14:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2978
02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:14.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was it first suggested?</v>

2979
02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe around the $2,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or so.</v>

2980
02:14:16.030 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 3>And did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a bunch of people jump on board or </v>

2981
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't say save something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes up.</v>

2982
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:25.321
<v Speaker 3>One of your colleagues has this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then you go to the cafe with your </v>

2983
02:14:25.321 --> 02:14:25.660
<v Speaker 3>legal pad and gore and how do we do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

2984
02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:26.530
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2985
02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:31.310
<v Speaker 2>And so what you would do in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so someone proposed an idea and you say,</v>

2986
02:14:31.311 --> 02:14:31.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2987
02:14:31.701 --> 02:14:33.560
<v Speaker 2>how would we test it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would we know?</v>

2988
02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2989
02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we said before,</v>

2990
02:14:36.621 --> 02:14:41.621
<v Speaker 2>maybe it predicts some pattern in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leftover microwave background radiation </v>

2991
02:14:41.621 --> 02:14:45.880
<v Speaker 2>from the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a different theory for what </v>

2992
02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:46.790
<v Speaker 2>happened at the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe your imprint post big bang is</v>

2993
02:14:46.791 --> 02:14:51.791
<v Speaker 2>a little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly the kind of thing </v>

2994
02:14:51.791 --> 02:14:51.791
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2995
02:14:51.791 --> 02:14:53.020
<v Speaker 3>the imprint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the microwave imprint of the Big bang,</v>

2996
02:14:53.021 --> 02:14:56.030
<v Speaker 3>this 14 billion year old event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2997
02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:01.380
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like terence mckenna had a fucking </v>

2998
02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:04.081
<v Speaker 3>hilarious way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a terrible job of butchering it,</v>

2999
02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.370
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3000
02:15:06.370 --> 02:15:08.850
<v Speaker 2>that people like,</v>

3001
02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:14.900
<v Speaker 3>it's funny how he was talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many scientists are atheists that they </v>

3002
02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:16.500
<v Speaker 3>don't want to believe in god they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to in.</v>

3003
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:18.960
<v Speaker 3>He was an atheist as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an atheist rather as well.</v>

3004
02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:19.620
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3005
02:15:19.621 --> 02:15:20.520
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are,</v>

3006
02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:25.760
<v Speaker 3>they do want you to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything came out of nothing for no </v>

3007
02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:30.621
<v Speaker 3>reason that anybody knows of 14 billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago there was this infinitely </v>

3008
02:15:30.621 --> 02:15:33.930
<v Speaker 3>small area that was smaller than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head of a pin.</v>

3009
02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:39.300
<v Speaker 3>And that's everything you see in the sky</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it exploded 14 billion years ago and</v>

3010
02:15:39.301 --> 02:15:40.530
<v Speaker 3>no one knows why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>

3011
02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:42.290
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

3012
02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:46.170
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that a mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy.</v>

3013
02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:49.170
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things that theorists,</v>

3014
02:15:49.410 --> 02:15:49.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3015
02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 3>people that are really into a god's </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

3016
02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:54.900
<v Speaker 3>they point to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3017
02:15:54.901 --> 02:15:56.550
<v Speaker 3>this is the scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3018
02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:58.260
<v Speaker 3>this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this event,</v>

3019
02:15:58.261 --> 02:15:59.700
<v Speaker 3>this is a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3020
02:15:59.701 --> 02:16:04.701
<v Speaker 3>this is the way bigger miracle than </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking on water or turning wine into </v>

3021
02:16:04.701 --> 02:16:05.370
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into wine.</v>

3022
02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

3023
02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:07.770
<v Speaker 2>baby stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3024
02:16:07.810 --> 02:16:12.390
<v Speaker 2>That this scenario would be 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatible with the laws of physics in a</v>

3025
02:16:12.391 --> 02:16:14.070
<v Speaker 2>way that turning water into wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of not.</v>

3026
02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the.</v>

3027
02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:22.250
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is actually not always </v>

3028
02:16:22.250 --> 02:16:23.880
<v Speaker 2>communicated very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big bang is the phrase,</v>

3029
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:25.680
<v Speaker 2>the big bang Is used in two different </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses.</v>

3030
02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:31.430
<v Speaker 2>One is what we call the big bang model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the whole history of the </v>

3031
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:33.760
<v Speaker 2>universe for the last 14 billion years </v>
<v Speaker 2>from an original hot,</v>

3032
02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:37.270
<v Speaker 2>dense state expanding cooling galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

3033
02:16:37.271 --> 02:16:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3034
02:16:39.370 --> 02:16:41.140
<v Speaker 2>That's settled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not art.</v>

3035
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:42.280
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3036
02:16:42.281 --> 02:16:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big bang model,</v>

3037
02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:45.910
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also the big bang </v>
<v Speaker 2>event.</v>

3038
02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.970
<v Speaker 2>The beginning of that story time equals </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

3039
02:16:48.971 --> 02:16:52.360
<v Speaker 2>The initial singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a prediction.</v>

3040
02:16:52.361 --> 02:16:52.990
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3041
02:16:52.991 --> 02:16:55.510
<v Speaker 2>if you remember we talked about in black</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes,</v>

3042
02:16:55.511 --> 02:16:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you have general relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>einstein's theory of gravity.</v>

3043
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:01.810
<v Speaker 2>It makes predictions and one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions,</v>

3044
02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:04.330
<v Speaker 2>if you trace the universe backward in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3045
02:17:04.331 --> 02:17:09.331
<v Speaker 2>you hit a singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit a moment when everything was </v>

3046
02:17:09.331 --> 02:17:10.180
<v Speaker 2>infinitely dense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinitely fast expanding,</v>

3047
02:17:10.181 --> 02:17:10.930
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

3048
02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:14.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the bIg bang moment and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly not true.</v>

3049
02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:16.860
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite of true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3050
02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:21.861
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no right to believe that that </v>

3051
02:17:21.861 --> 02:17:22.630
<v Speaker 2>actually happened because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction of general relativity,</v>

3052
02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:27.840
<v Speaker 2>but general tiffany's not right in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>regime because you're ignoring quantum </v>

3053
02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:31.291
<v Speaker 2>mechanics once again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't think that you </v>

3054
02:17:31.291 --> 02:17:33.070
<v Speaker 2>understand the fundamental quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical rules of the universe,</v>

3055
02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:38.220
<v Speaker 2>you have no right to say what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the big bang and what physicists </v>

3056
02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:42.541
<v Speaker 2>should say if they're being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that could be that there was a first </v>

3057
02:17:43.031 --> 02:17:46.150
<v Speaker 2>moment in the history of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first moment of time,</v>

3058
02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:51.370
<v Speaker 2>a day without a yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once we understand quantum mechanics</v>

3059
02:17:51.371 --> 02:17:53.170
<v Speaker 2>and gravity and how they play well </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

3060
02:17:53.171 --> 02:17:54.430
<v Speaker 2>that will all be very clear.</v>

3061
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Or there could have been something </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

3062
02:17:57.580 --> 02:17:58.750
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could be the,</v>

3063
02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:01.090
<v Speaker 2>what we call the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may have been just a phase.</v>

3064
02:18:01.091 --> 02:18:04.750
<v Speaker 2>The universe goes through occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this bouncing universe idea that you</v>

3065
02:18:04.751 --> 02:18:09.751
<v Speaker 2>were talking about with the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different universities hitting each </v>

3066
02:18:09.751 --> 02:18:11.581
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be an example of a scenario </v>

3067
02:18:11.581 --> 02:18:14.641
<v Speaker 2>in which the universe was eternal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it lasted forever and right now we </v>

3068
02:18:14.641 --> 02:18:16.360
<v Speaker 2>have no way of knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're very openminded.</v>

3069
02:18:16.450 --> 02:18:19.090
<v Speaker 2>It's 14 billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was the beginning,</v>

3070
02:18:19.091 --> 02:18:20.350
<v Speaker 2>maybe it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know.</v>

3071
02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:22.610
<v Speaker 2>What do you take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3072
02:18:23.170 --> 02:18:28.170
<v Speaker 2>of the idea that the big bang is process</v>
<v Speaker 2>a continual expansion and contraction </v>

3073
02:18:30.191 --> 02:18:32.620
<v Speaker 2>process and that it starts with the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>bang,</v>

3074
02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:37.860
<v Speaker 2>the universe expands and then somehow in</v>
<v Speaker 2>other polls back into itself until it </v>

3075
02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:40.060
<v Speaker 2>becomes this incredibly dense small </v>
<v Speaker 2>point again.</v>

3076
02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:42.010
<v Speaker 2>And then the whole process starts from </v>
<v Speaker 2>scratch,</v>

3077
02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:42.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3078
02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the scenarios on the </v>

3079
02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:47.460
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3080
02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:47.460
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3081
02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:51.250
<v Speaker 2>this idea that you referred to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was what was originally called the</v>

3082
02:18:51.251 --> 02:18:56.251
<v Speaker 2>egg pie erotic universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask why it was some ancient </v>

3083
02:18:56.251 --> 02:18:56.251
<v Speaker 2>greeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool name.</v>

3084
02:18:56.251 --> 02:18:56.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool word name.</v>

3085
02:18:56.251 --> 02:19:01.111
<v Speaker 2>So that was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this extra dimension in two </v>

3086
02:19:01.111 --> 02:19:02.170
<v Speaker 2>universes of smacking into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They later realized the same people,</v>

3087
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:07.230
<v Speaker 2>very well known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respectable physicists realized they </v>

3088
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:10.051
<v Speaker 2>could just play the game over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again so you could have this smacking </v>

3089
02:19:10.051 --> 02:19:11.590
<v Speaker 2>together call that the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it expands and cools,</v>

3090
02:19:11.591 --> 02:19:16.591
<v Speaker 2>but then it recontract and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>another bounce and just goes on an </v>

3091
02:19:16.591 --> 02:19:20.671
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am personally not that fond of this </v>

3092
02:19:20.671 --> 02:19:20.671
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

3093
02:19:20.671 --> 02:19:25.651
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence whatsoever or reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>to believe that our universe will ever </v>

3094
02:19:25.651 --> 02:19:26.230
<v Speaker 2>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not only expanding,</v>

3095
02:19:26.231 --> 02:19:31.231
<v Speaker 2>but it's expanding and faster as doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite of what you would expect </v>

3096
02:19:31.231 --> 02:19:32.120
<v Speaker 2>for we're going to contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think that's very likely.</v>

3097
02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:37.960
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the single most impressive empirical </v>

3098
02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:42.611
<v Speaker 2>fact about the universe is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between the past and the </v>

3099
02:19:42.611 --> 02:19:42.611
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call the arrow of time,</v>

3100
02:19:42.611 --> 02:19:43.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

3101
02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:45.740
<v Speaker 2>you remember the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not the future.</v>

3102
02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:48.020
<v Speaker 2>You make choices now that affect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

3103
02:19:48.021 --> 02:19:53.021
<v Speaker 2>but not the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this difference between the past and </v>

3104
02:19:53.021 --> 02:19:54.980
<v Speaker 2>future is nowhere built into the laws of</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics as we know them.</v>

3105
02:19:54.981 --> 02:19:58.310
<v Speaker 2>All the laws of physics that we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat the past and future the same.</v>

3106
02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:02.030
<v Speaker 2>The reason why there's a difference is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the big bang,</v>

3107
02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:07.080
<v Speaker 2>because the big bang was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very special organized state that the </v>

3108
02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:11.741
<v Speaker 2>universe could be in and ever since then</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have been expanding and cooling and </v>

3109
02:20:11.741 --> 02:20:16.661
<v Speaker 2>sort of winding down and that's the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to explain if you want to </v>

3110
02:20:17.121 --> 02:20:22.121
<v Speaker 2>explain the origin of the universe in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>view and the idea that there's an </v>

3111
02:20:22.121 --> 02:20:23.120
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't explain that fact at all.</v>

3112
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:26.940
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawrence krauss was trying to explain to</v>

3113
02:20:26.941 --> 02:20:31.941
<v Speaker 3>me the size of the universe and the age </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the universe and he was saying that </v>

3114
02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:37.280
<v Speaker 3>14 billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when we look back into the known </v>

3115
02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:37.320
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

3116
02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:39.600
<v Speaker 3>what we can say is like 14 billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

3117
02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:44.900
<v Speaker 3>but he was saying that that essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that that's as far back as </v>

3118
02:20:45.601 --> 02:20:50.601
<v Speaker 3>it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means that space is moving </v>

3119
02:20:50.601 --> 02:20:52.380
<v Speaker 3>faster than light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get back to that distance,</v>

3120
02:20:52.381 --> 02:20:54.750
<v Speaker 3>there might be something even further </v>
<v Speaker 3>back than that,</v>

3121
02:20:54.751 --> 02:20:56.280
<v Speaker 3>but we're not going to ever be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it.</v>

3122
02:20:56.910 --> 02:20:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I hope he didn't say exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he did.</v>

3123
02:20:59.670 --> 02:21:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fuck that up,</v>

3124
02:21:01.081 --> 02:21:01.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

3125
02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:06.600
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes even my favorite people in </v>

3126
02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:08.590
<v Speaker 2>cosmology used this language of space </v>
<v Speaker 2>expanding faster than light.</v>

3127
02:21:09.370 --> 02:21:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Entirely bullshit because space doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the speed.</v>

3128
02:21:13.390 --> 02:21:16.480
<v Speaker 2>The expansion of space is the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the question.</v>

3129
02:21:16.481 --> 02:21:18.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spaces this big.</v>

3130
02:21:18.730 --> 02:21:21.100
<v Speaker 2>By whaT amount has it expanded in</v>

3131
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:22.540
<v Speaker 3>one year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One second later,</v>

3132
02:21:22.570 --> 02:21:24.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have heard that expression before,</v>

3133
02:21:24.491 --> 02:21:26.920
<v Speaker 3>that space is moving faster than light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why now?</v>

3134
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Why did they say they shouldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3135
02:21:28.990 --> 02:21:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know because they're lazy and bad.</v>

3136
02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Saying that these are like high level </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

3137
02:21:34.391 --> 02:21:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3138
02:21:35.650 --> 02:21:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the never going to be invited</v>

3139
02:21:37.961 --> 02:21:40.570
<v Speaker 3>back to cosmology conference after this </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast?</v>

3140
02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always have the infinite monkey </v>

3141
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:45.600
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll,</v>

3142
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:45.600
<v Speaker 3>that'll be my new career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3143
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:47.020
<v Speaker 3>So what is happening then?</v>

3144
02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>space is expanding and light is moving </v>

3145
02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3146
02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And what is certainly true is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed of light is a finite number,</v>

3147
02:21:57.430 --> 02:21:58.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3148
02:21:58.370 --> 02:22:00.680
<v Speaker 2>It's one light year per year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way to remember it.</v>

3149
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the universe had a beginning,</v>

3150
02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:08.320
<v Speaker 2>a finite number of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's only so far out that light </v>

3151
02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:10.070
<v Speaker 2>can get between now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all there is.</v>

3152
02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:15.160
<v Speaker 2>So there are things far aWay that are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>far away we can never possibly see them </v>

3153
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:20.530
<v Speaker 2>at this current age of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it would take longer than 14 </v>

3154
02:22:20.530 --> 02:22:20.960
<v Speaker 2>billion years for light to get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to here.</v>

3155
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:24.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's just because the universe has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a beginning.</v>

3156
02:22:24.591 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with the fact</v>

3157
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.500
<v Speaker 1>that space is expanding at the speed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that speed.</v>

3158
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3159
02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:35.400
<v Speaker 1>if there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point where the big bang begins,</v>

3160
02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:40.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a single origin point and it </v>

3161
02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:43.620
<v Speaker 1>explodes outward and we are seeing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from some position.</v>

3162
02:22:43.890 --> 02:22:47.280
<v Speaker 1>So we're seeing this explosion 14 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years ago.</v>

3163
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Does it move in the opposite direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as their $28,</v>

3164
02:22:50.661 --> 02:22:53.490
<v Speaker 1>billion years and you know from point to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

3165
02:22:53.610 --> 02:22:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like that.</v>

3166
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:57.120
<v Speaker 1>The big thing is not a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3167
02:22:57.150 --> 02:22:58.190
<v Speaker 1>The big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

3168
02:22:58.220 --> 02:23:02.130
<v Speaker 1>this is hard to wrap your mind around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big bang is not a location in space,</v>

3169
02:23:02.131 --> 02:23:07.131
<v Speaker 1>it's a moment in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time in the history of the universe </v>

3170
02:23:07.350 --> 02:23:09.210
<v Speaker 1>when everything was on top of everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

3171
02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:14.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to talk about one </v>

3172
02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:17.960
<v Speaker 1>microsecond after the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the big bang one microsecond after </v>

3173
02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:17.960
<v Speaker 1>the big bang.</v>

3174
02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:19.350
<v Speaker 1>The universe could very well have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely large.</v>

3175
02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:24.740
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the universe started some </v>

3176
02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:24.740
<v Speaker 1>micro second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so any other time?</v>

3177
02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Infinitely small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3178
02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:28.470
<v Speaker 1>let's just forget about the infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>

3179
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insanely small things were closer </v>

3180
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.510
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as the size.</v>

3181
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:35.270
<v Speaker 1>If the universe is infinitely big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always infinitely big.</v>

3182
02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can still the big bang.</v>

3183
02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3184
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:43.410
<v Speaker 1>So if all matter is condensed into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very small spot,</v>

3185
02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:47.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that all things around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it are not infinitely large.</v>

3186
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to say around it because </v>

3187
02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the entire universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it visualize an infinitely big </v>

3188
02:23:55.111 --> 02:23:58.020
<v Speaker 1>universe full of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff,</v>

3189
02:23:58.380 --> 02:23:59.370
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies.</v>

3190
02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right now,</v>

3191
02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:03.930
<v Speaker 1>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's wind the clock backwards.</v>

3192
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:05.610
<v Speaker 1>So suck it all in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3193
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:09.300
<v Speaker 1>So the thing is that as far out as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3194
02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:10.670
<v Speaker 1>even if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3195
02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:12.810
<v Speaker 1>with your god's eye view faster than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of light,</v>

3196
02:24:13.050 --> 02:24:14.340
<v Speaker 1>there's still stuff out there.</v>

3197
02:24:14.370 --> 02:24:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It's uniformly spread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

3198
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3199
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:21.670
<v Speaker 1>But it's closer together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the relative size.</v>

3200
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:26.190
<v Speaker 1>The relative distance between galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stars is smaller in the past than it</v>

3201
02:24:26.191 --> 02:24:31.191
<v Speaker 1>is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the whole size of the universe is </v>

3202
02:24:31.191 --> 02:24:33.060
<v Speaker 1>still infinity and that's still true all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way back.</v>

3203
02:24:33.061 --> 02:24:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right up to the big bang.</v>

3204
02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:37.380
<v Speaker 1>The universe could have been infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

3205
02:24:37.381 --> 02:24:42.381
<v Speaker 1>but the density,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of stuff in a cubic </v>

3206
02:24:42.381 --> 02:24:43.920
<v Speaker 1>centimeter goes to infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3207
02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is the estimation that it was at</v>

3208
02:24:48.751 --> 02:24:51.030
<v Speaker 1>the moment of the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before,</v>

3209
02:24:51.031 --> 02:24:53.650
<v Speaker 1>like before it expanded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3210
02:24:53.850 --> 02:24:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's thought to be fairly small but </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely dense.</v>

3211
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3212
02:24:58.171 --> 02:25:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think you can say it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought to be in fairly small.</v>

3213
02:25:02.010 --> 02:25:04.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the observable universe.</v>

3214
02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:08.520
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is maybe what gets lost because the</v>

3215
02:25:08.521 --> 02:25:10.890
<v Speaker 1>universe is finite in age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only see a part of it.</v>

3216
02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see a part of it,</v>

3217
02:25:12.511 --> 02:25:17.511
<v Speaker 1>a few tens of billions of light years </v>
<v Speaker 1>across called that the observable </v>

3218
02:25:17.511 --> 02:25:17.511
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

3219
02:25:17.511 --> 02:25:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3220
02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:23.720
<v Speaker 1>so that definitely was smaller and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an actual number you can attach to </v>

3221
02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 1>the question.</v>

3222
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:28.240
<v Speaker 2>How big was it at the big bang and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know the answer.</v>

3223
02:25:28.450 --> 02:25:31.960
<v Speaker 2>We can sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on theoretical predictions.</v>

3224
02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:34.600
<v Speaker 2>It was the biggest possible size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have been.</v>

3225
02:25:34.601 --> 02:25:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Was about a centimeter across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest possible.</v>

3226
02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As big as it could be.</v>

3227
02:25:38.711 --> 02:25:41.110
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about essentially like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pinky nail.</v>

3228
02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:46.140
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's as big as the whole universe </v>

3229
02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:46.140
<v Speaker 2>could have been that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3230
02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:48.040
<v Speaker 2>In fact in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything you see,</v>

3231
02:25:48.041 --> 02:25:52.330
<v Speaker 2>everything around you right now that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can reach out and touch every galaxy out</v>

3232
02:25:52.331 --> 02:25:57.331
<v Speaker 2>there with billions of stars in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were all condensed into this one </v>

3233
02:25:57.331 --> 02:25:59.440
<v Speaker 2>centimeter cubic region of space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the large,</v>

3234
02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:01.240
<v Speaker 2>and it couldn't be much smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the largest.</v>

3235
02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:02.470
<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the largest.</v>

3236
02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's as big as it could have been.</v>

3237
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:05.550
<v Speaker 2>It could have been much smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have.</v>

3238
02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.790
<v Speaker 2>What is the smallest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have been,</v>

3239
02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:09.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be called the plank size,</v>

3240
02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 2>a 10th of minus 35 or 10 to minus 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>centimeters or something like that.</v>

3241
02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:16.540
<v Speaker 2>So incredibly tiny invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3242
02:26:16.570 --> 02:26:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very invisible.</v>

3243
02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3244
02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we think it happened?</v>

3245
02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the reason why the evidence we </v>

3246
02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:28.200
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3247
02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:28.200
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3248
02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:31.770
<v Speaker 2>what is the current theory as to what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the big bang.</v>

3249
02:26:31.771 --> 02:26:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Like why did the big bang take place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3250
02:26:35.021 --> 02:26:35.320
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3251
02:26:35.321 --> 02:26:40.321
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no preferred conventional </v>

3252
02:26:40.321 --> 02:26:40.321
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know that that's not,</v>

3253
02:26:40.321 --> 02:26:44.851
<v Speaker 2>that's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know because we're not sure </v>

3254
02:26:44.851 --> 02:26:44.851
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea is to answer.</v>

3255
02:26:44.851 --> 02:26:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously if there was a bounce or if </v>

3256
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:50.890
<v Speaker 2>there was some universe before ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of which ours came,</v>

3257
02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:52.720
<v Speaker 2>there would be a sensible answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3258
02:26:52.721 --> 02:26:54.250
<v Speaker 2>We just don't yet know what it is.</v>

3259
02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:59.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a more challenging question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that the big bang was truly</v>

3260
02:27:00.101 --> 02:27:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is perfectly plausible,</v>

3261
02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:09.100
<v Speaker 2>it's perfectly compatible with the laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>of physics and then you're in one of </v>

3262
02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:12.421
<v Speaker 2>these situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to reorient the kinds of </v>

3263
02:27:12.421 --> 02:27:15.001
<v Speaker 2>questions you will allow yourself to ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if the big bang was the </v>

3264
02:27:15.001 --> 02:27:18.361
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this intuitive feeling that </v>

3265
02:27:18.361 --> 02:27:21.271
<v Speaker 2>there was time before the big bang when </v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't anything and there was </v>

3266
02:27:21.271 --> 02:27:25.450
<v Speaker 2>nothingness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing just sat around for a long time </v>

3267
02:27:25.450 --> 02:27:25.480
<v Speaker 2>and then it decided to bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3268
02:27:25.850 --> 02:27:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Could've sat around for an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of years,</v>

3269
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:29.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3270
02:27:29.651 --> 02:27:34.651
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't think of it that way is what </v>

3271
02:27:34.651 --> 02:27:36.241
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't think about nothingness </v>

3272
02:27:36.241 --> 02:27:38.580
<v Speaker 2>transforming into the big bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about our universe thing of it </v>

3273
02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:42.781
<v Speaker 2>from the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the side that that we already </v>

3274
02:27:42.781 --> 02:27:43.390
<v Speaker 2>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but visualize into the past and imagined</v>

3275
02:27:43.391 --> 02:27:46.360
<v Speaker 2>that as you visualize into the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit a beginning.</v>

3276
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:51.630
<v Speaker 2>You hit a first moment of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a time when time itself came into </v>

3277
02:27:51.630 --> 02:27:56.221
<v Speaker 2>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no time out of which it </v>

3278
02:27:56.221 --> 02:27:56.221
<v Speaker 2>came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beginning of time.</v>

3279
02:27:56.580 --> 02:28:01.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like walking north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hit the north pole once you're at </v>

3280
02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:02.530
<v Speaker 2>the north pole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep going north.</v>

3281
02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.350
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just thAt everywhere,</v>

3282
02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:08.600
<v Speaker 2>every direction you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd now be south at the big bang.</v>

3283
02:28:08.890 --> 02:28:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Time is only toward the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not toward the past.</v>

3284
02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:16.070
<v Speaker 2>That's all my mind blowing is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>era of time,</v>

3285
02:28:16.810 --> 02:28:21.290
<v Speaker 2>the arrow of time is the particular fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that not only does time flow it,</v>

3286
02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:26.380
<v Speaker 2>the universe changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are differences between the past </v>

3287
02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:26.380
<v Speaker 2>and future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

3288
02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:28.520
<v Speaker 2>This time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is tough.</v>

3289
02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:32.720
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you guys sleep?</v>

3290
02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Very well actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

3291
02:28:36.350 --> 02:28:41.350
<v Speaker 2>like it was 10 years older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I first got interested in this </v>

3292
02:28:41.350 --> 02:28:41.690
<v Speaker 2>stuff and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

3293
02:28:41.691 --> 02:28:46.691
<v Speaker 2>when I was 11 or 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that would stop me from </v>

3294
02:28:46.691 --> 02:28:48.280
<v Speaker 2>sleeping was I be dreaming about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3295
02:28:48.290 --> 02:28:53.290
<v Speaker 2>the big bang in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I would come to the beginning and </v>

3296
02:28:53.290 --> 02:28:53.290
<v Speaker 2>we go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if the universe had just chosen</v>

3297
02:28:53.290 --> 02:28:55.850
<v Speaker 2>not to exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was no sleep for me.</v>

3298
02:28:55.851 --> 02:28:56.010
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

3299
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:58.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>choice,</v>

3300
02:28:58.130 --> 02:28:59.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know better now.</v>

3301
02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:03.390
<v Speaker 3>I moved on to other more worldly </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerns keeping me awake at night.</v>

3302
02:29:03.450 --> 02:29:08.450
<v Speaker 3>So is there anybody working on any sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of theory to try to understand what </v>

3303
02:29:08.821 --> 02:29:13.560
<v Speaker 3>forces might have caused it to burst </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth?</v>

3304
02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's two answers to that.</v>

3305
02:29:16.951 --> 02:29:18.630
<v Speaker 2>One is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of them.</v>

3306
02:29:18.631 --> 02:29:20.880
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of people thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of question,</v>

3307
02:29:20.910 --> 02:29:22.830
<v Speaker 2>but really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say it,</v>

3308
02:29:22.831 --> 02:29:25.980
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't ask that question </v>
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>

3309
02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:31.100
<v Speaker 2>we're embedded in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question you asked was what are </v>

3310
02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:33.000
<v Speaker 2>the forces that caused it to burst </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth?</v>

3311
02:29:33.050 --> 02:29:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that presumes that there was a cause </v>

3312
02:29:38.050 --> 02:29:42.620
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean causes and effects work </v>

3313
02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:45.711
<v Speaker 2>themselves out over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a time when there wasn't a </v>

3314
02:29:45.711 --> 02:29:48.840
<v Speaker 2>big bang and then there was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that caused the big bang to occur.</v>

3315
02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:54.370
<v Speaker 2>So what I want to suggest is that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not the metaphysical framework in </v>

3316
02:29:54.370 --> 02:29:55.500
<v Speaker 2>which to think about the origin of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

3317
02:29:55.770 --> 02:29:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask what caused it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked what were the laws of physics that</v>

3318
02:29:59.791 --> 02:30:04.791
<v Speaker 2>can be compatible with both the universe</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see today and with the universe </v>

3319
02:30:04.791 --> 02:30:07.620
<v Speaker 2>having a beginning 14 billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know the answer to that,</v>

3320
02:30:07.621 --> 02:30:09.920
<v Speaker 2>but that's the question we should ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3321
02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3322
02:30:11.530 --> 02:30:14.290
<v Speaker 3>it's such a complex discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3323
02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:19.060
<v Speaker 3>it's so complex that it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite and its possibilities that you,</v>

3324
02:30:19.061 --> 02:30:19.600
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3325
02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:24.190
<v Speaker 3>you go over all these variables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these possibilities and what we know and</v>

3326
02:30:24.191 --> 02:30:25.670
<v Speaker 3>what we're learning and it's just,</v>

3327
02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:27.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

3328
02:30:27.411 --> 02:30:30.020
<v Speaker 2>it's complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>

3329
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:35.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a realm that is just so far outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>our experience and our toolkit for </v>

3330
02:30:35.271 --> 02:30:37.970
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the world that we have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>guidance,</v>

3331
02:30:37.971 --> 02:30:39.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of at sea,</v>

3332
02:30:39.441 --> 02:30:42.290
<v Speaker 2>like what are the kinds of things we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be asking about?</v>

3333
02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:44.540
<v Speaker 2>What are the answers that would satisfy </v>
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>

3334
02:30:44.541 --> 02:30:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3335
02:30:45.951 --> 02:30:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that there are brute </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

3336
02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:54.280
<v Speaker 2>There are things we just need to accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we come up with a picture of the </v>

3337
02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:54.920
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of laws of physics and a story for</v>

3338
02:30:54.921 --> 02:30:56.420
<v Speaker 2>the history of the universe that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3339
02:30:56.421 --> 02:30:58.010
<v Speaker 2>the universe started this way and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened,</v>

3340
02:30:58.011 --> 02:30:59.510
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone says,</v>

3341
02:30:59.511 --> 02:31:01.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did it happen that way?</v>

3342
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.970
<v Speaker 2>And I would say there is no answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that question.</v>

3343
02:31:04.971 --> 02:31:09.971
<v Speaker 2>ThIs is just what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might change my mind if you convince </v>

3344
02:31:09.971 --> 02:31:13.211
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no right to demand that </v>

3345
02:31:13.211 --> 02:31:13.880
<v Speaker 2>there is a reason why things are one way</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than another.</v>

3346
02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you have difficulty like thinking of</v>

3347
02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:24.720
<v Speaker 1>a potential reason that one day we will </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap our heads around?</v>

3348
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Did he think that it's within the realm </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our possibilities,</v>

3349
02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>our understanding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always possible that there is a </v>

3350
02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>deeper explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3351
02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:33.300
<v Speaker 1>But then you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3352
02:31:33.301 --> 02:31:34.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that deeper explanation true?</v>

3353
02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And I think that this chain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations bottoms out,</v>

3354
02:31:39.050 --> 02:31:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that there will be one </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundational appointed,</v>

3355
02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:43.920
<v Speaker 1>which is not sort of self explanatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>

3356
02:31:44.130 --> 02:31:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And That's the way it is.</v>

3357
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Are there any legitimate scientists that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are contemplating the possibility of a </v>

3358
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:54.370
<v Speaker 1>big bang not being the origin of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe?</v>

3359
02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3360
02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:58.630
<v Speaker 1>The big baNg could be just one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

3361
02:31:58.631 --> 02:32:03.631
<v Speaker 1>One of these things that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a one possIbility is that there's </v>

3362
02:32:03.631 --> 02:32:05.200
<v Speaker 1>another universe that it sort of big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet and empty,</v>

3363
02:32:05.770 --> 02:32:08.230
<v Speaker 1>but through a quantum mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluctuation,</v>

3364
02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:13.260
<v Speaker 1>a little part of the universe could </v>
<v Speaker 1>pinch off and become a separate baby </v>

3365
02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:17.821
<v Speaker 1>universe and then grow by itself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be the origin of our </v>

3366
02:32:17.821 --> 02:32:19.160
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a stellar nursery for universes.</v>

3367
02:32:19.210 --> 02:32:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and It could go on,</v>

3368
02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:26.260
<v Speaker 1>say the great thing to really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't blown your mind yet,</v>

3369
02:32:26.261 --> 02:32:27.280
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm about to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3370
02:32:27.281 --> 02:32:29.590
<v Speaker 1>you already did put it back together </v>
<v Speaker 1>again real quick.</v>

3371
02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:34.150
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is finite in size.</v>

3372
02:32:34.151 --> 02:32:39.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about it could be </v>

3373
02:32:39.151 --> 02:32:39.151
<v Speaker 1>infinitely big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be finite insights,</v>

3374
02:32:39.151 --> 02:32:41.820
<v Speaker 1>but if it is finite in size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that a finite universe has zero</v>

3375
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:45.820
<v Speaker 1>total energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero total charge,</v>

3376
02:32:45.821 --> 02:32:48.130
<v Speaker 1>zero total velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

3377
02:32:48.580 --> 02:32:53.290
<v Speaker 1>so making a universe costs nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan guth,</v>

3378
02:32:53.291 --> 02:32:57.070
<v Speaker 1>who's a famous cosmologist and mit says </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is the ultimate free lunch.</v>

3379
02:32:57.280 --> 02:33:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Universes are not an expendable </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource.</v>

3380
02:33:01.090 --> 02:33:01.900
<v Speaker 1>You can make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3381
02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:06.960
<v Speaker 1>if you could make one universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make an infinite number of </v>

3382
02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:07.360
<v Speaker 1>universes just as easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

3383
02:33:07.650 --> 02:33:08.520
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it.</v>

3384
02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you understand there is.</v>

3385
02:33:12.470 --> 02:33:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's bath,</v>

3386
02:33:13.571 --> 02:33:14.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

3387
02:33:14.561 --> 02:33:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you look at the sun and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3388
02:33:16.571 --> 02:33:17.590
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would.</v>

3389
02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:21.070
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be like it would be hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a lot of stuff there.</v>

3390
02:33:21.071 --> 02:33:26.071
<v Speaker 1>It can just appear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the son also has a gravitational </v>

3391
02:33:26.071 --> 02:33:26.071
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3392
02:33:26.071 --> 02:33:30.630
<v Speaker 1>There's gravity around the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the math suggests is that there</v>

3393
02:33:30.631 --> 02:33:35.631
<v Speaker 1>is energy in the gravitational field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun which is negative and which is </v>

3394
02:33:37.211 --> 02:33:41.560
<v Speaker 1>exactly equal to the energy of the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cancels it out so that if you've got</v>

3395
02:33:41.561 --> 02:33:43.450
<v Speaker 1>a universe with nothing in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the sun,</v>

3396
02:33:43.451 --> 02:33:46.930
<v Speaker 1>that universe would have zero total </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy if it were closed in on itself.</v>

3397
02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3398
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:52.000
<v Speaker 1>It cancels itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3399
02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So negative energy in gravity cancels </v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive energy and stuff.</v>

3400
02:33:57.850 --> 02:34:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universes can have zero total energy.</v>

3401
02:34:00.490 --> 02:34:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And this is all obviously very </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical speculative mathematical </v>

3402
02:34:05.490 --> 02:34:05.490
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing we've done in the lab.</v>

3403
02:34:05.490 --> 02:34:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So take it with a grain of salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could change our minds,</v>

3404
02:34:07.601 --> 02:34:09.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's the current state of the art.</v>

3405
02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:11.640
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

3406
02:34:13.330 --> 02:34:17.440
<v Speaker 1>So the entire universe you believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolves around that principle.</v>

3407
02:34:17.470 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Free lunch.</v>

3408
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:19.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could easily.</v>

3409
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:22.840
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could make a universe at all,</v>

3410
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:26.680
<v Speaker 2>then you can probably make an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of universes just as easily.</v>

3411
02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:32.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you have a 100 pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe stuff and that gives you a </v>

3412
02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:32.480
<v Speaker 2>finite number to me.</v>

3413
02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:37.060
<v Speaker 3>EverY universe costs you nothing to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have a hard time even thinking of</v>

3414
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:42.150
<v Speaker 3>there being more than one universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yoU start thinking about the fact </v>

3415
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:43.830
<v Speaker 3>that there's 100 million galaxies in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this 100 million,</v>

3416
02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:46.630
<v Speaker 3>at least $100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million solar systems.</v>

3417
02:34:46.631 --> 02:34:51.631
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this galaxies is one of hundreds of </v>

3418
02:34:51.631 --> 02:34:52.300
<v Speaker 3>billions of galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the known universe.</v>

3419
02:34:52.810 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 3>And that there might be more than one </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

3420
02:34:55.360 --> 02:35:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that this was all for our </v>

3421
02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:03.480
<v Speaker 3>benefit seems a little ridiculous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>very tiny compared to the size of the </v>

3422
02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:04.140
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3423
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does get to be a bit of an issue at</v>

3424
02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:11.290
<v Speaker 3>a certain point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the massive at all is a defies.</v>

3425
02:35:12.010 --> 02:35:15.000
<v Speaker 3>It defies not just our understanding or </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

3426
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:18.070
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for the average person like myself,</v>

3427
02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:23.700
<v Speaker 3>it defies your ability to put the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're describing in the words,</v>

3428
02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:29.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of what the problem is.</v>

3429
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Training.</v>

3430
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we keep pumping into.</v>

3431
02:35:31.841 --> 02:35:34.350
<v Speaker 2>But here I can restore your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3432
02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:34.780
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3433
02:35:34.930 --> 02:35:37.060
<v Speaker 2>your thought that we matter for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

3434
02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Bring it back pretty bad because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrapping this up in some sense.</v>

3435
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in the middle of the smallest </v>

3436
02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:49.090
<v Speaker 2>scales in the important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe versus the largest scales.</v>

3437
02:35:49.091 --> 02:35:53.170
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the universe on very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small scales or very,</v>

3438
02:35:53.171 --> 02:35:56.440
<v Speaker 2>very early times near the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe looks very simple.</v>

3439
02:35:57.010 --> 02:35:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of complications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like We said,</v>

3440
02:35:58.721 --> 02:36:00.790
<v Speaker 2>you can't build a civilization on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>electron.</v>

3441
02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:04.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just no possible intricacies there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very simple thing.</v>

3442
02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:10.380
<v Speaker 2>The universe is also very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very simple and large scale and it will </v>

3443
02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:14.191
<v Speaker 2>get only simpler in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The university sort of dissolving into </v>

3444
02:36:14.191 --> 02:36:16.180
<v Speaker 2>emptiness as the universe keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>expanding,</v>

3445
02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:21.840
<v Speaker 2>it's only in between on scales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the size of a human being or the </v>

3446
02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:23.740
<v Speaker 2>earth and ecosphere that things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>

3447
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:29.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though we're much smaller than </v>

3448
02:36:29.250 --> 02:36:29.250
<v Speaker 2>the size of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're very big compared to adam's.</v>

3449
02:36:29.650 --> 02:36:34.650
<v Speaker 2>The number of neurons in the human brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>is roughly the same as the number of </v>

3450
02:36:34.650 --> 02:36:38.281
<v Speaker 2>stars in the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we are kind of a peak of </v>

3451
02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:42.640
<v Speaker 2>structuredness of the universe of </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity.</v>

3452
02:36:42.641 --> 02:36:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean until we build even bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligences and sO forth,</v>

3453
02:36:46.031 --> 02:36:48.640
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximizing.</v>

3454
02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Something that is a is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated on us which is not size or </v>

3455
02:36:55.241 --> 02:36:58.960
<v Speaker 2>scale or time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is complication and complexity.</v>

3456
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in the same sense that the energy </v>

3457
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:09.510
<v Speaker 3>and the gravity of the stars sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>managed to cancel each other out.</v>

3458
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Is that the case with people as well?</v>

3459
02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this is all again math,</v>

3460
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:16.340
<v Speaker 2>the whole universe</v>

3461
02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:20.930
<v Speaker 1>is a free lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The claim would consider a universe</v>

3462
02:37:21.350 --> 02:37:24.830
<v Speaker 2>with nothing in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you pick your favorite thing,</v>

3463
02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:26.480
<v Speaker 2>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a star or a galaxy,</v>

3464
02:37:26.481 --> 02:37:30.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the totaL energy in that thing,</v>

3465
02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:33.020
<v Speaker 2>minus the total energy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitational field,</v>

3466
02:37:33.021 --> 02:37:34.790
<v Speaker 2>because that's negative would be exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

3467
02:37:36.430 --> 02:37:36.970
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3468
02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:40.900
<v Speaker 1>That is super hard to wrap your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

3469
02:37:40.930 --> 02:37:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3470
02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the big question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3471
02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:49.280
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't get paid the big bucks if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it were using with the big question is </v>

3472
02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:52.741
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why do you think this is all </v>

3473
02:37:52.741 --> 02:37:53.800
<v Speaker 1>happening or do you ever use that word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>

3474
02:37:53.801 --> 02:37:55.030
<v Speaker 1>why is a weird word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3475
02:37:55.031 --> 02:37:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it weird is happening?</v>

3476
02:37:56.860 --> 02:37:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's causing it to happen?</v>

3477
02:37:59.830 --> 02:38:01.600
<v Speaker 1>What are the forces that caused it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

3478
02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:03.940
<v Speaker 1>You ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you ever look at all and go,</v>

3479
02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:05.980
<v Speaker 1>is there a purpose to all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3480
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3481
02:38:07.210 --> 02:38:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and I think the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

3482
02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that yeah,</v>

3483
02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:12.810
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3484
02:38:12.811 --> 02:38:15.800
<v Speaker 2>just looking up into the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3485
02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:21.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless the purpose was to make a pretty </v>

3486
02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:21.690
<v Speaker 2>sky boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that we're seeing here on earth</v>

3487
02:38:21.691 --> 02:38:25.500
<v Speaker 2>could have been done much with much less</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort than making 100 billion galaxies.</v>

3488
02:38:25.501 --> 02:38:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3489
02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:32.600
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence in anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've learned about science or the </v>

3490
02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:34.560
<v Speaker 2>universe that gives us a reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that there's a purpose behind it</v>

3491
02:38:34.561 --> 02:38:36.660
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>

3492
02:38:36.661 --> 02:38:41.661
<v Speaker 2>as time goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entropy of the universe is </v>

3493
02:38:41.661 --> 02:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>increasing and the universe is becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>more random and disorderly.</v>

3494
02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're riding a wave of a </v>

3495
02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:51.951
<v Speaker 2>universe that is growing and expanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cooling and becoming more and more </v>

3496
02:38:51.961 --> 02:38:54.420
<v Speaker 2>disorderly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a finite amount of time.</v>

3497
02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:58.020
<v Speaker 2>So 14 billion years from the big bang to</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

3498
02:38:58.021 --> 02:39:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one point.</v>

3499
02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:06.231
<v Speaker 2>four times 10 to the 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the future of the universe is </v>

3500
02:39:06.231 --> 02:39:09.060
<v Speaker 2>enormously longer thAn that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to our best current theories.</v>

3501
02:39:09.061 --> 02:39:09.900
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way.</v>

3502
02:39:09.901 --> 02:39:14.901
<v Speaker 2>It's potentially infinitely long anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last star is not going to burn out </v>

3503
02:39:14.901 --> 02:39:19.041
<v Speaker 2>until a quadrillion years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are very close to the beginning of </v>

3504
02:39:19.041 --> 02:39:22.620
<v Speaker 2>the history of the universe and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not forever.</v>

3505
02:39:22.650 --> 02:39:24.600
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't last and infinite amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3506
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:29.630
<v Speaker 2>So the universe is a femoral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We human beings and living creatures are</v>

3507
02:39:29.641 --> 02:39:34.641
<v Speaker 2>temporary structures within it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that it's all for some big </v>

3508
02:39:34.641 --> 02:39:36.390
<v Speaker 2>cosmic purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to hold very little water.</v>

3509
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever contemplate what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what function human beings have in the,</v>

3510
02:39:42.941 --> 02:39:46.230
<v Speaker 1>in the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we interface with reality,</v>

3511
02:39:46.231 --> 02:39:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the way we interface with our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature around us?</v>

3512
02:39:50.430 --> 02:39:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

3513
02:39:51.121 --> 02:39:52.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the function.</v>

3514
02:39:52.141 --> 02:39:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what human beings are.</v>

3515
02:39:54.630 --> 02:39:57.090
<v Speaker 1>We should be glad to be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it while we're here,</v>

3516
02:39:57.470 --> 02:40:02.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nice to each other and try to learn </v>

3517
02:40:02.470 --> 02:40:05.631
<v Speaker 1>more about the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not if we choose not to do </v>

3518
02:40:05.631 --> 02:40:06.840
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going against any preordained</v>

3519
02:40:06.841 --> 02:40:08.030
<v Speaker 1>function that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

3520
02:40:08.031 --> 02:40:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you're a remarkably calm when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss these things.</v>

3521
02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:13.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any existential angst?</v>

3522
02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think the other way around,</v>

3523
02:40:15.811 --> 02:40:18.240
<v Speaker 1>and honestly this is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small amounts of data.</v>

3524
02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:19.770
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3525
02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:25.190
<v Speaker 1>from what I can tell when personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedies strike people who are </v>

3526
02:40:26.430 --> 02:40:31.430
<v Speaker 1>atheistic cosmologists and scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with it way better than people who </v>

3527
02:40:31.430 --> 02:40:35.211
<v Speaker 1>think that we're embedded in a matrix </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bigger purpose or a spiritual </v>

3528
02:40:35.211 --> 02:40:35.211
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3529
02:40:35.211 --> 02:40:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3530
02:40:35.491 --> 02:40:40.491
<v Speaker 1>because you get that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened and you have an infinite </v>

3531
02:40:40.491 --> 02:40:41.250
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when someone dies,</v>

3532
02:40:41.251 --> 02:40:42.900
<v Speaker 1>it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be sad,</v>

3533
02:40:43.290 --> 02:40:44.820
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say,</v>

3534
02:40:44.821 --> 02:40:46.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't have happened.</v>

3535
02:40:46.570 --> 02:40:47.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

3536
02:40:47.671 --> 02:40:48.930
<v Speaker 1>These are the kinds of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

3537
02:40:49.410 --> 02:40:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Damn dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>

3538
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Take a while to process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a long one.</v>

3539
02:40:54.390 --> 02:40:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Go out and look at the milky way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

3540
02:40:55.771 --> 02:40:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Have to listen to this about 30 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and take notes,</v>

3541
02:40:59.101 --> 02:41:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but thank you very much and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

3542
02:41:00.931 --> 02:41:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it.</v>
