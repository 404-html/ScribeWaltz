<v Speaker 1>I it shouldn't be such a big deal.</v>

6
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 2>I want to know right now on this podcast,</v>

7
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.870
<v Speaker 2>who is running this country?</v>

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different factions that you call the government.</v>

9
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.993
<v Speaker 2>History,</v>

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.953
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

11
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

12
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.413
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

13
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Everything has always been controlled by the government.</v>

14
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Since day one.</v>

15
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Look at the time,</v>

16
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 2>illegal aliens in the workspace as recommended by the commission,</v>

17
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:45.700
<v Speaker 2>headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan.</v>

18
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.720
<v Speaker 2>If you look into the experiments to prove that the earth is spinning,</v>

19
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 2>all of them failed.</v>

20
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.753
<v Speaker 2>Look into it.</v>

21
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 2>You're just having a burned this.</v>

22
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>If you look into it and you,</v>

23
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 2>and you have proof that it is round,</v>

24
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:56.650
<v Speaker 2>instead of going,</v>

25
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.801
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

26
00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 2>some scientists figured out,</v>

27
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.870
<v Speaker 2>somebody figured it out,</v>

28
00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.741
<v Speaker 2>somebody figured out.</v>

29
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 2>But you figure it out.</v>

30
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 2>You try to figure it out.</v>

31
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

32
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.120
<v Speaker 2>because when they look into it,</v>

33
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 2>it's common sense.</v>

34
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 2>And when you look into it,</v>

35
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.081

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>We'll get expression,</v>

152
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

153
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.790
<v Speaker 1>look to your right.</v>

154
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>She's there as well.</v>

155
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It's every day here we are together and I'm just not wired that way.</v>

156
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

157
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.043
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.780
<v Speaker 1>so he's the main figurehead,</v>

159
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

161
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.270
<v Speaker 1>He's the main guy like right up with Miscavige.</v>

162
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

163
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.640
<v Speaker 1>And then John Travolta somewhere in that,</v>

164
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

165
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 5>John was given what,</v>

166
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

167
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

168
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.350
<v Speaker 5>a designation called con where they hunt.</v>

169
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.331
<v Speaker 5>Could con not,</v>

170
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 5>can't good con.</v>

171
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

172
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

173
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>K.</v>

174
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>H.</v>

175
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

176
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>K.</v>

177
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>H.</v>

178
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

179
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>N.</v>

180
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.820
<v Speaker 5>Kakao.</v>

181
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

182
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

183
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.460
<v Speaker 5>He's given this designation of cocoon,</v>

184
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 5>which there's a policy that basically says you can kill another human being.</v>

185
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 5>If you were conned,</v>

186
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 5>you're going to look the other way.</v>

187
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.103
<v Speaker 6>And he was given,</v>

188
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 6>he was given that by l Ron Hubbard.</v>

189
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 6>Don't make me laugh cause you gonna make me think.</v>

190
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 6>Imagine thousands of emails come out with them talking about,</v>

191
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 6>we'll have the kids ready,</v>

192
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.191
<v Speaker 6>six,</v>

193
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 6>seven and eight in the hot tub at this time.</v>

194
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.221
<v Speaker 6>And there'd be,</v>

195
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't see anything like that.</v>

196
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.541
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

197
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:38.931
<v Speaker 6>it gets you,</v>

198
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:39.540
<v Speaker 6>it gets really clear.</v>

199
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 6>Where did it say that it was in those emails?</v>

200
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 6>There's fricking thousands of them,</v>

201
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.900
<v Speaker 6>but it said,</v>

202
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 6>we'll get the kids in the hot tub.</v>

203
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.573
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

204
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 6>I never saw that.</v>

205
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 6>Can you,</v>

206
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 6>can you see if you could find that Jamie?</v>

207
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 6>That seems like,</v>

208
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.473
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

209
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 6>I got so confusing now.</v>

210
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.331
<v Speaker 6>The libs,</v>

211
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 6>you confuse every and nobody knows what bathroom to use.</v>

212
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 6>And I was at a night club the other night and here's the ladies room right here.</v>

213
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 6>And the men's room was right next to is a pile of shit in the middle</v>

214
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 6>with a tampon stuck in,</v>

215
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:04.944
<v Speaker 6>in a fake mustache</v>

216
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 6>and it won't last long.</v>

217
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 6>Hold on.</v>

218
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 6>Immediate head rush,</v>

219
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:13.150
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>

220
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

221
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.211
<v Speaker 6>Oh by the way,</v>

222
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:14.841
<v Speaker 6>don't inhale it.</v>

223
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:15.674
<v Speaker 6>Just puff it.</v>

224
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

225
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.951
<v Speaker 6>I'm a pot smoker,</v>

226
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

227
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 6>Well you don't want to hail that.</v>

228
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 6>There's no filter on that.</v>

229
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.933
<v Speaker 6>What are your buzzy,</v>

230
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.240
<v Speaker 6>but often it's mind blowing when you learn that some infinities are bigger than</v>

231
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:29.084
<v Speaker 6>others.</v>

232
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 6>Joe Rogan just lean two feet away from the microphone and the properties of each</v>

233
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 6>of those regions,</v>

234
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 6>whether they're conducive to forming galaxies and stars and planets and people</v>

235
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:43.461
<v Speaker 6>may be different.</v>

236
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 6>So we could say logically in that picture that the reason the universe looks</v>

237
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 6>like the way it does is because we're here to measure it.</v>

238
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

239
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 6>we should leave it at that.</v>

240
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

241
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 6>We should close with that.</v>

242
00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:00.730
<v Speaker 6>That is the mind blower blowers and you know,</v>

243
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:02.500
<v Speaker 6>iron man has that blue thing in his chest.</v>

244
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.363
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

245
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't think women are evil.</v>

246
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:05.890
<v Speaker 6>I like iron woman or iron man.</v>

247
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:06.401
<v Speaker 6>Their magic.</v>

248
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:06.970
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

249
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.920
<v Speaker 6>But by ripping out that blue thing,</v>

250
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 6>you're ripping out their ability to have children and be mothers and everything,</v>

251
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.820
<v Speaker 6>and then you put in a piece of shit into iron man's chest.</v>

252
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.100
<v Speaker 6>That's what feminists and like this woman are there.</v>

253
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:18.934
<v Speaker 6>Shit chests.</v>

254
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 6>They're malfunctioning.</v>

255
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:24.600
<v Speaker 6>Robots kill Em.</v>

256
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 6>Milo wants genocide killing.</v>

257
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 6>So do you think that they're imitating what they think are patriarchal</v>

258
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:31.041
<v Speaker 6>societies?</v>

259
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 6>They're doing their version of it and that's what they're doing with this.</v>

260
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 6>The whole matriarchal posturing.</v>

261
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 6>It's like Clark Kent,</v>

262
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 6>I want to run an article.</v>

263
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.903
<v Speaker 6>I'm writing.</v>

264
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

265
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 6>you're not running it and you'd go Clark,</v>

266
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 6>simmer down.</v>

267
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:45.284
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

268
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Speaker 6>I look at the things that I went through as a gift because I have gotten a gift</v>

269
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:50.584
<v Speaker 6>of feeling</v>

270
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.670
<v Speaker 6>retired during my career.</v>

271
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 6>Who else gets that?</v>

272
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 6>Some people retire for five years,</v>

273
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 6>lose their freaking mind and up in the bar and come back and try to fight again.</v>

274
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 6>10 years later was a weakened body.</v>

275
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.661
<v Speaker 6>A mass comm.</v>

276
00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:08.170
<v Speaker 6>Abuse.</v>

277
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

278
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.653
<v Speaker 6>Why though?</v>

279
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 6>Why are they doing that?</v>

280
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 6>They're not doing it because they're physically capable.</v>

281
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 6>They're doing it because they never dealt with their life away from fighting.</v>

282
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 6>Fighting was there like fighting is who they are.</v>

283
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 6>Fighting is their persona.</v>

284
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 6>So take away fighting.</v>

285
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.863
<v Speaker 6>What are they?</v>

286
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 6>They're in the bar drinking away with.</v>

287
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.014
<v Speaker 6>They're not,</v>

288
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 6>instead of drinking,</v>

289
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.850
<v Speaker 6>putting the booze down and knowing what you are without fighting,</v>

290
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 6>being happy with that chapter of your life and being able to live who you are.</v>

291
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten to feel that and now I can fight with a peace of mind,</v>

292
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 6>knowing how good I am without fighting and how great I am with it too.</v>

293
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

294
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.013
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

295
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 6>that's what this thing's about.</v>

296
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.381
<v Speaker 6>All these fights,</v>

297
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 6>all these me attacking those challenges,</v>

298
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 6>coming back and winning and getting my belt back.</v>

299
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.833
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

300
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 6>that could only happen because I let go of control of the things I couldn't</v>

301
00:09:58.711 --> 00:09:59.544
<v Speaker 6>control.</v>

302
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.491
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

303
00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:00.851
<v Speaker 6>he had,</v>

304
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:02.920
<v Speaker 6>he would be the first man I think about that kind of stuff.</v>

305
00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:04.030
<v Speaker 6>I give a plane crash.</v>

306
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.170
<v Speaker 6>I already know I'm planning ahead.</v>

307
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.790
<v Speaker 6>Did I eat a Vietnamese guy?</v>

308
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:07.993
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

309
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.461
<v Speaker 6>Because that's easy.</v>

310
00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:10.420
<v Speaker 6>It's start or move.</v>

311
00:10:10.421 --> 00:10:11.860
<v Speaker 6>If you attack somebody bigger,</v>

312
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.630
<v Speaker 6>you eat somebody bigger in front of other people.</v>

313
00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:14.800
<v Speaker 6>It's going to alarm people.</v>

314
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.130
<v Speaker 6>But you,</v>

315
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.410
<v Speaker 6>you gotta eat a small person.</v>

316
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.970
<v Speaker 6>So stature is important.</v>

317
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.530
<v Speaker 6>I think if you come down a Viet,</v>

318
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.940
<v Speaker 6>people aren't going to be that upset at Ya.</v>

319
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.670
<v Speaker 6>Well that means people are going to be super upset.</v>

320
00:10:24.671 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 6>What are you talking about?</v>

321
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.230
<v Speaker 6>Tony's dad?</v>

322
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

323
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.140
<v Speaker 6>their sacrifice.</v>

324
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.980
<v Speaker 6>They're more understanding of things,</v>

325
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:30.430
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

326
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.780
<v Speaker 6>this is the character you're playing.</v>

327
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.973
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

328
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.720
<v Speaker 6>but if you eat a black dude,</v>

329
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:36.610
<v Speaker 6>you eat a black lady and her family's here,</v>

330
00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:37.780
<v Speaker 6>they're going to be pissed.</v>

331
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.310
<v Speaker 6>So you think at Vietnamese person,</v>

332
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:40.144
<v Speaker 6>we'll let you slide.</v>

333
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.270
<v Speaker 6>I think that they'd be much more forgiving over a couple of day period.</v>

334
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.370
<v Speaker 6>I think a like their relatives.</v>

335
00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:46.030
<v Speaker 6>You don't think so?</v>

336
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.500
<v Speaker 6>Honestly one thing.</v>

337
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.951
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

338
00:10:47.951 --> 00:10:48.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

339
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.410
<v Speaker 6>I definitely think there'd be super pissed at you,</v>

340
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.850
<v Speaker 6>especially modernized ones.</v>

341
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.870
<v Speaker 6>But what is interesting is like Vietnam is one of the few places where um,</v>

342
00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.430
<v Speaker 6>Americans can go back to Vietnam and they don't seem to hold any grudge at all.</v>

343
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.953
<v Speaker 6>Exhibit a</v>

344
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.091
<v Speaker 6>exhibit a man.</v>

345
00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:05.924
<v Speaker 6>Honestly.</v>

346
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.740
<v Speaker 6>Do you realize 87% gout poll came out last year?</v>

347
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:14.270
<v Speaker 6>It's at 87% of the people on the planet or unhappy with what their life is all</v>

348
00:11:14.271 --> 00:11:18.500

351
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 6>Enjoy what they do.</v>

352
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.470
<v Speaker 6>You're one to 3%.</v>

00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:32.600

00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:37.620

<v Speaker 1>Disgusting.</v>

368
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:43.841

369
00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:44.770

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 2>how did he get in?</v>

442
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 2>We are allowing this to happen.</v>

443
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:34.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like we want it to happen.</v>

444
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a CIA,</v>

445
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Mk ultra experiment.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

447
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered how they're getting away with it.</v>

448
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 2>It's so out in the open.</v>

449
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 2>How come there isn't more psychic vampires stealing the energy from the kids</v>

451
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.150
<v Speaker 2>We're bringing God back in.</v>

452
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 2>He would swear that wasn't very religious,</v>

453
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 2>like Trump has gotten religion learning about this because let me tell you</v>

454
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

455
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves God and he's been briefed on all this</v>

456
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 2>and he's gonna roll their ass up so the pedophiles better get ready to do the</v>

457
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 2>rob trials even exists.</v>

458
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 2>That could be a conspirator.</v>

459
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:04.931
<v Speaker 2>Can I,</v>

460
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:05.764
<v Speaker 2>can I say one thing?</v>

586
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 6>line gentlemen.</v>

587
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 6>But I see a guy like you and I say that's appealing.</v>

588
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.430
<v Speaker 6>I look how you're dressed and you're in a conservative suit.</v>

589
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.680
<v Speaker 6>This is a nicer,</v>

590
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.800
<v Speaker 6>like I'm sure you could wear any suit you wanted but you chose assert that has a</v>

591
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 6>certain look to it.</v>

592
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

593
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.540
<v Speaker 6>I have spent some time asking around with this Joe,</v>

594
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.800
<v Speaker 6>but a bit like the same reason that we spent our time asking around with our</v>

595
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:11.634
<v Speaker 6>pocket square.</v>

596
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

597
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.630
<v Speaker 6>I remember thinking how much I found the suit repugnant and I became angry that</v>

598
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 6>the suit had been robbed from us,</v>

599
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 6>and so I had to create an alibi,</v>

600
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 6>a way in to understand why is that?</v>

601
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.573
<v Speaker 6>I'd like a suit</v>

602
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.390
<v Speaker 7>and you have many puzzles in front of you that you could solve,</v>

603
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 7>but you choose not to.</v>

604
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.001
<v Speaker 7>You know that.</v>

605
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 7>Those are the things that weigh on your conscience.</v>

606
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.401
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

607
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:39.570
<v Speaker 7>you know why I should really do this,</v>

608
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:40.404
<v Speaker 7>but you don't.</v>

609
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 7>It's like so I had this idea a long time ago because the world is a pretty</v>

610
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:44.611
<v Speaker 7>dreadful place.</v>

611
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:45.001
<v Speaker 7>I thought,</v>

612
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:45.540
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

613
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 7>what would the world be like if people stopped avoiding the things they knew</v>

614
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:50.544
<v Speaker 7>they should do?</v>

615
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:51.170
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

616
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:56.170
<v Speaker 7>Guess the question is how much are we contributing to the fact that life is a,</v>

617
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 7>is an existential catastrophe and a tragedy?</v>

618
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 7>How much is our own corruption contributing to that?</v>

619
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 7>How to really worthwhile question the things you leave undone because you're</v>

620
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:06.931
<v Speaker 7>angry,</v>

621
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:07.621
<v Speaker 7>you're resentful,</v>

622
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:08.191
<v Speaker 7>you're lazy,</v>

623
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:09.024
<v Speaker 7>you have a neuro Shia,</v>

624
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.850
<v Speaker 7>well you consult your conscience and it says,</v>

625
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:12.061
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

626
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:12.820
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

627
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.730
<v Speaker 7>got a place over there,</v>

628
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 7>could use a little work.</v>

629
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.490
<v Speaker 7>It's the same as working on yourself.</v>

630
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.440
<v Speaker 7>And so you clean that up because you can,</v>

631
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 7>and then things are a little clearer around you and you're a little better off</v>

632
00:19:23.971 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 7>because you've practiced a bit and and so you're a little stronger.</v>

633
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 7>And then something else manifest itself and says,</v>

634
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:32.190
<v Speaker 7>well maybe you could like take a crack at fixing me up too.</v>

635
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 7>So he decided to do that and then that gets a little bit more pristine,</v>

636
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.311
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

637
00:19:36.311 --> 00:19:37.144
<v Speaker 7>when soon.</v>

638
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:37.861
<v Speaker 7>And it's,</v>

639
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 7>it's humble because you're not exceeding your domain of competence.</v>

640
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.540
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

641
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

642
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 7>don't be fixing up the economy.</v>

643
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.660
<v Speaker 7>18 year old,</v>

644
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 7>you don't know anything about the economy.</v>

645
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 7>It's a massive complex machine beyond anyone's understanding.</v>

646
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 7>And you mess with it at your peril.</v>

647
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.090
<v Speaker 7>So when can you even clean up your own room?</v>

648
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.073
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

649
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.690
<v Speaker 7>Well you should think about that.</v>

650
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 7>You should think about that because if you can't even clean up your own room,</v>

651
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 7>who the hell are you to give advice to the world?</v>

652
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 4>And in the morning,</v>

653
00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.710
<v Speaker 4>this hooker,</v>

654
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.543
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

655
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 4>she just tells me like,</v>

656
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.350
<v Speaker 4>how much,</v>

657
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.290
<v Speaker 4>how much I owe her.</v>

658
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.681
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

659
00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:15.101
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

660
00:20:15.101 --> 00:20:16.390
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking outrageous.</v>

661
00:20:16.391 --> 00:20:17.590
<v Speaker 4>There's no fucking way I was,</v>

662
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:18.221
<v Speaker 4>I'd say it was like,</v>

663
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:18.940
<v Speaker 4>basically,</v>

664
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if you're a fucking pimp wants to kick my ass and fucking kill me.</v>

665
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:26.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm not paying that fucking much much for,</v>

666
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.300
<v Speaker 4>I forget it was so long ago.</v>

667
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.141
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

668
00:20:29.141 --> 00:20:29.974
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

669
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:30.731
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

670
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I was outraged beforehand.</v>

671
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.600
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

672
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.340
<v Speaker 4>it just wasn't in that case.</v>

673
00:20:36.341 --> 00:20:36.821
<v Speaker 4>I exactly,</v>

674
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:37.720
<v Speaker 4>I remember clearly,</v>

675
00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:38.290
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

676
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:39.101
<v Speaker 4>what do you want that much?</v>

677
00:20:39.101 --> 00:20:39.730
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

678
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

679
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you this much.</v>

680
00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:43.270
<v Speaker 4>And that's how much he get what period?</v>

681
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.360
<v Speaker 4>And we,</v>

682
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:44.570
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

683
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.891
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

684
00:20:44.891 --> 00:20:45.641
<v Speaker 4>we came out,</v>

685
00:20:45.641 --> 00:20:45.911
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

686
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:46.151
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

687
00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

688
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:46.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

689
00:20:46.961 --> 00:20:49.060
<v Speaker 4>I got to go film and uh,</v>

690
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.940
<v Speaker 4>well I can through,</v>

691
00:20:49.941 --> 00:20:50.774
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

692
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

693
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.800
<v Speaker 4>the lobby Knoxville is down there having breakfast.</v>

694
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 4>This hooker comes walking by and knocks on.</v>

695
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:57.124
<v Speaker 4>She says,</v>

696
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 4>that's not steevo.</v>

697
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 4>That's cheapo.</v>

698
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 8>That would be the scientific approach.</v>

699
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.753
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what it is.</v>

700
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.361
<v Speaker 8>Great mystery.</v>

701
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Speaker 8>Let's just wait and see versus a,</v>

702
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to postulate a lost civilization.</v>

703
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.330
<v Speaker 8>Nothing wrong with that Graham.</v>

704
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.590
<v Speaker 8>It's a free country.</v>

705
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

706
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.890
<v Speaker 8>and scientists do this all the time as,</v>

707
00:21:16.891 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Speaker 8>as you've mentioned,</v>

708
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 8>there's a rather humorous thing,</v>

709
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 8>which I have to say actually,</v>

710
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 8>I'm not even ask Jamie to pull up the,</v>

711
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.753
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

712
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 8>the a couple of images.</v>

713
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is embarrassing.</v>

714
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.680
<v Speaker 4>I remember telling my parents that I wanted to change my name to</v>

715
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.890
<v Speaker 4>Damien Monroe,</v>

716
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.010
<v Speaker 4>crystal Leah to Damien,</v>

717
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Damien Monroe because Damien was is the devil,</v>

718
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.071
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

719
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:51.550
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

720
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.580
<v Speaker 4>And then Marilyn Monroe was like pure in my head.</v>

721
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.181
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

722
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 4>you have both.</v>

723
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 4>I would ask my parents,</v>

724
00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

725
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.001
<v Speaker 4>I would ask my peers,</v>

726
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:00.940
<v Speaker 4>because I always sat like this at the dinner table and I asked him,</v>

727
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

728
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:01.901
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

729
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 4>can you call me crazy legs?</v>

730
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking like,</v>

731
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.921
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

732
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 4>like that would be cool.</v>

733
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Like if my family called me crazy legs,</v>

734
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.570
<v Speaker 4>it's Damien crazy legs coming at Ya.</v>

735
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:16.410
<v Speaker 4>And then they were like,</v>

736
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.141
<v Speaker 4>and my dad was like,</v>

737
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:17.830
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

738
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.420
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

739
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.800
<v Speaker 4>but just like maybe just at least at the dinner table,</v>

740
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 4>I remember saying that and you'd be like,</v>

741
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fucking calling you crazy leg.</v>

742
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.340
<v Speaker 4>We need you,</v>

743
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Chris,</v>

744
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about tiger woods and your podcast.</v>

745
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:30.340
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to on the way over here and I totally agree with you.</v>

746
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying like when tigers world fell apart?</v>

747
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:33.730
<v Speaker 4>Like how the fuck do you know?</v>

748
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:34.960
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you,</v>

749
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 4>did you talk to him like you don't know him?</v>

750
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.031
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

751
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

752
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

753
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.950
<v Speaker 4>that's just a bunch of hype.</v>

754
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 4>Like for him,</v>

755
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 4>it's like a double dump though,</v>

756
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:41.531
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

757
00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:41.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

758
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:45.400
<v Speaker 4>the thing happens personally with his personal life and it happens publicly</v>

759
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:46.360
<v Speaker 4>where everybody gets to see it.</v>

760
00:22:46.361 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that,</v>

761
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:50.010
<v Speaker 4>his body's falling apart at the same time no matter what he did.</v>

762
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:50.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

763
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:50.891
<v Speaker 4>No matter what.</v>

764
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 4>You're going to church every fucking week.</v>

765
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:54.250
<v Speaker 4>He was going to fuck up his back and his knees and they,</v>

766
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:54.731
<v Speaker 4>and it did,</v>

767
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:56.470
<v Speaker 4>but then they're trying to equate it to,</v>

768
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.333
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

769
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

770
00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

771
00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.030
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

772
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 4>I'd say what he did was none of my business,</v>

773
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 4>it's none of my fucking business.</v>

774
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to know about it.</v>

775
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 4>I hate no one about,</v>

776
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

777
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.420
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad if somebody like,</v>

778
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.320
<v Speaker 4>if the marriage falls apart,</v>

779
00:23:08.321 --> 00:23:09.600
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad if they get busted for drugs,</v>

780
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

781
00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

782
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 4>it happens if you fucked up and it's your fault,</v>

783
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:13.211
<v Speaker 4>you should get punched.</v>

784
00:23:13.211 --> 00:23:15.010
<v Speaker 4>But like the cops are handling it.</v>

785
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.030
<v Speaker 4>They arrested him.</v>

786
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.560
<v Speaker 4>The courts will handle it.</v>

787
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Do I?</v>

788
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.710
<v Speaker 4>Do I need to talk to,</v>

789
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I need to pile on and start wagging my fucking hypocrite and a finger at them.</v>

790
00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.090
<v Speaker 4>It's so immediate that you become this,</v>

791
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.030
<v Speaker 4>you become other,</v>

792
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.180
<v Speaker 4>you become an outsider.</v>

793
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 4>Like in the next morning when he went back,</v>

794
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 4>I rang the doorbell.</v>

795
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 4>I rang the doorbell to your own house and I lived in that house from the day I</v>

796
00:23:36.551 --> 00:23:37.360
<v Speaker 4>was born.</v>

797
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.200
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

798
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.480
<v Speaker 4>So you felt like you had to ring the doorbell.</v>

799
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 4>If this is not my world anymore.</v>

800
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

801
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

802
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 4>why don't you ring the doorbell?</v>

803
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

804
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

805
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.953
<v Speaker 5>there's no other,</v>

806
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

807
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.050
<v Speaker 5>there is nothing else like it.</v>

808
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.040
<v Speaker 5>This is not our home.</v>

809
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:51.883
<v Speaker 5>This is not.</v>

810
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 5>So we go and,</v>

811
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.001
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

812
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 5>we're packing all of our things.</v>

813
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

814
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 5>it was awful.</v>

815
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.250
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

816
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.083
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

817
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 5>I had been in those four months,</v>

818
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 5>I had been so terrified of,</v>

819
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 5>because I know knowing what was coming,</v>

820
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 5>like just imagine you're going to lose everyone in your life.</v>

821
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.361
<v Speaker 5>They're just,</v>

822
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 5>you're just going to like,</v>

823
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to like how your parents met and fell in love.</v>

824
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:18.221
<v Speaker 5>Or like your grandparents and family recipes and photos and memories and what</v>

825
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:18.921
<v Speaker 5>did the House looks?</v>

826
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm like taking photos and voice recordings and just all the time,</v>

827
00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 5>like an every,</v>

828
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.501
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

829
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:24.801
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

830
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 5>it's overwhelming.</v>

831
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.443
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

832
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.433
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

833
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.250
<v Speaker 4>so when you say something like,</v>

834
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.731
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

835
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:32.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

836
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:33.400
<v Speaker 4>we should be attacking Islam.</v>

837
00:24:33.401 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Islam as if it's something that is outside of Islam.</v>

838
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 4>That's simply false.</v>

839
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.751
<v Speaker 4>Islam.</v>

840
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:39.800
<v Speaker 4>Islam is Islam,</v>

841
00:24:39.801 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

842
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.641
<v Speaker 4>Ird,</v>

843
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 4>the one,</v>

844
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 4>the prime minister of Turkey,</v>

845
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Speaker 4>and I can quote many other,</v>

846
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

847
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Islamic experts said,</v>

848
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Islam is Islam,</v>

849
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:50.790
<v Speaker 4>the term moderate Islam,</v>

850
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.201
<v Speaker 4>Islam,</v>

851
00:24:51.201 --> 00:24:51.471
<v Speaker 4>Islam,</v>

852
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:54.020
<v Speaker 4>and all these other qualifiers are nonsensical.</v>

853
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:59.510
<v Speaker 4>And now the reason why that upsets me is because it grants people a false sense</v>

854
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 4>of security and hope,</v>

855
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

856
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Islam is wonderful,</v>

857
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 4>but we need to attack this separate thing called Islamism.</v>

858
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

859
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 4>from day one,</v>

860
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:09.200
<v Speaker 4>1400 years ago,</v>

861
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.730
<v Speaker 4>Islam was Islamism.</v>

862
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.061
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

863
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that there isn't a spiritual element.</v>

864
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that most Muslims just want to practice the spiritual part,</v>

865
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.900
<v Speaker 4>but there is no set of doctrines in a separate book called radicalized Islamism.</v>

866
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 4>It all comes from the same texts.</v>

867
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 4>It comes from the Quran,</v>

868
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.540
<v Speaker 4>it comes from the Hedis,</v>

869
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.770
<v Speaker 4>and it comes from the Sera,</v>

870
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 4>the biography of Muhammad.</v>

871
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

872
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.880
<v Speaker 4>so this kind of false narrative that people are promulgating so that they seem</v>

873
00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:41.600
<v Speaker 4>as though they're not frontally attacking a religion while laudable.</v>

874
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.291
<v Speaker 4>While Nice,</v>

875
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 4>I get that reflex.</v>

876
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.080
<v Speaker 4>It's false.</v>

877
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I talked about my dad with you,</v>

878
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:47.901
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

879
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:48.260
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

880
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 4>he was my wrestling coach in high school.</v>

881
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

882
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 4>he was also my,</v>

883
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

884
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:53.751
<v Speaker 4>earth science,</v>

885
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:56.300
<v Speaker 4>biology and environmental studies teacher.</v>

886
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 4>She was my teacher.</v>

887
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.970
<v Speaker 4>I want to drag you went to school,</v>

888
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.480
<v Speaker 4>your dad being the tea does fucking,</v>

889
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 4>I learned a lot because he was no joke.</v>

890
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:05.150
<v Speaker 4>He didn't pull any punches for me.</v>

891
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:05.451
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

892
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:05.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

893
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 4>he drove me as hard,</v>

894
00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:10.640
<v Speaker 4>if not harder than his other students who didn't show any favoritism.</v>

895
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.961
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things,</v>

896
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:13.520
<v Speaker 4>it was always his thing on the mat,</v>

897
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 4>and I'm kind of paraphrasing,</v>

898
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 4>but basically you,</v>

899
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.820
<v Speaker 4>you either win or you learn.</v>

900
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

901
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 4>especially in that high school,</v>

902
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.240
<v Speaker 4>college setting,</v>

903
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

904
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

905
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 4>you're learning about yourself.</v>

906
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:25.641
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

907
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 4>if you went out there and you got your ass handed to you and you just got bead</v>

908
00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.850
<v Speaker 4>and didn't learn anything,</v>

909
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:32.151
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>

910
00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking loser.</v>

911
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 4>Take the moment,</v>

912
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.290
<v Speaker 4>reflect on it,</v>

913
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.670
<v Speaker 4>build on what you did wrong and you now you're actually in a way you've won.</v>

914
00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.500
<v Speaker 4>You've now you know more about yourself.</v>

915
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.021
<v Speaker 4>You know about more your,</v>

916
00:26:44.021 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 4>your limitations are what you need to improve and expand your talents are your</v>

917
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.141
<v Speaker 4>limitations.</v>

918
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 4>So I guess whenever I'm doing a thing,</v>

919
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm always looking at it from a learning perspective.</v>

920
00:26:55.471 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 4>So there aren't necessarily mistakes unless they're fatal and then wouldn't know</v>

921
00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:00.661
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

922
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 4>So whatever.</v>

923
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Cause you see him in a club and he sees,</v>

924
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.870
<v Speaker 2>he sees some girls.</v>

925
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.243
<v Speaker 2>How are you doing?</v>

926
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.173
<v Speaker 2>Like BMW,</v>

927
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:09.080
<v Speaker 2>when girls go,</v>

928
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 2>what do you like?</v>

929
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.431
<v Speaker 2>You like BMW,</v>

930
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:11.120
<v Speaker 2>like cars,</v>

931
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.590
<v Speaker 2>like BMWs and crazy.</v>

932
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.020
<v Speaker 2>He'd take the girls out and go get a BMW.</v>

933
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:15.501
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

934
00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:17.000
<v Speaker 2>there was another guy standing on the wall,</v>

935
00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:17.930
<v Speaker 2>green jacket,</v>

936
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.060
<v Speaker 2>like green little jumpsuit.</v>

937
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's talking to him.</v>

938
00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Guess who was who?</v>

939
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Jay Z.</v>

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Nobody</v>

941
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:27.460

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:27.660

944
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.280
<v Speaker 9>He's just a great party.</v>

945
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Cause it wasn't too long after that accident that he had,</v>

946
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

947
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes,</v>

948
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:37.810
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

949

00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I know you could kill it.</v>

964
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

965
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.680

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.681
<v Speaker 2>Why not fuck it?</v>

968
00:27:58.681 --> 00:27:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

<v Speaker 2>of course you're Mexican.</v>

00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

971
00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:02.620
<v Speaker 4>I did an Adam Sandler film.</v>

972
00:28:02.621 --> 00:28:03.191
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that,</v>

973
00:28:03.191 --> 00:28:03.490
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

974
00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:03.790
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

975
00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:04.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

978
00:28:08.831 --> 00:28:09.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

981
00:28:12.161 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 4>And I used to star in films and it's,</v>

982
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.970
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird feeling for me.</v>

983
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.780
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm happy to be on the set and I love Adam and he's an old dear friend and</v>

984
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:21.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm super happy for him,</v>

985
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.170
<v Speaker 4>but I was starring in films,</v>

986
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:24.400
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

987
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere I go,</v>

988
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.111
<v Speaker 4>people say,</v>

989
00:28:26.111 --> 00:28:27.640
<v Speaker 4>why aren't you starting in films?</v>

990
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:28.181

00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:29.201
<v Speaker 4>What's up?</v>

993
00:28:29.201 --> 00:28:31.030
<v Speaker 4>And I can't answer it,</v>

994
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.170
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

995
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.280
<v Speaker 4>Poor choices.</v>

996
00:28:33.281 --> 00:28:34.091
<v Speaker 4>The weasel shit,</v>

997
00:28:34.091 --> 00:28:34.924
<v Speaker 4>dry it up.</v>

998
00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

999
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1000
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:37.900
<v Speaker 4>the movies didn't perform as well.</v>

1001
00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:39.190
<v Speaker 4>I didn't listen to my agents.</v>

1002
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't like doing drugs.</v>

1003
00:28:40.841 --> 00:28:41.381
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like,</v>

1004
00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:41.501
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1005

1006
00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.910
<v Speaker 9>It's just one movie didn't do so good.</v>

1007
00:28:45.911 --> 00:28:49.420
<v Speaker 9>Then the next thing that we didn't do so good and then they eventually just</v>

1008
00:28:49.421 --> 00:28:51.100
<v Speaker 9>stopped coming and he told us about money,</v>

1009
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:51.950
<v Speaker 9>shit,</v>

1010
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:52.210
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1011
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.070
<v Speaker 9>in his backyard and somebody thought it was a Baird.</v>

1012
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.713
<v Speaker 9>She would leave.</v>

1013
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.950
<v Speaker 9>She will let her dogs out every day and then she would clean up people.</v>

1014
00:29:05.951 --> 00:29:06.731
<v Speaker 9>French poodles,</v>

1015
00:29:06.731 --> 00:29:07.780
<v Speaker 9>when you shit outside,</v>

1016
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.490
<v Speaker 9>it's not going to be a decent shit.</v>

1017
00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.140
<v Speaker 9>It's going to be like explosive.</v>

1018
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.900
<v Speaker 9>So when I got up,</v>

1019
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.420
<v Speaker 9>it looks like somebody got shot in the head that we should all</v>

<v Speaker 9>French poodles Chihuahuas and she's looking at the wall like,</v>

1022
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:28.850
<v Speaker 9>All of a sudden she actually walks up close to it and squint and looks down on</v>

1023
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 9>it and looks around and runs in the house.</v>

1024
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:32.740
<v Speaker 9>I'm watching all this.</v>

1025
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.693
<v Speaker 9>I can't breathe.</v>

1026
00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.120
<v Speaker 9>Oh my God.</v>

1027
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:40.000
<v Speaker 9>I took a shit in favor in his backyard after a five hour drive from Colton or</v>

1028
00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:40.840
<v Speaker 9>some weird town,</v>

1029
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 9>did not talk to you after that for awhile I took a shit and then he ran over it</v>

1030
00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:47.170
<v Speaker 9>with his car and the whole back yard,</v>

1031
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.190
<v Speaker 9>smelly sewage waste.</v>

1032
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 9>I'd go with her the next day.</v>

1033
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.303
<v Speaker 9>He goes,</v>

1034
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 9>it smells back here.</v>

1035
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:53.530
<v Speaker 9>Let's walk in the house.</v>

1036
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.340
<v Speaker 9>I don't know what happened and you can see the brown shit.</v>

1037
00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.930
<v Speaker 9>You smashed it with this tire and a bunch of flies</v>

1038
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.640
<v Speaker 9>to talk to me for a month after that in some of these backyard</v>

1039
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 9>because I told him the truth.</v>

1040
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 9>I felt bad.</v>

1041
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 9>I lied to the guy.</v>

1042
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.600
<v Speaker 9>I remember I was telling you guys at one time,</v>

1043
00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:18.351
<v Speaker 9>my freshman year,</v>

1044
00:30:18.351 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 9>I didn't take a ship for a week and I had,</v>

1045
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.060
<v Speaker 9>I used to,</v>

1046
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.140
<v Speaker 9>I was addicted to steak,</v>

1047
00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:22.974
<v Speaker 9>comes with American.</v>

1048
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.390
<v Speaker 9>Jeez and all right.</v>

1049
00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:25.224
<v Speaker 9>A French brothers,</v>

1050
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.723
<v Speaker 9>listen to me.</v>

1051
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:27.580
<v Speaker 9>How long is that?</v>

1052
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.933
<v Speaker 9>I was in,</v>

1053
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.910
<v Speaker 9>I played freshman ball and we were playing Paddison east side.</v>

1054
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.070
<v Speaker 9>That's just a jungle of the school.</v>

1055
00:30:37.071 --> 00:30:38.750
<v Speaker 9>Like you gotta be careful when you're in there.</v>

1056
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.570
<v Speaker 9>And uh,</v>

1057
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.250
<v Speaker 9>we went there to play the Christmas tournament,</v>

1058
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:46.680
<v Speaker 9>but what kind of ball are we talking about?</v>

1059
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.600
<v Speaker 9>Basketball and I hadn't taken a shift from like 10 days or something.</v>

1060
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:51.351
<v Speaker 9>I took acid,</v>

1061
00:30:51.351 --> 00:30:52.570
<v Speaker 9>something to fuck my stomach up.</v>

1062
00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:53.630
<v Speaker 9>I didn't tell nobody.</v>

1063
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.770
<v Speaker 9>And those days I was really scared of doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody.</v>

1064
00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:58.970
<v Speaker 9>No Way.</v>

1065
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:59.181
<v Speaker 9>Home.</v>

1066
00:30:59.181 --> 00:31:00.050
<v Speaker 9>We got on the bus</v>

1067
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.770
<v Speaker 9>and while we were waiting there,</v>

1068
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.530
<v Speaker 9>my stomach started hurting and I said,</v>

1069
00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:07.430
<v Speaker 9>Jesus Christ,</v>

1070
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.950
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if I'm going to shoot myself a Fart,</v>

1071
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.600
<v Speaker 9>but let me just take a chance,</v>

1072
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.790
<v Speaker 9>and I blew this far.</v>

1073
00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:14.624
<v Speaker 9>Joe Rogan.</v>

1074
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.490
<v Speaker 9>That was so bad,</v>

1075
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:17.690
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1076
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.610
<v Speaker 9>We want a bus and people started running,</v>

1077
00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:20.720
<v Speaker 9>you know the school buses,</v>

1078
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.820
<v Speaker 9>people started running to the window,</v>

1079
00:31:22.821 --> 00:31:25.460
<v Speaker 9>goes right to swing down the bus windows,</v>

1080
00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.050
<v Speaker 9>but here's what you got by the,</v>

1081
00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:30.110
<v Speaker 9>I fathered again as the teachers would going,</v>

1082
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:30.771
<v Speaker 9>oh my God,</v>

1083
00:31:30.771 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 9>he's changing flavors.</v>

1084
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:32.614
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 9>What's the worst thing was the cheerleaders are crying.</v>

1086
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.830
<v Speaker 9>That's how bad they were sitting in front of a bus</v>

1087
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.420
<v Speaker 9>or the teachers yell.</v>

1088
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.851
<v Speaker 4>There's a building.</v>

1089
00:31:50.851 --> 00:31:54.720
<v Speaker 4>It's still there on Franklin and Hollywood where Charles Manson used to live and</v>

1090
00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:56.550
<v Speaker 4>run his or is out of,</v>

1091
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:57.660
<v Speaker 4>which I didn't know he was doing.</v>

1092
00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 4>He was a pimp,</v>

1093
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.010
<v Speaker 4>yet pimping girls to people that are staying at the Roosevelt color.</v>

1094
00:32:02.011 --> 00:32:02.461
<v Speaker 4>Me Badd.</v>

1095
00:32:02.461 --> 00:32:03.294
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1096
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>

1097
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 4>mine is</v>

1098
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.920
<v Speaker 4>perfect color.</v>

1099
00:32:10.921 --> 00:32:11.910
<v Speaker 4>Me Badd to Bam,</v>

1100
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:12.983
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

1101
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:16.350
<v Speaker 4>it's a hard one to learn but anything that's got an orgasm at the end of it,</v>

1102
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1103
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.170
<v Speaker 4>there's a degree of pleasure to be had but it takes,</v>

1104
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.470
<v Speaker 4>it takes a while to recognize or what they see the emotional cost of me to</v>

1105
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.030
<v Speaker 4>spiritual cost on other people.</v>

1106
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.550
<v Speaker 4>The fact that it's preventing me from becoming a father,</v>

1107
00:32:26.551 --> 00:32:27.600
<v Speaker 4>from becoming a husband,</v>

1108
00:32:27.601 --> 00:32:28.600
<v Speaker 4>from set Ellyn,</v>

1109
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.700
<v Speaker 4>from becoming rooted,</v>

1110
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:31.350
<v Speaker 4>from becoming actually whole,</v>

1111
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:32.340
<v Speaker 4>from becoming a man,</v>

1112
00:32:32.341 --> 00:32:33.510
<v Speaker 4>from becoming connected.</v>

1113
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.370
<v Speaker 4>And it takes a while to spot that.</v>

1114
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.490
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people don't get the opportunity to break out that pattern.</v>

1115
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.010
<v Speaker 4>I would never have spotted it had a not first being a heroin addict and going</v>

1116
00:32:42.011 --> 00:32:42.501
<v Speaker 4>hold on a minute,</v>

1117
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 4>you're doing that thing again.</v>

1118
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 4>Same with fame and celebrity.</v>

1119
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Well toxic,</v>

1120
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.080

00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:50.300
<v Speaker 4>exciting and brilliant and loads of lovely people in there.</v>

1122
00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 4>And I still like,</v>

1123
00:32:51.141 --> 00:32:51.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1124
00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:52.280
<v Speaker 4>I might make another film,</v>

1125
00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened but like it's because I'd had the template and</v>

1126
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 4>experiences of awe,</v>

1127
00:32:57.531 --> 00:32:58.420
<v Speaker 4>this is addiction.</v>

1128
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.500
<v Speaker 4>You're expecting this thing to make you feel bad.</v>

1129
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.060

1138
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1139
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1140
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood is such a labyrinth in terms of like getting shit done and getting</v>

1141
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:20.751

<v Speaker 4>So we can all talk to each other.</v>

1171
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1172
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:54.480
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.500
<v Speaker 4>So what you want to do is come down here and do your,</v>

1177
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.010
<v Speaker 4>We'll put it up on the screen.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

1179

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:06.603
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1181
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.160
<v Speaker 4>well I don't really want to tell you what it is.</v>

1182
00:34:08.161 --> 00:34:09.240
<v Speaker 4>What I want you to watch it yet.</v>

1183
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:11.730

1184
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.563
<v Speaker 4>that's not it.</v>

1185
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:13.530
<v Speaker 4>One more page.</v>

1186
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll find it for you.</v>

1187
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Just takes me a second.</v>

1188
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of bullshit.</v>

1189
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.170
<v Speaker 4>This is the craft by the way.</v>

1190
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.740
<v Speaker 4>And did you spell it right?</v>

1191
00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:24.001
<v Speaker 4>Astro.</v>

1192
00:34:24.001 --> 00:34:24.361
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>

1193
00:34:24.361 --> 00:34:25.194
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

1194
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Astra.</v>

1195
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:26.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1196
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Astra Astra not astro.</v>

1197
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.631
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1198
00:34:28.631 --> 00:34:29.464
<v Speaker 4>you're typing it.</v>

1199
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.180
<v Speaker 4>You just got to get,</v>

1200
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.611
<v Speaker 4>we've got to get,</v>

1201
00:34:32.611 --> 00:34:33.444
<v Speaker 4>make sure it's the right one.</v>

1202
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 4>So the hundred mile race that I was doing a month before Moab add about,</v>

1203
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean 12 miles roughly to the finish line.</v>

1204
00:34:42.001 --> 00:34:45.000
<v Speaker 4>My vision started blurring like in the periphery.</v>

1205
00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:45.781
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1206
00:34:45.781 --> 00:34:50.781
<v Speaker 4>and over the course of the next couple of miles closed in until it was pure</v>

1207
00:34:51.361 --> 00:34:51.840
<v Speaker 4>white.</v>

1208
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.730
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't see anything pretty much.</v>

1209
00:34:53.731 --> 00:34:55.980
<v Speaker 4>I would say like 98% blind.</v>

1210
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:56.760
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1211
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.460
<v Speaker 4>I could see my feet like right in front of my feet.</v>

1212
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.200
<v Speaker 4>But it was just white out.</v>

1213
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 6>When people heard about this,</v>

1214
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 6>like they're like problem with like click bait journalism.</v>

1215
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.650
<v Speaker 6>The headlines look like I was,</v>

1216
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.210
<v Speaker 6>it's like sexual misconduct stuff.</v>

1217
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 6>And like,</v>

1218
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be like,</v>

1219
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.753
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

1220
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1221
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.530
<v Speaker 6>let me just stop you right here.</v>

1222
00:35:12.531 --> 00:35:13.670
<v Speaker 6>If you say like one more time,</v>

1223
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:15.260
<v Speaker 6>I fucking head's gonna explode dude.</v>

1224
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:16.160
<v Speaker 6>I get comments like that.</v>

1225
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 6>It's brutal.</v>

1226
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:17.520
<v Speaker 6>Isabella,</v>

1227
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 6>is it as bad as all right.</v>

1228
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 6>I just want you to slow it down.</v>

1229
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to use it every now and then.</v>

1230
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:23.850
<v Speaker 6>This coffee break,</v>

1231
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.450
<v Speaker 6>you're breaking the like the like meter</v>

1232
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.041
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

1233
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm not stupid.</v>

1234
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:29.990
<v Speaker 4>And so I said to myself,</v>

1235
00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:31.700
<v Speaker 4>stop stuttering now.</v>

1236
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.350
<v Speaker 4>Stop Stuttering now.</v>

1237
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 4>I said that dozens hundreds of times over and over and over.</v>

1238
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:42.861
<v Speaker 4>And fortunately the storms went past and held onto the tree and soaking wet.</v>

1239
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:48.411
<v Speaker 4>I came out of the tree and walked back to where I was living and then the next</v>

1240
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 4>day I got up,</v>

1241
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see anybody and I was walking on,</v>

1242
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1243
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 4>on this path and a sidewalk and there's a lady that I really liked a lot and uh,</v>

1244
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.350
<v Speaker 4>but she was always attracted to the super self assured jocks and things like</v>

1245
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:01.561
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1246
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 4>She was actually very kind and sweet,</v>

1247
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.430
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't want to stare at her in the eyes because I would stutter.</v>

1248
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.680
<v Speaker 4>And it's humiliating for us.</v>

1249
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Speaker 4>So the more humiliating us stutterers feel,</v>

1250
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 4>the more we stutter.</v>

1251
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.090
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a really slippery slope.</v>

1252
00:36:18.091 --> 00:36:20.160
<v Speaker 4>And so I would avoid eye contact.</v>

1253
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 4>And so for the first time she walked towards him,</v>

1254
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

1255
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:24.871
<v Speaker 4>good morning,</v>

1256
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:25.141
<v Speaker 4>Paul,</v>

1257
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:25.651
<v Speaker 4>how are you?</v>

1258
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 4>She was always so nice to me and I was terrified because I'd embarrass myself.</v>

1259
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at her straight in the eyes.</v>

1260
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.560
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1261
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.341
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing fine.</v>

1262
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:33.174
<v Speaker 4>How are you?</v>

1263
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.430
<v Speaker 4>And I stopped stuttering in one day.</v>

1264
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:36.720
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1265
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 4>And this speaks to now what was been medically proven is that we can reset the</v>

1266
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 4>neurology of the human brain through neurogenesis.</v>

1267
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.580
<v Speaker 4>I believe that experience allowed me to map new neurological pathways that</v>

1268
00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 4>allows me to elocute in a way that I could not elocute before.</v>

1269
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 4>Used to hang out a lot with Dennis.</v>

1270
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1271
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.260

1274
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 4>was at a restaurant in Chicago not too long ago.</v>

1275
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:00.901
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1276

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.690
<v Speaker 4>Me and my buddy were hanging out with them.</v>

1291
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:13.561
<v Speaker 4>Talent,</v>

1292
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:14.311

00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:16.164
<v Speaker 4>haven't seen him.</v>

1296
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:16.740
<v Speaker 4>This is great.</v>

1297

1299
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 4>when you see a buddy you really love and it's really affectionate and Dennis is</v>

1300
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:22.321
<v Speaker 4>one of those people.</v>

1301
00:37:22.321 --> 00:37:24.120
<v Speaker 4>At some point he just gets up and he wanders away.</v>

1302
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 4>I think he's going to take a piss.</v>

1303
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1304
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 4>But 10 minutes goes by,</v>

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 4>I just figured he's gone.</v>

1311
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.780
<v Speaker 4>It's just the way he is.</v>

1312
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.190
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1313
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.023
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't even say goodbye.</v>

1314
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.903
<v Speaker 4>Just gone.</v>

1315
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 4>I get up the next morning I turned the television,</v>

1316
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.</v>

1317
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:42.853
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1318
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:43.320
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1319
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:43.621
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1320
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:44.970
<v Speaker 4>I spent an hour and a half with them.</v>

1321
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:45.571
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say anything.</v>

1322
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:46.590
<v Speaker 4>We go about going to North Korea.</v>

1323
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.240
<v Speaker 4>As I turned the television,</v>

1324
00:37:48.241 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like very controversial.</v>

1325
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Dennis Rodman to North Korea.</v>

1326
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.390
<v Speaker 4>So I text my buddy and I say,</v>

1327
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 4>have you seen the news?</v>

1328
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.511
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1329
00:37:57.511 --> 00:37:58.344
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1330
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 4>I say turn on the television.</v>

1331
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:00.541
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1332
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:01.081
<v Speaker 4>what channel?</v>

1333
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:01.381
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1334
00:38:01.381 --> 00:38:02.310
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

1335
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.370
<v Speaker 4>And two minutes goes by.</v>

1336
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 4>Holy Fuck.</v>

1337
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Cause he went through the same thing,</v>

1338
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:09.234
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1339
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 7>and the radio program director came into my town knew,</v>

1340
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:13.530
<v Speaker 7>and you know if you've ever been in radio,</v>

1341
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 7>when they come into town,</v>

1342
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 7>knew the first thing they're going to do is change everything cause they got to</v>

1343
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:18.180
<v Speaker 7>put their own stamp on it or why are they there?</v>

1344
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.690
<v Speaker 7>So this guy comes in and he goes,</v>

1345
00:38:19.691 --> 00:38:21.270
<v Speaker 7>well we're going to rebrand you.</v>

1346
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:21.781
<v Speaker 7>He goes,</v>

1347
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:25.260
<v Speaker 7>I want everyone to think of your name and instantly think of the brand and I'm</v>

1348
00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:25.621
<v Speaker 7>already,</v>

00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:27.721
<v Speaker 7>So here's what he said.</v>

1354
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:30.960
<v Speaker 7>So I hate to say this because this will become a meme online that I will have to</v>

1355
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:31.820
<v Speaker 7>live with the rest of it.</v>

1356
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.210
<v Speaker 7>But it's an absolutely true story.</v>

1357
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.290
<v Speaker 7>So the guy says to me,</v>

1358
00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:34.531
<v Speaker 7>he goes,</v>

1359
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:37.900

1361
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.001
<v Speaker 7>And I said,</v>

1362
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:40.541

<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1366
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 7>so that anytime anybody thought,</v>

1367
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:42.731
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

1368
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:43.121
<v Speaker 7>they would think,</v>

1369
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:43.331

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.410
<v Speaker 7>He really said yes and I say,</v>

1374
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:47.951
<v Speaker 7>I said to him,</v>

1375
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

1376
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 7>I said two things,</v>

1377

<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

1378
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.141
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

1379
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 7>the first thing is I got to live in this town,</v>

1380
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.840

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 7>so really you want that to be the first thing people think.</v>

1382
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.330
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1383
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 7>The second thing is I got to have a career after this stupid idea of yours fails</v>

1384
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.091
<v Speaker 7>and you're like,</v>

00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:01.841
<v Speaker 7>you don't understand.</v>

1387
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:02.030
<v Speaker 7>We're,</v>

1388
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 7>we're building up a mental image.</v>

1389
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 7>You'll be a household name.</v>

1390
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:04.961
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

1391
00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:05.171
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

1392

1393
00:39:06.131 --> 00:39:07.270
<v Speaker 7>The guy who fucks chickens</v>

1394
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:09.790

<v Speaker 7>after that,</v>

1397
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.253
<v Speaker 7>I finally said,</v>

1398
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:11.651
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

1399

<v Speaker 7>do you want to step outside right now?</v>

1401
00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:16.910
<v Speaker 7>I don't mean my wife laughed at me because I'm already an old man.</v>

1402
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.261

<v Speaker 7>cavalier.</v>

1556
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.550
<v Speaker 7>right to the time.</v>

1557
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.800
<v Speaker 7>And then with a powerful enough,</v>

1558
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:34.903
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1559
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.240
<v Speaker 7>telescope pointed at us to catch the light reflected.</v>

1560
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.231
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1561
00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:40.250
<v Speaker 7>You could use,</v>

1562
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:43.370
<v Speaker 7>just as satellite technology looks down on the earth,</v>

1563
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 7>you could see the reflection of the earth from that time and visually prove</v>

1564
00:43:48.711 --> 00:43:49.700
<v Speaker 7>everything you want it to.</v>

1565
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:50.661
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

1566
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 7>What the light is coming from the earth as you go.</v>

1567
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 7>You would theoretically be looking at earth at that point,</v>

1568
00:43:57.111 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1569
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.850
<v Speaker 7>The reflection of the light.</v>

1570
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 7>It's a as it's a million miles away.</v>

1571
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.533
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:03.261
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1575
00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:03.830
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

1576
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.570
<v Speaker 7>If you light the light,</v>

1577
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:06.973
<v Speaker 7>the light,</v>

1578
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 7>good time to be alive.</v>

1579
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 7>But as the human race,</v>

1580
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 7>as a person,</v>

1581
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:12.163
<v Speaker 7>all of us,</v>

1582
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.240
<v Speaker 7>there's no one gets out alive.</v>

1583
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.481
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

1584
00:44:14.481 --> 00:44:15.730
<v Speaker 7>One quicker.</v>

1585
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.880
<v Speaker 7>We remember that.</v>

1586
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.931
<v Speaker 7>The better.</v>

1587
00:44:17.931 --> 00:44:18.764
<v Speaker 7>We're all be</v>

1588
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.133
<v Speaker 7>not work.</v>

1589
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.890
<v Speaker 7>I was cut off a couple times.</v>

1590
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:28.900
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>
