1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.850
Yes.
Welcome back Dr Heart.
Good to see you brother.
Good to be here man.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.600
Pull this sucker right up to you right there.
That's been good to be a,

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
I was in Mexico City and I'm in my hotel room and is only like two different

4
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.130
channels that speak English.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.250
So while I'm forced to watch Fox News and I saw you on the bill O'Reilly show

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.760
those cluster fuck shows where they have one person like bill O'Reilly's the

7
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.260
host,
and then they have all these boxes with all these different people and

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.830
everybody's talking over everybody and the whole thing only lasts like three

9
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.920
minutes and they're tackling these complex subjects.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.960
You got maybe like a half a sentence out before you got interrupted.

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.540
I don't even remember what the topic was.

12
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.480
It must've had something to do with drugs and addiction.
They brought you on,

13
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.250
right?
Yeah.
I think that episode was drugs and texting.

14
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:57.460
Addiction,
texting addiction.
Really?
That's what it was.
It,

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.310
it degenerated into texting addiction.
Yeah.

16
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.110
Jesus Christ.
Um,
I thought it was marijuana or something.
I'm not even,

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.950
it was marijuana initially.
Right.

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.370
Because we can concerned it about what they were concerned about.

19
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.650
The Hud does oppose it.
High number of marijuana users,
the new high number.

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.090
Right.
And then the thing is,

21
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:22.380
is that I was trying to make clear that the numbers of marijuana users today is

22
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.110
considerably lower than that.

23
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:29.111
What they were at 1978 or 1980 and but they weren't aware of the information

24
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:34.110
from 1978 or 1980 is that like the numbers per capita cause there's so many more

25
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:37.950
people now.
No.
Yeah,
it was percentage of,
in this case,

26
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:42.390
the percentage of high school students who were of marijuana use in the past 30

27
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:44.820
days or the past year.
Okay.

28
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.740
I've recently found out that there's a hundred million less Americans in 1970

29
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.700
than there are today.
Yeah,
that sounds about right.
Yeah.
It's fucking crazy.

30
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
If you really stop and think about that,
I mean 40 whatever years ago,

31
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.490
100 million less people.
Yeah,
yeah,
Yup.

32
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.420
We're still growing.
Yeah,
we're fucking crazy.
We can't keep this up.

33
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.250
That's ridiculous.
So there were,
there were smoking more pot back then.
More kids,

34
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.260
more per se.
A higher percentage.

35
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.030
You had a higher percentage of Americans who were smoking or using any illegal

36
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:24.960
drug was about 1978 and 1980 but at that time period,

37
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.950
it hasn't been anywhere near that high today.

38
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.010
It was probably like right after the Nixon administration,

39
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.820
like that fucking idiot probably had everybody just doing drugs.

40
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:40.821
When you got a president that's that messed up gets busted with Watergate and

41
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.670
you know,
all just all the foolishness and involved in his administration.

42
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.890
I bet he led people to drugs.
Well,
you know,

43
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:49.020
it does a whole lot of theories about it,
but you know,

44
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:52.830
one of the theories is that people became distrustful of government and things

45
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:55.320
that government was saying.
So not only that,

46
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.900
kids were experimenting in the 60s and it said,

47
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.240
and this was later in 70 [inaudible] they were still experimented and being

48
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.150
distrustful of the government.
So it's not surprising.

49
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:09.151
But the thing is is that even then drug use rates weren't that high really.

50
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.430
I mean,
because the people who were using marijuana at the time,

51
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.650
they're now running the country,
they're now doing the Derren,

52
00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:19.990
these responsible positions and ended up doing about as well as previous

53
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.710
generations.
And so,
um,
uh,

54
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.020
it's not a big deal that people use drugs.
In fact,
you know,

55
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.360
I'm working on a new book and the thing is,

56
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:32.110
is that what I'm going to argue in the new book is that more people should be

57
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.710
using drugs.
Like what,

58
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.490
when you say more people should be using drugs.
Here's the thing about,

59
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.370
I hate the term I,
there's two terms that I have a real problem with it.
I don't,

60
00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:45.250
I don't hate them,
but I think they're,
they're,

61
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.210
they're weighted addiction is one of them.
And drugs is another one.
Yeah,

62
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.200
because addiction is like when you start talking about addicting,

63
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.430
being addicted to texting,
I have friends that are definitely,
uh,

64
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.430
they definitely are inclined to check their phone way too much.

65
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.610
Like they feel compelled when they're in traffic,

66
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.730
they can feel like there's a red light and they're like,
oh good,

67
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.030
let me check my phone.
Like I'm at a red light,
like Jesus Christ,

68
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.000
what the fuck is going on?
But I think that's an impulse.

69
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:17.380
It's just a foolish pattern of thought to call that an addiction and then to

70
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.120
call like alcoholism,

71
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.720
the same thing where you could literally die if you stop drinking.

72
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.590
Well that's crazy.
This,
these are not the same things.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

73
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:27.640
when we think about addiction,

74
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.990
it's a simple sort of definition that we use in medicine and the definition is

75
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:32.824
that,

76
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.150
does it cause you a tremendous amount of distress and is it disrupting your

77
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:41.770
social,
occupational,
your family sort of functioning that.
That's kind of it.

78
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.450
I mean,
so people can indulge in and behavior every day,

79
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.770
multiple times a day,

80
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:51.850
but they're handling their responsibilities and they are not distressed about

81
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:54.940
this behavior.
They wouldn't meet criteria for addiction.

82
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:59.941
Whereas somebody could like use alcohol or cocaine or some drug once a month or

83
00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:01.870
once a week or what have you.

84
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.520
And then they have all of these disruptions surrounding that drug use and they

85
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:10.720
may meet criteria for addiction.
Whereas I could be using cocaine every day,

86
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.430
but handling my responsibilities,
it,
I'm not distressed by it.
Uh,

87
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:17.710
I don't have these problems are related to it.

88
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.770
I'm not an addict even though I'm using it every day.

89
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:24.820
So addiction has to do with social disruptions and being distressed,

90
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.560
not actual amount of youth or how many times you engage in the behavior.

91
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.670
But this sort of definition is missed upon many of people in,

92
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.260
in a general population.
Yeah.
Most people don't think about it that way.

93
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:42.190
Most people think that if you don't use it,
you're an like,

94
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.250
if you don't,
it will save you do something every day.

95
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.350
Like I had a friend who was a longshoreman and he worked with this guy that

96
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:51.670
would shoot heroin every day at lunch.

97
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.420
And that always freaked me out because the guy showed up for work everyday on

98
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.400
time.
He was a responsible guy,
he was married,

99
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.690
<v 1>he had children and this guy would get heroin.
He would cop every morning.</v>

100
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.100
He would go there and he would sit in his truck and he would shoot up and you

101
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.370
know,
whatever,
however long that that lasts,
you know,

102
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.310
he gets an hour lunch break and they would come back and go to work.

103
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.880
And I would like every day he goes,
every day.
I tried did it every day.
Well,

104
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:21.680
you know,
this past summer,
the past three months or so I was in Geneva,

105
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.030
just got back in the states.
Um,

106
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.060
and I was working in a heroin clinic where they administer heroin every day,

107
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.110
seven days a week,

108
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.400
twice a day to people who meet criteria for heroin addiction.

109
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.320
And when I say they administer heroin,
I don't mean like small doses,

110
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.800
I mean doses that they'll up to like a gram a day,

111
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.450
a thousand milligrams a day,

112
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:47.660
a lot more than what people use here in the states typically.

113
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.010
And these people who are getting heroin every day,

114
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.250
a large percentage of them also go to work.

115
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.480
A large percentage of them have families and they're taking care of their

116
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:00.920
responsibilities.
They are,

117
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.980
this is their treatment and this is a treatment that works for them.

118
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.400
But their treatment include two daily doses of intravenous heroin,

119
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.560
seven days a week,
you know,
and,
and so like when I think about,

120
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.570
well one of the reasons I went there,

121
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:21.080
and I did this because of the way we think of heroin in this country,

122
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:23.120
we think of it as such as evil drug.

123
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.710
And that's just a American mythology.
And,
and that's just wrong.

124
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.690
And that's ignorance and,

125
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:33.110
but that's how many including drug experts in this country think of heroin.
But

126
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.620
we have all of this great technology,

127
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.650
but we're so ignorant when it comes to many of these drugs.

128
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.040
So heroin administered intravenously on a daily basis is not,

129
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.590
it's not devastating.
No.
In fact,

130
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.270
some people would do better about having the daily doses,

131
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.690
a daily dose of heroin or another opiate.
Um,
no,

132
00:07:55.691 --> 00:08:00.050
it's not devastating.
I didn't see even me.
I would go,
fuck man,

133
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:03.470
that's kind of fuck you up.
Like taking heroin every day.
Yeah.

134
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:07.070
And it's been this whole journey.
Men since I saw you last time,

135
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:12.090
I've been all over the world and this whole journey to see what people do with

136
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.590
drugs or with drugs they're using and how they do it.

137
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.380
It's been so eye opening even for me,

138
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:22.880
someone who has spent their life studying drugs and I'm learning so much more

139
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:26.690
now.
And,
but the Switz experience of,
uh,
the Dutch also do this.

140
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.090
There are some parts of Germany that does this.

141
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.390
They have small programs in the UK.
They had small program,

142
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.201
there are other countries,

143
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.470
but the Swiss by far have the biggest program and they've been the most

144
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:39.140
successful.
They've been doing this for more than 20 years now.

145
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.020
And they started doing this in response to,
um,
uh,

146
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.850
HIV concern.
People worried about folks getting HIV.
So they had to do something,

147
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.240
had to have clean needles,
we had to make sure that the drugs were pure.
Um,

148
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.130
so they're worried about death,
HIV,
all of those

149
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.401
<v 0>things.</v>

150
00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:00.300
And this was the rational response where they put it in a medical community

151
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:04.350
where people got treatment and,
and,
um,
along with their heroin.

152
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.670
And they have no plans of going back,
nor should they because it works.

153
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.210
Boy,
that's hard for Americans to swallow.
Right.

154
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.420
And is it because of all the propaganda we've been fed?

155
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.410
Is it because just of misinformation?
I mean I would say propaganda,

156
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:23.850
but even me,
someone who's a pro drug,

157
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:25.590
for the most part person I would say God,

158
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.280
heroin every day he's probably going to fuck you up.
Yeah,
I mean,
but you,
you,

159
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:33.150
you raised a good question.
Is that part of the propaganda?
I don't know.

160
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:35.540
I mean obviously there are people who are using,

161
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.130
who used this as part of propaganda,
but in part but not,

162
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.590
I don't think they're trying to use it as pop.
Granted,

163
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.260
I think they're ignorant and they're close meaning people.

164
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.320
But then there are other people.
Just think about some of the films,

165
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.230
train spotting.
You think of a numb of these films.

166
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.540
All of those films now can't use that salacious story any more.

167
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:59.250
Death grip us.
It's not reality,
but it's,
it makes great films.

168
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:03.630
It may great sort of subjects with documentaries when we think about musical

169
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:05.310
heroes and people will say,
well,

170
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.750
they were misunderstood so they use heroin and they weren't.
That's not,

171
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:14.010
I mean they use heroin because it's a rational sort of a use of the drug.

172
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.010
When you think about its ability to decrease anxiety,

173
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.040
it's ability to like make people or have people relaxed and just be in a space

174
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:24.480
where they finally can get some peace.

175
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:29.481
When you think about all of the things that many of these sort of musical icons

176
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:34.650
are,
these great artists have to do with,
it's rational.
It makes rational sense.

177
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:37.440
The thing that I'm trying to do is how do we,

178
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.160
how do we allow people to do these things and be safe?

179
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.120
How do we still keep them say,
because people are going to do it.

180
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.740
That's a fact.
I mean,

181
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:49.840
we've been trying to get rid of heroin or in our country for sometimes,

182
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.980
but every year we have 100 or 200,000 new heroin users every year.

183
00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:00.180
That number has not changed for 40 years.
Um,
and I don't expect it to change.

184
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.520
Well if that number hasn't changed,
but the population has increased,
you know,

185
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.500
how does that work?
Uh,
what,

186
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.380
that's why I was like between a hundred and 200,000 every year that,
I mean,

187
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:13.540
it's been,
it's been fluctuating between those numbers and,

188
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.810
but the point is that we're going to have a substantial proportion of heroin

189
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:22.950
users,
new new heroin users.
These are new heroin users every year.

190
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.510
And on top of that,

191
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.620
people don't consider the people that take opiates in pill form that are

192
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:33.180
prescribed by their doctors,
which is incredibly high.
And,
uh,

193
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:35.190
I've known many people,
I've,

194
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:40.170
I've close family members that have ruined their lives getting fucked up on

195
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:44.310
pills.
And I want to say addicted,
but now I'm,
I'm reluctant to say addicted,

196
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:47.530
but what,
maybe some word dicta.
I mean maybe that,
that,

197
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.310
that describes some people,
but,

198
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.880
but please understand the majority of people who use those pills using

199
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.790
responsibly

200
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.420
<v 1>and they know what they're doing.
But there are people,
like you said,</v>

201
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.580
who ruined their lives as a result.

202
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.320
But the the thing that we have to think about is that if the majority of users

203
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:09.850
of these pills are fine and then you have this subset to smaller subset who are

204
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:14.530
not,
it tells you that it's not the pills,
but by that same token,

205
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:19.531
there is still some issues I have with the way we have our pills or or the way

206
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:23.350
we do appeals in this country.
Opiate pills,

207
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.090
we put a seed of metaphysics in these pills and which I am not a fan of having

208
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:30.760
the seat of medicine in those fields because the seed of medicine,

209
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:35.761
it's the number one reason for liver toxicity and so sometimes if people really

210
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:37.630
want to push the dose of their opiate,

211
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.560
they have to get even more acetaminophen.
That would,

212
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.790
that's the more dangerous of the two and no situ in this situation.

213
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.930
Why did they put Acetaminophen in the pill?
What is the function of it?

214
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.850
It is stated that they put a seat of medicine in the pill because it's an added

215
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:57.970
pain reliever,
but I don't think that's the real reason.

216
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:02.190
I think the real reason that is in appeal is,
think of it this way.
Uh,

217
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.550
on the California highway,
I think the maximum speed limit is like 65 or 70.

218
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.490
Now imagine if someone designed,

219
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.540
so a car and let had tires on it that blew out when you reach 75 miles per hour.

220
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.430
So it's like the safety valve.

221
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.670
So you blow out the tires or somebody exceed the speed limit.

222
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.380
I think Acetaminophen is in the pills and opiate pills for that reason,

223
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.280
you take too much,
you blow out your liver,
you die really.

224
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.630
So you think they put it in there for added liver toxicity to make sure people

225
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:37.600
don't take too much of the opiates,
I think is in there.
Yeah.

226
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:41.920
To discourage the use of opiates.
Absolutely.
Wow.

227
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.060
And I think that,

228
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.320
and I think that's sick and I think that that's a problem because when you think

229
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:51.760
about even other countries like Geneva or Switzerland,

230
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.410
you don't see a seed of metaphor.

231
00:13:54.411 --> 00:13:57.490
And in these medications like they are here,

232
00:13:57.491 --> 00:14:01.090
you certainly don't have people prescribing them like they do here with the

233
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:05.530
Acetaminophen.
Eh,
you know,
it's like you don't need that in there.

234
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.050
If you want somebody to take an additional pain reliever,

235
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:11.920
you prescribe it or you tell him you recommend it,
but you don't need,
uh,

236
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.670
the number one reason for liver toxicity in a,

237
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.700
with opiates I think is there to have people blow out their livers or do to

238
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:23.650
discourage people from taking more opiates.

239
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.410
So would that be to alleviate their responsibility too,

240
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.320
to make sure that less people have opiate addictions?
Like what,
why I,

241
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:37.090
that doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah.
So it's like,
okay,
if you know that you,

242
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:37.630
if you,

243
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.060
if you take too much acetaminophen and that would discourage you from taking
the,

244
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.880
the opiate.
That's what I think the reason.
Wow.
That seems weird to me.

245
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:49.240
That seems like they would have had to,
I've had a paper trail in order to,
uh,

246
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.640
I mean it seems like that that has to be something that would be discussed.
Well,

247
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.170
I think,
like I said,
the,

248
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:58.460
the stated reason is that it provides an additional pain reliever.

249
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.000
And I'm saying it doesn't make any sense.

250
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.910
If you want to have that additional pain reliever,

251
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.070
simply give somebody a seed,
a metaphor or Ibuprofen or something else,

252
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.000
but you don't need to put it in with what Ryan would each other.
Yeah.

253
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:18.410
So would they do that to make some sort of a proprietary blend or something like

254
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:22.520
that where their pills would be different than others?
Does that make any sense?

255
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:26.360
No.
Nope.
Because these things are all generic now,
right there.

256
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.590
So there's no one making tons of money at the result of this.

257
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.510
They're all generic and they all have that stuff in them.
In the United States.

258
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.610
You think about,
you've heard of Vicodin,

259
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.470
if I could add is I think a oxycodone and a seed,

260
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:47.320
a metaphysics Percocet perks that actually is oxycodone,
uh,
biking in,

261
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.920
it's hydrocodone and Acetaminophen,
but all of these Percodan,
Percocet,

262
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.880
Percodan,
Vicodin,
all of these things have acetaminophen in it.

263
00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.640
<v 2>Wow.
You know,
I don't have a lot of experience with,
uh,
opiates,</v>

264
00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:04.360
but I did get a knee surgery once and they gave me this morphine trip.

265
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.030
They gave me this little thing that you could press anytime you want

266
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.410
<v 1>that didn't have a seat of benefit.
I pressed the shit out of that button,</v>

267
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.250
but that did not have that,
did not,
that did not,
that didn't have a seat,

268
00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:16.080
have a better fit.
And then do you,
like you said,

269
00:16:16.081 --> 00:16:19.170
you press that button and then you probably needed it and that's cool.

270
00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:21.690
That and you were successful.
You're doing your thing,

271
00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:26.280
you have a successful podcast.
I mean that's luckily,
I dunno man,

272
00:16:26.281 --> 00:16:30.070
if you kept the,
kept me with that button might be still on that hospital.
But

273
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.630
you know,
that's,
I'm just fucking around.

274
00:16:36.631 --> 00:16:37.810
But I do have a friend that broke,

275
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.350
<v 2>no knows my friend Brendan shop,</v>

276
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.230
he broke his nose and they put them on those pills.

277
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.790
They put them on a oxycontin's,
um,
after the game.
Uh,
no surgery.

278
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.870
And uh,
his friends wound up taking them away from him after a couple of months.

279
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.920
He was just taking them all day.

280
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.840
<v 1>It could,
it certainly could have,
like I said,</v>

281
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.420
been there are some people get in trouble,
but the mass majority of people don't.

282
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:00.820
But the problem is that people,
they,

283
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.170
they're simple reframe is that it's these pills,
these pills.

284
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.990
So you,
you think that

285
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.740
<v 2>some people just have that sort of compulsive behavior and that behavior could</v>

286
00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:15.520
manifest itself in drink it too much coffee or it could manifest itself and

287
00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:20.200
taking those pills or it's essentially the behavior that's an issue more than it

288
00:17:20.201 --> 00:17:22.270
is the actual substance or the medicine.

289
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.460
<v 1>Well,
you know,
people overindulge in activities for a variety of reasons.</v>

290
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.400
And if we really want to understand why they do it,

291
00:17:29.401 --> 00:17:32.700
we have to understand that individual person's situation.
Right.

292
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.120
And oftentimes we're too damn lazy to do that.

293
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.280
And then it's so much easier just to blame the drug.
But when we blame the drug,

294
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.280
there are some serious consequences.
And that's what I'm saying,

295
00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:47.550
it's like the consequences.
It's that now we have this new legislation,

296
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.070
we have this new effort go at the people

297
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.360
<v 2>who use these drugs.
And that consequence though,</v>

298
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.290
those consequences are inappropriate.

299
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.750
And so that's why I try and get people to just be like,

300
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.560
well look at the individual person's situation.
What happened with that person?

301
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.030
Cause it ain't the drug.
I assure you that that's,

302
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.490
it's fascinating that in Switzerland they're doing that.

303
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.010
Gin Is Geneva.
That's where he said it was.

304
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.030
<v 1>Well Geneva,
Zurich burn.
Um,
yeah.
Throughout the major cities in Switzerland</v>

305
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.720
<v 2>and they're giving them these high doses.</v>

306
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:22.350
Do they have a program if they want to wean off,

307
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.680
if these people want to stop doing it?
Yeah.
So this program is for

308
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.160
<v 1>people who want to stop people who want to continue.
They also have methadone,</v>

309
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.760
they have buprenorphine,
they have other soda treatments as well.
But they just,

310
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.760
this is just one of many options.
That's all.

311
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.480
<v 2>And the Methadone is what we always heard of in America.
Like the,</v>

312
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.240
I think I told this story last time you were here,

313
00:18:44.241 --> 00:18:47.930
but I used to play pool at this place that was right next to a methadone clinic.

314
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.040
And these people that would go on,

315
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.950
they'd get their methadone and then they'd come over and play pool and they just

316
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:54.560
look like zombies.
We'd call them Methadone,
Ian's,

317
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.860
that's who he used to call them.
But they would come over,

318
00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.540
just zoned out and they would just fucking out of it.

319
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.830
And this guy that I worked with was saying,
um,
he was like,

320
00:19:03.831 --> 00:19:06.710
you know that Methadone Shit they give them is actually worse than the heroin?

321
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.840
And I was like,
that doesn't make any sense.

322
00:19:08.841 --> 00:19:10.130
Why wouldn't they just give them heroin?

323
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.950
<v 1>Well,
I mean that's,
that's the question that the Swiss ass,</v>

324
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:18.090
why don't you just give people what they want?
Right.
I mean,

325
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:21.170
so there are re their,
their answers to that question.
I mean,
you,

326
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.370
you said Methadone was probably worth it certainly can be for some people

327
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:29.250
because the half life of Methadone is a lot longer.

328
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.650
It lasts forever.

329
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.240
It stays in your blood for a long time compared to heroin.
So some people say,

330
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:36.691
well,
you know,

331
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:41.691
I don't want to have a long acting opiate such that it makes me feel kind of

332
00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:45.270
slow.
That's why I want to use heroin as opposed to methadone.

333
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.570
Whereas other people,
Methadone worked for it.
That's fine.
Whatever works.
Um,
eh,

334
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.970
but then there are people who said what,
just give folks what they want.

335
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.200
And that's what the Swiss say in,
in this case,
what heroin.

336
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.070
There'll be some heroin users who say,
I want to get off of heroin.

337
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.300
I want to do whatever I can do to get off because I don't want to shoot a
needle,

338
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:11.010
for example,
and Methadone works well for them.
Buprenorphine works well for them,

339
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.530
but then there are other people who just say,
no,

340
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.140
I want to continue to use heroin with the needle,

341
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.790
and as an adult you should have that.
Right?
You should have that option.

342
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.880
<v 2>Yeah.
That is the issue,
right?
Isn't it?
Because if we can freely purchase alcohol,</v>

343
00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:30.881
and even more insidious in a way is the amount of sugar consumption that people

344
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.380
in this country,
especially our consumption of sugar,

345
00:20:36.381 --> 00:20:39.730
and this is something I've really been focusing on a lot lately because I've

346
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.860
been educating my kids about how much sugar is in things.

347
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.970
It's really hilarious because my seven year old was talking to my five year

348
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.160
yesterday and she's

349
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.380
<v 0>like,
there's nine grams of sugar in that.</v>

350
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.200
They're having this little conversation about this thing that she wants to drink

351
00:20:54.201 --> 00:20:56.620
that's supposed to be healthy.
She's like reading it,

352
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:59.950
there's nine grams to see a seven year old do that.
I'm like,
wow,

353
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:01.610
this is kinda cool.
Um,

354
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.530
but sugar can fuck people's lives up for sure.

355
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:07.840
And I know a lot of people that are addicted to sugar,

356
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:13.090
not just compelled to eat it,
but it actually changes their gut flora.
You know,

357
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.230
the actual,
uh,

358
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:19.150
the floor inside their body craves this to the point where these people,

359
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:20.920
it gets,
they get crazy for it.

360
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.310
People get really crazy for sugar and it's just causes all sorts of health

361
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:28.780
consequences.
But no one wants to say,
Hey,
we should outlaw candy bars.

362
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.250
No one should say that.
Right,
exactly.
Right.
Right.
Same thing.
It was booze,
right?

363
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.940
No,
no.
We have Ge.
We could,
we all,
everyone in this room,

364
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:39.940
we could drink ourselves to death just with the shit that I have in my closet

365
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:41.440
over here and that little kitchen,

366
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.650
we could go in there and just chug those bottles and we'd all be dead.

367
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.650
They'd find a salt dead.
That's crazy right now.
But we won't do it.
Right.

368
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.620
Exactly.
I mean,
we just drove a car here.
I mean,

369
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:56.690
I could have just driven that car off of a cliff.
Yeah.

370
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.150
But we don't do that because we are adults and we are,
you know,

371
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.760
we have some autonomy.
The same should be true with sugar.

372
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.000
The same should be true with these drugs.
But the thing is,

373
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:11.800
it's that one of the things that concerns us about sugar is that for so long

374
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:15.880
we've been lied to about the role of sugar in disease,
uh,
men.

375
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.260
So people didn't realize that sugar was causing all of these problems.

376
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:23.710
And so people felt like they were misled.
That's okay.

377
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.420
Now we have better education.

378
00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:28.450
So now you make these decisions with your eyes open.

379
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.880
The same could be done with drugs.
You make these decisions with your eyes open.

380
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:34.780
You're an adult.

381
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.500
You certainly can get in trouble with this particular drug or that particular

382
00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:40.570
drug.
But here's how you do it more safely.

383
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.490
You certainly can get in trouble with sugar,

384
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.350
but here's how you can do it in a way that's reasonable and more safe than not.

385
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:53.070
And through education instead of by demonizing things and by propaganda.

386
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.540
And I think,
uh,
being more lipstick,
that's,
you know,
it's,

387
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.980
we are very judgmental and more realistic about a number of things.

388
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:04.981
And I think that the drug issue is ideal for a perpetuating our moralism.

389
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.760
Mm.
Yeah.
That's,
it's,
it's,
and it's a weird one too,
right?

390
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:12.820
Because don't you drink wine in church?
We serve wine.

391
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:17.680
That's fucking [inaudible] been to church in a while either,
but I'm pretty sure,

392
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.490
I'm pretty sure that it's the supposed to signify the blood of Christ.
Right?

393
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.920
Is that it?
Yeah,
it's booze.
They're getting hoot hoot stuff,

394
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.060
which to for Jesus.
But it's,
um,
w w would just,
we're,
we're,

395
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:36.061
we're very strange in what we allow and don't allow other adult human beings to

396
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:38.980
do.
And that,
uh,

397
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.190
that really sort of gets to the heart of all this.

398
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.220
And then we're also very squeamish about the idea of needles.

399
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.240
<v 1>And when you say this program in Geneva,
super successful,</v>

400
00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:53.920
and the giving people intravenous heroin up to thousand milligrams a day,

401
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.250
I'm like,
wow.
Needles,
Jesus.
You know,
that's,
that's something the,

402
00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:00.770
the actual administration of it,

403
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.790
like the method of administration makes people squeamish.
Yeah.
You know,

404
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:06.500
but we give needles in hospitals.

405
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:09.410
We do those sorts of things and eliminate things about this program.

406
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:11.780
That's nice is that they have clean needles,

407
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.380
they have clean drug and so it decreases the likelihood that day we have

408
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:16.240
abscesses.
It's,

409
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:21.250
and those sorts of things or other sorts of blood born illnesses or concerns,

410
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.640
they are decreased.
In fact,
people are more healthy being in these programs.

411
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.170
Obviously the not being in these programs.
Um,
so,
uh,
they,

412
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.090
they have made me,
they've convinced me.

413
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:37.570
So intravenous heroin can in effect w act in a lot of the ways that maybe some

414
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:42.620
prescription drugs like Xanax or maybe some antidepressants do where they

415
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:45.950
alleviate the anxiety that certain people have.
Oh yeah.

416
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:49.220
I mean the heroin soda or,

417
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:52.700
so a number of these people have to tell you they have psychiatric illnesses.

418
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.760
It's like some of them have schizophrenia,
some of them have depression.

419
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:59.450
They have a wide range of illness.
It's just like any other,
um,

420
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.350
identified addicted population.
Heroin for example,

421
00:25:03.351 --> 00:25:06.870
helps people in,
in many cases control.

422
00:25:06.871 --> 00:25:11.330
They're sort of psychotic behaviors.
They are sort of delusions.
Um,

423
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:16.390
and so heroin can be a very useful drug in a wide range of soda for price range

424
00:25:16.671 --> 00:25:20.880
of symptoms.
We know this,
uh,
as we,
as people in medicine notice,

425
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.150
well let me clarify,

426
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.190
at least people in medicine outside of the United States now this,
this isn't,

427
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.210
this is not anything that's earth shattering or groundbreaking.

428
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.660
Well what is the difference between the education that they receive outside of

429
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.370
the United States and inside of the United States?

430
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:41.690
Just the bias that we have about certain medicines.
Yeah,
we are,

431
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.680
we cannot divorce,
um,

432
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.890
our drug education from our social control.

433
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.340
And so when we think about how drugs or drug policy has been used to go at the

434
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:59.180
groups that we don't like,
and if we're not a part of the outgroup,

435
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.570
we just kind of accept this information uncritically.

436
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.210
And we've been told that people who use heroin,

437
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.930
they have those issues and they're not like us.
They are those people.

438
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.620
And why is,
why should we question it?

439
00:26:11.621 --> 00:26:15.350
We don't know them very well and we see people putting a needle in their arm.

440
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.360
Something must be wrong with them.

441
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.970
And so you can tell all of these incredible stories.

442
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.320
Physicians believe these stories in this country,
uh,

443
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.140
our medical experts or addiction experts believe this sort of stuff.

444
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.370
But it's not true.
It's not reality.
Um,

445
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:35.150
and so that's one of the reasons that I traveled and not continue to travel and

446
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.280
to learn.

447
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.280
And I'm learning so much about the thing that my bias sees that I held and that

448
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:43.980
I'm trying to get rid of.
I'm trying

449
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.470
<v 0>to really just focus on the evidence.</v>

450
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.220
So in a sense like the United States is very unique in its,

451
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.750
in its propaganda and then unique and it's sort of singular view on drugs.
Well,

452
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.760
given that we have such a big military,

453
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:02.460
it's hard for us to be unique because other countries,

454
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.600
what our military might and our money,
we kind of tell them what the thing too.

455
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.240
So we're not unique.
Canada,
Canada's won,

456
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.650
but all of South America or large portion of South America,

457
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:16.170
even some places in Europe,
Asia,

458
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.260
you know a number of places share our screwed up views on drugs because they've

459
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:26.040
been told to share out screwed up views because they get some money for having

460
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:27.480
these screwed up views.

461
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:31.350
Like we support various programs in Columbia about drugs.

462
00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:34.080
A eradication of drugs end up all around the world.

463
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.980
So these countries share our views.
But places like Geneva,

464
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.900
that's really autonomy's and there are some other autonomous nations that

465
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.970
actually look at the evidence and see what's best for their population and that

466
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:51.550
was best for the people at the United States.
And,
and,

467
00:27:51.551 --> 00:27:55.320
and they don't just accept the propaganda without thinking about their

468
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:59.220
population.
Have you seen there's a new TV show?

469
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.210
Fear the walking dead.
It's like the,
the new spin off that's in La.

470
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:08.190
I had no,
I mean I've been away from the United States,

471
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:12.180
so I watched it and I thought immediately of you because there's a character in

472
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:15.720
it that is a heroin addict.
This young son is a heroin addict.

473
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.440
And a while he was in this,
spoiler alert everybody,

474
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.340
if you're a fan of the show and you haven't watched any of the,
I dunno,

475
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.080
spoiler alert here comes fast forward.
Um,

476
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.700
the kids a a junkie and he's in this,

477
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.910
this drug den and he's shooting up and this chick,

478
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.790
he's friends with turns into a Zombie.
He starts eating people's faces and shit.

479
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.450
And I was like so much of water.
Yeah,
that's great stuff.
Well,

480
00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:43.190
they get him to a whole the get them to a hospital,
right?
He,
uh,

481
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.630
they've got the hospital for days,
right?

482
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.860
He's a little sick at first and then he seems fine.
And then his,
uh,

483
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.930
his withdrawals kickin and his cravings kick in.
I'm like fucking days later,

484
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.180
like days later he can't take it anymore.

485
00:28:57.181 --> 00:29:00.960
He's shaking and he's throwing up all over himself and he falls to the ground.

486
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:02.610
He has seizures and throws up on himself.

487
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.690
But if like a day ago the kid was fine a day ago,

488
00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:09.690
like his face has all the color in it who looks normal.

489
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:14.100
And I remember what you had said last time you were here.

490
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.250
That withdrawal is a lot like getting the flu.

491
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:21.060
It's like getting sick and then it goes away and everything else is just sort of

492
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:25.890
in your head.
Well,
yeah,
you know,
the severity can,
can,

493
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.750
can vary based on the extent that a lot of people been using the drug obviously.

494
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.400
But yeah,
it's the flu basically.
And um,
you're not going to die.

495
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:39.300
And all of the sort of dramatic characterizations that we see on TV,

496
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.220
it's the sell their,
it's really

497
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.910
<v 1>to sell their product.
And the problem is,
is that people get educated on that,</v>

498
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:48.910
bullish on that sort of stuff,
right?
Yeah.
You were gonna say bullshit.

499
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.430
What's the right way to say it?
Oh yeah,
it is bullshit.

500
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.660
Forgot where am I thought I was

501
00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.170
<v 0>Riley.
My best
if want Riley,</v>

502
00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.750
you would've been interrupted 150 times already.

503
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:05.000
We've already gotten to 30 commercials.
Yeah.
This,
uh,
this kid in the show,

504
00:30:05.001 --> 00:30:09.500
he's mother actually breaks it.
Spoiler alert,
spoiler alert.

505
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:14.570
His mother actually breaks into the school to get pills for him.
Yeah.

506
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.060
She breaks back into school and she has to fight zombies and shit,

507
00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.560
but she breaks into the school to get pills for her son and she's going to like

508
00:30:21.561 --> 00:30:24.680
slowly wean him off with these pills.

509
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.010
But the fucking kid was normal just a day ago,

510
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:33.100
<v 1>you know?
Yeah.
You know,
my,
it's too hard for me to watch the stuff.
I mean,</v>

511
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.290
you know,
on the one hand it's like I'm trying to be a regular citizen and just,

512
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:41.220
you know,
appreciate art or what people do.
But then on the other hand,

513
00:30:41.221 --> 00:30:44.340
it's just that I just know the consequences of that rubbish,
you know,

514
00:30:44.341 --> 00:30:49.341
and the consequences that it gives some idiotic politician a raison d'etre.

515
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.431
So he,

516
00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:53.910
they feel like this is their reason for being now and then they can go after

517
00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:57.210
this drug because they saw it on his awful TV show.

518
00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.040
TV shows actually really good.
Yeah.
Well

519
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:04.730
<v 0>I think the real issue is,
um,
like many people,</v>

520
00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.350
the writers and the producers probably aren't heroin users.

521
00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.270
So their idea is based on the popular mythology,
the popular culture,

522
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:18.560
the idea that we've all been sort of fed by train spotting.

523
00:31:18.561 --> 00:31:21.350
And all these other films.
There's sort of just repeating that.

524
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.300
<v 1>No,
I'm glad you pointed out that you can have a good TV show,</v>

525
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:28.690
but get the drug issue wrong and that,
that's a great point.
Yeah.

526
00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.890
<v 0>Was his real wrong obviously,</v>

527
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.750
but a lot of us have this idea and like,
I swear before I met you,
I mean,

528
00:31:35.751 --> 00:31:38.810
and I'm a person who's,
I'm not averse to drugs.

529
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.520
I thought of it all as I thought heroin.
Like,
Oh yeah,
man,
you can get addicted.

530
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.400
You do it once you're addicted and then you're fucked.

531
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.430
It's just somehow or another becomes a part of you.

532
00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:54.590
That's why I've always had a problem when they start talking about marijuana

533
00:31:54.591 --> 00:31:55.424
addiction,

534
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.090
like how many people get addicted to marijuana because I don't understand what

535
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:02.750
even the mechanism would be for you to get addicted to that.

536
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.460
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean,
uh,
again,
if we go back to the definition that I talked to the start,</v>

537
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.940
yeah.
When we think about social disruption,

538
00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:13.940
disruption of family function,
work and that sort of thing,

539
00:32:13.941 --> 00:32:15.560
and it's causing you distress.

540
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.100
You can clearly see how somebody might be addicted to marijuana,

541
00:32:19.101 --> 00:32:22.130
a low percentage of people become addicted to marijuana,

542
00:32:22.131 --> 00:32:24.470
but you certainly can see that.
Yeah,

543
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.950
somebody might get distressed by their marijuana use,
fine,

544
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.290
and so they can meet criteria for addiction,

545
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:35.780
but when you compare marijuana addiction to alcohol,
nicotine,
cocaine,

546
00:32:35.781 --> 00:32:39.770
or any other drug,
it's lower than all the rest of those drug.
But certainly

547
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.790
<v 0>it's possible that somebody has some distress and hab,</v>

548
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.370
psychosocial disruptions and functioning.

549
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:51.730
So the disruptions and functioning is what really identify someone as being an

550
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.610
addict.

551
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:57.610
But if someone is a person who is using heroin on a daily basis but shows no

552
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:01.070
disruption in their life shows no problems with their,

553
00:33:01.071 --> 00:33:05.120
their social situation or their job functioning or anything like that,

554
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.910
but then they get off of it.
Yeah.

555
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.850
Then they're an addict because if they get off of it or they try to quit cold

556
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:13.400
Turkey and then they get all fucked up because of that,

557
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.970
well then you would have to kind of qualify them or,
well it,

558
00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.320
that's just one criteria.

559
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:21.440
Withdrawal symptoms of only one criteria and you have to have,

560
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.310
I mean that's something,
one symptom.
So you have to have several symptoms,
right?

561
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:28.760
In order to meet criteria for addiction.
But if you only have withdrawal,

562
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.050
that's not an addict.
I mean,

563
00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:34.370
cause you can think about somebody who's taking an antidepressant medication or

564
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:36.740
somebody who's taken more freeing for pray.

565
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.700
All those people can experience withdrawal,
but we wouldn't call them an addict.

566
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.830
I mean it's just like withdrawal.

567
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:47.800
It's just the common sort of drug effect at the longterm.
Use Arbitrage,

568
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.590
caffeine,
withdrawal,
all of these things are,
I mean,

569
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:56.270
when people have a hangover,
oftentimes that that's acute withdrawal.

570
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.750
That's just an acute sort of manifestation of withdrawal center.

571
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.100
But we wouldn't call them an alcoholic simply because they went out and partied

572
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:07.490
for a couple of nights.
And so withdrawal is not the,

573
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.030
not the only criteria that we use to determine addiction,

574
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.380
but most people would and most people would be wrong.

575
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.730
And that's part of the problem here.
Right?
Cause they,
they,

576
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:23.330
they are looking only yet withdraw,
which what's your all is it's not a big deal.

577
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.590
Uh,
and well it's the only,

578
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:28.430
it only becomes a big deal when we're talking about alcohol withdraw from

579
00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:32.870
chronic alcohol use or we're talking about barbiturate withdrawal from chronic

580
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:36.920
use because the person can die outside of those drugs.

581
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:41.950
I mean those are the only sort of more commonly used drugs that we worry about.

582
00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:44.750
Withdrawal,
the rest it there you'll be fine.

583
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.060
People constantly throw around the term addiction then I guess in an incorrect

584
00:34:50.061 --> 00:34:53.420
way.
And it technically incorrect way because um,

585
00:34:53.421 --> 00:34:57.380
I know a lot of people that I would say are addicted to coffee where they need

586
00:34:57.381 --> 00:35:00.050
to have coffee in order to wake up and function.
Yeah.

587
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.930
But like you said that they,
they use it wrong.
Yeah.

588
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:07.280
So maybe because the coffee is actually helping them to maybe do their job

589
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:09.500
better and not disrupting their job.

590
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.150
The coffee is even is helping them in their human function.

591
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.210
Well,
the last time you were here you explained something that really,

592
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:19.870
I never knew either.
It's that the,

593
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.960
the thing you just discussed that withdrawal is actually,

594
00:35:23.961 --> 00:35:28.910
or rather a hangover is actually your body withdrawing like the compensatory

595
00:35:28.911 --> 00:35:33.020
mechanisms that your body uses to deal with the alcohol in your system.

596
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.930
That's what the feeling of being hung over is.

597
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.190
Is your body just withdrawing from that alcohol?

598
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.360
<v 1>Certainly that that certainly that can be a symptom of withdrawal.
The hangover,</v>

599
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.590
absolutely.
I mean you,

600
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.320
you put a foreign substance into your body and your body tries to adjust,
try to,

601
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.280
we call it homeostasis.
This is a normal response and then alcohol is half.

602
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:58.281
Life is so short that it's in the body and then before your body gets a chance

603
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.330
to just completely,
it's gone,

604
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:04.500
but your body has already overcompensated and so what you're seeing is this

605
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:09.390
expression in some cases,
how difficult is this?
Like when you,
when you,

606
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.480
if you tried to discuss this to like the bill Reilly crowd like that there's a

607
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:18.360
lot of people that are not going to swallow this definition.

608
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.120
Like their idea of deficit there.

609
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.860
Their definition of addiction is very different than what you're saying.

610
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.890
You know,
like before,
before we went on air,

611
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:30.570
you and I was talking a little bit this past summer,
I've been all over.

612
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.570
I mean just past,
well since I saw you last,
I've been every,

613
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.770
I've been all over the globe.

614
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.390
And one of the things that when I give these talks and when people say,

615
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:41.820
I heard you on the Joe Rogan show,
you know,

616
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.530
all over the world from Vancouver to Brazil to Geneva,

617
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.830
to the Philippines all over.
Um,

618
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.520
I know when they say that I heard you on the Joe Rogan show,

619
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:58.290
I know that they are thinking people.
I know that these are people who,
um,

620
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:03.180
look for information outside of the normal sort of source of information.

621
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.880
And so those are the people who I'm trying to reach,

622
00:37:05.881 --> 00:37:10.881
the people who are actually grappling and struggling with these ideas and trying

623
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:15.810
to evaluate the ideas for the merits based on their merits.
And that's it.

624
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.680
Whereas when you talk about the O'Reilly's and you talk about the politicians

625
00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:21.060
and you talk about these people,

626
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.200
those are the people who I like talking to lease.
I mean,

627
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:29.730
not necessarily a O'Reilly himself,
but some of the people who watch him.

628
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.610
Um,
uh,

629
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.600
and so I'm trying to reach the general public,
the people who come,

630
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:39.850
who watch your shelter,
people who were into what you do,

631
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.080
the common folk who are out there,
which,

632
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:47.130
who are struggling and they're trying to learn.
And I think if we reached them,

633
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:51.900
the politicians will follow them,
not the opposite way around.

634
00:37:51.901 --> 00:37:56.730
And so my least favorite people to talk to our politicians,
I mean,

635
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.280
it's as an adult,
me and you,
we,

636
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.990
you'd like to talk to people who take you seriously,

637
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:05.940
particularly when you're respecting them.

638
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.270
Politicians oftentimes don't give a shit about you.

639
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:14.550
They only care about their votes and how they can use you for those votes.

640
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.330
You know,
it's insulting to me to talk to people in that way.
And so I,

641
00:38:19.331 --> 00:38:22.470
I try to avoid them coming here to this place.

642
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.750
I know that there'll be people out here who listened to you who was struggled

643
00:38:26.751 --> 00:38:30.390
with this and,
but they'll,
we'll evaluate it based on its merits.

644
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:34.740
And that's all you can ask is that people evaluate your arguments based on the

645
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:36.100
merits and then you have

646
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.900
<v 0>conversations,
discussions,</v>

647
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:41.980
and you go back and forth and you the best evidence win and everybody

648
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:45.130
understands those rules.
And those are your listeners.

649
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.030
That's not the politicians,
that's not the talk show host.

650
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:51.200
Those are not those people.
And so they're,

651
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.580
they're not the people who I'm trying to reach and,
and,
and,

652
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:59.530
and it helps to keep me sane because I can't deal with people who don't use

653
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:03.370
evidence or don't play what evidence.
It's part of the rules.
Yeah,

654
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.800
that's a great quote.
That's on your website about a,

655
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.420
I made sure that I don't engage in conversations with people that don't abide by

656
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:12.820
the rules of evidence.
That's a great quote.

657
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.120
And I agree with you about politicians too,

658
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:20.500
because essentially politicians just go where the wind of public opinion goes.

659
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.080
And so many of them,

660
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.050
they have a team of people deciding what they're talking about.

661
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.660
The team of idiots.
Oftentimes,
yes.
And uh,

662
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.250
unfortunately those people,
oftentimes they'll,

663
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.730
when these politicians,
they'll get involved in debates,

664
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.270
are get involved in some sort of a public function where they're discussing

665
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:44.590
something or giving a speech and they can say things that are just absolutely

666
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:46.750
inaccurate.
And those things,

667
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:52.140
when people aren't really discerning or they don't have the time maybe to go

668
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:56.020
over the evidence,
these people take that as fact.
Yeah,
no,
you know,

669
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.330
this is why I continue to be out here.

670
00:39:58.331 --> 00:40:02.350
Because when people make those kinds of statements based on no evidence and

671
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:04.300
they're just lies,
it's just inaccurate.

672
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.840
The consequences of those lies and the accuracies are so great and there are so

673
00:40:10.121 --> 00:40:12.190
many poor people who paid a price for it.

674
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.120
That's why I continue to stay out here and I stay out here to call those people

675
00:40:16.121 --> 00:40:19.390
out on it and try to embarrass those people.
I mean,
I'm a,

676
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:24.730
I'm a firm believer in embarrassing politicians when they tell these lies,

677
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:29.170
when they make up this information because they are ruining too many people's

678
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:30.970
lives.
As a result,
we will,

679
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.770
they're agents of poor information oftentimes whether they want to be or not.

680
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:40.410
I think all they want to do is get elected and stay in power and,

681
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.920
and then serve whoever paid for their campaign.
That's it.

682
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.580
That's exactly it.
It's a terrible system.
If you think about it that way.

683
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.920
That's it.
That's,
it's a terrible system.

684
00:40:50.921 --> 00:40:54.910
That's why I'm glad you do your thing and I'm glad that people all around the

685
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:58.890
world are checking you out.
Well,
now when you're on these travels and you're,

686
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.120
you're going around the world,
did you go to Portugal at all?

687
00:41:01.121 --> 00:41:05.110
Did you talk to anybody from there?
I talked to people.

688
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:08.230
They're like high officials there,
but I haven't been to Portugal yet.

689
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.570
And you know,

690
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.340
I think you bring up Portugal because they decriminalized all drugs.
Um,

691
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.050
so two digit Czech Republic,
Czech Republic did it before Portugal,

692
00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:21.760
but we all know about Portugal.
Um,
and uh,
so that's a good thing.
I mean,

693
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:26.740
it's just simply means that people can't be arrested for drug possessions and,

694
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:31.660
and a drug possession is considered like a 10 day supply of drugs in Portugal,

695
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.520
which is a good thing.
And then there are other places

696
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.780
<v 1>around the world that people are doing other innovative things.</v>

697
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:43.730
Like in Sao Paulo,
Brazil,
the mayor of Mira,

698
00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:48.020
who dodge is,
I'm paying drug addicts or drug users,

699
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:53.330
paying them a salary,
giving them housing,
um,
uh,
giving them food,

700
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:57.950
three meals and that sort of thing to make sure they show up for work and they,

701
00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.630
and then if they're coming to work,

702
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:01.700
that means they're not getting into other activities.

703
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:06.550
And so he's trying to keep his certain areas of his city safe doing that.
Um,

704
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.690
and then we talked about the Swiss and we,

705
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:13.520
and so there are a number of people thinking about innovative ways to deal with

706
00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:18.320
drugs and to treat people like adults and not children.
Like in our country,

707
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.980
we just still concerned about moralism even though there had been some states to

708
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:29.270
have said,
as you well know,
Colorado,
Alaska,
Oregon,
Washington,

709
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.110
they've said that we're going to legalize marijuana for adults and they have,

710
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:37.290
and I suspect California will vote and um,
uh,

711
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.180
November 16 to see if they want,
if they want to do the same thing.

712
00:42:41.181 --> 00:42:45.590
So despite the sort of a moralism,

713
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.070
we still have some people,
uh,

714
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.170
out here pushing for progressive,

715
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.090
rational adult sort of drug laws.
And so I,
I hope we continue to see this.

716
00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.510
<v 2>When I look at the current state of politics in America and I look at,</v>

717
00:43:01.511 --> 00:43:05.800
um,
what we call our leaders and the way they discuss drugs.

718
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:11.550
What I'm looking at is it's almost like they're trapped in an ancient way of

719
00:43:11.591 --> 00:43:14.050
thinking that doesn't work anymore because of the Internet,

720
00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:18.640
because of the Internet where we have so much access to information now we have,

721
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.780
we have,
we have a freedom to actually find the truth.

722
00:43:22.781 --> 00:43:27.640
So like what you're talking about where people have these misconceptions and

723
00:43:27.641 --> 00:43:31.090
then you come on and you give the absolute truth.

724
00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.660
Fact based evidence and you're forced to like examine.

725
00:43:34.661 --> 00:43:38.870
Like why do I have these assumptions in my head?
Why do I have and why,

726
00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.160
why do why?
I mean,
I,

727
00:43:40.161 --> 00:43:43.540
I was forced to confront these when I talked to the first time,
I was like,

728
00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:47.080
why do I have these ideas in my head that I have I really researched them?

729
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.640
Is this something that I've my out there in the field talking to people that are

730
00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:54.940
addicts talking to people that are treating them?
Absolutely not.
No,

731
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:59.860
this is just trainspotting.
This is just,
you know,
popular culture politics,

732
00:43:59.861 --> 00:44:03.910
given politicians giving speeches that that's all I know of it.

733
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.670
And I think the,
our,
our base of understanding is expanding.

734
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.640
<v 1>I agree.
I mean,
these people like you.
Well,
thank you.
I mean,</v>

735
00:44:11.641 --> 00:44:15.120
because of what you're doing,
obviously these alternative media forms,
right?

736
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.090
I mean,
when I think about coming to your show,
um,

737
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:23.280
my publicist and those people,
they wasn't on the book ray radar,

738
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.240
which is a mistake.
But I mean,
we know better now.
People are,
are learning now.

739
00:44:27.241 --> 00:44:32.241
So that's really encouraging to me that we have these forms of media out here

740
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:36.720
on,
on the one hand.
Um,
but you,
you made,

741
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.580
you made a point,
um,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's slipped my mind now.

742
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:43.020
We can,
we can go on.
I forgot to,

743
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.900
<v 2>um,
well about politics being stuck in,</v>

744
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.990
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

745
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.640
So as we think about the politician as we think about the politician,

746
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.890
I think the last Republican debate,
there were a couple of politicians,

747
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:03.840
I think Jay Bush and Christie and they were saying how they would bring the

748
00:45:03.841 --> 00:45:08.060
federal government in to change what's going on in Colorado.

749
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.820
Chris Christie Guy.
Yeah,
yeah.
Those guys.
And they,
they,
you know,

750
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:15.270
that kind of logic and thinking.
Um,

751
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.670
I think that if he actually got the nomination,
that wouldn't happen.

752
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.490
I don't know if they have to say these kinds of things,

753
00:45:23.491 --> 00:45:28.491
but it would be nice if the American people really punished these idiot to say

754
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:30.990
things like that.
Because on the one hand,

755
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:35.991
we think about the folks at Colorado taking this vote and the whole issue of

756
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:41.400
states' rights and this is what the Republicans say they really like.
Well,

757
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.820
I don't mean to go out to Republicans or cause I think they're the same as

758
00:45:44.821 --> 00:45:48.220
Democrats quite frankly.
Uh,
so it's not,
that's is not,

759
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:52.350
this is not a knock on them as a party.
Uh,

760
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.610
but when people talk about,
uh,
a state's right,
right.

761
00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:01.230
That's what this is it the state have decided.
And so the public,

762
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:05.960
the American people should really slam idiots who say things like they're going

763
00:46:05.961 --> 00:46:10.300
to go out there,
stay.
What about this issue of states'?
Right.
I mean,
and,
and,
and,

764
00:46:10.301 --> 00:46:13.170
and so I think Republicans and Democrats,

765
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:17.390
she really go out to these people for saying remarks like that.
Well,

766
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:18.890
<v 2>Chris Christie in particular,</v>

767
00:46:18.891 --> 00:46:22.220
because a lot of the things that he says are totally inaccurate.

768
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:25.220
And then on top of it,
what is his concern?

769
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:29.810
I'm assuming his concern is the health consequences of marijuana use.
Well,

770
00:46:29.811 --> 00:46:33.560
the health consequences of being a gigantic fat fuck are way worse than the

771
00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:35.870
health consequences of marijuana use.
I mean,

772
00:46:35.871 --> 00:46:40.820
that guy is morbidly obese and he's talking about people who smoke a plant that

773
00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:43.040
makes them happy.
That's ridiculous.

774
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:48.050
The idea that you're going to take that right away from responsible adults like

775
00:46:48.051 --> 00:46:50.510
me.
Like I'm,
I don't know how old he is,

776
00:46:50.511 --> 00:46:53.630
but I don't think he's much older than enough either.
Yeah,
no,
I hear you.

777
00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.330
I love you.
Outrage about this.
I mean,

778
00:46:56.331 --> 00:47:01.210
but this is how this is what Americans have to do about heroin,

779
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.360
about cocaine.
Uh,
boy,
that's a tough sell man.
That's why I said it.

780
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.560
It's a tough sell.
But people think of coke is due to,

781
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:12.320
won't shut the fuck up at parties.
I want to start businesses with you.

782
00:47:12.321 --> 00:47:15.050
Want to tell you about some shit that they never really did.

783
00:47:15.051 --> 00:47:19.180
That's what people think about coke assholes where they know they haven't had

784
00:47:19.181 --> 00:47:21.200
done coke where people had no damn,

785
00:47:21.201 --> 00:47:25.790
I need to be around at least people you know that do coke cause everybody I've

786
00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:28.160
been around that on coke is an idiot.

787
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:33.690
Well you know some of the people who do cocoa around me or in government,

788
00:47:33.691 --> 00:47:38.620
so I guess they can pass as it is to.
So same thing with um,

789
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.310
alcohol,
right?
I mean,
here's a,
here's an example.
There was a,

790
00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:45.540
a guy that I know that a soldier that,
uh,

791
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.380
came back from Afghanistan,

792
00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:52.120
he's got all sorts of pain issues from the war and he takes,
uh,

793
00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:57.250
uh,
oxycontin and he is trying to get off of it.
He slowly weaning himself out,

794
00:47:57.251 --> 00:48:01.240
but he'll take like a couple of day every day.
And uh,

795
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:06.240
he was describing it to me when I was at a bar and my immediate reaction is

796
00:48:06.241 --> 00:48:09.670
like,
wow,
man,
that dude's on it right now.
He seems so normal.
Like,

797
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:14.730
and then while I'm thinking that I'm next to people that are drunk off their ass

798
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:18.730
at this fucking bar,
at the Improv,
I mean,
these people are hammered,

799
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:23.020
just sloshed and they're probably doing way more damage to their body right

800
00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:26.440
there.
And I'm like,
wow,
there's poor flux on pills.
You know?
I mean,
it's,

801
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:31.590
it's interesting how we have these categorizations that like the pill,

802
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:36.310
the Oxycontin pill,
like,
oh,
this guy's,
he's gotta be fucked up.
Meanwhile,

803
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.270
to my left,

804
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.360
there's a bar filled with people just throwing back this liquid poison and

805
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:44.110
torture in their liver and their brain.

806
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.130
<v 1>Yeah,
man.
See this is the new book,
man,
when it comes out,</v>

807
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:49.240
I'm going to have to come here.

808
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:51.540
But this is precisely what I'm trying to deal with it.

809
00:48:51.541 --> 00:48:56.541
I'm trying to show people how to use drugs to enhance human functioning

810
00:48:56.921 --> 00:49:01.120
experience and so forth.
Now that means that as we get older,

811
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.480
we may have to change out drug use from some like alcohol,

812
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:08.670
alcohol might be a little too toxic on some of our liberties as we get older,

813
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.410
toxic in other ways for us as we get older.

814
00:49:11.411 --> 00:49:15.400
And some other drugs like oxycontin or something else might be more beneficial

815
00:49:15.401 --> 00:49:18.610
for you to achieve that goal that you're trying to achieve.

816
00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.010
And that's what the new book is trying to,

817
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:26.100
trying to look at to help people change their drug use according to their age,

818
00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:27.100
their maturity,

819
00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.970
all of these things and how to keep them safe and also to help them to

820
00:49:30.971 --> 00:49:34.930
accomplish that goal that they seek to enhance human experiences.

821
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:37.880
When we go to parties,
we take drugs.
Um,

822
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:42.040
we take alcohol and noted to as a social lubricant,
you know,

823
00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:45.820
but maybe that social lubricant isn't working for me as much these days.

824
00:49:45.821 --> 00:49:50.440
Alcohol disrupts my sleep,
you know,
whereas an opiate,
it's perfect.

825
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:51.970
You know,
I can chill,

826
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:56.680
I can relax and I can get some great sleep and I can be here,
uh,

827
00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:01.780
to do your show and be bright and bushy tailed and I'm ready to go as opposed to

828
00:50:01.811 --> 00:50:06.280
having that dream the night before but have an oxycontin or something else.

829
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.620
<v 2>That's interesting.
You know,
I think also we're dealing with a,</v>

830
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.820
a reaction like when,
when you were talking about,
uh,

831
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.030
people in the 1970s that were doing,

832
00:50:18.031 --> 00:50:20.850
the higher percentage of them were smoking marijuana and it could have been a

833
00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.340
reaction to the Nixon administration.

834
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:28.130
I think in a situation like that,
you,
you get preacher's daughter

835
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:33.130
<v 0>sort of affect the suppression where people just want to react to that</v>

836
00:50:33.351 --> 00:50:36.980
suppression.
People don't like being told what to do.
And in,

837
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.120
in the case of things like cocaine,
there's that naughty factor.

838
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.950
There's the fact that it's forbidden.

839
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.510
Does this factor that what you're doing is something that's illegal and that

840
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:49.190
makes it more exciting?

841
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:53.060
I think that's one of the things that was highlighted by the decriminalization

842
00:50:53.061 --> 00:50:57.590
in Portugal and the subsequent effects when the and any,
even Colorado,

843
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.880
when you look at the cow,

844
00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:03.560
what what they've shown in Colorado is the lowest instances of drunk driving and

845
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:08.090
I think something like 15 years low instance of violent crime that they've had

846
00:51:08.091 --> 00:51:11.270
in a long time and no deaths,
you know,

847
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:15.920
they're talking about like one guy jumped off of a building when he was high on

848
00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:20.570
pot.
Edibles.
Listen,
people make shitty choices all the time,

849
00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:25.571
whether on pot edibles or they drink too much dr pepper or they have too many

850
00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:27.170
fucking Twinkies.
I mean,

851
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:31.060
wasn't there a guy in San Francisco that killed somebody that used Twinkies as
a,

852
00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:33.260
a defense?
The twinkie defense?
Yeah.

853
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:37.070
It was like a famous defense because sugar is a drug.

854
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:42.550
I think that we're responsible adults being able to make choices based on

855
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.010
evidence and based on on reality.
In fact,

856
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:51.130
that should be the foundation of our society.
How we treat almost everything.
Joe,

857
00:51:51.131 --> 00:51:53.840
man,
you,
you just laid it out with marijuana.

858
00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.960
I absolutely agree with you,
but I just,

859
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:59.990
I want to push you to think about heroin in the same way.

860
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:04.400
Cocaine about same way because what you just said about marijuana,

861
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.610
you're absolutely right,
but it also applies to these other psychoactive trucks.

862
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.760
Um,
we just need to make sure people know how to do these things safely.
I,
I'm,

863
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:15.770
I'm,
I'm opening my mind to this.

864
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:18.140
I just don't have any experience in any of those.

865
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.170
I was always scared of a coke because when I grew up,
I had a,

866
00:52:22.171 --> 00:52:26.570
a friend and his cousin got,
he became a mess.

867
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.160
He was selling it and all this dude dude was a Duke coke and hang out in his

868
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:35.570
house and watch TV and sell coke and he lost a ton of weight and he looked like

869
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:38.330
shit.
And it's just like he made some bad choices,

870
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.660
but he could have made those bad choices doing a lot of different things.

871
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.010
Just like you talked about,

872
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:47.790
the guy who possibly drunk jumped out of the building at the edibles and it had

873
00:52:47.791 --> 00:52:51.170
some other issues.
You're absolutely right.
There are a lot of issues.
I mean,

874
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:55.730
you can,
I'm sure,
I mean,
you can look at my talks,

875
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:58.550
you can look at other people.
You can see,
you'd be like,
okay,

876
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:03.340
can you tell what drug I'm on?
Can you tell what drug this person is on King?

877
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:08.600
Of course you can't.
Right.
Um,
uh,
because people are,

878
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:12.380
most of us are adults and responsible and know what we're doing.

879
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:17.020
What's a good drug to take right before you do the O'Reilly's show?
Oh,
sh uh,

880
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.670
um,
no,
actually what the O'Reilly walkers,

881
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:26.190
a Beta blocker might be helpful.
Uh,
but you want to just take a low

882
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:31.190
<v 2>dose of amphetamine so you can be really alert and attentive and ready to go.</v>

883
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.520
Yeah.
You'd be ready to go.
That's that style.
You know,
I had a Peter Shift,

884
00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.020
you know,
he is,
he's a,
um,

885
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:43.320
he's a financial genius and I'm very controversial character.
Very,

886
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:43.680
very,

887
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.450
very successful but has these like controversial ideas about economics.

888
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:52.230
But I had him on the podcast and a,
I don't know how many podcasts he's done,

889
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.360
but he started off the show like,

890
00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:59.460
cause that's how they do it.
You know when you go on those talk shows,

891
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:03.540
you gotta be able to fucking fire Dah Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

892
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.830
But this shows three hours of just chilling out and talking.

893
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.430
So about an hour and a half in,
he starts to slow down.
I'm like,
you want a drink?

894
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.700
I was like,
yeah,
I'll have a drink.
So we got him a Jack Daniels on the rocks,

895
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:15.510
we sit and then,

896
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:19.320
and then he got casual about an hour and a half in and it became an actual

897
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:24.240
conversation.
Like I'm,
I know virtually nothing about finances.

898
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.750
So I wasn't challenging.
Am I just asking questions and I wanted to find out,

899
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.960
you know,
I wanted to get him to aluminate certain perspectives,

900
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.420
but he was ready for someone to jump in.

901
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:36.180
He was ready to beat that split screen thing.

902
00:54:36.181 --> 00:54:38.250
When you have one person on one side,
one of the other,

903
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.430
and they have opposing viewpoints and they just talking over each other.

904
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.390
I understand.
I sympathize with the cat cause I,

905
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.570
you know how it is and then before you know it,

906
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.370
it's over and then you don't really get many of us think to,

907
00:54:53.371 --> 00:54:58.200
all right,
it's our opportunity to educate the American public.
It's not,

908
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.800
it's really an opportunity for the host to show how smart they are.

909
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.900
There's a lot of them.
Yeah,
it's all,

910
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:08.901
it's just also a lot of just preaching to the choir nonsense and they want the

911
00:55:09.121 --> 00:55:13.050
conflict of two people with opposing viewpoints yelling at each other and

912
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:16.290
calling each other morons and pseudo symmetry is what they want.

913
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:21.290
To pretend that each issue has in a certain amount of evidence over here and a

914
00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:24.790
certain amount of evidence over here and the,
and the,
and the,

915
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.050
and the sort of real story somewhere in the middle.
No,

916
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.360
most issues don't happen like that,

917
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:33.900
but that's how nonthinking people can see the world.

918
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:38.070
But the world doesn't work like that.
No,
it doesn't.
What was that documentary?

919
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:40.670
Jamie,
do you remember the name of the documentary that I was talking about where

920
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:45.240
there's just people that were hired to go on and talk about,
uh,
uh,

921
00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:48.570
Jesus Christ.
I just washed it really recently.
What does it Mirage man?

922
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.550
Was it mirage madness?
Yeah.
Um,

923
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.880
they were hired to go on the shows and talk about whether it was initially it

924
00:55:57.571 --> 00:56:02.010
was whether or not cigarettes and nicotine were bad for your health and

925
00:56:02.011 --> 00:56:05.700
addictive.
And then it became about global warming,
the same people.

926
00:56:05.701 --> 00:56:10.170
And they would go on all these different talk shows and just spout out this

927
00:56:10.171 --> 00:56:14.430
stuff very loudly and with confidence.
And that was literally their job.

928
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.080
They were being hired to do this.

929
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.920
So they'd go on these talk shows and they would just,
Yap.
They would just,

930
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:24.190
just talk real loud and real confidently and talk over people and their,

931
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.900
<v 0>their,
their function or their,</v>

932
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.970
their career was to try to change opinion with these short little bursts.

933
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:35.230
Yeah.
Yup.
That's what they do.
And I don't do that very well.

934
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:39.470
Yeah.
Well,
that's why I had to contact you after I saw you on O'Reilly.

935
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:39.821
I was like,

936
00:56:39.821 --> 00:56:44.821
you look so frustrated because that shows it's so fucking retarded.

937
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:50.320
You know,
I try not to show frustration.
I really do.
So if I did,
that's not,

938
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.370
that's not good.
Well I should say knowing you,

939
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:59.350
you looked mildly perturbed on the outside.
Like if I didn't know you,

940
00:56:59.351 --> 00:56:59.681
I'd be like,

941
00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:03.160
well that got handled that really well cause they just fucking talked over him.

942
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.730
I mean they give you like,
I mean,
I'm,
I'm not even exaggerating.

943
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.050
You might've had to talk for,

944
00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.950
you might've got out 20 seconds worth of talking before they were talking over

945
00:57:11.951 --> 00:57:15.040
you.
Yeah.
You know,
um,
the thing,

946
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:20.070
it's just so perplexing to me that you can be so irresponsible and have this

947
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:26.230
stuff be on the airwaves and not get in trouble for it.

948
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:30.940
And then what they are doing on many of these shows,

949
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
they're doing more harm to the American education then more the most people.

950
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.530
And yet they're not in jail.
In fact,

951
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:44.320
they're being rewarded handsomely for this sort of day.

952
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:48.100
And then we're putting people in jail for these other minor infraction.

953
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:53.320
It's the stored it man.
It's something really sick about this system.
It is.

954
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:57.070
And it seems like it's trapped in momentum that these,

955
00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.280
these shows have always existed the way they have,
you know,

956
00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:04.810
with these seven minutes segments that go to ad break and you know,
one host,

957
00:58:04.811 --> 00:58:07.090
loud boisterous guy talks over everybody.

958
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.970
He shows had been around for so long like that,
that there,

959
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.750
there are comfortable model for us.
Yeah.

960
00:58:12.751 --> 00:58:15.850
And for some people they're not comfortable for me because I tell you,

961
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:21.100
I've been really trying to rethinking like wearing what can I live in this
world?

962
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:25.510
But you know,
the U S is,
they're making it very hard for me to want to stay here.

963
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.650
Um,
but you know,
I have children that I have to raise here,

964
00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:32.650
but after that I'm out.
Really,

965
00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:37.630
we are going to go Canada Canada's good fuck.
No,
no disrespect to Canada.

966
00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:40.780
I mean,
uh,
I love it up there.

967
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:44.620
Canada is really us light and really,
yeah,

968
00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:47.990
I mean Vancouver is a little different,
right?
The rest of cabinet,

969
00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:52.991
is that trying to be like the u s typically when it comes to drugs and all of

970
00:58:53.111 --> 00:58:57.210
these issues?
Yeah.
Vancouver is the most open minded when it comes to drugs.
Yeah.

971
00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.150
I mean Vancouver,
I really dig to folks of Van.
Cool.

972
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.610
Don't they have some sort of a heroine program in Vancouver as well?
They do.

973
00:59:03.611 --> 00:59:06.640
It's on the DL.
It's,
and it's for research purposes,

974
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:11.470
but they certainly have a program where they're giving heroin and it's a

975
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.470
research project that the University of British friend,
uh,

976
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:18.070
fit British Columbia.
I was there on Friday night.

977
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.590
I did a theater there and you could drive by the theater and get a contact with

978
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.010
your window

979
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.120
<v 2>open.
Like literally just drive them out.
It's sold marijuana so open,</v>

980
00:59:26.121 --> 00:59:29.750
you know that contact hat thing isn't that kind of,
it's not real.
Right?

981
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.870
It's not real.
I've hotbox people in this very room.
How dare you.

982
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.070
I'm going to change your research.
Fuck some people up in this room.

983
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.780
We are wrecked.
Some people that,
let's do it today.
Let's see if it's a real,

984
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:48.560
I don't think it's a real,
but you don't think it's real.
We can do an experiment.

985
00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:50.030
Here's another reason why I think it's real.

986
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:53.450
There's this place in Toronto and uh,
they have,
uh,

987
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.760
I don't want to give them up because I don't think it's legal,

988
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:59.210
but they do a comedy show there and they have a,

989
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:01.880
the front is like a bong shop and then the back,

990
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:05.810
they have a comedy club and they have no ventilation whatsoever.

991
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:09.200
You walk into the back room,
you are in a fucking cloud of marijuana,

992
01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:13.070
smoke the candles and no longer burning on oxygen.

993
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.400
They're burning on marijuana smoke.
There's no oxygen in the room.

994
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:20.270
You're breathing pot only and you will get high as fuck.

995
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:24.050
Cause I have a friend who doesn't even smoke pot and I took him to the show.

996
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:28.550
He's like straight edge.
He was high as fuck.
He was like,
dude,

997
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:32.090
I don't even know if I could walk.
And I was like,
exactly.
This is,

998
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.320
this is a reality.
Like you just need to be an extreme situations.

999
01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:40.370
I'll take you to Toronto,
Rochelle,
you,
I bet.
Let's,

1000
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:42.880
everyone will fuck you up.
I guarantee you.
Well,

1001
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:46.220
we need to do is take someone who's totally clean,

1002
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:50.090
like someone who doesn't do any marijuana whatsoever and make them sit in that

1003
01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:54.200
audience and watch an hour and a half comedy show and then get up.
That's cool.

1004
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.980
That's it.
Do it.
And then we can also test our yard.
We can do all that stuff.

1005
01:00:57.981 --> 01:01:01.220
Yeah,
let's do it.
Well,
don't they test positive though?
If you're at a party,

1006
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:02.054
I mean,
can't you,

1007
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:06.430
can't you test positive for some of those more stringent drug tests?
You know,
I,

1008
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.090
I know people say that,
you know,
but I,
I haven't seen that,

1009
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:15.310
but I don't know for sure.
I certainly haven't seen it,
but maybe,

1010
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:16.370
maybe it's possible.

1011
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.760
Do you know the issue that's going on right now with the UFC and this guy named

1012
01:01:19.761 --> 01:01:20.980
Nick Diaz?
No.

1013
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.640
This is a huge story in the world of sports because Nick Diaz,

1014
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:29.260
who was one of the most popular fighters in the UFC A and is a,

1015
01:01:29.261 --> 01:01:32.070
a very outspoken marijuana enthusiasts.

1016
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:35.360
He's also extremely healthy.
He,
uh,

1017
01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.900
I think he eats mostly Vegan except I believe he eats some fish.

1018
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:41.750
He a runs triathlons on a regular basis.

1019
01:01:41.751 --> 01:01:44.390
He swam back from Alcatraz twice.

1020
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:47.870
He's known for being really one of the most fit guys in the sport,

1021
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.660
but he loves marijuana and he smoked it all the time.
Um,

1022
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.790
the UFC has instituted in the Nevada state athletic commission has instituted a

1023
01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:58.680
new drug policy in regards to marijuana.
Well,

1024
01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:02.810
they've lowered the threshold to considerably,
like much,
much lower.

1025
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.430
So you literally would have to be high like the day of the fight in order to

1026
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:08.264
test positive.

1027
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:13.040
So he is administered tests from two different organizations.

1028
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:13.700
One of them,

1029
01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:18.700
the world antidoping agency water and water is a blood test,

1030
01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:22.350
which is much more accurate than what Nevada state athletic commission uses.

1031
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.590
Nevada state athletic commission uses a urine test,

1032
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:30.960
the blood test both before and after the fight find him to be under the

1033
01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:35.370
threshold.
So he passes.
But Nevada using their urinalysis test,

1034
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.050
say that he fails,

1035
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.320
they find him $165,000 and then they banned him from the sport for five years.

1036
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.380
Yeah.
So that's a huge

1037
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.530
<v 1>rage.
Well,
it should be.
I mean,
really marijuana shouldn't even be on any of the,</v>

1038
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.540
even what I know,
what,
uh,
uh,

1039
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.680
increased their thresholds that that's required to trigger the penalty,

1040
01:02:57.681 --> 01:02:59.720
which was a good thing.
Um,

1041
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:05.110
but it shouldn't even be on water is a list because when we think about drugs

1042
01:03:05.961 --> 01:03:07.490
and performing enhancing drugs,

1043
01:03:07.491 --> 01:03:10.610
clearly people are not using marijuana to enhance performance.

1044
01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.970
That's not where they're using it for recreational purposes.

1045
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.510
And maybe that was the day before or several days before,
uh,

1046
01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.360
but it certainly has nothing to do with their competition.

1047
01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.270
And so it should be off of those lists.
And I mean,

1048
01:03:23.271 --> 01:03:26.630
this is what people should protest and argue about,

1049
01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:30.890
demonstrate about the NFL,
the NBA,
all of these things.

1050
01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:35.630
They should remove marijuana from that.
They should also remove cocaine,
cocaine,

1051
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:38.090
it would not be used to enhance performance

1052
01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:40.370
<v 2>inside that in competition,</v>

1053
01:03:40.371 --> 01:03:42.980
you don't think it would enhance performance as a stimulant?

1054
01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.250
<v 1>Oh,
barely.
I mean,
it's such a short lived thing.</v>

1055
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.870
Amphetamines can do a better job with that.
But cocaine would be be barely.

1056
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:52.160
It really would be.
I mean,

1057
01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:56.720
but if we start talking about drugs in sports and then we're really being
honest,

1058
01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:01.280
um,
we have to think about why are drugs banned from sports in the first place.

1059
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:01.760
I mean,

1060
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.390
and so if we start doing that and then we can systematically go through the

1061
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:10.940
illogical sort of reasoning behind these bands,
um,

1062
01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:15.800
uh,
people say,
well,
we care about the health of the athletes and drugs.

1063
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:20.600
Okay,
regulate drug use in sports and make sure that they have a physician and so

1064
01:04:20.601 --> 01:04:24.320
forth.
But if you really cared about the health of athletes in sports,

1065
01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:28.130
you ban boxing,
you been all of these sorts of things,
you ban football.

1066
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.870
So that's like,
that's bullshit.
That's not why you go,

1067
01:04:32.871 --> 01:04:35.240
that's not why we care about drugs and sport.

1068
01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.540
Not because of the health of athletes.
That's just not true.
Well,

1069
01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.090
we say the athletes are role models.

1070
01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.980
Why should athletes have an additional responsibility more so than anybody else?

1071
01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:49.070
That's a very good point.
You know,
so that's crap.

1072
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.930
And you just go down the list and think about why we ban these things and it

1073
01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:58.670
just doesn't fit.
We banned them because a moralism and war on drugs.

1074
01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:03.230
And that's just inappropriate because we're now starting to see that the

1075
01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:08.231
rationale on which the war on drugs is built is problematic at best.

1076
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.980
What do you think of a situation like say the Lancet Lance Armstrong

1077
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.860
<v 2>situation where he's involved in a sport?</v>

1078
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:21.820
He tests positive for some stuff.
I don't even think he did test positive.

1079
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:22.270
That's right.

1080
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:26.830
I think they weasel their way around the test so well that he never really

1081
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:27.820
tested positive by the,

1082
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:31.960
he ultimately had to admit to using performance enhancing drugs.

1083
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:36.400
They strip him of his tour de France titles.
Then on top of that,

1084
01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:40.280
because he was sponsored by the post office,
he,
uh,

1085
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:45.070
gets hit with defrauding the government.
When you defraud the government,

1086
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:48.760
they are allowed to sue you for three times the amount that they gave you.

1087
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:51.700
So if they gave him $30 million,

1088
01:05:51.701 --> 01:05:54.520
they're suing him for $90 million or something crazy like that.

1089
01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.880
And on top of that,
once you strip him,

1090
01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:01.870
if you're going to give that title to the next person who didn't test positive

1091
01:06:01.871 --> 01:06:05.760
for that,
you got to go down to like 18th place.
Yup.

1092
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:09.460
Which is hilarious.
Yeah.
So like my friend Bill Burr,

1093
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:14.350
hilarious comedian had a great bit that he did about this on the Conan O'brien

1094
01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:18.580
show.
He was like,
so basically our steroid it up,

1095
01:06:18.581 --> 01:06:23.170
guy beat your steroid it up guy.
I mean there are all steroid it up every,

1096
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.000
the whole sport is predicated on it.
I mean if it's what th th th this sport,

1097
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.120
and I've even heard it argued by doctors that doing the Tour de France without

1098
01:06:33.971 --> 01:06:38.971
the drugs is arguably more dangerous for the athlete's body than doing it with

1099
01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:40.150
the drugs.

1100
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.670
<v 1>Well,
the Tour de France has always had drugs in it.</v>

1101
01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:47.560
I mean everyone knows this and so this notion that it's going to be clean or it

1102
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:52.240
should be clean,
it's a pipe dream.
It's really ridiculous.
I think that,
you know,

1103
01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:56.380
the whole Lens Armstrong issue,
not talking about him specifically,

1104
01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.880
but we should allow drugs in sports.
That's what,
that's what we should do.

1105
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:04.440
We should just regulate it.
Um,
um,
the,

1106
01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.670
and be honest and upfront about it.

1107
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:09.120
<v 2>Is that possible?
Do you think that's possible in this,</v>

1108
01:07:09.121 --> 01:07:11.250
in this environment that we're in right now?

1109
01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.680
<v 1>Carson's possible,
it was possible right before we got into this environment.</v>

1110
01:07:15.681 --> 01:07:17.810
Drugs,
drugs were in sports.
I mean,

1111
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:20.780
we think about the Olympics for most of the Olympics,

1112
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:23.360
people were using performance enhancing drugs.

1113
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:27.410
That's how we got more selective antibiotics,
steroids,

1114
01:07:27.411 --> 01:07:31.580
because of the Olympics and East Germans and,
and that whole source of thing.

1115
01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.020
But actually they were here in America,

1116
01:07:33.021 --> 01:07:37.700
but it was competition with the old Soviet Union.
So I think that,

1117
01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:42.020
um,
uh,
yeah,
it's possible.
It's possible if we are just,

1118
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:45.380
if we stopped being hypocrites about it and say,
people say,
well,

1119
01:07:45.381 --> 01:07:48.800
it gives some people an unfair advantage.
Yeah.
That's a big one.
Now.

1120
01:07:48.801 --> 01:07:51.080
That's a joke.
That's really a joke.
I mean,

1121
01:07:51.081 --> 01:07:54.860
particularly when I think about every four years when the Olympics come around

1122
01:07:54.861 --> 01:07:58.400
and Americans get proud about all the metals we win.

1123
01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:03.080
When we fucking win medals from a country like Switzerland that has 7 million

1124
01:08:03.081 --> 01:08:06.440
people in New York City has more people in it then Switzerland,

1125
01:08:06.441 --> 01:08:07.400
the entire country.

1126
01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:11.810
Of course we got to have more metals than Switzerland or some other small

1127
01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:16.220
country.
Is that an unfair advantage?
Not Yes,
but hell,

1128
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.770
<v 0>yes it is.
But do we talk about that?</v>

1129
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.880
There are some people who have resources and other people don't have resources.

1130
01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:26.930
We got to always have does unfair.
So life is unfair.
Well,

1131
01:08:26.931 --> 01:08:29.810
the most unfair advantage in the Olympics,
in my opinion,

1132
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.840
is when they w NBA players play basketball like Jesus fucking Christ.

1133
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:37.580
I mean,
I know we want to win,
but holy Shit.

1134
01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:41.780
You mean you let Michael Jordan or Lebron James or someone along those lines

1135
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:46.190
play in the Olympics against some dude from Czechoslovakia that's kind of fucked

1136
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:47.420
up.
Well,
you know,
they,

1137
01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:51.060
their argument was that the other countries were allowing their NBA players to

1138
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.130
play fine.
I mean,
but from the outset,

1139
01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:59.630
when you have these huge countries like the u s and a competing with these other

1140
01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:03.170
smaller countries who have limited resources,
come on.

1141
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.970
Are you kidding me?
And we talk about like Ferret,

1142
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.760
vantage and unfair that that is also,

1143
01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:14.330
there's people that have natural advantages like Lebron James.
Again,

1144
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:15.980
like that guy,
if you look at him,

1145
01:09:15.981 --> 01:09:20.720
that is a genetic freak of nature when you have very few people that are ever

1146
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:25.550
going to have a body like his,
right.
I know,
but they're in the NBA.
Right.

1147
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:30.230
But I'm saying even amongst the NBA,
he sort of stands.
He's an outlier obviously.

1148
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:32.930
He's incredibly disciplined.
Obviously he's talented,

1149
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:36.320
obviously is massive work ethic.
No question about it.

1150
01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:41.620
Obviously he has basketball intelligence that surpasses nine 9.9999% of the

1151
01:09:42.621 --> 01:09:46.520
people in the game.
There's all these other things on top.
But then on top of it,

1152
01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:49.790
he has this fucking race car body.
You know,

1153
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.720
I mean that like the guy,
you know,
you take a,
you know,

1154
01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:58.130
someone who's less physically talented there,
they'll never going to,

1155
01:09:58.131 --> 01:10:01.670
if they both do the same amount of work,
they both try as hard.

1156
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:03.800
You're never going to be that guy.
But you know,

1157
01:10:03.801 --> 01:10:08.330
there are people who have bodies like his and they're not him.
I mean,
you,

1158
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:12.950
you've seen this throughout sports website will have these phenomenal bodies,

1159
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:16.620
but they're not him.
So it's not only their sort of physical makeup,
right?

1160
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.190
It's people's drive,
their work ethics.

1161
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.990
All of these things I don't think are emphasized enough.
I mean,
uh,
you,

1162
01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:28.170
you and I,
the thing about it,
we're talking about Lebron James and not Jack,
Jack,

1163
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:32.270
Jack Brown,
because we don't know him,
but Jack Brown has a hell of a body,

1164
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.890
but we don't know him because he doesn't have the ethic,
the work ethic.

1165
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.870
He doesn't have the drive.
He doesn't have all of these things.

1166
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:43.871
But you and I can go and look at the NFL roster or some roster and we can see

1167
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:47.510
some guys who are just built and they just look great.

1168
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.390
And then we don't know who the hell they are.
Right.

1169
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:55.010
But we're talking about him because this is a selection bias because we see him

1170
01:10:55.011 --> 01:10:59.660
and he's doing it.
But I,
I don't dis the whole genetic thing.

1171
01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:05.020
I need to see some evidence before I start to talk about genetics.
I,
I don't,

1172
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:08.150
I don't know to what extent that can contribute,

1173
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:13.180
but what I do know is that work ethic and drive and people putting

1174
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.510
<v 2>in the work,
I know that pays off.
I absolutely know that.
It certainly does.</v>

1175
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:22.200
And it,
you,
you need all those things.
You can't just have genetics,
genetics,

1176
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:27.201
just what does that expression to hard work beats talent when talent refuses to

1177
01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:31.420
work hard?
Is that it?
Yeah.
And that is,
that is absolutely fine,

1178
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:34.830
but when you got a guy like Lebron James who has talent and hard work,

1179
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.160
then you get a superstar and you get that in all sports.

1180
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.760
But the argument being that he does have this advantage physically that,

1181
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.540
you know,
the average person with an average body just does not have,

1182
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:53.490
but the average person in the NBA does,
they have this body they had,
they look,

1183
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.230
they can look like Lebron could,
they know,
could a lot of them.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1184
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:03.050
there are some guys who are pretty big and uh,
uh,

1185
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.350
fast and those sorts of things.
But here's a,
here's a good example.

1186
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.900
In the UFC,
I'm in mixed martial arts.

1187
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:14.930
They used to allow testosterone replacement therapy and it was kind of abused.

1188
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:20.690
And the way it was abused is the way the male endocrine system works.

1189
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.980
As it's been explained to me.
Obviously I'm not a doctor.
Um,

1190
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:29.910
when you take testosterone,
your body stops producing it.

1191
01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:34.370
So what these people would do is they would take it and then uh,

1192
01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:38.250
they would get off of it and their body would have very low testosterone.

1193
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.950
Then they would get a blood test and the doctor would say,
hey,

1194
01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:44.790
you have low testosterone,
you need testosterone replacement therapy.

1195
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:47.790
So we had guys that are in their twenties that were getting testosterone

1196
01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:49.530
replacement therapy,
which is kind of crazy.

1197
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:54.510
They would take it and then they would take large amounts of it and recover much

1198
01:12:54.511 --> 01:12:56.040
better than other people would.

1199
01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.450
They would be able to work harder and train harder.
And we had some instances,

1200
01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:02.490
and this is one guy named Vitor Belfort,

1201
01:13:02.491 --> 01:13:07.230
who was the poster boy for testosterone replacement therapy because his career

1202
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:10.920
was kind of in a lull.
He got on testosterone replacement therapy.

1203
01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:15.390
He's a guy who's been fighting in the UFC since 1997.
Okay.
And uh,

1204
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.930
he's in his late thirties and then all of a sudden in his late thirties,

1205
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:23.760
he is fucking smashing people and he looks like a God.
I mean,

1206
01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:27.570
his body's just chiseled.
He's got super confidence.

1207
01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.010
He's a super aggressive attacking and he's just highlight reel knockout after

1208
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:34.140
highlight reel knockout in his late thirties.

1209
01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.920
Then they take away testosterone replacement therapy.

1210
01:13:37.921 --> 01:13:41.340
The Nevada State Athletic Commission says,
you know what?
This is just a,

1211
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:44.070
we don't believe in this anymore.
We think this is being abused.

1212
01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:45.420
Everyone's going to have to get off of it.

1213
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.230
And one of the reasons why they did it is because they tested him out of

1214
01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:50.670
competition just randomly.

1215
01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:55.671
They grabbed him and he was off the charts like nonhuman levels.

1216
01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.350
So they,
they make him get off of it.

1217
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:03.390
He then fights for the title after he gets off of it and he looks like a shell

1218
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:08.370
of himself.
His body is like soft.
He's like skin is loose.

1219
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:12.010
Like he,
he just doesn't,
he doesn't have endurance.
Like,
he just,

1220
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:16.300
<v 0>he got destroyed in the first round by the champion and everybody looks at and</v>

1221
01:14:16.301 --> 01:14:17.410
goes,
we'll see.
You know,

1222
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:20.410
this is what happens when you take a guy like that and you'd get them off this

1223
01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:21.070
stuff.

1224
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:24.100
But there's a certain amount of people that look at a guy like that and go,
man,

1225
01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:27.100
wouldn't you like to see him fight on it?
Wouldn't you?

1226
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.950
Wouldn't you like to see what he could do if you had kept him on it?

1227
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:34.570
Cause he seemed like a monster.
Yeah,
I mean,
I know I would.

1228
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.770
I like to see,
you know,

1229
01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:40.180
because if we got to draw the conclusion that the steroids was the reason that

1230
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:45.160
he was fighting like that.
So now that we did the a portion or the AB portion,

1231
01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:49.090
so now we need to go back to a,
put them back on the stove was,
and then,

1232
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:52.390
and then I'll feel more confident that yeah,
it was a steroid.

1233
01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.010
But the question is though,

1234
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:58.450
is that an unfair advantage for him versus the person he's competing against who

1235
01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:01.180
is clean and natural?
His opponent,
Chris Weidman,

1236
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:05.350
who is the champion is a notoriously clean,
he's just hard work,

1237
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.380
looks clean,
you know,
it doesn't look like it.
God does any steroids at all.

1238
01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:12.040
I just works hard.
He's smart.
He's tough.
Yeah.
So yeah,

1239
01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:15.670
so we shouldn't give the champion and option to use steroids.

1240
01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:19.120
If he wants to use him,
he can do it.
If he doesn't,
he doesn't have to,

1241
01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:22.290
but the other guy,
we should also give them that option into,

1242
01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.470
let's see what happens.

1243
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:27.730
The problem with that in mixed martial arts as opposed to any other sport is

1244
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:32.731
that giving someone testosterone or a steroid is going to allow them to

1245
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:38.380
administer damage to their opponent that they might not be able to do without
it.

1246
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.130
So their opponent is going to suffer because of it.
It's a different thing,

1247
01:15:42.131 --> 01:15:47.020
like the ability to deliver a basketball and to net is one thing,

1248
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:50.920
but the ability to kick somebody in the head is a completely different thing.

1249
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.400
And the idea being that if you give someone EPO for instance,

1250
01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:59.560
which a expands your endurance threshold,
you will be able to throw more strikes.

1251
01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:02.560
You'll be able to attack more aggressively without worrying about conserving

1252
01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:06.610
your gas tank and the you could damage someone in a way that you would not have

1253
01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:09.160
damaged them naturally.
I don't see that as a problem.

1254
01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.440
I remember when Mike Tyson was knocking people out,

1255
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:14.710
when people walk into the room,
an op in the ring with him,

1256
01:16:14.711 --> 01:16:18.270
there was always that potential that you might get damaged in ways my,

1257
01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.060
that's right.
Yeah.
And so I don't see this as a problem.

1258
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:26.430
We should let it into sports and you know,
this is part of the,

1259
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:30.580
the risk of what you do.
That's,
it's as simple as that for me.

1260
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.840
And then we should also monitor to athletes and make sure that they are,

1261
01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:38.560
they do have healthy levels and levels that are not going to cause toxicity to

1262
01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:42.520
them,
but I don't see that as a problem.
You know,
it's interesting,
conversely,

1263
01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.820
guys who have gotten off of it,
they can't take punishment.

1264
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.150
Like there's a one specific guy and this guy,

1265
01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:52.660
if anybody has an argument for taking it,
it's this guy,

1266
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.050
his name is big foot Silva and he actually is a giant.

1267
01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:01.260
He has gigantism so he has a tumor on his pituitary gland and he was taking um,

1268
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:05.210
external,
what does it x dodginess as he said,

1269
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:10.310
exogenous testosterone.
And if anybody has an excuse for taking

1270
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:13.670
<v 2>it,
it's this guy.
Well,
when he was on it,
God,</v>

1271
01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:15.710
this guy could take a fucking punch to take.
I mean,

1272
01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:20.600
he had this war with this guy,
Mark Hunt,
this epic five round fight.

1273
01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.480
And then when he got off of it,
he gets hit and he just goes down.
Like it's,

1274
01:17:25.481 --> 01:17:29.840
it's really shocking the difference in his ability to take punishment while on

1275
01:17:29.841 --> 01:17:30.674
it.
And then while,

1276
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:34.880
<v 1>but see,
you know,
I have to tell you,
I'm a bit outside of my expertise,</v>

1277
01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:38.240
so I don't really know these guys,
but,
uh,
I,
I,

1278
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:42.680
you certainly have piqued my interest and I want to know more about it because,

1279
01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.940
um,
you know,
just to be logically consistent,

1280
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:49.400
I think that these things should be allowed in sport.

1281
01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.410
And if I'm going to have that position,

1282
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:56.630
I like to know more about the things that you're saying.
Like when he was on it,

1283
01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.260
he could take a punch.
Then when he got off he couldn't take a punch.

1284
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.810
I don't know how many years between that and age,

1285
01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:06.710
what role age plays in all of these sorts of things.
But I like to know more.
I'm,

1286
01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:10.850
I'm just,
um,
I'm just at a disadvantage because I just don't know.

1287
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.710
I don't know enough of the details about it.
Um,

1288
01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.630
but I would just challenge people to think about,
hey,

1289
01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:23.030
what if we allow drugs in sports?

1290
01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:26.600
One of the things that it does do that it helps,
it helps

1291
01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.480
<v 2>covery and apparently it mitigates the effects of damage.</v>

1292
01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:35.140
It can mitigate the effects of a of damage that you take,
not just in,

1293
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.810
in training but also in competition.
Yup.

1294
01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.920
And in that sense it would benefit people.

1295
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:45.600
But I do see the argument and Ronda Rousey's made it pretty eloquently that if

1296
01:18:45.601 --> 01:18:49.860
someone is taking a steroid,
if they're,
they're cheating,

1297
01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:50.843
quote unquote,

1298
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.590
that it's going to allow them to administer damage that they would not have been

1299
01:18:55.591 --> 01:18:58.950
allowed to do or wouldn't have been able to do with just hard work.

1300
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:03.710
<v 1>Well,
I know that's a,
that's a,
that's a,
um,
that's a conjecture.</v>

1301
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:07.880
But I don't know if that's true.
I don't,
I have no idea if that's true.

1302
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.210
I understand.
I understand.
It's,

1303
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.850
it's the most extreme version of sports writing is.

1304
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.090
So it's the most extreme consequences for this debate.
Sure.
I,

1305
01:19:18.091 --> 01:19:21.920
and I think that it's a perfect place to start because it is that support that

1306
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:25.700
you're going to get into the ring.
You've got to be a man.
You Bet.
I mean,

1307
01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:30.440
you better be tough.
A woman or tough,
tough woman,
you better be.
Yeah,

1308
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:35.300
you have to.
You can't be,
you can't be a wimp getting and that ring.

1309
01:19:35.301 --> 01:19:38.860
So I think that it's a great place to think about this and,

1310
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:42.800
but the notion that somebody would be able to administer more punishment because

1311
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:45.980
they're on steroids.
I don't know if I accept that.

1312
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:51.020
I don't know if I accept just a guide,
need some evidence to um,

1313
01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:54.940
to before I come to that conclusion.
I understand your position.
I'm

1314
01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.180
<v 2>pretty sure that's a correct position though.
The,
the,
the,</v>

1315
01:19:58.181 --> 01:20:00.970
you would be able to administer more.
Um,

1316
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.430
I think if you take very talented athletes that are already,

1317
01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:07.030
have all those attributes,
discipline hard work.
Yeah.
And then you add,

1318
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:08.040
you're going to

1319
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.360
<v 0>get a more efficient body.
You're going to get a body that functions more.
Yeah,</v>

1320
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:16.680
yeah,
that's right.
But we're talking about delivering blows.
You can,

1321
01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:21.510
you think that people will be able to deliver blows in ways that I do.

1322
01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:25.800
And on top of that,
I think also with,
with fighting a big one is confidence.

1323
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.130
And there's something about those guys that are choose to the tits.
They,

1324
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:32.320
they're confident as fuck cause they're barely human.
Yeah.

1325
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:37.290
I mean when you hit these super high hyper human levels of testosterone,

1326
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.840
you get these incredibly aggressive,

1327
01:20:39.841 --> 01:20:43.620
confident men that can do things that they might.

1328
01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.550
And then subsequently when they get off that stuff,
boy,
their confidence,

1329
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:52.551
it erodes radically Instagram pages start looking like suicidal strippers,

1330
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:58.060
motivational quotes and shit and like,
you know,
they get real weird jealousy,

1331
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.150
ultimate experiment that we have to tell people they're on these things and

1332
01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:05.940
let's see if they're confident or is increased.
Right.

1333
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:09.450
And we can see whether or not it's the placebo effect.

1334
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:11.430
It's sort of confident thing.
I mean,

1335
01:21:11.431 --> 01:21:15.060
but I know that they have real physical effects,
so I'm not denying that at all.

1336
01:21:15.061 --> 01:21:19.650
But the competence piece of be interesting to see whether or not somebody will

1337
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:24.390
love still have this confidence if we give them placebo and telling them this is

1338
01:21:24.391 --> 01:21:26.990
what the hair,
but isn't it fascinating also that we're,

1339
01:21:26.991 --> 01:21:31.991
we're still talking about drugs like that term drugs is just such a weighted and

1340
01:21:32.581 --> 01:21:33.630
loaded term.

1341
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:38.930
That fact that that that term could be used for a steroid as well as for aspirin

1342
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:41.340
or coffee.
It's,
it's,

1343
01:21:41.341 --> 01:21:46.341
it's really kind of unfortunate that we have this one blanket term that applies

1344
01:21:46.891 --> 01:21:51.891
to psychedelics and as well it applies to testosterone and it applies to heroin.

1345
01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:57.050
I mean,
there's too many things.
I actually liked that.
Do you?

1346
01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:00.930
Yeah.
Why?
What,
what,
why don't you like it?
I mean,

1347
01:22:00.931 --> 01:22:05.100
because when we think about one of the things that bothers me about the

1348
01:22:05.101 --> 01:22:09.960
psychedelic kind of movement,
and God blessed them,
people who enjoy this thing,

1349
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:15.180
but you know,
people separate their drug use,
like the psychedelic use.

1350
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:20.181
Like I'm using this to go on a higher plane or for some other reason as opposed

1351
01:22:21.241 --> 01:22:23.520
to the person on the corner who was getting high.

1352
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:27.810
It's like you can rationalize your drug use however you want,

1353
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:32.610
but you're using drugs and it's all the same thing,
you know?
So it's like,

1354
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.940
it's a beautiful thing.
It's like we're all together in this,

1355
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:40.050
I'm not better than you with my drug use and you're not better than me.

1356
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:42.270
What your drug.
Oh,
I see.
I love that.

1357
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.560
The lead ism of the psychedelic noise here.
Exactly.

1358
01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:50.910
It or other people.
I mean,
this notion like even the marijuana smokers,

1359
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:54.990
when they talk about marijuana and not talk about crack and not talk about

1360
01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:58.440
heroin,
what the fuck is that?
I mean,
come on,

1361
01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:02.400
you're doing a drug just like I'm doing this drug.

1362
01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.860
And so it's hypocrisy.

1363
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:09.770
It's the same elite Ism that is pervasive throughout our society.
Well,

1364
01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:13.960
I think the idea is that when you're doing marijuana or something like that,

1365
01:23:13.961 --> 01:23:17.080
they're,
they're being like a responsible,

1366
01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:22.081
they're taking something that makes you more socially aware and casual.

1367
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:26.800
Whereas when you're doing some speed or some math or something like that,

1368
01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:29.710
you know,
you're stealing cars and fucking drive it into pedestrians.

1369
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:32.560
That's how people look at it.
Hard,
man.

1370
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:37.660
Because you know,
you know,
I hear these things right?

1371
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.600
Like I have done all of these things right.

1372
01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:44.410
And it's not like I am stealing cars or doing any of these.

1373
01:23:44.411 --> 01:23:48.850
You don't get wacky when you get on the meth.
No.
I mean,
what,
you know,
look at me.

1374
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:52.631
I mean,

1375
01:23:52.631 --> 01:23:57.220
my life revolves about around my work and you know,

1376
01:23:57.250 --> 01:24:02.250
my idea of a good time is being able to write a new paper to write a book and

1377
01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:07.930
but that doesn't,
that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate drugs and drug use.

1378
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.850
Right.
And so,
um,

1379
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:14.020
and I think this is the majority of drug users in the world of academia.

1380
01:24:14.021 --> 01:24:17.080
Does your stance caused controversy?
Because you know,

1381
01:24:17.081 --> 01:24:20.530
you're obviously a very educated guy,
very well respected,

1382
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:25.890
but yet you say this so openly that you enjoy drugs like,

1383
01:24:25.931 --> 01:24:30.190
whereas a lot of people would shy away from that even if they do research on the

1384
01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:33.220
drugs themselves.
I've had people that,
you know,

1385
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:38.250
even guys that work trying to legalize drugs that are very hesitant to admit

1386
01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:41.470
they're falling like Rick Doblin,
I had him on the podcast.

1387
01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:44.980
He didn't want to admit that he had taken provigil before the show,

1388
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:49.030
which is he did,
but he was hesitant to it,
you know,

1389
01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:51.520
and not just slamming him at all because I love it.
Oh me.
Yeah,
me too.

1390
01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:55.090
I was a great guy.
Right,
right,
right buddy.
I found it fascinating that this,

1391
01:24:55.150 --> 01:25:00.150
there was this like hesitancy to admit that he took something that is so mild.

1392
01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.750
Like pro vigil gives you a little bit of energy.
Sure.

1393
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:04.870
It doesn't alter your heart rate.

1394
01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:07.720
It certainly doesn't alter critical thinking processes,

1395
01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:12.880
but he was hesitant and he's the head of maps.
Yeah.
See,

1396
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:16.900
I'm not to talk about Rick situation specifically,

1397
01:25:16.901 --> 01:25:21.880
but just in general,
when people are reluctant to say these things,

1398
01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.220
that's part of the problem because we need to help people get out of the closet.

1399
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.330
There are so many people who go to jail,
who get in trouble,

1400
01:25:31.331 --> 01:25:36.331
who lose their job for doing a behavior that well respected people in our

1401
01:25:36.581 --> 01:25:37.950
society,
in,

1402
01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:43.280
I've been all over the world and I've been hanging out with some of the more,
uh,

1403
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:48.070
some of the movers and shakers in a variety of society and I have seen them get

1404
01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:52.930
high and they are responsible people and they are people who I would want my

1405
01:25:52.931 --> 01:25:57.220
children to be like in many cases,
some of these folks now,

1406
01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:00.160
um,
many of those people are closeted it,

1407
01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:04.340
but them being in the closet allows

1408
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.080
<v 1>this hypocrisy to go on,</v>

1409
01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:11.180
allows us to go at the poor people for doing a behavior,
engaging in behavior,

1410
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.680
in which many of us engage in some very wrong with that.

1411
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:19.460
And that's very,
for me,
very hypocritical.

1412
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.450
And I like to look in the mirror as a man,
as an adult,

1413
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:28.810
and to say that I live my life as honestly as I can in that regard.

1414
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.860
Um,

1415
01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:35.570
and so what kind of man would I be if I wasn't honest about this?

1416
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:36.530
It.
I mean,

1417
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:40.850
I'm the person who has given thousands of doses of these drugs to people and

1418
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:44.000
carefully studied their affects written books on this stuff.

1419
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.040
If I can't say this,
why are you here?

1420
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.500
Why am I here?
I mean,
what is,

1421
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:58.030
I would be embarrassed as a person and I would deserve to be embarrassed as a

1422
01:26:58.101 --> 01:27:03.101
person because I didn't take the opportunity to help my fellow citizens who are

1423
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:07.820
catching hell for doing the same thing that I and others do.

1424
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:11.270
<v 0>That would be wrong.
Well,
Kudos to you for taking that stance,</v>

1425
01:27:11.271 --> 01:27:15.590
but I think that's a brave stance.
It isn't in the world of academia.

1426
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:20.600
Like how was that?
How was that,
uh,
accepted?
Uh,

1427
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:22.430
I don't,
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.

1428
01:27:22.431 --> 01:27:26.870
All I know is that I have to do my job.
So I do my job and you know,

1429
01:27:26.871 --> 01:27:30.290
I try and do my job as well or better than my colleagues.

1430
01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:34.640
That's all I can do in those spaces.
But,
you know,
I dozer,

1431
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:38.840
dozer and not the spaces that in which I live.
I mean,
I worked there,

1432
01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:43.370
but I'm trying to be a citizen of the world.
And so,
um,

1433
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.680
that's just a narrow aspect of my life.

1434
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:48.850
That's very admirable and I'm glad you're alive.
Thank you,
man.

1435
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.430
Glad there's people like you out there.
It's just so important.
I think.

1436
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:54.010
I really do.
I think,
um,

1437
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:58.310
these conversations where a guy like you who's so educated in the subject can

1438
01:27:58.311 --> 01:28:01.940
expand people's minds and say,
say things in such an honest way.

1439
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.901
I think it's just,

1440
01:28:02.901 --> 01:28:07.790
it's very critical because it's because we are so hesitant to admit these
things.

1441
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:12.200
You know what I mean?
Uh,
I run into situations with parents all the time.

1442
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:15.170
You know,
like I go to school with their kids,
go to school,

1443
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.250
and then the Google me,
you'll find out,
uh,
you know,
army,

1444
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:22.340
all the fucking drug talk is the one that freaks them out the most.

1445
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:26.150
Not the fact that I'm involved in cage fighting.
Like that seems fine.

1446
01:28:26.151 --> 01:28:27.500
Like they want to get tickets.

1447
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:31.460
You know what the drug stuff is the weird part,

1448
01:28:31.461 --> 01:28:33.140
especially the psychedelics ones,

1449
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.450
psychedelics are the ones that seem to freak them out.

1450
01:28:35.451 --> 01:28:38.660
The mall's more so even than the pot,
like DMT,

1451
01:28:38.661 --> 01:28:42.890
like I've had more parents asked me about Dmt,
you know,
with this cute,

1452
01:28:42.891 --> 01:28:47.190
curious cross armed.
So what is this DMT stuff?
We'll see.

1453
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.870
I have children too,
so you know,
like get stimulus.
So it's a thing.

1454
01:28:50.871 --> 01:28:55.620
I'm sure you like me or an odd look and fellow,
you know,

1455
01:28:55.621 --> 01:29:00.380
with your crazy dreadlocks,
you long fingernails and liquids.
This motherfucker,

1456
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:01.890
this guy's a doctor.

1457
01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.240
<v 1>Yeah.
You just hit it on the head.</v>

1458
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:13.430
But you know,
that's the sort of thing that drives me.
Right.

1459
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:16.940
That's why when people are sleeping,
I'm working.
I mean,
I'm,

1460
01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:21.510
I'm working around the clock,
you know?
Uh,
but I pretend that I'm not,

1461
01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:24.900
you not pretend like I'm just chilling and you know,

1462
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:28.860
I'm one of the most sort of uptight people you want to meet when it comes to

1463
01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:31.680
work,
you know?
Uh,
I am,
uh,
yeah,
I'm a,

1464
01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.780
I'm a difficult person to work for because you're a workaholic.
Absolutely.

1465
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.200
Absolutely.
I think your work is very,
very important to you,
obviously.
Yeah,

1466
01:29:40.201 --> 01:29:43.260
absolutely.
You know,
it's like if you're going to be in the game,

1467
01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:45.360
you gotta be in the game to win it.

1468
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:50.090
<v 2>Well,
it's also what you're doing is so critical at this juncture,</v>

1469
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:53.630
because I think we're in a transitionary stage in our culture.

1470
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:57.290
I think our culture is opening it's mind.
And I think as we said before,

1471
01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:59.240
because of the Internet,
because we're,
we,
we,

1472
01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:02.390
we can have conversations like this where no one can step in and stop us.

1473
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:05.450
It's already too late.
Everything you've said,
it's all streamed.

1474
01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:09.110
People recorded it.
It's being people who are listening to it right now,

1475
01:30:09.111 --> 01:30:11.450
there's no way around that.
People are getting it.

1476
01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.580
They're playing it in their car.
No one could stop it.

1477
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:16.610
And once that information gets out,
then they'll Google it.

1478
01:30:16.670 --> 01:30:19.250
A vast majority of the people that are curious about this,

1479
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:22.070
we'll start looking into some of the things that you've said and go,
wow,

1480
01:30:22.071 --> 01:30:26.480
that's true.
Wow,
this is crazy.
And then they'll talk to people at work.

1481
01:30:26.481 --> 01:30:27.620
They'll talk to people at the gym,

1482
01:30:27.621 --> 01:30:28.970
they'll talk to people that they're friends with,

1483
01:30:28.971 --> 01:30:31.310
and then it will expand further and further and further.

1484
01:30:31.311 --> 01:30:36.020
So I think what you are doing is critical.
It's critical at this juncture.
So the,

1485
01:30:36.021 --> 01:30:40.220
the fact that you approach it like it's so critical is why,
you know,

1486
01:30:40.221 --> 01:30:41.410
you're so important.
Well

1487
01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:44.500
<v 1>thank you man.
Because you know,
that's how I try it and see it.
You know,</v>

1488
01:30:44.501 --> 01:30:46.090
it's like I think about like,

1489
01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:50.530
I don't want to let people down by me not working as hard as that kid

1490
01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:55.360
particularly,
uh,
when it's so important as you point out for so many people,

1491
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:58.240
you know,
because young people,
older people,

1492
01:30:58.241 --> 01:31:01.450
people always going to get high then always going to get hot.

1493
01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:05.770
So one of the things we can do is we can help them do it more safely and more

1494
01:31:05.771 --> 01:31:07.090
effectively we can do,

1495
01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.080
we can actually do that as opposed to saying don't do that.

1496
01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:13.810
Come on.
If you're a thinking person,

1497
01:31:13.811 --> 01:31:18.811
you want to know why it's more important that kids and people challenge me,

1498
01:31:19.751 --> 01:31:22.750
challenge everyone and they,
and when they challenge us,

1499
01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.610
they might actually go and engage in this behavior.
Okay,
I have my own kids.

1500
01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:31.420
So that means my kids hear me talking about this.
So my kids might think,

1501
01:31:31.421 --> 01:31:34.660
what drugs aren't that bad?
Cause I heard when my dad said,

1502
01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.690
so I have to uh,

1503
01:31:37.691 --> 01:31:42.100
understand that there's a potential that my kids will use drugs to.

1504
01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:43.570
Yeah,
I know that.

1505
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:47.440
But the thing I try to do is make sure they're safe and they know what they're

1506
01:31:47.441 --> 01:31:48.274
doing.

1507
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:52.600
And also that they understand their role about educating their friends and

1508
01:31:52.601 --> 01:31:56.080
keeping their friends say,
and even educating their teachers.
Like,

1509
01:31:56.081 --> 01:31:58.600
I get my kids say,
Dad,

1510
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:03.300
I had the drug talk in class and this is what this person said does.

1511
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:08.170
Teacher said,
or this person said that the majority of people who use marijuana,

1512
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:12.670
um,
go on to use other drugs and become addicted to marijuana,
some other drug.

1513
01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.550
So my kid,
my young kid has the raised his hand and be like,
um,

1514
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.680
Mr x,

1515
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:26.520
it's exactly the opposite of what you just said.
And then the teacher says,
well,

1516
01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:30.010
you know,
like what evidence do you have for this sort of thing?

1517
01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:33.610
Of course my kids,
they do.
And you just like,
well,

1518
01:32:33.611 --> 01:32:37.080
look at the last three presidents of the United States,
you know,
and,

1519
01:32:37.081 --> 01:32:41.320
and so he goes on and he educates the teachers and that sort of way.

1520
01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:47.080
But you know,
that's,
that's a hard thing for a kid to do.
And,

1521
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:51.190
but he feels compelled to do it because he understands that his,

1522
01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:55.130
that's part of his responsibility to,
there was a great,
uh,

1523
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:57.860
<v 2>well lecture by Terence Mckenna wants,</v>

1524
01:32:57.861 --> 01:33:01.640
where he was talking about his kid being in class and Terence Mckenna is sort of

1525
01:33:01.641 --> 01:33:05.060
a legendary feature and the figure in the psychedelic community.

1526
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:10.450
And his child was in class and the teacher was telling his child that LSD causes

1527
01:33:11.781 --> 01:33:16.250
brain damage.
And he said,
you know,
no,
it doesn't cause brain damage.

1528
01:33:16.251 --> 01:33:19.010
And Teachers said,
well,
who told you that?
And he said,
Albert Hoffman.

1529
01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:25.250
And like when you've had a conversation with Albert Hoffman and you're dealing

1530
01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:28.850
with some fucking high school teacher in podunk,
Colorado,

1531
01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:34.120
<v 1>be interesting if the teacher knew who Albert Hoffman was probably did.
Yeah,</v>

1532
01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:35.950
I hope so.
I would hope so.
Yeah.

1533
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:37.810
<v 2>See this,</v>

1534
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:42.150
the narrative that the brain damage narrative is a big one.

1535
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:44.160
And you know,
like boy,

1536
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:48.570
there's a lot of things that can potentially cause your brain to not function at

1537
01:33:48.571 --> 01:33:52.560
its best.
And some abuse of drugs is certainly on that list.

1538
01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:58.010
But there's a lot of things that we do on a daily basis that are not good for

1539
01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:01.140
you.
Like,
like poor diet,
lack of exercise,

1540
01:34:01.141 --> 01:34:05.940
like being stuck in polluted cities like breathing in brake dust and fucking

1541
01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:08.430
exhaust fumes all day.
All these things are terrible.

1542
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:12.510
<v 1>Yeah.
But we,
we really have to challenge the brain damage narrative.
I mean,</v>

1543
01:34:12.511 --> 01:34:17.460
one of the things that we do is that we don't challenge it.
I mean,

1544
01:34:17.461 --> 01:34:19.470
so like when we,
one of the things,

1545
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:21.480
when we think about the brain damage narrative,

1546
01:34:21.481 --> 01:34:25.990
it has gained more energy in recent years in part because we have this

1547
01:34:25.991 --> 01:34:30.840
technology of neural imaging,
brain imaging.
But what in fact,

1548
01:34:30.841 --> 01:34:35.100
what has happened with brain imaging is that brain imaging has become a

1549
01:34:35.101 --> 01:34:39.580
projection tests basically.
You know what I mean?
When I said projection test,
um,

1550
01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.820
no I don't,
you know,
ink blot test.

1551
01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:47.360
So a or war shop sort of psychological test where you throw up some image and

1552
01:34:48.181 --> 01:34:50.760
you ask the person what did they see?
And then you know,

1553
01:34:50.761 --> 01:34:54.220
you get to sort of Dale tell you they are interpretation and didn't in

1554
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:59.210
psychologist has his or her subjective of what that means.

1555
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:04.070
That's what brain imaging in drugs,
in the sort of a drug field has become.

1556
01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:08.690
It's become a projection test.
So that means that uh,

1557
01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.840
the sort of what the examiner sees is what um,

1558
01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:17.570
uh,
the,
the task or the information becomes.

1559
01:35:17.571 --> 01:35:19.790
So it's a subjective sort of view,

1560
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:23.780
a subjective view of what the examiner thinks.

1561
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:27.680
And so you can take brain imaging for example,

1562
01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:30.560
you can take the data and give it to two different labs,

1563
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:34.370
just give the data to two different labs and you don't tell them who the

1564
01:35:34.371 --> 01:35:35.510
participants are.

1565
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:41.500
I would bet you any amount of money that the two labs would not come up with the

1566
01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:46.160
same interpretation.
You know?

1567
01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:49.310
So people think of this as like being hard science.

1568
01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:54.290
It's there and this is what we,
we see.
And we know it's not that way.

1569
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:55.970
It's a,
it's really,
it's,
it's,

1570
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000
there's a lot of subjective subjectivity that goes into these sorts of tests.

1571
01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:05.930
And so one of the things we have to do is just push back and ask people when

1572
01:36:05.931 --> 01:36:09.650
they talk about these drugs causing brain damage,
where,

1573
01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:13.160
what's the evidence that these are the questions that people have to ask.

1574
01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:16.370
Please show me the evidence of the brain damage that you're talking about.

1575
01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:21.050
Because it's true.
Amphetamines can cause brain damage.

1576
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:25.190
Nicotine is a lot more dangerous than amphetamine,

1577
01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:29.090
heroin and all the rest of these things in terms of potency in that sort of

1578
01:36:29.091 --> 01:36:29.241
thing.

1579
01:36:29.241 --> 01:36:34.130
But we take nicotine and doses that we avoid any sort of damaged at all or most

1580
01:36:34.131 --> 01:36:35.790
of the damage associated with,

1581
01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.280
we take all of these drugs and doses that causes your Foria,

1582
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:44.720
which is way below the doses that causes toxicity.

1583
01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.090
So when we start talking about brain damage,

1584
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:51.890
humans don't usually take drugs in the doses that will cause brain damage

1585
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:53.360
because if they did,

1586
01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:57.920
the drug effects become unpleasant and humans won't take it because it's so

1587
01:36:57.921 --> 01:37:01.220
unpleasant.
So the notion that these things cause brain damage,

1588
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:04.490
you need to really ask people to show you the evidence.

1589
01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:09.640
I have not seen evidence in humans that all of these recreate any of these

1590
01:37:10.011 --> 01:37:12.620
recreational drugs is causing some brain damage.

1591
01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:16.840
<v 2>So when they have those scans and they show the brain and they show the effects,</v>

1592
01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.330
like when someone's on x amount,
you know,

1593
01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:22.090
milligrams of this or of that.

1594
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:25.810
But I always wondered that like what are you seeing when you see like

1595
01:37:25.811 --> 01:37:30.280
highlighted portions of the brain?
Like what is that just activity in that area.

1596
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.650
So

1597
01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:34.700
<v 1>if we talk him,
most of the studies have been done when people are not on drugs.</v>

1598
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:37.100
I mean we can talk about when people are on drugs would do that.

1599
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.290
And so what you do,
you typically do,

1600
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.640
you have like a group of methamphetamine users in one group and then you have

1601
01:37:43.641 --> 01:37:46.910
people who've never used methamphetamine and other group and you image their

1602
01:37:46.911 --> 01:37:50.570
brain.
You might do what this thing we call a pet image.
That was,

1603
01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:51.440
that was popular.

1604
01:37:51.441 --> 01:37:55.770
What you inject a radioactive compound in somebody's body.

1605
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.980
And this compound selectively binds to let's say dopamine cells in the brain and

1606
01:38:01.891 --> 01:38:05.010
when it binds to the dopamine cells since his radioactive,

1607
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.120
it lights up and it and,

1608
01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:12.130
and so you can see how many dopamine sales are in a person's brain or region or

1609
01:38:13.381 --> 01:38:18.030
you can get an idea of the dopamine cells and how many are there.

1610
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:23.070
One of the things that has done a sort of a popular way that it's done is that

1611
01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:28.071
they say the methamphetamine users have less dopamine receptors then the non

1612
01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:29.790
methamphetamine use.

1613
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:35.270
And so that's interpreted as saying methamphetamine caused the methamphetamine

1614
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:40.260
users to lose dopamine cells,
kill sales.
Basically.

1615
01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:44.580
Now we don't know what we were,
what was in the brains of the,

1616
01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.730
of the methamphetamine users before they used methamphetamine.

1617
01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.700
We only know from this one scan.
That's one problem.
Another problem is,

1618
01:38:52.701 --> 01:38:57.701
is that we don't know what the normal range of dopamine receptors or or are,

1619
01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.620
uh,
an a,
an a person spray.

1620
01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:05.820
So if you look at like your brain versus my brain will see differences,

1621
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.810
what does that me or if you look at the brains of people who never used drugs or

1622
01:39:09.811 --> 01:39:12.330
anything,
you'll see differences.
What it does,
it mean.

1623
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:15.930
And so we have a wide range just as humans,

1624
01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:20.931
we have a wide range of dopamine cells in each person's brains versus somebody

1625
01:39:20.941 --> 01:39:21.774
else.

1626
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.840
So you can't say that methamphetamine caused these people to lose dopamine cells

1627
01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:32.010
because we don't know if they lost open me cells in the first place.

1628
01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.480
And another thing is this,

1629
01:39:33.481 --> 01:39:37.980
that you have this tremendous amount of overlap of dopamine cells in this case,

1630
01:39:38.250 --> 01:39:41.340
in the methamphetamine users compared to the controls.

1631
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.540
So that means that some people in the methamphetamine group has more dopamine

1632
01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:49.890
cells than people in the control and vice versa.
So what does it all mean?

1633
01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:55.770
It doesn't mean what it typically means is we don't know.

1634
01:39:55.771 --> 01:39:59.580
But what we know it doesn't typically mean is that it caused some brain damage.

1635
01:39:59.581 --> 01:40:03.480
Because when you look at these people's functioning,
cognitive functioning,

1636
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:04.343
other functioning,

1637
01:40:04.890 --> 01:40:08.250
they look just like anybody else who didn't use methamphetamine.

1638
01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.920
<v 2>That's fascinating.
Um,
so that's really interesting.</v>

1639
01:40:12.921 --> 01:40:17.921
So the only way to tell would be to take someone who is healthy and doesn't have

1640
01:40:18.231 --> 01:40:22.640
a history of drug use and monitor them,
get them hooked on methamphetamine,

1641
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.760
and then see what's happening to their dopamine receptors.
Then

1642
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:28.320
<v 1>you certainly that that could be a way of doing that.</v>

1643
01:40:28.321 --> 01:40:32.640
But that would be really expensive.
And I don't know if it's just a ethical,
yeah,

1644
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:35.800
I mean we had these natural experiments already,

1645
01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:40.820
so we think about amphetamine use became big in the 30s and we have this sort of

1646
01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:44.680
history in the military.
We still use amphetamines,
polished shoes,

1647
01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:48.780
but a millets are always on that stuff.
Right?
Fly Missions,
right,

1648
01:40:48.781 --> 01:40:51.780
to make sure that the sharp,
right.
So you,
you have this history,

1649
01:40:51.781 --> 01:40:55.570
so you just look in the population and you say,
all right,

1650
01:40:55.571 --> 01:41:00.280
what is a dopamine related illness?
You look at a dopamine related illness.

1651
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:03.210
One of them is Parkinson's disease.
You lose dopamine cells,

1652
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.930
you get Parkinson's disease.

1653
01:41:05.530 --> 01:41:09.610
Do you have higher rates of Parkinson's disease and methamphetamine users?

1654
01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:14.650
And you know,
the bottom line is that you don't generally see this,

1655
01:41:14.651 --> 01:41:17.420
you don't see higher rates of method of,

1656
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:21.610
of Parkinson's disease in methamphetamine user.
I mean that's just one thing.

1657
01:41:21.611 --> 01:41:26.611
But you can just look to out the society and you can see various illnesses,

1658
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:32.900
particularly neurological illnesses and see do you have a greater rates of this

1659
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.720
illness and people who report it,

1660
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.790
this type of drug use and you don't really see that.
And so I,

1661
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:40.624
um,

1662
01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:44.050
when I hear people talk about the brain damaged thing and particularly when they

1663
01:41:44.051 --> 01:41:48.640
show brain imaging,
that's not evidence of brain damage.
You know,

1664
01:41:48.641 --> 01:41:50.260
when you have animal studies,

1665
01:41:50.261 --> 01:41:54.100
you can give animals in Pheta means for everyday for their life and then you

1666
01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:55.093
kill them at,

1667
01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:59.470
at some point and then you look at it and fed a dope mean damage for example.

1668
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:04.770
You certainly can see damage when you give amphetamine at doses 30 40 times what

1669
01:42:07.511 --> 01:42:10.810
humans take.
Yeah,
you can see some toxicity.
It's clear.

1670
01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:15.460
But now when you give to doses that a comparable to what humans take over that

1671
01:42:15.461 --> 01:42:18.880
same period of time,
you don't see this really.
Yes.

1672
01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:24.010
<v 2>So the stimulants and the effect of the stimulants don't result in brain damage</v>

1673
01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.620
unless you're at just ridiculous levels.
Absolutely.

1674
01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.380
This is the same thing that I worry about with

1675
01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.840
<v 1>um,
steroid use.
You know,</v>

1676
01:42:32.841 --> 01:42:37.510
this is why I want to make sure that we actually regulate it because we want to

1677
01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.780
make sure people are not taking doses that are so large that they might actually

1678
01:42:41.781 --> 01:42:45.470
be causing some damage and we don't regulate it.
Yeah,
you can,

1679
01:42:45.471 --> 01:42:48.740
you run that risk and so regulate it and then you,

1680
01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:51.410
and if you really care about people,
that's what you would do.

1681
01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.940
And then you make sure that you monitor them regularly to make sure that they

1682
01:42:55.941 --> 01:42:57.840
don't exceed those levels and you educate.

1683
01:42:57.930 --> 01:42:59.880
<v 2>I'm about the potential consequences.
Well,</v>

1684
01:42:59.881 --> 01:43:03.690
a good example of that is probably the bodybuilding community because if anybody

1685
01:43:03.691 --> 01:43:08.670
takes steroids at hyper human and on re preposterous levels,

1686
01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.410
it's bodybuilders.
And yet very few of them wind up dying from it.

1687
01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.270
There are a few cases of guys that were like really big in the eighties and

1688
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:20.160
nineties that are now dead from heart attack.

1689
01:43:20.490 --> 01:43:24.690
But if you ever see what those fucking guys look like,
you realize like these,

1690
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:27.720
these are not people that are taking normal levels.

1691
01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:32.490
These are not people that are even taking commensurate levels to their peers.

1692
01:43:32.491 --> 01:43:36.420
Like a lot of them are taking just these insane insane and some of them have

1693
01:43:36.421 --> 01:43:39.630
come clean about their routines and what they would use.

1694
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:42.090
I mean they were just red lining.
It's,

1695
01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:44.310
they were just red lining their system on a regular basis.

1696
01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.050
We're trying to win and they were trying to,

1697
01:43:46.110 --> 01:43:51.030
and that's a sport where you have to take steroids.
I mean,

1698
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:52.070
you're not going

1699
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.280
<v 0>to compete with a Lee Haney or a Dorian Yates.</v>

1700
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.740
You're not going to compete with them if you don't take steroids.

1701
01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.630
It's a sport that is really,
you have to,
it's the only way it works.

1702
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:07.730
Your human body is not supposed to be that big.
Yeah.
Well,
um,
yeah,

1703
01:44:07.731 --> 01:44:11.360
Mike had started us that we should make sure we keep them safe by making sure

1704
01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:14.990
that they understand what they're doing and how to do it.
Yeah.

1705
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:19.400
But that's,
that is a crazy sport when you think about it.
I mean,

1706
01:44:19.401 --> 01:44:22.220
some people don't even consider it a sport,
whatever,
an activity,

1707
01:44:22.221 --> 01:44:23.720
whatever you want to call it now,

1708
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:26.480
because it's not like you're doing anything other than standing there looking

1709
01:44:26.481 --> 01:44:29.780
big.
It's weird,
right.
Because you're not,
you know what I mean?

1710
01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:33.980
It's like you're not trying to run faster.
You just stand there.

1711
01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.240
Is that a support?
Uh,
you know,
uh,

1712
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:41.390
if they think it is it that competing,
right?
An activity.

1713
01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:44.840
It's certainly a legit activity.
And they're competing,
right?
Yes.
I guess,

1714
01:44:44.841 --> 01:44:47.960
but they're,
the competition is so subjective.
It's like,
you know,

1715
01:44:47.961 --> 01:44:51.170
you look at one guy,
I mean,
I don't get it.
I look at the,
like,

1716
01:44:51.171 --> 01:44:54.320
if I look at Mr Olympia and this is like the top five guys,

1717
01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:57.650
like they're indistinguishable to me.
They're all just giant,
huge dudes.

1718
01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:00.140
I don't know how the fuck does one person when in one person,

1719
01:45:00.141 --> 01:45:03.220
not when I don't get it.
Yeah.
But you know,
our ignorance shit,
right.

1720
01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:05.570
Prevented him from having to sport,
you know?
No,

1721
01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:08.810
I'm not saying prevent them from having a sport.
I'm saying,
is it a sport?
Yeah,

1722
01:45:08.811 --> 01:45:10.870
no,
it's an activity.
But that's my thing.

1723
01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:15.230
Our ignorance should prevent them from Collins was a sport.
Right?
I mean,

1724
01:45:15.231 --> 01:45:19.430
you know,
there are some sports that I just don't get.
I mean,
golf,

1725
01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:23.490
it's clearly a sport.
But is it though Mike,

1726
01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:26.960
my wrestling coach in high school wouldn't even say baseball is a sport.

1727
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:31.160
He's like,
it's a skill game.
Coach Murphy to skill game.
It's not a sport.

1728
01:45:31.570 --> 01:45:34.010
You get tired,
you get tired when you gotta do you gotta push through it.

1729
01:45:34.011 --> 01:45:36.080
When you're playing baseball,
you get the fuck out of here.

1730
01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.460
That's how it sparked and make us run hills.
If we said it was a sport,
okay,

1731
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:44.150
well I'm from animals I feel too.
But you know,

1732
01:45:44.151 --> 01:45:49.151
the thing is is that my view on this certainly should not be considered.

1733
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:53.840
You know,
even though that's,
that's because of my own ignorance.
I should not,

1734
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:57.050
I shouldn't have much of a say.
So there,
because of my ignorance,

1735
01:45:57.530 --> 01:46:01.130
I understand even though I have my view,
but you know,
my view is less important.

1736
01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:04.350
Well in bodybuilding,
if there is consequences to taking the,
the,

1737
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:07.280
the level of steroids that you need to take in order to get that big,

1738
01:46:07.281 --> 01:46:11.240
like didn't Arnold have open heart surgery?
I think Arnold had heart surgery.

1739
01:46:11.241 --> 01:46:14.590
I'm pretty sure.
So I think for a lot of those guys,
but,
but,

1740
01:46:14.591 --> 01:46:18.140
but I don't know has had a fun,
I mean he had,
his life has been,
you know,

1741
01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:22.220
I don't know why he had open heart surgery,
so,
but I mean clearly he used arrows.

1742
01:46:22.221 --> 01:46:26.090
He said this,
but I don't know if that's the reason.
I mean,
you know,

1743
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:30.320
the number one sort of a reason that people die in the United States is heart

1744
01:46:30.321 --> 01:46:33.440
disease and they get that for a variety of reasons.

1745
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:38.450
Many of them I've never taken steroids.
So obesity,
right,
isn't it?
It's obesity,

1746
01:46:38.451 --> 01:46:43.160
poor eating habits,
a wide range of things.
Yeah.
Genetics,
lack of exercise.

1747
01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:47.450
A lot bad enough alcohol,
no alcohol,
no alcohol.
I mean,
you,
uh,

1748
01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:52.200
moderate alcohol use is associated with lower levels of heart disease and stroke

1749
01:46:52.201 --> 01:46:54.300
and all the rest of these things.
Why do you think that is?

1750
01:46:54.301 --> 01:46:55.620
It just relaxes people.

1751
01:46:55.621 --> 01:46:58.230
And it takes a little bit of the edge off and less stress on the body.

1752
01:46:58.231 --> 01:47:03.231
Maybe there is a component that has been identified and alcohol that they think

1753
01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:08.100
is helpful at getting rid of plaques and that sort of thing.

1754
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:11.070
But I,
it's not definitive.
I don't,
I don't know.

1755
01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:15.180
Is that one of those things where you'd have to take a healthy person and expose

1756
01:47:15.181 --> 01:47:19.470
them to alcohol?
Does and monitor as well?
Same thing.
I'm fed amine maybe.

1757
01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:23.280
Well you know it's like if you do a wide range of different types of studies,

1758
01:47:23.281 --> 01:47:25.200
you know,
because there is no perfect study,

1759
01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:29.130
but if you have all of these different types of studies and then you have the

1760
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:33.060
evidence coming pointing to the same way,
the same direction,

1761
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:35.760
it increases your confidence that this is real.

1762
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:37.630
And that's Kinda what happened with alcohol.

1763
01:47:37.631 --> 01:47:42.631
There have been dozens of large studies with thousands of people that have

1764
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:45.600
looked at folks who don't drink alcohol.

1765
01:47:45.601 --> 01:47:50.130
Those people who drink moderate doses and those who drink excessive or larger

1766
01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:53.430
doses and the moderate drinkers time at the time,

1767
01:47:53.970 --> 01:47:57.540
they are associated with all of these positive outcomes.

1768
01:47:57.570 --> 01:48:02.400
And so it's certainly starting to increase my confidence that it's something

1769
01:48:02.401 --> 01:48:05.040
real going on where people should drink.

1770
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:09.690
Moderately should drink moderately.
Yeah.
Uh,
wow.

1771
01:48:09.691 --> 01:48:13.710
That's controversial,
right?
Is a pretty controversial isn't it?
Isn't it?

1772
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:17.070
I don't go should take a little heroin.
They should drink.
Moderately.

1773
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:20.120
Should do some steroids.
Um,

1774
01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:25.330
I'm obviously not really stating your position,
but isn't,

1775
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.590
there's a thing in red wine.
Um,
there's an antioxidant called Rivera trawl.

1776
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.100
Isn't that something that they've associated with health as well?

1777
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:34.830
They were thinking about it was specific to red wine,

1778
01:48:34.831 --> 01:48:39.630
but now they think it's just I'll in general.
Yeah.
In a perfect world,

1779
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:43.140
Dr. Carl Hart,
if you were,
the drugs are first of all,

1780
01:48:43.141 --> 01:48:45.900
why the fuck would we have the czar's?
Aren't they like evil?

1781
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:50.590
Isn't there like a fucking dictator when they they are,
yeah.
In a way,
right?
Yeah.

1782
01:48:50.591 --> 01:48:53.730
If you know anything about what happens with us drug policy,

1783
01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:55.830
you can't help but think that they are evil.

1784
01:48:55.890 --> 01:48:58.920
It's kind of ironic then that we call them the drug czar instead of the drug

1785
01:48:58.921 --> 01:49:01.050
chairman or the drug,
you know,

1786
01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:04.440
overseer or policy coordinator.

1787
01:49:04.450 --> 01:49:08.370
You have to understand the first drug czar was William Bennett and I think he,

1788
01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.690
he,
he tucked that title and that's where is he brand with it?
He's like,
well,

1789
01:49:12.691 --> 01:49:16.980
I'm a fucking czar.
I'm going to act like one if you were,

1790
01:49:16.981 --> 01:49:21.540
I mean it say if a President Obama or president Trump when he gets into office,

1791
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.240
is that scared the shit out of your what?
Not really man.

1792
01:49:24.241 --> 01:49:26.400
Cause the same thing I live in this country,

1793
01:49:26.401 --> 01:49:30.010
look at all of these people who run this country.
I mean,
uh,
it doesn't care me.

1794
01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.910
They're all,
they're not that different.
So,

1795
01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:36.650
well I think if anybody would be different than might be Trump.
I mean he's a,

1796
01:49:36.651 --> 01:49:40.350
he's the only one that's financially independent.
Yup.
Yup.

1797
01:49:40.351 --> 01:49:43.560
And that's probably why he's so well,
and he also has a,

1798
01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:48.100
has a personality and the other folks who were for the Republicans

1799
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.020
<v 2>don't have personalities.
That is true.</v>

1800
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:55.300
And this is not an endorsement by no means,
but this is just the state of fact.

1801
01:49:55.301 --> 01:49:59.470
He,
he has a personality and personality means a lot in this goofy country.
Yeah.

1802
01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:04.420
Um,
if,
if,
anyway,
if someone came along and said,
listen,
Doctor Heart,

1803
01:50:04.421 --> 01:50:07.390
you're obviously very educated in this subject,

1804
01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:09.310
much more so than the average person.

1805
01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:14.500
What do you recommend we do in this country to handle drugs?

1806
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:20.130
<v 1>Yeah,
so,
um,
the first thing I do,
um,
um,</v>

1807
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:21.400
uh,
you know,
it would be,

1808
01:50:21.401 --> 01:50:24.570
you'd be really hard pressed to have me like working government for one.

1809
01:50:24.571 --> 01:50:27.250
So I just want to state that because,
um,

1810
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:30.760
the thing that I love about being academia is that I'm a free man.

1811
01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.020
And then in government,

1812
01:50:32.021 --> 01:50:34.750
these people talk about what they can't do because of some of the,

1813
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:36.070
some whatever reason.

1814
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:39.820
I don't understand how you look in the mirror when you say you can't do things.

1815
01:50:39.821 --> 01:50:44.821
But if I had some influence on drug policy in this country,

1816
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:47.680
first thing I would do was decriminalized all drugs.

1817
01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:50.950
That would be the first thing that would happen immediately.

1818
01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:56.430
Then I would change our educational sort of,
uh,
programming in this country,

1819
01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:57.460
surrounding drugs,

1820
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.860
all of these things that vilified a drug and say that it's the drug that causes

1821
01:51:02.861 --> 01:51:03.940
that,
that would be out.

1822
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:07.240
People who are doing this sort of things that the government is paying for,

1823
01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:11.740
their money would dry up if they didn't change their,
the way they're educating.

1824
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:13.060
That's,
that's another thing.

1825
01:51:13.630 --> 01:51:18.630
Another thing I would do with police forces and that I had control over it.

1826
01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:22.060
They would,
when they confiscate drugs,

1827
01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:25.060
their domain mission is not to arrest people.

1828
01:51:25.061 --> 01:51:27.220
The main mission is to keep people safe.

1829
01:51:27.610 --> 01:51:32.610
Whenever they confiscated drugs day would test them for adulterants and see what

1830
01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:35.650
else is in that cocaine,
what else is in that heroin?

1831
01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.750
And they would be published in the local papers.

1832
01:51:37.751 --> 01:51:42.751
It will be published in some local sort of form where everyone would know avoid

1833
01:51:43.131 --> 01:51:47.150
this type of drug or does packaging because it has,
does,
don't,
don't,

1834
01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.860
don't trust and that's not safe.
Whereas something else,

1835
01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:55.150
it doesn't have that adulthood.
And so the people would be informed immediately.

1836
01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:59.310
Then another thing I would do,
I would work on um,
uh,

1837
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:02.830
legalizing or regulating drug and all of these drugs.

1838
01:52:03.130 --> 01:52:08.130
Figuring out what would be the best regulated market for marijuana.

1839
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.440
What would be the best regulated market for cocaine?

1840
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:14.870
What would be the best regulated market for heroin?
Well,

1841
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:19.570
how do we best regulate ecstasy?
How do we do this?
And,
um,

1842
01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:23.260
that's,
that's where I would go and we would,
uh,
we would,
uh,

1843
01:52:24.130 --> 01:52:28.690
we would get rid of the people in jail who are there because of drug violation.

1844
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:32.610
<v 2>Obama's done a little bit of that.
I just kind of scratched the surface,</v>

1845
01:52:32.611 --> 01:52:36.240
getting people out of jail that are in for nonviolent drug offenses.

1846
01:52:36.241 --> 01:52:39.240
But it's been,
it was a very small amount of people and it was,

1847
01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:42.210
there was a big deal do about it.
And I,
you know,

1848
01:52:42.211 --> 01:52:46.100
I couldn't help but be underwhelmed because I think it was only

1849
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.680
<v 1>like 65 people or something like that.
I don't remember what the,</v>

1850
01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:53.000
I think the total now has gone up to like 80 south took him.
Jesus Christ.

1851
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:56.830
He's fucking million people in jail.
We have 2.3 million.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1852
01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.200
But how many of them are in there for now?
No,
you're right.
You're right.

1853
01:53:00.201 --> 01:53:03.440
You're right.
Insane.
It's probably half the population,
right?
Yeah.
No,

1854
01:53:03.441 --> 01:53:07.970
I'm with you mid like you,
you've been overwhelmed or underwhelmed.

1855
01:53:07.971 --> 01:53:12.610
I have been,
um,
disappointed.
I mean I voted for Obama and,
uh,

1856
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:16.040
I was hoping that we get a lot more relief on this thing.
So I mean,
we,

1857
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:20.030
the crack cocaine was originally punished a hundred times more harshly than

1858
01:53:20.031 --> 01:53:21.470
powder cocaine at the federal level.

1859
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:24.980
It's now punished 18 times more harshly than powder cocaine.

1860
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:29.240
That doesn't make any sense.
They're the same drug and that's just racism,

1861
01:53:30.490 --> 01:53:31.323
you know,
that's,

1862
01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:36.680
or come back to racist targeting economic disparity.
I mean you're,

1863
01:53:36.681 --> 01:53:41.300
you're targeting people in poor communities.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
we doubled our,
um,

1864
01:53:41.370 --> 01:53:45.620
uh,
enforcement of drug laws has been racially discriminatory.
That's a fact.

1865
01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:50.420
I mean,
but we certainly can come back to the racism piece.
Uh,
but I mean,

1866
01:53:50.421 --> 01:53:53.720
so that sort of thing,
we were expecting Obama to,

1867
01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:56.900
his administration have pushed for one to one,
equating with crack,

1868
01:53:56.901 --> 01:54:01.040
what pattern it didn't happen.
And by the way,
it's 18 to one now.

1869
01:54:01.041 --> 01:54:03.980
And then when you look at the arrests of people who are being arrested,

1870
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:08.870
it's still 80% black.
It still does racially discriminatory sort of effect.

1871
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:13.070
So changing that law didn't have any impact on that.
That's one thing.

1872
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.740
And then when we think about the people who are being,

1873
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:17.890
the sentences have been commuted,
you know,

1874
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:22.250
he has become the president who has commuted more sentences than any other

1875
01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:26.510
president.
I think Johnson was a ahead of him at one point,

1876
01:54:26.511 --> 01:54:28.040
but now he's the past Johnson.

1877
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:31.940
But we have to think about when Johnson was president,

1878
01:54:31.941 --> 01:54:35.060
we met her that 200,000 people in jail,
you know,

1879
01:54:35.061 --> 01:54:37.700
now we got 2.3 million and sell.

1880
01:54:37.701 --> 01:54:42.701
So really this is a drop in a bucket and that this is disappointing to me.

1881
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:47.870
I am so,
um,
uh,
discouraged.

1882
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:50.960
Uh,
and um,
uh,

1883
01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:56.020
it's heartbreaking actually because we thought we would see this president be

1884
01:54:56.661 --> 01:55:01.620
more bold about these things,
raise these issues.
And um,

1885
01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:06.670
some of it is re some of these sort of arrests are related to race and race.

1886
01:55:07.610 --> 01:55:09.380
Racial discrimination is important.

1887
01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:12.500
But one of the things that happens in our country when we start having this

1888
01:55:12.501 --> 01:55:17.360
discussion or these discussions about racial discrimination is that we still,

1889
01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:22.040
we were in this frame where poor black people,

1890
01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:25.070
poor other people,
white people,

1891
01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:30.100
all these other people in the country who are catching the same hell are not

1892
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:35.060
working together as a result of keeping it to this conversation,

1893
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:37.580
tie to the ratio of discrimination.

1894
01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:41.690
Although racial discrimination is important in,
in a lot of domains,

1895
01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:45.390
and that we should not forget that,
but there are people,

1896
01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:50.450
there are white poor people catching the same hell for the same or similar

1897
01:55:50.521 --> 01:55:54.810
reasons.
The reason might not be conspicuously race,

1898
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:58.470
but it might be for other reasons.
Um,
like I said,

1899
01:55:58.471 --> 01:56:02.760
I've been traveling all over the,
all over the world and I went to Belfast,

1900
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:06.690
Northern Ireland,
and you got a lot of fans there.

1901
01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.320
Like the Catholics,
although they're not really capital,

1902
01:56:10.321 --> 01:56:12.570
as many of these people are not really capitalists,

1903
01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:17.640
but they're catching hell by,
uh,
for similar reasons.
You know,

1904
01:56:17.641 --> 01:56:21.810
they're being dominated by a British sort of a occupation,

1905
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:24.340
if you will.
Um,
and they're,

1906
01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.410
they have similar problems as poor people have in this country.
And,

1907
01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:33.510
and so one of the things I try and I'm struggling with is that I'm trying to get

1908
01:56:33.511 --> 01:56:38.511
people to see how poor black people struggles in the u s is connected with poor

1909
01:56:39.661 --> 01:56:42.690
white people struggle in Belfast.
It,

1910
01:56:42.691 --> 01:56:46.960
their struggles are connected with poor peoples in um,

1911
01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.230
in Brazil all around the globe.
These people have more things in common.

1912
01:56:52.650 --> 01:56:57.650
And then sometimes to conspicuous characteristic of race kind of blinds us from

1913
01:56:59.850 --> 01:57:02.890
our connection with other folks.
And,
and,

1914
01:57:02.891 --> 01:57:07.891
and so I'm struggling with how to communicate this in a way that everybody can

1915
01:57:08.431 --> 01:57:08.971
see,
hey,

1916
01:57:08.971 --> 01:57:13.650
we're in the shit together and there are a few elitist sort of people who are

1917
01:57:13.651 --> 01:57:18.651
benefiting from us going at each other's throat and not understanding.

1918
01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.220
And then us also just playing right into it.

1919
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:30.290
<v 2>One of the things about cocaine and heroin and accuracy as opposed to marijuana</v>

1920
01:57:30.631 --> 01:57:33.870
is that marijuana obviously is really easy to make.

1921
01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.310
I'm going to just put it in the ground.
You water it,
it grows,
harvest it,

1922
01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:41.310
it's simple.
It's like you see it as a leaf.
You,

1923
01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:43.950
you don't have to worry about there being a bunch of stuff in it.

1924
01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:46.080
When you talked about,
uh,
what's the word you use?

1925
01:57:46.081 --> 01:57:50.820
Adulterants adulterants someone's taking cocaine and cutting it with something

1926
01:57:50.821 --> 01:57:53.520
else.
Yeah.
That,
that becomes you when you'd look at it,

1927
01:57:53.521 --> 01:57:56.530
it still looks like white powder.
Yup.
Um,

1928
01:57:57.570 --> 01:58:02.550
legalization if we legalized it as opposed to decriminalizing,

1929
01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.530
if you decriminalizing it,
what'd you do need,

1930
01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:06.750
you're not prosecuting people that are using it,

1931
01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:12.200
but what do you do with the people that are selling it and how do you move to a,

1932
01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.460
an ethical,
responsible,

1933
01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:17.610
open market for something like this?

1934
01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:21.670
<v 1>Um,
so when you say what do you do with the people who are selling it?</v>

1935
01:58:21.671 --> 01:58:23.820
What do you mean?
The people who currently sell node?

1936
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:28.560
<v 2>No,
no,
no.
We'll be some people that will be,
see if we go to decriminalizing.
Yup.</v>

1937
01:58:28.590 --> 01:58:32.190
How,
obviously that means that you're not going to prosecute the people that are

1938
01:58:32.191 --> 01:58:33.930
using it,
but how do they get it?

1939
01:58:34.090 --> 01:58:36.460
<v 1>Yeah.
So do we change that?</v>

1940
01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:41.080
So decriminalization to think about Portugal and Czech Republic,
um,

1941
01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:44.200
you still have the illicit markets in those places.
Right?

1942
01:58:44.230 --> 01:58:47.830
And so people have to understand that decriminalization is not to go at the

1943
01:58:47.831 --> 01:58:52.650
listed markets.
Uh,
decriminalization,
the major reason that you decriminalize it,

1944
01:58:52.651 --> 01:58:57.590
that you don't want to put your citizens in jail and you want to,
uh,

1945
01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.890
encourage them to get help if they need help.

1946
01:58:59.891 --> 01:59:03.280
So it's about the sort of user and that that's kind of what you're doing.

1947
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:08.260
But if you're worried about illicit drug markets and you want to get rid of

1948
01:59:08.261 --> 01:59:13.150
illicit drug markets,
then regulation is a way to go.
Legal Law,

1949
01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:14.320
legal regulation.

1950
01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:19.620
And if you worry about adulterants legal regulation is a way to go because you

1951
01:59:20.231 --> 01:59:25.090
get rid of the black market and you get to rid of the potential dangerous

1952
01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:29.170
compounds that people cut these drugs with.
That's my major concern.

1953
01:59:29.171 --> 01:59:33.670
That's why I kind of pushed for now regulating these markets because I'm more

1954
01:59:33.671 --> 01:59:36.040
afraid of the adult trans.
I'm not afraid of heroin.

1955
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:37.960
I know how to keep people safe.
Well,
heroin,

1956
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.150
I know how to keep people safe with cocaine,

1957
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:43.690
but I don't know how to keep people safe with some of the cuts because I don't

1958
01:59:43.691 --> 01:59:44.524
know what they are.

1959
01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:47.260
<v 2>Right.
And no one knows until you test it.</v>

1960
01:59:47.710 --> 01:59:51.030
And it just seems to me that you're,
if,

1961
01:59:51.070 --> 01:59:54.470
if we accept the fact that people were doing drugs in this country and we,

1962
01:59:54.490 --> 01:59:56.470
we kind of have,
right.
I mean,

1963
01:59:56.540 --> 02:00:01.420
it's not like there's ever been a time in our country that people stop doing

1964
02:00:01.421 --> 02:00:02.980
drugs.
Even for a month.

1965
02:00:03.250 --> 02:00:06.730
There's never been like a month of no one doing drugs in this country.

1966
02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:10.270
So the entire top president wouldn't function.
Right.

1967
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:14.600
<v 1>I mean,
those guys take sleeping pills and stimulants to get going.
I mean,
they,</v>

1968
02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:15.443
they're you,

1969
02:00:15.450 --> 02:00:18.300
<v 2>they have to do,
they're really,
they have to like,</v>

1970
02:00:18.301 --> 02:00:19.710
do you think Obama takes sleeping pills?

1971
02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:25.360
<v 1>All right.
Um,
I can't say for sure that he does,
but if you,</v>

1972
02:00:25.361 --> 02:00:26.320
if we had a bet,

1973
02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:31.480
I will bet you a lot of money daddy does just because he's so tired because he

1974
02:00:31.481 --> 02:00:33.820
works so crazy hours.
He would be,

1975
02:00:33.821 --> 02:00:37.330
I would say it responsible if he didn't take sleeping pills.
Really?

1976
02:00:37.690 --> 02:00:41.590
Of course you need sleep is one of the most important human functions.

1977
02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:44.500
And I want my president to be getting sleep.

1978
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:48.740
<v 2>But when you take sleeping pills doesn't alter your rem sleep and fuck with your</v>

1979
02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:49.574
cycles.

1980
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.310
<v 1>Some of them certainly can.</v>

1981
02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:55.540
So you try and find ones like opiates are outstanding

1982
02:00:55.710 --> 02:00:58.450
<v 2>for sleep.
You're a big fan of the opiates aren't.
Yeah.</v>

1983
02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:03.240
Are you working for the opiate industry?
Are you,
are you involved somehow?

1984
02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:04.853
But there are

1985
02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:09.810
<v 1>authors that will work and I'm sure,
yeah,
some good physicians.</v>

1986
02:01:09.811 --> 02:01:11.880
I mean you look throughout history,

1987
02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:15.540
the presidents have taken stimulants and sedatives as well.

1988
02:01:15.541 --> 02:01:16.860
They should because they,

1989
02:01:17.250 --> 02:01:22.250
they have to be on these different coasts and the time change and they have to,

1990
02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:27.180
it just doesn't make,
I mean,
people who have to be in the public eye,

1991
02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:32.240
I assure you they are taking drugs to enhance their human experience and

1992
02:01:33.721 --> 02:01:34.554
function.

1993
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:39.740
<v 2>So,
uh,
to go back to that,
there's never been a time,
it's not like an goal.</v>

1994
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:42.980
There's never been a time where we've gone a month,
a week,
a year,
whatever,

1995
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:44.990
without anyone in this country doing drugs.

1996
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:47.270
So we know that the drugs are always going to exist.

1997
02:01:47.690 --> 02:01:51.230
It would seem to me that this country that's obsessed with making money to the

1998
02:01:51.231 --> 02:01:55.730
point where we have privatized prisons and we allow people to profit off of

1999
02:01:55.731 --> 02:01:56.930
people being in jail,

2000
02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:02.320
wouldn't it be a better source of income to instead tax legal sales of drugs to

2001
02:02:04.071 --> 02:02:06.260
make everything legal,
tax it,

2002
02:02:06.410 --> 02:02:08.810
and then you get the benefit like you got in Colorado.

2003
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:13.990
Colorado is the first state ever to get more taxes from marijuana than they do

2004
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:16.370
from alcohol,
which is incredible.

2005
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:19.640
They made more money this year from out from marijuana than they have from

2006
02:02:19.641 --> 02:02:22.430
alcohol and alcohol has been around forever.

2007
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.580
If we did that with cocaine and heroin,

2008
02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:30.860
with ecstasy and all these other drugs that we know people are already using,

2009
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:35.210
and we also know people are selling illegally and not paying taxes on it.

2010
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:38.660
It's not only people are selling coke and going,
you know what?
I'm a coke dealer.

2011
02:02:38.661 --> 02:02:43.070
Bowel responsible Americans.
I like to pay taxes.
I made $100 million here.
Hey,

2012
02:02:43.130 --> 02:02:46.640
how'd you make that money?
I'm fucking hustle,
hustle and flow,
you know,
I do.

2013
02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:49.790
No one's going to do that.

2014
02:02:49.791 --> 02:02:53.900
So we're missing out on all that tax revenue as a country.
I mean,

2015
02:02:53.901 --> 02:02:58.901
it's an economically unsound to not legalize it and tax it if you know for a

2016
02:02:59.931 --> 02:03:04.850
fact that people are going to do it.
Yeah.
It seems economically irresponsible.

2017
02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:08.330
And then the idea of these public or private prisons,

2018
02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:13.600
private prisons are a giant issue in this country because they also lobby and

2019
02:03:13.630 --> 02:03:15.110
the,
the prison unions,

2020
02:03:15.111 --> 02:03:19.880
the prison guard unions and police officer's unions lobby to make sure the drug

2021
02:03:19.881 --> 02:03:23.870
laws state in place to make sure that they have work.
It's insidious.

2022
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:25.940
It's creepy and it's scary.

2023
02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.990
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
private prison.
Now the thing is,</v>

2024
02:03:28.991 --> 02:03:31.310
is that they're all those things you said,

2025
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:36.400
but understand they only make up 11% of all prison beds in the United States.

2026
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:38.510
Right.
They're trying to,

2027
02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:41.770
they are going to Brazil now and they're going to some other places and,

2028
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:44.990
and it's important that we are aware of what you just said,

2029
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:48.530
but we also need to be aware of places like Louisiana.

2030
02:03:48.531 --> 02:03:52.400
I think they have the largest number of prisoners in the country.
Um,

2031
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:56.930
they have local sheriffs who kind of operate like private prisons.

2032
02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:02.380
So they bid or they get these state prisoners to be housed in their jail and

2033
02:04:04.341 --> 02:04:07.910
they receive a certain amount of money for having those,

2034
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:10.130
those prisoners in their local jails.

2035
02:04:10.131 --> 02:04:15.131
So this is a way for the local sheriffs to generate income revenue by taking the

2036
02:04:17.961 --> 02:04:21.350
prisoners from state prisoners into their local Gerald jails.

2037
02:04:21.351 --> 02:04:24.260
And so this technically is not private prison,

2038
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:29.770
but this is certainly unscrupulous and people should be aware of this going on

2039
02:04:29.931 --> 02:04:33.680
throughout the country as well.
So private prisons are concerned,

2040
02:04:33.681 --> 02:04:37.830
but also these local jails and local sheriffs,
they're doing similar things.

2041
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:43.550
<v 2>But legalizing drugs though would be financially a huge boon to our economy.</v>

2042
02:04:45.810 --> 02:04:50.460
<v 1>Yeah,
I think so.
Um,
um,
yeah,
I think so,
but uh,</v>

2043
02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:53.850
people will,
um,
people,
um,

2044
02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:58.950
I don't know if that argument alone is,
is going to be as,
can it be compelling?

2045
02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:01.200
I mean,
I,
I certainly think it's an important argument.

2046
02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:04.350
<v 2>Sure.
No,
not alone,
but it,
it's something that should be considered,</v>

2047
02:05:04.351 --> 02:05:06.360
especially in the wake of what's going on in college,

2048
02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:11.310
<v 1>right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And there are people who are saying in terms of Colorado,</v>

2049
02:05:11.311 --> 02:05:15.270
they're saying that,
yeah,
Colorado is generating all of this tax revenue,

2050
02:05:15.570 --> 02:05:20.160
but they're having to pay out a lot of it too because they have to enforce this

2051
02:05:20.161 --> 02:05:20.994
new law.

2052
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:26.130
And so people are kind of distorting this sort of story.

2053
02:05:26.131 --> 02:05:30.480
But I think over time,
Colorado and other places,

2054
02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:35.570
it is going to show that this is a huge benefit and the benefits far outweigh

2055
02:05:37.111 --> 02:05:38.220
the risks I think.

2056
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:43.040
<v 2>And similar to what's going on in Portugal where you see the decrease in violent</v>

2057
02:05:43.041 --> 02:05:45.140
crime,
the decrease in addiction,

2058
02:05:45.141 --> 02:05:48.410
the decrease in all sorts of different problems that are associated decrease in

2059
02:05:48.411 --> 02:05:51.080
revenues to their prisons and all of those things.
Yeah.

2060
02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:54.620
All the negative aspects of that we associate with drugs.

2061
02:05:54.710 --> 02:05:57.500
A lot of it is negative aspects of crime.

2062
02:05:58.130 --> 02:06:02.390
<v 1>Yeah.
See the thing about Portugal too,
you have to understand,
um,</v>

2063
02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:05.580
in places like Portugal,

2064
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:10.010
Switzerland knows kind of places where they kind of take care of their people.

2065
02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:14.980
They are more of a homogenous society than we are.
And when,

2066
02:06:14.981 --> 02:06:18.950
when you have a place like the United States where we're not as much as like La,

2067
02:06:18.951 --> 02:06:21.530
you guys have every nationality,

2068
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:26.300
ethnic group raised their all here,
not homogenous at all.

2069
02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:30.140
And so what are the things that the drug laws have has done?

2070
02:06:30.141 --> 02:06:35.141
It has allowed us to separate out those people we don't like and go after them.

2071
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:40.550
So if we decriminalize it makes it more difficult.
So you taking away that tool,

2072
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.030
whereas Portugal to Swiss and those folks,

2073
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:46.350
there's such a marginal societies,

2074
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:50.360
they kind of care about the people in their society because the people who are

2075
02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:55.880
empower,
um,
they see that many of the people who might be,

2076
02:06:55.940 --> 02:07:00.780
uh,
subjected to these laws,
they look like them.
They are then,
um,

2077
02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:03.730
and our society,
since it's not as homogeneous,

2078
02:07:04.190 --> 02:07:09.190
it's easy for us to think about these drug laws being used to go out to those

2079
02:07:09.381 --> 02:07:12.890
people who don't share our values.
That's,
that's what we say.

2080
02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:15.880
But they really don't look like us and they're really not us.

2081
02:07:15.881 --> 02:07:20.881
So this can't really happen because we know that there are a number of people

2082
02:07:21.411 --> 02:07:25.730
who,
who look like folks who are in Washington and they're using drugs,

2083
02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:29.120
they're using a lot of drugs,
but they're not subjected to drug policy.

2084
02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:30.651
I see what you're saying.

2085
02:07:30.651 --> 02:07:35.030
And so it's like we have to be honest about why we have these policies in place

2086
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:35.920
in the first place.

2087
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:40.600
They allow us to go out to the people we don't like without explicitly saying
so.

2088
02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:45.160
<v 2>So I think overall,
I guess an overview we're,
we're,</v>

2089
02:07:45.161 --> 02:07:50.161
we're looking at is we have a society that has a lot of ignorance when it comes

2090
02:07:52.631 --> 02:07:56.860
to both the prevalence of drugs,
the use of drugs and the effect of drugs.

2091
02:07:57.370 --> 02:08:02.370
And that ignorance is part of the problem and it's shaped not just public

2092
02:08:03.221 --> 02:08:08.140
opinion,
but also shape policy shaped how politicians address these issues.
Like,

2093
02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:12.160
like a guy like Chris Christie that is allowed to say ignorant stuff.

2094
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:15.940
The reason why he's not booed off stage and he does it is for a lot of the

2095
02:08:15.941 --> 02:08:16.870
people in the audience,

2096
02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:19.960
they don't know that what he's saying is unbelievably ignorant.

2097
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:24.310
<v 1>Yeah.
And he kind of provides the cover for them,
you know,
um,</v>

2098
02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:28.540
they kind of support these things because they're not happening to them.

2099
02:08:28.570 --> 02:08:33.340
And it's those other people who don't share their values is what they say,

2100
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:37.630
but they really don't look like them.
They don't,
they don't dress like them.

2101
02:08:37.631 --> 02:08:41.800
They don't go to the same schools,
they don't do any of these things.
So Christie,

2102
02:08:41.801 --> 02:08:45.970
when he says that he's saying this because he's representing a,

2103
02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:50.971
what many Americans think and he's providing cover for that bigoted ignorance or

2104
02:08:52.721 --> 02:08:55.300
that,
uh,
uninformed perspective.

2105
02:08:55.970 --> 02:09:00.430
<v 2>So what you're doing now with this touring all around the world and are you</v>

2106
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:03.320
speaking and all these places?
Like what,
how do,
what are you doing?

2107
02:09:03.710 --> 02:09:05.950
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
I,
I,
uh,</v>

2108
02:09:06.150 --> 02:09:10.410
I spoke at the World Health Organization as past summer,
um,

2109
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.830
universities in Belfast and London.
Uh,
Geneva of course,
uh,

2110
02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:20.810
Brazil.
It was just down there speaking.
Uh,
I'll be in Canada next month.

2111
02:09:20.910 --> 02:09:24.590
Um,
so just doing all of these,
these talks,

2112
02:09:24.591 --> 02:09:28.730
I'm trying to have these kinds of conversations,
trying to inform people,

2113
02:09:28.731 --> 02:09:32.900
trying to let people know that they've been hoodwinked all around the world.

2114
02:09:32.901 --> 02:09:34.480
And they've been hoodwinked,
um,

2115
02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.760
particularly countries that follow the US drug policy and trying to expose why

2116
02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:43.010
the countries are following this policy that it has had.

2117
02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:46.670
It's having detrimental impact on their citizens.

2118
02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:51.090
<v 2>How was this received?
Is it re universally received or is there,</v>

2119
02:09:51.091 --> 02:09:53.320
there's different places that are more open to it?

2120
02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:56.120
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
in Brazil for example,
uh,</v>

2121
02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:01.240
they have followed the u s wholeheartedly and Brazil has 50% of their population

2122
02:10:01.371 --> 02:10:03.020
is black,
right?
50%.

2123
02:10:03.021 --> 02:10:07.850
They have like the greatest African population outside of Africa.
Uh,

2124
02:10:07.851 --> 02:10:11.330
they,
uh,
and Mo and prisons,

2125
02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:14.310
they're jails filled Phil black people.
And,
uh,

2126
02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:19.420
the poor people in the country up and their drug policy is being used as a tool

2127
02:10:21.231 --> 02:10:23.630
to further marginalize this group basically.

2128
02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:27.620
And so when I go down there and speak and abroad,
dare by their government,

2129
02:10:27.621 --> 02:10:32.621
oftentimes it's well received even from the ruling class and the government.

2130
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:36.530
And so it's a conundrum to me,
quite frankly,

2131
02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:42.110
that I'm so well received there by the ruling class.
Um,
but,

2132
02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:44.840
uh,
there are some people who,
who are,
uh,

2133
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:49.070
very interested in changing policy Geneva and those places.

2134
02:10:49.071 --> 02:10:53.810
What I'm saying to them,
those folks there and they're like,
no shit.
We know that,

2135
02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.640
you know,
and they,
they are Derek.

2136
02:10:55.641 --> 02:11:00.641
Drug policy is reflected or it's more a rational go to France.

2137
02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:03.830
They're equally as ignorant as we are,

2138
02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:07.160
and they use their apologetic policy just like we do.

2139
02:11:07.161 --> 02:11:12.080
And they're equally Agner arrogant as we are.
Um,
Belfast,
uh,

2140
02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:16.190
they are,
um,
they're trying,
I mean,
they are there.

2141
02:11:16.191 --> 02:11:20.600
Derek Catholic population,
you know,
they're on the siege basically.

2142
02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:25.490
Um,
um,
Vancouver,
they feel the message of course,

2143
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:30.620
um,
uh,
Norway,
all of these people,

2144
02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:35.330
they are responding because they know this is not,
I'm not,
um,

2145
02:11:35.331 --> 02:11:39.050
I wish I was brilliant and bright and all those things.
I'm not,
you know,

2146
02:11:39.051 --> 02:11:41.970
this is not anything that's earth shattering date.

2147
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:44.960
These people know many of the people around the world,

2148
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:50.390
Columbia and was in Columbia.
Um,
those people,
they're politicians.

2149
02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:51.253
They know,

2150
02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:55.850
but they're getting a lot of money from the US to continue this sort of war on

2151
02:11:55.851 --> 02:11:58.520
drugs.
Mexico,
they know,

2152
02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:02.090
but they're getting a lot of money from the u s to continue this war on drugs.

2153
02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:06.380
Hasn't,
Mexico decriminalized a lot of things.
They decriminalized everything,

2154
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:10.530
but nobody talks about it because,
uh,

2155
02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.640
as I pointed out earlier in Portugal,

2156
02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:18.770
a person is allowed to have a 10 day supply of drugs before that that triggers

2157
02:12:18.771 --> 02:12:22.700
some sort of criminal prosecution.
So you can have a 10 day supply,

2158
02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:27.440
a methamphetamine,
heroin,
whatever.
In Mexico you get,

2159
02:12:27.710 --> 02:12:32.710
you trigger a criminal offense when you have just a small amount of something.

2160
02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:37.310
So it's like,
it's really not decriminalization,
uh,
you know,
it's just,

2161
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:39.470
they lowered the threshold that,

2162
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:44.690
that trigger a criminal process of prosecution.
And so,
uh,
it's,

2163
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:48.650
it doesn't really play out in the spirit of decriminalization.

2164
02:12:48.651 --> 02:12:49.850
So they're still,

2165
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:54.910
they probably did it to appeal to the United States laws or to abide by what the

2166
02:12:56.721 --> 02:12:58.700
United States is looking for them to do.
Yeah.

2167
02:12:58.701 --> 02:13:00.710
I don't know exactly why they did it,

2168
02:13:00.711 --> 02:13:05.570
but I know they're continuing their war on drugs.
Um,
in part because of us,

2169
02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:06.553
um,

2170
02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:11.680
which is a war on drugs is really a war on people and particularly a war on poor

2171
02:13:11.841 --> 02:13:15.990
people as we know.
And I'm against wars,
you know,

2172
02:13:15.991 --> 02:13:18.830
and I'm an ex military person now.

2173
02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:22.880
People want to see you talk and are you still traveling?
Yeah.
Yeah.
