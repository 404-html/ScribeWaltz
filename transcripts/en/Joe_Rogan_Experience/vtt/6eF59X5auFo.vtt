1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.770
Four,
three,
two,
boom.

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.910
And we're live.
How are you brother?
I'm great man.
Living in here,
man.
Thank you.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.660
Yeah,
I mean I've been wanting to have you on for a long time,
man.

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.440
I've been following your career forever and I've been a big fan forever,

5
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.210
so it's nice to be able to

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.530
<v 1>down with.
Yeah,
I know,
man.
This is awesome.
This is a,
I've been a big fan of the,</v>

7
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:27.310
of yours obviously,
and the podcast for a long time.
So to be in here,

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.200
get the tour,
check out your awesome man warehouse.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.590
<v 0>I think a dream.</v>

10
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.860
This is an elaborate plot to convince me to get you to join the UFC.

11
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.300
That's all it says right away.
Right away.
We want to go straight to it.
Okay,

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.810
well I just,
I mean all of this could be yours.

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.710
I appreciate Rory Macdonald going over there.
I know he did what he had to do,

14
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:50.580
but even that one bums me out.
I wanted a,

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.040
I want to see you fight the best guys in the world.

16
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:57.720
And I think right now over in Beltour you have very good competition,

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.780
but I don't think you have the best guys and I think you're one of the best
guys.

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.801
I think a,

19
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.490
I think I wake up every morning and think I'm the best guy in the world to,

20
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.140
that's the way we want to be the best guy in the world.

21
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:09.180
That's the way I've been thinking for a while.
And then not always in my car

22
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.360
<v 1>here.
I mean I've had some losses where I've,
you know,</v>

23
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.820
had temporary lapses of confidence and whatnot,

24
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:17.810
whether it be my training or my abilities and myself or my thoughts and my

25
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.980
abilities myself.
But I mean,
where I'm at right now firing on all cylinders,

26
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.873
I feel like

27
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.930
<v 0>everything's worked.</v>

28
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.370
So do you feel like those moments where you haven't been at your best,

29
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:32.090
where you've had lapses and then you felt those dark moments,

30
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:36.410
do those motivate you to never let that happen again?
Yeah,

31
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:39.150
I mean I think I actually went through for those.
Yeah.

32
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.950
<v 1>People that don't know.
I went through three losses in a row.
I mean,
that's,</v>

33
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.310
that's rough.
I mean,
the first lost Eddie Alvarez was a tough split decision.

34
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.690
A lot of people thought I won.
Um,
so you kind of get this,
you know,
oh,

35
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.780
woe is me attitude,
which I had never had really had before.

36
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:54.370
And all of a sudden it's like,
why did this happen to me?

37
00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:56.470
Then had a back injury and then fought,

38
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:59.860
we'll Brooks when I shouldn't have on one week,
basically one week of training,

39
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.090
which led to another loss,

40
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:04.090
which led to another lack of confidence and then another law.

41
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:07.840
So I went through that tough dark time,
you know,

42
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:12.100
and I think there was certain aspects of the of it that was,
it was me taking,

43
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.300
taking the sport for granted.

44
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.860
It was me taking my abilities for granted and also just not taking extreme

45
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:20.470
ownership of my mental state.

46
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.290
Like realizing that I might be the hardest worker in the gym.

47
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.050
I am the hardest worker in the gym in every gym.
I go to him,
the hardest worker.

48
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.140
I lived life,
right?
I do the right things.
Um,

49
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.980
but if you're not constantly taking extreme ownership of your mental state of

50
00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:37.570
your confidence,
your self image,
I think a healthy self image is the,
um,

51
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.450
the most important component of being successful in life.
And I just,

52
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.920
I wasn't taking care of that essence.

53
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.610
<v 0>So you were doing all the right things physically,</v>

54
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.060
you weren't doing what you needed to do mentally.
Yeah,
I mean,

55
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.230
I think I had never visualized until after that.
I mean,

56
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.120
<v 1>honestly,
I mean,
I come from,
uh,
I come from a hardworking background.</v>

57
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:59.120
My Mom and dad both worked two jobs.
My Dad was a union carpenter,

58
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.290
woke up at five in the morning every single morning,
pulled us,

59
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.410
pulled himself up by his bootstraps mom the same way,
working two,
three jobs,

60
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.840
both of them to make sure that me and my brothers had every,

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.310
every single advantage in life,
whether it be wrestling camps,
football camps,

62
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:16.480
this,
that,
the other thing.
Um,
but we weren't exactly taught that,
hey,

63
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.030
you can go out in the world and do great things.

64
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.510
You can go out and you can be not just good but great and be a champion.

65
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:25.060
And I think I went into college wrestling and I might,

66
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.370
I might have told the coaches I wanted to be a national champion.

67
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:29.380
I might've told the reporters,
um,

68
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.720
all the people that I was supposed to then I want it to be a national champion.

69
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.050
But in my heart of hearts,
I didn't truly believe it.
You know,
and I think,

70
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.950
and I was,
I mean,
you,
you ask Tyron,
you asked Ben,
um,

71
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.260
those guys took me under their wing because I was the hardest worker in the
room,

72
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.120
you know,
and they said,
man,
this guy could be good,

73
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.170
but I didn't exactly believe in myself.
Um,

74
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.310
and now it's taken me almost til I'm 30 years old to really truly believe that I

75
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.540
was put on this earth to do some amazing things and that there is no limits on

76
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.930
myself and that there is no limits to my capabilities and my abilities.
So,

77
00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.261
I mean,

78
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:04.261
I think we underestimate how important and how mental life is.

79
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:07.570
And not just in,
not just in athletics,
not just in fighting,
not just in sports,

80
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.390
but I mean in anything,
in business and,
and just being a good person.

81
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.660
Just believing in yourself and having a healthy self image.
Yeah,

82
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:15.030
I couldn't agree more.
Um,

83
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.830
I think that's one of the most important things to life,

84
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.240
but it's also really difficult to cultivate.
Oh,
it is Bob.
Well,

85
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.660
I think too,
I mean,
I'm very hard on myself,
you know?
I mean,

86
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.480
I think anybody who's,
who's successful is,

87
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:30.040
is at least relatively hard on themselves.
And I,

88
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.890
I think I got to the point where I just started calling myself lazy.
You know,

89
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.850
I wake up every morning,
you know,
and I,
and I think,
Michael,
you're being lazy.

90
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:38.260
If you don't do something today,

91
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.220
listen to this podcast or watching this youtube video or read this book,

92
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.350
or spend 10 minutes,
five minutes,

93
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:49.351
30 minutes visualizing yourself in a cage or on a podium or having loads of

94
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:54.100
wealth or having loads of influence,
having loads of impact,
having,

95
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.530
having ridiculous amounts of success.

96
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.470
Because until you actually see it in your mind's eye,

97
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.940
you can't actually achieve it.

98
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.940
Or we are going to get to the point right on the cusp of about to be achieving

99
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:06.880
it.
And you're going to have that cognitive dissonance where something,

100
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.360
something pops up where you have the opportunity to break that barrier.

101
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:13.690
But you're gonna find a way to sabotage yourself because you don't truly believe

102
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:16.210
that you deserve it.
And I did that numerous times in college.

103
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.220
There was times where I was beaten,
um,

104
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.450
top rank guys in the country and would somehow find a way to lose because

105
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.160
winning,
to me,
being crazy successful to me wasn't exactly,

106
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.020
it didn't exactly Mesh with how I truly saw myself.
You know,

107
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.220
I think it's,
and I think I can look back on that and not with regret,

108
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:39.490
but with that kind of edge now they just educate myself and I look back and I

109
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:44.410
could put myself at national duels against CPH later,
US versus Minnesota.

110
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.470
My team needed me to,
when he was ranked the top five in the country,

111
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.940
I wasn't supposed to beat him.

112
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.420
I was up by two takedowns and somehow in the third period I lose the match and I

113
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:57.350
can go back and see that in my mind and realize,
okay,
that was a time,

114
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.393
let's say,
let's,

115
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.090
<v 2>let's,
uh,</v>

116
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.690
let's respect that for what it is and let's use that as fuel for the future.

117
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:06.380
I mean,
my last Eddie Alvarez was,
was a lot of technical,

118
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.650
a lot of technical things I did wrong.

119
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:13.630
Technically losses the will rooks were,
were things I did wrong technically.
Um,

120
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.290
but mentally I wasn't there as well.

121
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.080
And then I came back with a vengeance and then one,

122
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:20.060
and I've now I've one six in my last seven.

123
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.440
The only loss was a crazy freak injury and now we can continue to move forward

124
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:27.920
and just kind of look at it from as an adult instead of take the emotion out of

125
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:31.070
it and look at it a plus B equals c,
you know?

126
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:32.480
And so it's really kind of helped me,

127
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540
I think for a lot of people who don't test themselves in such an extreme manner.

128
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:37.731
I mean,

129
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.940
I think MMA is probably one of the most extreme things you could do for a job

130
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:45.410
with being a soldier or a fireman or a police officer or something like that.

131
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.410
But it's that this idea that you sabotage yourself because you can't imagine

132
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:51.740
yourself winning.

133
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.740
Chael Sonnen talked about that quite a bit about his fight with Anderson Silva,

134
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.240
how he was,
you know,
kind of dominating him,
not kind of,
but was dominating him,

135
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.510
was very close to being the UFC.

136
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:06.020
Middleweight champion found a way to fall into a triangle and he had done that

137
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:10.550
with Paulo Filio when he fought him and there was this thing that he would do

138
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.370
where he would find a way to fuck it up.

139
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.280
Even though you're there doing it,

140
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:20.060
the pressure of possibly pulling it off was too overwhelming to,

141
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:22.940
you didn't build some,
some ways you didn't,
you didn't believe it.
And,

142
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.020
and it's not even,
I mean we're,
we're all,
I think we're all victim to our subs,

143
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.780
our subconscious sometimes too.
I mean,
like we said,
I mean,

144
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.870
we're in there fighting.
You think,
okay,
that's,
that's a man in there fighting.
He,

145
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:37.120
he has control of his body.
But you,
you do,
but you don't,
I mean like when,

146
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:38.150
when Jay was getting caught,
I mean,

147
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.650
I know exactly what you're talking about it for everybody.
No,

148
00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:43.610
the remembers that fight because we were all sitting there watching,
thinking,

149
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:44.151
holy cow,

150
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:47.480
I can't believe [inaudible] here's a couple of minutes away from being the tar

151
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.700
out of them,
you know,
and all of a sudden,

152
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.400
I think we all saw the triangle come into,
you know,

153
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.490
Anderson and it seemed like he'd put push the arm down real slow and then all of

154
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.010
a sudden through the leg over and we're all like,
what are you doing?

155
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.540
And then 30 seconds later he's,
you know,
or 10 seconds later the,
the fights over.

156
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:04.670
And I think it's the,
the,

157
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:09.671
your views or your beliefs not matching up with the reality and all of a sudden

158
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.080
there's that fine line between breaking that barrier.

159
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.760
And unless you have been there before,
unless like I said,
visualizing yourself,

160
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.000
extremely successful,
extremely wealthy.
Someone to be looked at,

161
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:22.580
someone to be admired,
someone to be,
to,
to follow.

162
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:26.870
Unless you see that you're going to get to the point where you tell everybody

163
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:27.710
you want the success,

164
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:31.130
but you're not going to get it unless you 100% truly believe in it.

165
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:33.440
And it took me 30 years to figure it out.

166
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:37.430
So anybody who's done that before you know it,
it's okay.
It will come with time.

167
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:39.200
But you really have to,
like I said,

168
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:44.201
take extreme ownership of inside your brain between your ears is the most

169
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:47.120
important part of life as we've already said.
And,
and,
and,

170
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:51.650
and you can continue to work hard.
And I go back to the talking about being lazy.

171
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:55.800
You know,
I literally call myself lazy and you know,
shame myself.
You know,
like,

172
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.430
Michael,

173
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 1>why didn't you do this today?
Why didn't you work on your mental,</v>

174
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.340
your mental health today,
your self image today?
Why didn't you visualize?

175
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:02.911
Why didn't you do that?

176
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:05.430
Because that's just just like flexing a muscle in the gym,

177
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.260
just like throwing a thousand repetitions,

178
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.950
whether it be on the punching bag or drilling or a wrestling move or a or a

179
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.840
takedown.
It's all the same stuff.

180
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:15.750
And arguably more important on the mental side of things and it isn't the

181
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.030
physical side of things.
When you keep saying extreme ownership.

182
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.490
Did you read Jocko is booked.
I have it.
I have,

183
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.390
it's one of those ones where I have it and I haven't read it yet,
but I,

184
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.430
I love that,
that word.
Extreme ownership.
Yeah,
it's an awesome not,

185
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.590
it's an awesome book too.
And it's from a guy who was actually lived it,
you know,

186
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.050
just a lot of,
you know,

187
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.600
there's a lot of wisdom in his life experiences that you can get something out

188
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:37.740
of.
Um,

189
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.770
I asked because you obviously are a guy who seeks out knowledge,

190
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.490
right?
You,
you,
you work on your mind.
What,
what was it?

191
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:50.370
Was it a book or as a series of books?
Like what,

192
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.060
what got you thinking differently?
Well,
honestly for me,

193
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.960
what got me thinking differently,

194
00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:59.310
it was honestly just going through the most trying time in my life.
I mean,

195
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:02.310
I had just gotten married.
Now it's time to be a man,
now it's time to step up.

196
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.480
Now it's time to provide.

197
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.100
And all of a sudden I go through this loss streak where after my third loss,

198
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:10.080
I went home to San Diego with my wife.

199
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:12.720
We sat on the couch and we sit there and we just cried.
Who was the third loss?

200
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.830
Uh,
Third Wilson was we'll books the second time.
Oh,
that's right.
So,
um,

201
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.060
so I lost him twice,
Eddie once and then now the Madison Square Garden one.

202
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.840
But we went home,
we sat there and it was almost like,
what do we do now?

203
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.220
Is Bella tour going to cut me?
Am I,
did I work this hard to now,
you know,

204
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.290
be where I'm at now.
You know,
I mean,
I was at the,

205
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.710
I mean I was a two years or year and a half removed from being one of the top

206
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:36.960
three guys in the world had just beaten Eddie,
Eddie and you know,

207
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:40.410
all that kind of stuff.
And now here I was,
three fights in a row lost.
But it was,

208
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.700
it was that time where I realized,
right.

209
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.090
I was actually starting to change my kind of mental training and stuff.

210
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:53.620
I was starting my mental training as I was going into that third fight.
Um,

211
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.700
or that,
that third loss,
that second fight with a little Brooks.
Um,

212
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.650
but I just hadn't been there yet.
And honestly that one,

213
00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:03.470
and that one was more just like I got caught,
you know?
Um,
but that,

214
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.740
that was really what kind of set the trigger.
And,
and I,

215
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.470
and I think it just started to realize,
Michael,
why you know,
you,

216
00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:11.720
you sit there and you tell people you want to be the best.
You,
your,

217
00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:15.180
your actions speak louder than your words.
You work harder than everybody else.

218
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:18.150
You show at first,
you're the last one to leave.
You take care of your body,

219
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:21.390
you do all the right things.
At the end of the day,
somebody has to be the best.

220
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:24.630
Why shouldn't it be?
You?
And I kept asking myself that question,

221
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.590
and the only answer I could come up with was,
I deserve to be the best.

222
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:32.160
I really do.
You know?
And I can say that with humility to say,

223
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:34.170
I really do deserve to be the best guy in the,

224
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:36.780
in the entire world at lightweight.
Now,
nobody works harder than I do.

225
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.460
Nobody takes care of themselves by than I do.

226
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.000
Nobody has made the sacrifices that I have and nobody lives the clean lifestyle

227
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.240
like I do.
And it has,
has a calling on their life like I do.

228
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.730
Yet when it came down to it,

229
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:52.530
it has taken years and years and decades to almost erase the small mindedness

230
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.950
that I've had in my past.
Um,
and we're all just a constant work in progress.

231
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:01.780
And I think I just,
I came up with work hard,
good things might happen,

232
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.500
but most likely it be mediocre,
you know?
That's Kinda,
that was Kinda my mindset.

233
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.730
But what did you do different or what,
what did you change for me yet?

234
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.200
Reading books.
I'm like,
what specifically,

235
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.710
do you remember what triggered it or what helped you?
There's a,
um,

236
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.790
there was a book called Mind Gym.
We were heard of it,
no mind gym.

237
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:21.880
And they talked about,
he talks about making a mental highlight reel.

238
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.390
And since that day,
I've made mental highlight reels every couple of months.

239
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:26.920
And even even right now to this day,

240
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.360
there's on my mental highlight reel right now is beating Kyler Sanderson,

241
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.553
um,

242
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.330
at Mizzou on senior night when him and I were ranked at the same,

243
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.880
we were ranked like fourth and fifth in the country,
you know,

244
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.610
and not that I wasn't supposed to be doing,
but the manner in which I beat him,

245
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:43.444
I almost majored Im.

246
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.870
And it was one of those breakthrough moments where I gave myself permission in

247
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:51.160
front of everybody to just go out there and beat a guy handedly.

248
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.530
It was a wrestling mat and it was a wrestling match,
you know.

249
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.770
So when you say make a mental highlight reel,

250
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.740
this is of your past accomplishments,
past accomplishments.

251
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.320
And I think the biggest detriment,
the,

252
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.410
the biggest detriment to the people that work hard and expect a lot of

253
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:09.430
themselves is when you have achievements,
you don't take time to smell the roses.

254
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:13.090
You don't take time to pat yourself on the back,
you feet,
you think that,
okay,

255
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:16.300
well if I,
if I,
if I stop and I said,
you know what,
I am good.
Oh my gosh,

256
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:18.460
I did do a great job.
Holy cow,
I was dominant.

257
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.310
You're not supposed to do that because that's prideful.
And that's,
that's,

258
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:23.710
that's conceited and that's narcicisstic.
But really,

259
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.320
if you're not your biggest fan,
who's going to be,
you know,

260
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.810
and I think that's what I always did.
I would accomplish something.
I'd say,
okay,

261
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:30.100
well I'm supposed to accomplish that.

262
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.880
I won this tournament while I was supposed to you.
Or there's a balance,
right?

263
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.750
There's a balance between patting yourself on the back too much and kissing your

264
00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:41.890
own ass,
believe in your own bullshit.
And we see what happens with those guys.

265
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:44.380
That's almost worse.
Exactly.
One.
And I think,

266
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.500
and I think we've all seen those cases too,
you know,

267
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.990
we've all seen those cases where you see,
you see one guy,

268
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:52.360
pride comes before the fall and then all of a sudden the fall happens.
You say,

269
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:53.440
okay,
well I don't want to do that.

270
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.860
But there is that fine line that that middle ground where it's like I,

271
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.950
I it's okay to love yourself.

272
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:02.830
It's a don't look at yourself in the mirror and say that man right there

273
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:05.440
standing in front of me in the mirror is a bad ass and you are,

274
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:07.840
you deserve to be extremely successful.

275
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.920
But then when you go out in the world that you don't walk around like you're

276
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:14.560
better than people.
You don't walk around like you know,
so I mean there's,

277
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.990
there is no,
you know,
finite a plus B equals c type of way to live.

278
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.130
But there is that middle ground between being your biggest fan,

279
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.120
taking time to stop,

280
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.970
stop and Pat yourself on the back and re realize your accomplishments,
which,

281
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.370
which the mental highlight reel thing is something great.

282
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:34.090
Cause you can go through 10 things in your past and just continuing to remember

283
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:34.960
those times where you,

284
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.430
you were in your flow state where you absolutely performed at a ridiculous level

285
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.310
that you didn't,
that you kind of surprise yourself almost.

286
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:45.850
And I think that continues to happen step by step and brick by boring brick.

287
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.850
You make these little bitty accomplishments and as long as you continue to

288
00:14:48.851 --> 00:14:51.980
remember them,
you can continue to increase that

289
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.480
<v 2>confidence capacity that you had,</v>

290
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:56.840
that you should have in queue and start to go from,
man,

291
00:14:56.841 --> 00:15:00.830
I didn't know what was capable of this to now the confident expectancy of,

292
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.950
okay I said I deserve it,

293
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:06.320
but now I really am starting to believe that I deserve it.

294
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:07.970
And then once you actually believe,

295
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.570
then you get no scenarios where it's you versus him and someone's got to win.

296
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.410
So it's you more most of the time now.
So this flow state thing,

297
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:20.411
so like when you are in a state where you feel like everything is just clicking,

298
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.040
do you try to,

299
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.640
how do you try to recreate that in your mind to remember that state?

300
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.690
I think it's,
I think it,
it is writing things down after practice or,

301
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.060
or honestly sometimes what I like to do is you do that,

302
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.450
you're like come a journal,
a trading journal,
try to write things down.
I mean,

303
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:38.420
and,
and that's,
that's things too that can be added to a mental highlight reel,

304
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:38.631
you know,

305
00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:42.620
like go like having a really great sparring day and then remembering what you

306
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:44.860
had for breakfast,
remembering how your,
how your day started.

307
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.370
Remember whether you did or did not watch the TV before practice or you know,

308
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.140
those little things.
And then,

309
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.530
and then I always talk about working extremely hard and surround yourself with

310
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:56.810
the best people possible.
And that's why I've,
you know,

311
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.990
I moved out to Las Vegas right when I started fighting and then moved to San

312
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.170
Diego and then move and then move my training camp to Arizona.

313
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.090
And then now Florida and now,
you know,

314
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.180
so I've moved all over the country to find the best guys I possibly can.

315
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:11.090
So when you have a great day like that,
sit down with the coaches and say,

316
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:14.240
hey coach,
you know,
talking to Henry or Evan or call me or,

317
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.660
or one of these guys that has coached me right now and talk about it,

318
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:19.910
like almost overly talk about it,
which that,

319
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:23.090
those guys are always annoying to me.
Are,
they always used to be like,
Hey,

320
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:24.140
I did this right and I did this right,

321
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:27.500
and it did disrupt because I always thought,
well,
you should just work.

322
00:16:27.501 --> 00:16:30.150
You shouldn't talk,
just work.
But I,

323
00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:33.980
I've started to realize that those things need to be vocalized or they get swept

324
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:36.170
under the rug and you forget that you had a great day.

325
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.330
So now we sit down and we'd talk and we say,
hey man,

326
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.740
that that three to was really,

327
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.770
really working great off the faint and we work that we worked at yesterday as we

328
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:47.120
were hitting mitts and now you're continuing to show yourself that this thing

329
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:49.970
really actually does work.
You're not just working to work,
you're working smart,

330
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.751
and then you see,

331
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:55.280
you see that working smart actually turns into results and then you're,
you're,

332
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:59.810
you're,
you're like a lab rat in the gym working on these little experiments that

333
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:04.310
you're,
that you're making and you're actually collecting the data and seeing the

334
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.760
results.
No.
When you're talking about doing a mental highlight reel thing,

335
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:10.940
is this sort of a,
a rebuilding exercise,

336
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:15.941
a rebuilding confidence exercise or is this just a solidifying skillset and

337
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:20.030
understanding your potential?
Cause you've already done things before like,

338
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.290
cause you were in a bad spot when you started doing this and you,

339
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.340
is this when you started constructing this highlight reel thing?
That's what,

340
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.690
yeah,
that's when it,
that's when I really,

341
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:33.170
I actually read the book and in college and then found it on my shelf one day.

342
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.550
Do you know who wrote it?
Mind gym suit.
You find a Jimmy Gary Mack.
Mack.

343
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.550
Gary Mack.
Sorry man.
Yeah.
And then there was just a bunch of,

344
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.880
and there was another book,
um,
to remind or remind me.

345
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:47.600
It's called how champions think.
Um,
but,
and it was just a bunch of,

346
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:49.890
a bunch of instances where they were talking about tiger woods and they were

347
00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:50.130
talking

348
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 1>about this guy or that guy,
you know?</v>

349
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:54.640
And then one of the chapters was doing a mental highlight reel.

350
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.140
And I think it can be used for both.
I mean,
no,
I mean you should do one.
Today,

351
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.110
we should all do one today.
Whether you're in a great place,

352
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:04.110
whether you're just you just closed the biggest business deal you ever possibly

353
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:07.620
could or you just are down in the dumps because you feel like the biggest loser

354
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:10.470
on earth,
you do a mental highlight reel to just,
it's,

355
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:12.930
it's just like going to the gym and then it changes.
You know,

356
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:15.330
maybe maybe this month is different than next month.

357
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:18.900
Maybe you wipe off an old one and you put on a brand new one that you just

358
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:21.870
remembered it because sometimes we forget successes that we have.
It takes,

359
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.460
it takes me going to my Wikipedia page or me going on some old interviews or,

360
00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:28.320
or somebody telling me on Twitter,
hey,

361
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:31.980
remember that time he did this for me to actually remember the successes that

362
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:36.150
I've had because I've been conditioned to pull myself up by my bootstraps every

363
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:40.290
single day and forget about all my accomplishes in my past because those don't

364
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:40.500
matter.

365
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.860
Those are stumbling those what I used to look as stumbling blocks because what

366
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:46.320
got you here isn't going to get you where,
where you want to go.

367
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.480
And we have that some sort of that,
that mentality.

368
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:52.620
But you have to take the time to remember and almost look at yourself the way

369
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:56.490
other people see you.
Because we all are,
are,
are all our biggest critics.

370
00:18:56.491 --> 00:19:01.230
You know,
the way my fans see me,
the way you watch me fight is,
and,
and the,
the,

371
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.790
the way you see my abilities is probably even better than I have seen myself a

372
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:08.190
lot in my past.
From an outside perspective,

373
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:12.720
it's so much easier to look at someone outside perspective because our own inner

374
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:17.721
monologue or our own and our own self image dummies down who we are and,

375
00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:20.850
and how much we went to accomplish it.
Not all of us.
I mean,

376
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:23.570
there's a lot of people out there who are cocky,
narcissistic,

377
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.780
narcissistic people who think they are the,
you know,

378
00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.340
those people have the hardest time coming back from losses the big time because

379
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:32.580
when they get head kicked or something and then they realize they're human,

380
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.530
it's like whoa.
You see it with a lot of those guys where they don't,

381
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.490
instead of facing their demons,
what they've done is create this delusional,

382
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.380
delusional self image.

383
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.690
And when that delusional self image gets shattered and it's an undeniable

384
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.240
reality that there's people that are better than them,
it's very,

385
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:53.550
very difficult for them to bounce back.
Yeah.
Well,

386
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:57.680
and I mean I think I am by no means the poster child for for that.
I mean it,

387
00:19:57.681 --> 00:20:01.470
it took me a loss that carried me into another loss and another loss.
It was a,

388
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.220
I went 688 days without a win and I'll never,
but when I write a book,

389
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:09.750
some days it was Sunday is going to be called 688 days and that's how long it

390
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:14.140
took me to go from loss to win.
And that's a long,
that's a long fucking time,

391
00:20:14.141 --> 00:20:15.240
long time to be,

392
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:20.390
to question yourself every single day to wake up in the morning wondering if you

393
00:20:20.571 --> 00:20:21.510
were going to have a paycheck,

394
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.850
wondering if you were going to get a phone call from her manager,

395
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:28.851
wondering if you really wanted to open up your phone and see all the negative

396
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:30.240
comments that I told you.

397
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.490
Michael Chandler wasn't as good as we all thought he was.
[inaudible] you know,

398
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.430
that,
you know,
but I mean,
not even,
you know,
not even just the fans.
It was,

399
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:41.980
you know,
the media wrote me off [inaudible] everybody you and you know,
the,

400
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.810
you're,
you're just,
you get written off and,
and it's,
it,

401
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.730
it shapes the reality when really the reality was,
man,

402
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:53.140
I was put on this earth to do some great things,
but it just took me,
I look,

403
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.200
I look at it now and I think,
you know,
if bad things happen to you,

404
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:59.230
but a good things come,
a good thing comes from,
it wasn't really a bad thing.

405
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.290
And I look at it and I say,
everybody's got losses.
It's not a big deal.
You know,

406
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:06.250
I remember the sting,
I remember the pain.
I remember the embarrassment.
I mean,

407
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.640
what we also got to remember too is this is embarrassing.
You lose a fight.

408
00:21:09.641 --> 00:21:14.500
That's embarrassing you hard pill to swallow.
Yeah.
You know,
so it's,
it's tough,

409
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.310
especially when you were a former champion and then you're going these 600 plus

410
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.170
days without a win and that's,

411
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:24.760
it really highlights the difficult nature of fighting as opposed to any other

412
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.710
sport where,
you know,
there's,

413
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.950
there's times where it's entirely likely that you're going to go a long time

414
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:37.840
without competing again.
Yeah.
You could go six months without competing again.

415
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:40.630
You can go eight months,
guys go a year.
If you get injured,

416
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.820
that's a long fucking time.
Any other sport,
if you lose a baseball game,

417
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.270
you know,
you drop a ball,
like you're back at it next day,
the next day.

418
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.010
Same thing with wrestling.
You know,
wrestling,

419
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:53.720
wrestling was great because you know,
you,
you lost it.

420
00:21:53.721 --> 00:21:56.260
You lost a match on Saturday.
You were able to,

421
00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.380
to come back and the dual on Wednesday or even the next Saturday,

422
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:02.260
seven days you had to go.
You know what I mean?
A lot of times,
yeah,
I mean,

423
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.850
barring injuries or whatnot,
I mean,

424
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:07.810
it could be a year before you get to get to step back in the cage again and then

425
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:11.800
every single day you spend questioning and every single day you also just end up

426
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:13.870
putting so much pressure on yourself.
I mean,
my,

427
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.940
the biggest thing that I did wrong was I came into this sport.
I wasn't,

428
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.910
and literally the 18 months after starting the sport,

429
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.660
I was in a cage with Eddie Alvarez,
top five guy in the world,
beat Eddie Alvarez.

430
00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:29.260
Then it was like,
okay,
now you have to perform.
That was that.

431
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:31.120
Soon after starting the sport,
uh,

432
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:36.121
August of 2009 I had my first fight and then I fought him in 2011.

433
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.900
That's crazy.
Yeah.
And he finished him and finished him,
but,
but then,

434
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:44.680
but then now the,
now the real game starts.
Now it's like,
okay,
hey,
you're there.

435
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.630
You're ranked in the top three,
top five,
you know,

436
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:49.300
your whole future depends on every single fight.

437
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.550
And then instead of thinking about every single fight,

438
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.710
you think about every single practice.

439
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:55.120
And instead of thinking about every single practice,

440
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:57.850
you think about every single round in practice and that not just every round,

441
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.080
but every minute in practice.
So you hit me,
you hit me with a one to immediately,

442
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:05.800
that's a loss in my mind.
So now I have to come back and get it,
you know?

443
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:10.240
So instead of just focusing on success,
I was focusing on perfection.

444
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.150
So every single day I was trying to be perfect.
You can't be perfect.

445
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.110
The greatest athletes in the world will tell you they are not perfect.
You know,

446
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.210
they fail time and time and time again.

447
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.280
But I'd put all this pressure on myself to where I put myself in this prison of

448
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:24.881
Michael,

449
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:28.720
you suck because you just lost to this guy who's not even signed to at any

450
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:32.050
organization at all.
And you just lost to him in,
in this,
in the sparring round.

451
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:33.700
In My,
my view of,

452
00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:36.670
of what the loss was was different than my coach who watched it.
He said,

453
00:23:36.671 --> 00:23:38.740
no you did all right and you didn't lose horribly.

454
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:41.190
But in my mind I lost horribly.
I would've got finished bubble ball.

455
00:23:41.191 --> 00:23:43.390
That kind of like crazy stuff,
you know.
Um,

456
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.120
so that's the thing too is I started focusing on success and our perfection,

457
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.090
you know,
stop putting so much pressure on yourself to be perfect.

458
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.770
Just focus on being successful.

459
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.430
Now I'm focusing on the big picture of being successful instead of these little

460
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:57.710
bitty instances where I'm trying to be perfect.

461
00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:02.590
<v 0>Now when you look at yourself and you look you overall MMA skillset,
do you uh,</v>

462
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.770
do try to look at it almost like as if you're managing yourself,

463
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.380
not managing yourself like a fight manager,
but like,

464
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.400
like a project like looking at it like,
okay,
this is what we need to work on.

465
00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:14.700
This is how I need to tighten this up and tight.
Do you,

466
00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:19.030
do you look at it as like an overall long term project?
Like how do you,

467
00:24:19.031 --> 00:24:20.410
how do you visualize it?

468
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.740
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean in,
and I get that question a lot too,
is like,
well hey,
how much,</v>

469
00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:25.420
how much,
how do you prepare for an opponent?

470
00:24:25.421 --> 00:24:30.421
And honestly I'd say almost 90% of my training is focusing on myself.

471
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.390
I mean,
cause if I,
if I put the right systems in place,

472
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.770
if I get the right sales skill sets is sharp as they can be for fight night.

473
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.590
There's not a guy in the lightweight division in the entire world that I think

474
00:24:41.591 --> 00:24:45.010
can beat me that last 10% 90% focused on myself.

475
00:24:45.011 --> 00:24:48.670
The last 10% focused on the little intricacies,
the little habits,
the little,

476
00:24:48.671 --> 00:24:51.220
the little tendencies that my opponents might have.
I mean,

477
00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:53.290
Eddie did a great job with it in the second round.

478
00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.500
They knew if they ran from me in the second fight.
Yeah,

479
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.320
they ran from me and they circled and circled and circled crazy maniac robot

480
00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.670
come forward like a reckless abandoned Michael Chandler is going to come and

481
00:25:02.671 --> 00:25:04.090
he's gonna eat a thousand you know,

482
00:25:04.091 --> 00:25:08.860
eat a thousand jabs and you can keep them off you long enough to hopefully maybe

483
00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:11.440
when decision,
they did a good job at that.
I wasn't cutting off the,

484
00:25:11.441 --> 00:25:13.480
I wasn't cutting off the case.
I wasn't using my faints.

485
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.470
I was starting to trying to throw big shots because why we had that epic battle

486
00:25:17.471 --> 00:25:20.650
in 2011 I wasn't a hundred percent confident in my training.

487
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.870
So that led me to just fight like a barbarian rather than a skillful veteran

488
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.010
that has the skills and the abilities to be able to go out there and beat any

489
00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:32.770
lightweight in the world.
And you know,
so I think that's a relatively new,

490
00:25:32.771 --> 00:25:36.070
with your finding experience too,
right?
Well that time,
your second fight,

491
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.530
but I was still very young and I had changed.

492
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.000
I had moved to a training camp where I wasn't getting,
we all,

493
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.710
we all need to look at ourselves to or not.

494
00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:46.360
I'm not telling people how to live their lives are trained,

495
00:25:46.361 --> 00:25:50.590
but I needed to focus on a certain path to victory.

496
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.550
Find the easiest path to victory.
Bruce Lee,
you know,
water,
be like water,

497
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:59.050
you know,
I mean adapt,
but also just say,
okay,
I'm a not a long,

498
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.240
not a long guy,
not a tall guy.
I'm a shorter,

499
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.660
powerful wrestler who can take anybody down who's not going to get taken down,

500
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.160
who has an overhand right that can knock,

501
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.390
knock anybody out in the entire world and a gas tank that can,
that can come,

502
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.870
that will surpass any 25 minutes that I need to fight.

503
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.390
So I needed to focus on these certain five elements to be successful and not a

504
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:19.961
thousand stuff.
I mean,

505
00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:23.920
training with Dominick Cruz and working on footwork and doing this and doing

506
00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:27.100
that rollouts and all that kind of stuff,
it just,

507
00:26:27.101 --> 00:26:30.460
it wasn't the right path to victory for me.
Therefore,

508
00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:33.880
I found myself almost out training myself.

509
00:26:33.881 --> 00:26:37.540
I was training so much when if I were to really just want to trained basics and

510
00:26:37.541 --> 00:26:40.810
good cardio or strength and conditioning,
good boxing,
good wrestling,

511
00:26:40.811 --> 00:26:43.980
good grappling.
That's easy to say now it

512
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.200
<v 2>is a fact.
Right and duck in that.
Yeah.</v>

513
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.920
Where were you training at the time were you're training on alliance?
Yeah.
Yeah.

514
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.910
And do you,

515
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:55.020
so you felt like you were trying to mimic like Dominic's crazy movement and I

516
00:26:55.021 --> 00:26:58.740
think it's just,
I mean the good thing about that training camp is they have,

517
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.970
they have opened themselves up to a lot of different techniques.
You know,

518
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:06.150
I mean I,
I,
I feel like I'm pretty athletic.

519
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:09.510
I feel like I catch on pretty quickly.
But really to be successful,

520
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:11.940
like if I was going to step into the cage with Khabib tomorrow,

521
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.660
I'm going to focus on the basics that win.
I mean,

522
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:19.830
you can win a whole fight with a one,
two and good takedown defense,

523
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.950
some takedown offense and some good grappling,
you know?
And that's it.

524
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:24.900
That's all you need.
And in my mind,

525
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.370
the more I try to make this an intricate sport and a complicated sport,

526
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.530
the more you're going to find yourself having incremental defeats.
You know?

527
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.800
Like when I'm,
when I'm sparring outside of my element,
all of a sudden I find,

528
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.980
okay,
I tried this this round and I got beat up,
you know,
and got beat up.

529
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.550
Which messes up your confidence and all that stuff.
Do you feel like,

530
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.210
and this is something that I struggle with too,
when trying to analyze fighters,

531
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.870
performances and their future and what you can and can't do,
do,

532
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.660
do you feel like you go into MMA with a certain skill set you,

533
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.720
you started out as a wrestler and you know you're not going to be like a karate

534
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:06.390
expert.
Yeah.
Right.
You're not going to be a wonder boy.

535
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.900
You're not going to be a Jujitsu expert,

536
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.770
which you are as powerful wrestler with great striking.
That's your,

537
00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:16.170
that's your skill set.
You're strong and you got great cardio.

538
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.150
If you tried to add a bunch of stuff to that and expand your skill level,

539
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:26.160
do you feel like there's enough time in a career to really achieve that type of

540
00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:31.140
proficiency with say like kickboxing or something like that,

541
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:36.141
that a real worldclass kickboxer has the almost we're are better off not doing

542
00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:40.500
that.
Yeah,
I mean that,
I mean I think I am the how to manual for that,
you know,

543
00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:45.510
and,
but,
but I also do try to do different,
I mean just to too many,

544
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:49.080
too many angles to many different combinations.
Too many,
too many calls.

545
00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:52.090
I mean you can also a coach can out coach to,
you know,

546
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:53.730
I mean a coach can out coach and say,

547
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.870
tell you seven different combinations in one minute when really it should just

548
00:28:57.871 --> 00:29:01.470
been focused on cutting him off,
focus on focus on faints,

549
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:04.110
focus on touching the leg,
which is going to set up the set up,
the uh,

550
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.230
the punches and focus on the punches are going to set up the take down.
You know?

551
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:07.651
I mean,

552
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:12.651
I also would say now say like my coach Henri Hooft awesome kickboxing,

553
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.210
awesome kickboxing coach has amazing techniques,
but it's very,
very,
very basic.

554
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.890
We,
we focus on being very,
very proficient and very violent with the basics.

555
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:23.640
You know what I mean?

556
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.960
You're not going to see us throwing a bunch of crazy combinations or a budget,

557
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.750
a bunch of crazy stuff.
Um,
so that works very well for me.

558
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:35.310
I started out with Gil Martinez in Vegas,
just wrestling,
just boxing,
you know.

559
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.690
Um,
and then I went to alliance and the now down in Florida with,
with Henry.

560
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.860
And you live in Florida?
No,
no.
I live in Nashville,

561
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.000
<v 1>but my last three camps I've done down in Florida,
um,</v>

562
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.680
I'm opening up my own gym in Nashville.

563
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:50.620
So I will be doing training at both places.
But I mean,
the,

564
00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.590
the killers that I get to spar with and train with don in Florida can't be

565
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.930
matched in,
in those coaches are amazing down there.
So yeah,

566
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:57.850
I'm a big fan of Henri Hooft.
Yeah,
it's good.

567
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.960
I like him as a person and I really liked his coaching style.
He's an animal.

568
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.351
He is.

569
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:05.740
And the funny thing is he coached against me in that second Eddie Alvarez fight.

570
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.980
You know,
so like we talk about that and that's why I will always,

571
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.050
I want to fight 80 against so bad.

572
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.120
I want to have that one I had that was waiting for,
that felt modified.

573
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.420
Eddie so bad.
But I have so much respect for him because not only did I spend,

574
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.920
I spent 50 minutes inside the cage with the guy.

575
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.390
We both have our face bloodied and battered and stitches.

576
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:26.590
I mean I got stitches in my lip.

577
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.210
We both have stitches in our lip and our eyes and eyebrows from each other.
Um,

578
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.220
but it's funny because when I sit there and I talked to people that I trained

579
00:30:35.221 --> 00:30:37.840
and I basically trained in his training camp that he used to train in and

580
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:40.360
everybody always said,
there's only one guy compare your work at.

581
00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:45.040
I can compare your work ethic to your dedication,
to your love for your family,

582
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.190
your love for the sport,
this,
that,
and the other thing.
And that's Eddie.
So,

583
00:30:48.191 --> 00:30:50.650
I mean me and Eddie have have spoken a couple times.

584
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:54.100
I went up and trained with Frankie Edgar for two weeks,
um,

585
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:56.680
a couple of years ago and he was out there training.
So we like,

586
00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.640
it's always just funny between me and him because we have fought and you know,

587
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.370
but it's funny but it's not like we have so much respect.

588
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:06.120
We don't hate each other.
You guys hang out and go to dinner or anything.

589
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.151
We never done that.

590
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:10.240
But I mean we saw each other at practice and I asked him to spar and he's like,

591
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:13.790
Nah man,
I don't want to get knocked out.
And I made that up.
But,

592
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.470
but we were the same.
We we're at the same thing and uh,

593
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:19.240
saint practices and stuff and it's kind of,
but you also get,

594
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.350
it's cool to get com compared to a guy that you have fog because that

595
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:26.110
immediately gives you that a much more respect for somebody.

596
00:31:26.111 --> 00:31:27.610
Cause cause I know how hard I train.

597
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:30.850
I know I show up early and I'm always doing the little bit of extra and

598
00:31:30.851 --> 00:31:32.440
everybody knows what I'm fighting for.

599
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.830
And I think him and I are very similar in that kind of,
in that respect.

600
00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:37.840
So it's Kinda cool.
Yeah.

601
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.670
I would imagine no one knows each other better than you guys do after something

602
00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:45.970
like that.
It's pretty nuts.
Yeah.
I mean,
and,
and man,
yeah,

603
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.670
they were both knocked down,
drag out wars.
They were crazy.

604
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.130
I would still say I won the second second fight,

605
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.420
but a very close fight I will say.
But,
but like I said,

606
00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:59.620
I mean I ran into too many punches.
Um,
you know,
it was,

607
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:03.010
it was kind of crazy too.
I think I actually spoke to one of the refs,

608
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:03.621
one of the reps who,

609
00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:06.280
who called the fight for Eddie or not one of the restaurant of the judges,

610
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.910
like a couple months after I was at some event and he's like,
oh yeah,

611
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:11.470
well he rocked you in the second round.
And I was like,

612
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:13.360
he didn't rock me in the second round.
I tripped,

613
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.060
I basically like tripped and it looked like I got rocked.
Right.

614
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.870
So it's just funny that kind of stuff to this,

615
00:32:17.871 --> 00:32:22.630
this sport is left up to the necessarily know what they're doing.

616
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:25.870
That too.
Yeah.
That's a real problem with me.
I go crazy.

617
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.110
Like I remember you talking about a couple fights ago,

618
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.540
he kept saying the one navy.
Yeah.
You're like,

619
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:36.370
we're not going to say that lady alone.
She's a nice lady.
But look,

620
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:40.190
man,
it's,
it's just a disgrace that you have people that really don't

621
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.190
<v 0>know anything about martial arts and they're judging martial arts competitions.</v>

622
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:49.770
I mean,
could you imagine if you had like an ultimate fighting championship,
uh,

623
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.900
eight man tournament with all the judges and have them fight each other.
Right.

624
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.010
He'd be like,
why in the fuck is going on here?
Yeah.
You guys don't even train.

625
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.410
You don't know anything about fighting at all.
They take,

626
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:03.170
what do they take a test,
one test,
you know,
I mean,

627
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.870
a lot of them in certain commissions come from boxing.
So they're,

628
00:33:06.871 --> 00:33:09.040
they're boxing judges would even then,

629
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.280
where are they boxers or did they test a good question.
A lot of them.
No,
no,

630
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.220
I'm beat.
But I think like,
I don't know if Harold Letterman can box.

631
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.750
It does a great job of judging though.

632
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.690
I mean I agree with a lot of his assessments,

633
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:26.090
but I think boxing is more straightforward.
It's two hands.
Yeah.
You know,

634
00:33:26.091 --> 00:33:29.460
there's no elbows,
knees take downs.
You don't have to understand Jujitsu.

635
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.940
You don't have to understand wrestling.
You don't,

636
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.690
you don't have to understand when a guy's in trouble versus the guy's not in

637
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:39.380
trouble in a certain position.
Like how close was that submission?
You know,
what,

638
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.430
how many leg kicks is that guy eaten?
Why did he switch his stance?

639
00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:45.920
These switches dance cause he does it all the time.
Or as his left leg chewed up,

640
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.930
you know,
they don't know.
They really don't know stuff that you're saying that,

641
00:33:49.931 --> 00:33:54.170
that people who have seen this border our thinking,
but the judges or have,

642
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.620
you know,
may,
may or may not have any idea of what's going on with them.

643
00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.890
A lot of them don't.
You have an idea.
It's a disgrace.
It really is a disgrace.

644
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:05.030
It's crazy to think that we have sports been around for 20 years now,

645
00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:08.900
25 years now,
and we're still having this conversation.
Yeah.

646
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:12.860
Boxing has questionable judgments.
Like there's,

647
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:16.840
there's some questionable calls,
but nothing like MMA.

648
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.950
I think MMA is,
it's disgraceful.
The worst,
you know,

649
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.720
the worst one in your opinion.
Why wouldn't want an,
I wouldn't want to say oh,

650
00:34:25.721 --> 00:34:29.360
worst one because there's been so many fucking terrible ones.

651
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.990
Sometimes it's like a split decision.
Well you'll,
you'll hear one,

652
00:34:32.991 --> 00:34:37.330
you agree with one,
you agree with and one you're like,
what the fuck?
Yeah.

653
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:38.750
And we'll like look at each other.

654
00:34:38.751 --> 00:34:42.660
Like I'll look at Amac and I'll look at DC and we were like,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

655
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.520
How the fuck did someone think that person won that fight?
Yeah.

656
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.920
It's just bad man.
It's just really,
really,
really bad.

657
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:51.710
And for a God like you who,
you know,

658
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:55.940
you have a win bonus and a show bonus in the UFC.

659
00:34:55.941 --> 00:35:00.110
So if you're in there and you do everything right and you get robbed,

660
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.250
you didn't just get robbed of a decision.
And on your record it goes to the lock.

661
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.780
And you could,
you know,
you could protest it til the cows come home.

662
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:10.220
Nobody ever gets anything reversed.

663
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.020
When's the last time anybody got a decision reversed?
Yeah.

664
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.740
I can't even remember now.
I mean,
I don't,
I don't really think it happens.

665
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:17.450
Did they rob you of your wind bonus?
I mean,

666
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:20.930
it could cost you tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.

667
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.130
It's a fucking terrible,
terrible disgrace.
Yeah,
I mean,
and,
and also too,

668
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.430
I've never really even thought about the financials of it.

669
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:30.680
I never really thought it was always,
to me it was like a wrestling match.

670
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:34.580
It was a loss.
It was a loss of my record.
And then now I look back and I think,

671
00:35:34.581 --> 00:35:36.870
Dang man,
if I would've fought just a little bit different here or that,

672
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.070
or that judge would have saw

673
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.890
<v 2>this with a little bit different and we're talking a lot of money that I could</v>

674
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:43.200
have in my pocket or would have won,
you know?
So it's,

675
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.080
we've discussed this many times and I think first of all,

676
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:50.250
the idea of three judges is ridiculous.
Why?
Why only three?
Are they expensive?

677
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.740
Like how fucking you,

678
00:35:51.741 --> 00:35:56.460
you could get some of the best martial arts practitioners in the world to judge

679
00:35:56.461 --> 00:35:58.020
fights and have 10 of them.

680
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.460
And I bet you would have a correct outcome way more often than you would with

681
00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:03.720
three.
Yeah.
You know,

682
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:07.920
and I just think we need to overhaul that and for whatever reason they're

683
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:11.910
reluctant to do so.
Um,
we talked about before this podcast started,

684
00:36:11.911 --> 00:36:14.770
we talked about weight classes.
I think that's another giant issue.
Yeah.

685
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.840
I think every 10 pounds is a legitimate compromise.
Yeah.

686
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.020
And I think what we have now,

687
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:22.560
like the one 85 to two oh five pound gap is just bananas,

688
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.250
20 pounds of between world championship weight classes.
Like,
yeah,

689
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.100
it was just nuts.
You're dealing with two different size humans.

690
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:31.950
It's just so different.
Completely.
Yeah.
I mean,
and yeah,

691
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:36.000
I mean obviously closer to home for me would be that one 65 ish,
you know,
I mean,

692
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:38.970
and there's so many competitors are so many,

693
00:36:38.971 --> 00:36:42.660
just the average human being has between one 50 and one night.
You know,

694
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.650
there's the big guys,
there's a small guys,
but we're kind of in that mid range,

695
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:51.300
you know,
and I think,
uh,
one 65 weight class for a lot of us at one 55,

696
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.360
um,
I mean I would always probably stay at one 55.
I would love some,

697
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.780
some cool matchups at one 65 and be able to try to go for different belts and

698
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:00.110
all that kind of stuff.
Obviously that would be great.
But,
um,

699
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.390
one 55 is great for me.
Um,
but there's definitely,

700
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:06.180
I know some guys who were missing waits Shell Kevin lead two weeks ago.

701
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.960
Miss Weight.
It could be because obviously missed weight numerous times,

702
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.150
but could be Biz.
You know,

703
00:37:12.151 --> 00:37:16.680
he's a big guy when he gets down to one 55 that is quite a cut.

704
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.820
And since he's been,
I believe he's with George Lockhart,
right?
Yeah,
I think so.

705
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.450
Um,
well it wasn't him and Tony Martin,
Him and Tony both with Lockhart,

706
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:28.740
and then they dropped the fight right before Tony got hurt.
I don't know.

707
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.630
I'm not sure.
I thought that was,
I think that's the case.
Um,

708
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.220
I mean there's a lot of great experts,
Mike Dolce of course,

709
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:38.610
there's a lot of great experts in getting you down to the the proper way.

710
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:42.930
But the bottom line is when you're coming down from 200 pounds and you're

711
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:46.750
getting down to one 55,
that's a fucking struggle.
It is lot.
Yeah.
I mean,
and,

712
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.830
and like we talked about too,
it depends on,
you know,
cause everybody,

713
00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:52.450
that's always the question I get from all kinds of equal,
hey,
what,

714
00:37:52.451 --> 00:37:55.560
what weight do you walk around at?
And it's not really the weight,

715
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.040
it's the body composition.
How much,
you know,
how much body fat are you holding?

716
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.660
You know,
I mean,
I get a Dexa scan,
um,

717
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.870
every couple months when I'm down in Florida or whatnot.

718
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:06.630
We always try to stress a Dexa scan.
How does that work?
So you basically,

719
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:09.530
it's the one where you lay down as the one they have with the dance institute in

720
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.850
UFC probably.
It's just the thing that goes awry for five seconds.

721
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:17.720
And it does everything from,
from water to bone density to muscles,

722
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.610
tendons,
ligaments to Oregon's like all of that kind of stuff.

723
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:25.170
And the cool thing is my bone density has continued to go up like over the last

724
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.610
couple of years.
You know,
how much,
I mean it's,

725
00:38:27.611 --> 00:38:30.720
it's point 0.01% or whatever.
But I mean that's,

726
00:38:30.721 --> 00:38:32.550
that's a lot when you're talking about bone density.

727
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:36.190
And is that from strength training?
I think so.
I mean,
I put it,
I put out a post

728
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.950
<v 1>a couple months ago where I really think,
you know,</v>

729
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.100
I've been extremely blessed to have a throughout college wrestling.

730
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.360
I mean I've seen so many talented guys,
careers ended because of injuries.

731
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.970
I had none.
You know,
I had a couple of sprains here and there.

732
00:38:48.971 --> 00:38:51.820
I had a meniscus tear,
whatnot.
There's are like six weekends here.

733
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:55.300
He's no big deal.
Same thing in,
in,
in mixed martial arts.

734
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:58.840
I haven't really had any really bad injuries and I really do think it's because

735
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:02.500
I keep my body in great shape and I do a lot of strength training.

736
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.430
Like my body is constantly overcompensating for the weights that I'm throwing

737
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:09.670
around the med balls and I'm throwing around the,
the comfort zone,

738
00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:13.210
getting my skin in my body outside of my comfort zone and day in and day out

739
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:17.020
that my body is just kind of bulletproof itself to,
you know,

740
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.570
a lot of serious injuries.
Obviously it's fights.

741
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.270
I mean it's a fighting and you know,
you're,

742
00:39:21.271 --> 00:39:24.460
you're jacking up little limbs in hands and feet and all that kind of stuff here

743
00:39:24.461 --> 00:39:27.620
and there all the time.
But nothing serious.
Cam Haynes went,

744
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:31.430
worked out with you and one of your strength conditioning workouts.
Who was your,

745
00:39:31.431 --> 00:39:32.470
your strength coach for that?

746
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.130
That was a Todd Durkin and San Diego fitness quest 10.
So that was,
uh,

747
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.810
that was something he had just Skype.

748
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:41.110
He was doing skydiving that morning yet with Andy Stone and he,
uh,

749
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.200
he wanted to come in for a workout and yeah,
we went through,
I mean,

750
00:39:44.201 --> 00:39:48.100
a lot of my stuff is not crazy heavy.
Um,
but it's just a lot of reps,

751
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:51.430
a lot of cardio,
a lot of,
a lot of moving stuff around,

752
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:54.220
a lot of functional movements.
And we have,
what kind of stuff are you doing now?

753
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.900
I Love Med ball stuff.
I Love Med ball slams,
med ball rotations.
I love anything.

754
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.610
What I always focus on his strength plus speed equals power.

755
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:07.180
So we'll do one strength movement,
whether it's a,
whether it's a dead lift,

756
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.740
whether it's a,
you know,
a trap bar,
dead lift,

757
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:11.830
or a squat straight into a speed movement,

758
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.430
which would be like just a plyometric squat jump.

759
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:18.580
So you've got the strength plus the speed and that's how you continue to gain

760
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:23.380
power in supersets,
you know,
so then,
so that maybe we're doing a bench press,

761
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.110
you know,
bench press isn't the greatest workout,

762
00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:29.560
but it's focusing on the punching power.
Just three reps of something,

763
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:33.250
a little bit heavy dumbbells or barbells,
barbells and dumbbells.
Right.

764
00:40:33.251 --> 00:40:34.790
To a plyometric pushup.

765
00:40:34.791 --> 00:40:37.930
So now you've got another strength plus a speed equals power.

766
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.930
So plyometric pushup,
meaning you explode up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

767
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.920
And do you clapping at the top like how you,
you could,
yeah,
you could.

768
00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:45.671
You don't have to.
I mean,

769
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:48.550
a lot of times it's just exploding as hard as you can and then catching yourself

770
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:51.400
exploding as hard as you can.
Um,
and we do a lot of that kind of stuff,

771
00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:56.130
whether it's,
you know,
squats to hurdle jumps or dead lifts to,
um,

772
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.290
Med ball slam to jump,
you know,
I mean,
we're always,

773
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.120
and that also gets your heart rate up.

774
00:41:01.121 --> 00:41:04.090
It's also just getting your body moving like crazy.
So I mean,

775
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:07.330
a lot of the stuff we're doing at my,
at my new gym,
a lot of that programming is,

776
00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.470
is very similar to that,

777
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:12.460
where we have like a ripped class where it's resistance interval power,

778
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:15.430
plyometric and is there an endurance and we're focusing on all those things.

779
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.290
Everybody likes to do that.
They'd like to make it an acronym.
Yeah,

780
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.620
beloved love doing that was my boy PJ.
That was my,
what?

781
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.440
My bug PJ at Jenny Kim and I loved it though.
Was like ripped.
What is that?

782
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:27.460
And then I was like,
wow.
All right.
P P e.
D.
I love it.
So yeah,
talk about that.

783
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.490
Yeah.
People like that because you can remember it,
right?
Yeah.
Um,

784
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:34.190
now when you are going into a camp,
who

785
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.860
<v 2>organizes your training?
Like how do you,</v>

786
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.250
how do you decide when you're doing strength and conditioning?

787
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:44.210
When you're doing skill work,
when you're sparring,
when you're recuperating?

788
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.540
It's a,
it's always a little bit different.
I mean,

789
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.430
and the last couple of camps out in Florida,

790
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:53.510
we've had pretty much the same kind of schedule.
You know,
we,
we're,

791
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.550
Monday morning is always a drill.
Tuesday is sparring,
Wednesday was wrestling,

792
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.810
Thursday was,
Thursday was grappling,
Friday was sparring.

793
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.950
And then at night we go more individual,
whether it's individual with,
uh,

794
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:09.310
one of the,
one of the kickboxing coaches,
one of the mid,

795
00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.950
one of the MIT coaches with the either Henry or Evan or maybe it's a one on one

796
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:16.070
with Kami Barzini or maybe it's a one on one with Greg Jones or it's a one on

797
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:19.340
one with,
um,
uh,
grappling coach or it's your strength and conditioning.

798
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.770
A lot of times I coupled them where I'll do an hour with,

799
00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:26.540
I'll do an hour of strength work with 30 or 45 minutes of,
of pads as well.

800
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.950
You know,
where it all depends on the recovery,
you know what I mean?
If I,

801
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.900
if I feel myself getting overworked,

802
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.140
I will cut one of those out and focus on which one's more important for that

803
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:38.140
particular fight.
You know?
I mean if I,
if I,

804
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:41.690
I was fighting Goatee Yamauchi who's a big time grappler,

805
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:47.080
big time submission artists.
So I focused a lot more on escapes,
um,

806
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.330
defense submission,
defense and all that kind of stuff.

807
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.730
I was still focusing on strength and conditioning and striking,

808
00:42:52.731 --> 00:42:56.600
but I really threw in an extra couple of grappling sessions there,
you know,

809
00:42:56.601 --> 00:42:59.370
so it's,
so who's managing all of this though?
Do you have a,

810
00:42:59.371 --> 00:43:02.150
a head coach that decides what you're going to do?
What?

811
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:03.740
And they'd look at you and say,
you know,

812
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:07.400
today we're going to take it easier today.
We're going to do this.
I think,
I mean,

813
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.250
it's,
it's that kind of loose schedule that we always have.

814
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:11.920
But Henry Henry said that Henry and,

815
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.230
and Kami Barzini has come in and really helped,
um,

816
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.640
helped manage some of that stuff.
We made a couple of different changes.
Um,

817
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.310
but I mean,
yeah,
they come in and they say,
here's,
here's what we're going to do.

818
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:25.610
But then every now and then it's like,
hey,
tonight instead of,
you know,

819
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:26.990
instead of an hour long,

820
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:30.350
we're going to do 30 with 30 with me and then 30 with Kami or Henry him would do

821
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:33.650
30 but 30 minutes of pads,
30 minutes with comedy.
So it's,
it ebbs and flows.

822
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:38.210
And I think one of the biggest things about mixed martial arts is it's an

823
00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:40.190
individual sport,
right?
We're all grown men.

824
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:43.610
We all have our coaches that were supposed to listen to,
but I don't have to,

825
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.550
I don't have to do it.
They don't have to do it.
Any of these guys telling me too.

826
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.600
But I think that's why wrestlers are so successful because they show up,

827
00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:53.630
they shut up and you tell me what to do.
And you asked me how,
how high to jump,

828
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:56.090
and I just jump,
you know?
Yeah.
I've always said that.

829
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:59.330
I think there's two aspects of wrestling that make it the most important

830
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.650
skillset to have an MMA.

831
00:44:01.651 --> 00:44:05.870
And one of them is the ability to take a fight to the ground or stand back up.

832
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.520
Like just to have that,

833
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.850
to have the ability to dictate where the fight takes places gigantic.

834
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:14.570
But to who's Mike maybe just as important is the mental strength.

835
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.410
Wrestlers are always dehydrated.
They're always exhausted,

836
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:22.280
they're always pushing and there they take pride in being the most miserable

837
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:24.620
person.
Yeah.
You know,
there's something about that,

838
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:29.621
like it be having the ability to push through discomfort,

839
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.130
which is just something that you cultivate

840
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.150
<v 1>in a,
in a amateur wrestling career.
Yeah.
I mean you just get,</v>

841
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.330
I think you just get so comfortable being uncomfortable.
Like your,

842
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.300
your life sucks for five years straight,
especially division one,

843
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:45.240
college wrestling.
I mean,
and it's,
it's an emotional rollercoaster.

844
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:47.580
I mean with that mental toughness that you're talking about,

845
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.700
you don't just get mentally tough from,
from working hard.

846
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.600
You get mentally tough from working hard and losing and then winning and then

847
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:58.860
losing and then having coach riding your but because of this and then you got to

848
00:44:58.861 --> 00:45:01.860
final and you've got to test and you got this and you've got all this hold this

849
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:05.430
whole life that you're trying to manage and figure out while you're still trying

850
00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:06.690
to become a national champion.

851
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:10.230
So you're getting thrown into the hardest sport in the entire world,
physically,

852
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:13.200
the hardest sport mentally plus trying to do,
you know,

853
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:14.760
have a college career actually get your degree,

854
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:16.840
the whole reason you went to college.
Um,

855
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:22.130
and then really just being coachable and understanding delayed gratification.

856
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.370
I think so many people can come into an MMA gym and they have a great boxing

857
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:29.130
coach and it's like they expect after the first mid session that they're going

858
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:33.390
to look like Roy Jones Jr.
Whereas when I showed up to MMA,
I realized,
okay,

859
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:35.280
I went to Vegas and I was training with Gray Maynard,

860
00:45:35.281 --> 00:45:39.360
didn't Mike Pyle and Jay here on and Tyson Griffin and Evan Dunham and all
these,

861
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.230
all these great guys.
I knew I was going to take my licks for a long time.

862
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.870
It might've been a year before I went around.
I was okay with that.

863
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.380
You have to be okay with the delayed gratification of life and that's,

864
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:52.200
and now even at a 32 year old,
as a 32 year old,

865
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.010
I understand that any aspect of life that I'm going into that's new.

866
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:59.460
It's okay if I'm the guppy.
It's okay if I'm the lowest guy on the Totem Pole,

867
00:45:59.461 --> 00:46:02.430
even though I've accomplished so many great things and um,
you know,
and I,

868
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:06.240
and I've done some great things in life.
I still,
I'm still a guppy in a lot of,

869
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.060
a lot of aspects of life.
You know,
it's,

870
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.080
that's a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow.

871
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.690
It is kick boxers never learned Jujitsu.

872
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:16.830
They hate getting tapped and hello getting tapped.
It's never happened actually,

873
00:46:16.831 --> 00:46:20.580
but now,
you know what I mean?
I mean,
you've seen it.
I mean,

874
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.780
we've all seen it got us a fantastic kickboxers that for whatever reason they

875
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:28.710
just try to concentrate only on defense.
It's all they want to do.
Yeah.
I mean,

876
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:31.860
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not one of those guys that I get tapped and I'm like,
Oh man,

877
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:35.100
good job man.
I'm ripping tick.best.
But,

878
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.140
but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna show up the next day.

879
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.480
That doesn't mean I'm going to,
I mean,

880
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.880
the funniest thing is you go to any gym or around the country if they have,

881
00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:46.020
I bet you asked DC this at,
at Aka,
he's running the wrestling practice.

882
00:46:46.021 --> 00:46:48.660
I bet the amount of guys that show up for sparring day and grappling day is

883
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:51.570
different than the guys who show up on wrestling day.
Same thing at our gym.

884
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:55.380
We'll have 28 guys,
30 guys sparring on,
on Tuesday,

885
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:58.200
all sudden Wednesday rolls around and we're doing a group,
a wrestling practice,

886
00:46:58.201 --> 00:47:01.740
and there's like seven guys that show up.
You know,
it's a fucking,
and it's hard,

887
00:47:01.741 --> 00:47:03.780
you know,
buck and hard,
but you have to embrace the suck.

888
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:07.890
You have to understand that you don't get anything in life without getting

889
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.590
yourself outside of your comfort zone,
right?

890
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.170
Every single thing that you want to accomplish is waiting for you right outside

891
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:15.960
of your comfort zone.
And that's what I've really started to realize.

892
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.160
And you just take ownership,
extreme ownership of of it and say,
stop being,

893
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.820
stop being a sissy and just go push yourself to your puke.
Have you ever puked?

894
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:26.610
Have you ever passed out?
No.
You haven't.
You know,
or you haven't passed out.

895
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.220
You know,
I rarely Puke,
so I want to just continue,

896
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.040
try to get myself there and if I can,
I'm doing something right now.

897
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:36.580
When you say visualization and you say you visualize,

898
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.120
how do you do it and what do you do?

899
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:43.180
You schedule a time like,
hey,
you know,

900
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.490
8:00 PM tonight after training,

901
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.360
I'm going to sit down and I'm going to visualize for an hour.
Yeah,

902
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.250
there needs to be a time.
I mean first of all,
you all,

903
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.930
you always want to try to set a time you,

904
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:56.350
you can never say I'll definitely do it tomorrow.
You need to say,

905
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:59.380
okay well have I have practice here,
I have practice here,
I need to eat here.

906
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:02.550
I have an interview here,
I have this year that their car out.

907
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.400
It doesn't need to be a crazy amount of time.
I mean you know,
five,

908
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:10.250
five minutes is long enough.
That's a long time to be,
I mean that's all round.

909
00:48:10.251 --> 00:48:12.850
Do you ever give a grapple around in two minutes goes by,

910
00:48:12.851 --> 00:48:15.460
you look at the clock and there's three minutes left.
Temple is holy cow.

911
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:19.030
Like you know a five minutes is a long time cause you can get a lot done

912
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:23.680
mentally cause cause visualization knows no time.
There's not a clock ticking.

913
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.660
You know there's things happening.

914
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:27.760
There's so you close your eyes when you do this.

915
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.160
Where are you sitting in you sitting in a dark room?
Like how do you do those?

916
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.810
Sometimes it's,
I mean the hard part with me is I'm a very good sleeper.
Like,

917
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.920
I've,
I've tried to be like,

918
00:48:35.921 --> 00:48:38.470
I'm going to wake up in the morning and I'm going to keep laying in bed and

919
00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:42.280
visualize it and fall asleep,
you know,
like,
so you got to know yourself,

920
00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:45.280
you know that he's good though.
At least at least you're getting sleep for sure.

921
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:48.730
Yeah.
You gotta I mean,
you've got to have the self awareness to know where,

922
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:51.220
where you're on,
where you're off,
you know?
So for me,

923
00:48:51.221 --> 00:48:54.820
I mean a lot of times it's sitting up,
sitting on,
sitting on the couch,

924
00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:59.530
sitting on a chair.
Um,
but I think the biggest thing is,
is,
is seeing,

925
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.350
seeing the lights.
I mean the other day for instance,
like I was just,

926
00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.020
we were just talking about Fuji and putting in the maths and so we just,

927
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:08.710
we just installed a,
a bag rack system in my gym and something there.

928
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:09.850
I don't know if it was the rubber,

929
00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.390
the cage panels or what it was and it smelled exactly like the bell tore cage.

930
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.490
And I started to get,
I got like,

931
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.720
I literally my hearts heart rate started going up and I got goosebumps because

932
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:22.900
of a smell.
You get triggered.
Yes.
That's what it is.
Yeah,
exactly.

933
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:27.250
And I know exactly what that smell is.
Um,
that's weird.
I'll smells do that.
Oh,

934
00:49:27.251 --> 00:49:31.180
100%.
I,
and I've,
I've almost,
I've actually asked Bella or,
Hey,

935
00:49:31.181 --> 00:49:34.690
can I have a piece of that cage I want to cut off to smell eight inch piece of

936
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:37.630
that cage,
the canvas or whatever it is to bring in.

937
00:49:37.631 --> 00:49:42.350
Just just suck it in a huff coach huff cage.
But you gotta get your,

938
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.230
you got to get yourself to their,
you know,
um,
and,
and be in the,

939
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:51.640
in the space,
in the arena.
I can see the cage.
And after I started doing it,

940
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.760
I mean,
it was the tricky pit bull fight,

941
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.840
the knockout where that was the first time that I had really,

942
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.040
really gotten,

943
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.400
I had really made the head hit that breakthrough where I walked into the cage

944
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:07.630
that me,
Joe,
I hated fighting.
I didn't really like it that much because I,

945
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.610
I wasn't myself.
I wasn't present.

946
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:12.490
I wasn't literally a caged animal and I hated the way I felt.

947
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.000
I was peeing blood after fights because I was just going so crazy and I was
just,

948
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.690
and obviously I gained a lot of fans because people loved the way I fight,

949
00:50:19.691 --> 00:50:22.520
but they didn't exactly care about my wellbeing that much but right.

950
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.900
But it wasn't until that fight where I got into the cage and I just started

951
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:29.150
smiling because I thought,
Michael,
this is your home.

952
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.070
Like this is your home.

953
00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:34.130
Because I had visualized it so much because the problem with we talked about

954
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:37.340
earlier is you only get to compete every six months,
every three months.

955
00:50:37.341 --> 00:50:39.320
You don't know what that actually feels like.
And you can,

956
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.780
you can show up to the venue early and you can walk around it.

957
00:50:41.781 --> 00:50:44.900
You can smell the smells,
but it's,
there's nothing like competing in the cage.

958
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:46.850
There's nothing.
You can't recreate it in sparring.

959
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:48.440
You can't recreate it in the gym.

960
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.170
The only really place you can recreate it is in your mind.
If you,

961
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:53.900
if you just continue to remember,

962
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:58.190
I can remember my last fight like it like it was yesterday cause I've actually

963
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.610
gotten better at the skill of visualization because I think that's one thing

964
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:05.090
that happens too is you sit down and maybe you're listening to this podcast and

965
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:06.650
like,
okay,
I'm going to smell the smells of this.

966
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:08.270
I don't to see the sights of this.

967
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.570
And then you have a really not great visualization session.
You're like,

968
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:14.780
man that was stupid.
That guy's an idiot,
you know?
But it really does take,

969
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:16.161
it really does.

970
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:21.161
Take a second and let us take actual practice too to see and smell and hear and

971
00:51:22.161 --> 00:51:23.330
feel like you need,

972
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.380
you need to see yourself getting put in compromising situations and,

973
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.380
and then see yourself getting out of it.
You know,
you need to see,

974
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.700
you need to see yourself,
um,

975
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:37.490
performing at a ridiculously high level and how that's going to feel and how and

976
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:41.120
how,
how your brain is a is a hundred percent bulletproof and how your,

977
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:45.410
how your heart rate is where it needs to be and how you are somehow confidently

978
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.150
composed during that.
During those fights,
you know,
because it used to be,
I would,

979
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.280
the bell would ring and I would go a thousand miles an hour.

980
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.210
And The Times that you've seen me exhausted and fights,
I mean I passed out,

981
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.020
literally passed out in a fight before,
right at the route,

982
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.490
right at the end of the round.
Thank God it was at the end of the round.

983
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:06.290
Henry who've came,
picked me up,
my feet were like a pigeon toed.
I couldn't,

984
00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.300
he was like dragging me back to my corner.

985
00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:12.170
I sat down in the cage because I watched the video and all of a sudden my coach

986
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:16.440
out here woke me up.
I heard his voice and I turned around and I literally,

987
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.280
it was a,
it was a,
the Benson Henderson fight.
Wow.

988
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.010
I literally thought the fight was over and I asked him,
I said,

989
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:25.280
did I just get finished as this fight over?
And he said,
no man,
you gotta go,
go,

990
00:52:25.281 --> 00:52:29.360
go,
go into the know what happened?
Did you get hit?
Um,
what,
what was it was,

991
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.500
it was in the Benson Henderson fight going into the fifth round.

992
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:38.240
We are in that weird,
I have this thing where I,
I actually like to get,
um,

993
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.840
you know that one,
that one move where you're,
you're basically like this and he,

994
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:45.620
and they catch your,
your arm with the leg and then Chris suffix.
Yes.

995
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.770
And mounted that one where I remember the old school where that guy's got elbow

996
00:52:48.771 --> 00:52:52.160
to know him,
but I do a backflip over top and,
and,

997
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.340
and I always land on top and it's something that I set up and I probably

998
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:57.800
shouldn't put myself in a bad situation,
but a lot of times I get it.

999
00:52:57.801 --> 00:53:01.400
So I like to go there.
So you mean like a crucifix where the guys behind you?

1000
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.710
Yeah.
Like he's,
and he's,
he's on here on top of him.
Yeah.

1001
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.060
He would know he's on his back like this.
Okay.
Right.
Um,

1002
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:10.460
and then I did a back flip and I crunched myself up.

1003
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:14.600
So I think I owe you punched myself.
Put yourself to sleep.
Yeah,
almost.

1004
00:53:14.601 --> 00:53:17.900
And he had kind of a halfway choke.
Um,
but it wasn't,

1005
00:53:17.901 --> 00:53:20.830
I wasn't really in a competence right here.
Oh my gosh.
Come on now.

1006
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.810
Often Young Jamie.
Yeah.
How do you do that?
He knows what he's doing.

1007
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:26.370
This was a Benson's

1008
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:30.630
<v 2>first fight in the UFC after Korskoff right?</v>

1009
00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:34.900
Or excuse me in the bell tour.
So he fought Korskoff at 70 we're,

1010
00:53:34.901 --> 00:53:38.190
which is crazy.
He did not belong in that weight class.

1011
00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:41.880
And then to this position,
and I do this backflip,
I always end up on top.

1012
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:46.170
So he's got kind of a joke and then I crunched myself.
Boom.

1013
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.020
And then hopefully,
hopefully they'll say you,

1014
00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:53.070
you gone on time here and hopefully that shows my dead eyes.
Oh Wow.

1015
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:57.110
That's so crazy.
Cause you look tired.
Like you were brawling.
There was,

1016
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.810
there's another one on that you can find on the Internet that you can just look

1017
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:04.710
into my eye.
The Look,
look,
look dead,

1018
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.510
glazed over eyes.
And I looked down at my feet,
I looked down at my feet,

1019
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:14.050
my feet aren't moving,
my feet were like dragging my feet.
Don't what?

1020
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:17.580
What happened in this?
The fight where you lost the title,

1021
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:21.930
where your leg gave out?
I stepped back,
rolled the ankle,

1022
00:54:21.931 --> 00:54:25.650
pinch that nerve,
and then my foot just went straight.
So from rolling the ankle,

1023
00:54:25.651 --> 00:54:27.600
that's what it,
that's what did it,
that's what pinch the nerve.

1024
00:54:27.601 --> 00:54:31.620
And you see where I stepped back and I thought like something had broken,

1025
00:54:31.621 --> 00:54:35.430
like a ligament had given out or something like that.
I had no idea.
I wish,

1026
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:38.820
I wish I would've had the hindsight to just not chase.

1027
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:41.870
I mean I have this thing where I love to hit people and run Adam and,

1028
00:54:41.871 --> 00:54:43.560
and like go in for the kill,
which is,

1029
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.160
which has worked very well for me in my career.
Um,
but in that instance,

1030
00:54:47.161 --> 00:54:47.994
if I would just,

1031
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.940
if I would have either number one switch to southpaw cause I could push off of

1032
00:54:50.941 --> 00:54:52.350
it,
I just couldn't lift it.

1033
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:56.520
So I wish I would have switched to south Paul or I would have just planted

1034
00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:59.550
myself in the middle of the cage and waited for him to keep throwing kicks and I

1035
00:54:59.551 --> 00:55:00.520
would've kept kept handling.

1036
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.480
I mean I only one punch really got landed in that entire fight and that was me

1037
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:06.600
dropping him.
Now when,
when that happened,

1038
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.660
how long did it take before your leg started working again?
Oh Man,
it was scary,

1039
00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:14.250
man.
I mean to two weeks later or seven days later,
I ran five miles,

1040
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.050
so seven days,
seven days at her.

1041
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:20.520
But for about three days I looked down at my foot and my brain was telling me to

1042
00:55:20.521 --> 00:55:23.580
lift my foot and nothing was happening at Man.
I thought it was,

1043
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.960
it was a scary time.
I mean,

1044
00:55:24.961 --> 00:55:28.530
I got like you were wondering whether or not you had permanent nerve damage in

1045
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:33.320
your foot.
Yeah,
and I got a great,
a great staff around me.
I mean we,
my,

1046
00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:37.860
my manager has hooked all of us up with Sanford medical up in Sioux Falls,

1047
00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:41.880
South Dakota.
I'm doctor [inaudible],
orthopedic Surgeon,
Dr Troy,
gusts,

1048
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.870
neurosurgeon.
And when he talks about,
when they looked at it,
he just said,

1049
00:55:45.871 --> 00:55:48.720
you just have,
you just have pinched nervously.
Yeah.

1050
00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.930
Basically a pinched nerve whenever you did that and it just,
it,
that is crazy.

1051
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:55.680
I've never seen that before.
Yeah,
it was,
it was unfortunate.
It was,

1052
00:55:55.681 --> 00:55:59.010
it was horrible,
you know,
but it was just one of those things.
And that was my,

1053
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:03.540
you know,
I want a six,
six out of seven and that was my one loss.
So yeah,

1054
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:07.020
that was our weird one too,
because it was a fight where,
you know,

1055
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:11.490
it was kind of just getting going and Oh yeah.
When your foot started doing that,

1056
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:14.640
I remember watching it going,
Whoa,
is his ankle broke?
Like what's going on here?

1057
00:56:14.641 --> 00:56:17.600
It was weird.
Yeah.
I mean in,
it's one of those things too where,
you know,

1058
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.980
I've talked to big John about it,
I've talked to herb dean about it.

1059
00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:22.140
I've talked to all these guys.
I'm like,
man,
would you have stopped that fight?

1060
00:56:22.141 --> 00:56:24.040
And then they're both like,
man,
it looked really

1061
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.870
<v 1>bad.
You know,
it looked bad,
but,</v>

1062
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:29.350
but you're still up in your conscious is still up and conscious and I wasn't

1063
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:34.300
taking damage.
I,
I could imagine like,
you know,
I mean,
um,

1064
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:37.210
what's his name?
O'Malley hurt his foot and he was like,

1065
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:40.540
he couldn't even walk and he was up falling down and he was about to start

1066
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:43.420
getting beat up.
Like I was still on my feet.
I was still fighting.

1067
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.770
Did it look really bad?

1068
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:46.750
They look like a wounded deer out in the middle of a field,
you know,

1069
00:56:46.751 --> 00:56:49.240
like of course.
But you know,

1070
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:53.060
I always say like if this was back in the the Viking days and you know,

1071
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.710
you chop one of my legs off and it's me versus him to the battle of the death,

1072
00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.690
I'm still one of that fight 10 times,
10 times out of 10.

1073
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:03.610
So you wish the fight kept going 100% yeah.
It's a weird way to stop a fight too.

1074
00:57:03.611 --> 00:57:05.170
When a guy's not taking damage,

1075
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.750
she's just got an a leg that's not working properly.
Well,

1076
00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:11.020
and the problem was too,
you know,
he almost,

1077
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:13.420
he basically called timeout and asked for the doctors to come in.

1078
00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:17.110
Once you've done that,
the fights over,
I think,
I think the ref literally thought,

1079
00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.630
you know,
he should have just called the fight,
right?
He shake,

1080
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:22.660
your leg was broken or something,
like what did it,
what was his thought process,

1081
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.590
I guess?
And then,

1082
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:26.220
and then the doctors came in and then they started feeling around and they're

1083
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.690
like,
you know,
they were like right here.
I think his Tibia is fractured.
It's,

1084
00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:32.170
I can feel the bone.
I'm like,
doc,
I promise you just get out of here.
Let me,

1085
00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:35.740
there's let me fight.
I got a crib,
I got an a calf cramp or something.
I was like,

1086
00:57:35.741 --> 00:57:38.860
you don't just lying to them.
I just get out of here.
Let me,
let me go.

1087
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:42.970
I promise it's fine.
I don't feel a thing.
It's not hurt.
I'm good.
Um,

1088
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.420
and then they stopped the fight and they pull the stool to pull the stool from

1089
00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:49.900
me too.
So remember that.
Oh yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.
What was that about?

1090
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.850
That was my commissioner that was,

1091
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:54.100
that was New York Athletic Commission at its best.

1092
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:58.240
Like pull the stool and I fell and I,
and then a bunch of people were like,

1093
00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.130
hey man,
did they call the fight?
Because they hit,

1094
00:58:00.131 --> 00:58:02.260
they thought you couldn't stand.
And I said no,
I,

1095
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.860
I hope not because that would have been very unfortunate cause I fell on

1096
00:58:05.861 --> 00:58:09.940
national TV.
Got Charlie Brown tie all three stooges.

1097
00:58:09.941 --> 00:58:13.690
Molarity currently thanks for nothing.
Dot.
Yeah.
Why did they pull a stool?
It was,

1098
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.840
I don't know.
I see some mistake.
I think I stood,
I think I stood up.
I was like,

1099
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:18.100
Hey,
maybe if I get the crowd into it,

1100
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:19.690
maybe these guys will get out of here and let the fight go.

1101
00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:22.390
So I like stood up and I was like,
let's go,
you know,

1102
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.850
and I was sitting on the stool and I fricking looked at him and I was like,

1103
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.780
you better hope they don't let me off this toolbox.

1104
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.100
I'm going to come break your face,
you know?
And then I stand up and then he,

1105
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.730
and then the guy pulls a stool and then a second later,
I'm on my butt.
Now.

1106
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:37.180
Why didn't the rematch take place?
Ah Man,
I asked for it.

1107
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:40.060
And October I asked for it in November.
I asked for it in December.

1108
00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:41.920
And then finally I'm like,
man,
this is stupid.

1109
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:43.960
I'm gonna go ahead and take a take a fight against the scariest guy in

1110
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:48.520
lightweight division Yamauchi and then,
then he got injured.
Um,

1111
00:58:48.521 --> 00:58:49.720
so then I fought Brandon Gurts.

1112
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:54.220
So it's like I've never once pulled out of a fight.
I've went into many fights,

1113
00:58:54.221 --> 00:58:56.620
injured.
I have never once not answered the call.

1114
00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:59.490
I've always stepped up and I've always been the most exciting guy in Beltour

1115
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.440
will forever be the most exciting guy in tour.
Um,

1116
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:07.270
so it's unfortunate that these things happen to me,
but it's just part of it,
man.

1117
00:59:07.271 --> 00:59:11.350
It's so time though to go without a rematch,
you know?

1118
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:14.620
I mean to be clamoring for it.
And he hasn't defended the title,
correct?
No,

1119
00:59:14.621 --> 00:59:18.310
he's a part time fighter.
Part time.
Part time.
What does he do full time?

1120
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.880
I don't know.
I think he's,
uh,
it's got a job.
Kids Jujitsu,
something.
I don't know.

1121
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.770
<v 2>I don't know what he does.
I mean,
honestly,
it's,
it's,
it's baffling,</v>

1122
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.130
but we'll does belt or even have a heavyweight champ.

1123
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:34.210
I Dunno.
That's crazy.
How the fuck do you not know?
I don't know.
Why don't you,

1124
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:35.510
I mean I don't,
I don't,
you know,

1125
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.150
it would take me a second to think about all the champs in the,
in the sport too.

1126
00:59:38.151 --> 00:59:40.430
They've got it stacked welterweight division.
Yeah.

1127
00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.510
Welterweight Division right now with Roy McDonald and Lima and you know,

1128
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:49.250
Paul Daley and I mean Lorens Larkin.
I mean it's a fucking stack division.

1129
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.130
That's tough.
Harsh cough.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1130
00:59:52.131 --> 00:59:53.750
That was why I was asking for the Paul daily fight.

1131
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:56.090
I was trying to get that fight where you really,
I mean I just,

1132
00:59:56.150 --> 01:00:00.870
I want to get some big fights.
He's terrifying.
That motherfucker.
Yeah.

1133
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.920
For about a minute and a half and then use your break as well.
Well,
his,

1134
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.740
his grappling,
Zoe's always been his achilles heel,

1135
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.530
but God damn that left hand is a missile that uh,

1136
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:10.760
that Lauren's Larkin fight where he,

1137
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:14.780
where he like knocked him out on his feet and he was just kinda like,
yeah,
there,

1138
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:18.590
but not really there.
Paul Dale,
he can do that to anybody.
His left hand he has,

1139
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.350
that to me was a crate.

1140
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.820
That was one of the most frustrating ones when he fought Josh Koscheck.

1141
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:29.330
And threw that punch afterwards and he got kicked out of the UFC basically

1142
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:30.164
forever.

1143
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:34.090
And now you see like Connor throwing Dolly's through windows and all this shit.

1144
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.650
I'm like,
well,
what about Paul dailies gotta be going,
what the fuck,
man?

1145
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:40.520
I got kicked out forever for this.

1146
01:00:40.521 --> 01:00:42.830
I even throw a punch that landed that he's like,
I wish,

1147
01:00:42.831 --> 01:00:45.140
I wish I was in it when it was the entertainment business.
You know,

1148
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:50.130
guys like him though are very interesting where he's such a specialist,
you know,

1149
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.940
he's such a striking specialists.
I watched him,

1150
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.490
I watched him kickbox actually because you know Bella toward those,
those,

1151
01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:59.060
those kickboxing and an inmate and he and he a kickbox,
uh,

1152
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.580
Fernando Gonzales I believe.
Um,
and it was,
it was,
oh,
he's good.

1153
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.840
He's a really good,
especially in that kickboxing,
right,
right.

1154
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.160
When he knows there's no take downs,
there's no threat of,

1155
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:13.100
and there's a different distance there and he's really good at that kickboxing

1156
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:15.560
range,
you know,
unless you're there to be able to really threatened,

1157
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:19.130
threatened with the takedown.
Um,
he's going to be on his game.

1158
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.390
One of my favorite fights of his for forever.
We'll be that fight with Nick Diaz,

1159
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:27.240
which was just fucking one round of chaos,
chaos,

1160
01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.220
chaos until Nick Diaz overwhelmed them.

1161
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:34.820
But nick just puts that crazy triathlon pace on you where you just can't keep up

1162
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.810
with them.
I know.
And that doesn't give you any break.
I know.
And it,

1163
01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:41.990
and those guys,
those guys have both nick and Nate have done a very good job of,

1164
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.880
of not being afraid to take some damage,

1165
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.720
let guys like guys really swarm them and they do have that cardio.

1166
01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.680
But I think they have that.

1167
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.210
They just have that Stockton just coughing and it's almost just like that.

1168
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.871
I've actually,

1169
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:57.330
the funny thing is like me and Michael Johnson sparred numerous times where

1170
01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.890
we're kind of like talking to each other because that's against mine.

1171
01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:01.280
That was against my nature like that,

1172
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:05.450
that cocky braggadocious talking during a fight type of deal.
I mean once again,

1173
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:09.830
that's practice of,
of almost an alter ego,
almost a little bit different.

1174
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:12.490
And then my last couple of fights,
you've seen me be more present,

1175
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:14.840
talking a little bit,
almost kind of egging,
egging them on,

1176
01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:18.020
like not being afraid it,
you should just be like business,
business,
business,

1177
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:20.280
got a fight and now it's like,
hey man,
I'm in here.
You're fighting,

1178
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.500
<v 1>you're fighting somebody who's cognitively here.</v>

1179
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:24.870
My two feet are planted firmly on this ground.
Right?

1180
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:28.080
You're not bound by the moment.
I'm a hundred percent pure in the zone,

1181
01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.530
hundred percent present and in the zone,
like in the zone,
ready to die in there.

1182
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:36.450
Not afraid to,
but also willing to,
willing to fight a very smart fight,

1183
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.960
smart,
sharp,
composed,
missing shots,
taken,

1184
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:44.370
taken shots or taking takedowns when I want to and need to and not being afraid

1185
01:02:44.371 --> 01:02:46.530
to,
to just fight like an extreme,

1186
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:51.480
extremely talented veteran rather than just a vessel violence,
you know?
Yeah.

1187
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:55.200
A vessel of violence as similar as the way of put it to like to think of

1188
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:57.090
yourself as a professional,

1189
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.750
doing your best to execute your skillset and such an extreme circumstance.

1190
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.570
And how many fights have you had now?
A 22,

1191
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:11.850
how many fights do you think it took before you felt that comfortable?

1192
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:17.460
17 and that crazy.
Yeah,
man.
That's all.
I am not joking.
It's,
it's,

1193
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.390
it's ridiculous.
I mean,
I wonder why I,
and now I know why so many people just,

1194
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:25.560
they have a short MMA career and then they're done.
It's hard to,
it's hard.

1195
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:28.470
And then,
you know,
and then,
and that's with my career going really well.

1196
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:32.310
I've signed some good contracts and had and been able to do some really good

1197
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:36.150
stuff and it had some big fights and had some,
you know,
had some good success.

1198
01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:39.300
But I can imagine these people going through the grind and then all of a sudden

1199
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:42.090
you get injured or all of a sudden your manager screws you over and all of a

1200
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:46.620
sudden this and that.
And I've had a really relatively not easy road.
I mean,
but,

1201
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.740
but I've had a really good path,
but I can see how people are like,
man,

1202
01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:50.850
I'm done with this.
You know?
And,

1203
01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:55.050
and I think going back to your point to where you talk about,
um,

1204
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.850
fighting like a veteran.
I mean I think it's all based on the confidence too.

1205
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:03.630
And I see it time and time again guys,
guys,

1206
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:07.260
guys only have one option and that's to fight like a crazy madman because they

1207
01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:09.810
don't have a hundred percent confidence in their skills.

1208
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:13.530
And I think that's why you saw early in my career I fought like a mad man

1209
01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:16.800
because I wasn't a hundred percent confident in my skills.
I was 100% confident.

1210
01:04:16.801 --> 01:04:20.580
My Cardio,
my heart,
my willingness to just take damage,

1211
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:23.940
my willingness to die inside the cage.
I was,
I was confident in that.
There was,

1212
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.480
I stood,
I stood against Eddie Alvarez of 16,

1213
01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:29.760
18 months removed from a college wrestling room and said,

1214
01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:32.340
I'm going to beat that guy.
I'm not supposed to beat them on paper,

1215
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.760
not supposed to beat him record wise.
I'm not supposed to beat him in any other,

1216
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.980
any other universe besides right here.

1217
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:39.540
In my mind I'm saying I want to beat that guy.

1218
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.180
And I did it just by sheer toughness.

1219
01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:44.880
So I believe in my toughness and my cardio and my heart and all that kind of

1220
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.830
stuff.
But I didn't a hundred percent believe in my skills.

1221
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.130
So then all of a sudden you start to mature a little bit and you start to

1222
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:52.140
realize that you have these skills,

1223
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:56.850
you have these bag of these bag of tools to use and you can use them not just

1224
01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:00.540
effectively,
but you can use them efficiently and smart,
you know,

1225
01:05:00.541 --> 01:05:03.750
so you didn't under pressure under pressure.
Yeah.
And it's,
I mean,

1226
01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:07.230
and there's still times where you got to cut you,
you got to gut check.
You know,

1227
01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.320
and that's,
that's a good thing that I know I have in my back pocket is,

1228
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.460
is I get in a fight with one of these guys and he's out matching me.

1229
01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:18.100
He's outclassing me.
He has better technique than me on that night and I'm

1230
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.790
<v 2>off.
He's,
he's technique wise,
he's not tougher than I am.</v>

1231
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:24.160
He doesn't have better cardio than I do.
He's not willing to,

1232
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:27.280
to literally take as much damage I as I am and keep coming forward.

1233
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:30.100
He's not willing to do that.
And that's what I've always had the confidence in,

1234
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:32.680
but now I have the confidence in my skill sets as well.

1235
01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:36.430
When you see a guy like his,
he's one of my favorite examples,

1236
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.400
just engaging who's just a fuck in SAP,

1237
01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:45.400
but you see him go undefeated in world series of fighting,

1238
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:48.700
what do they call it now?
Professional Fighting League.
Is that what they call,

1239
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:50.110
she'll fight league,
is that it?
Yeah,

1240
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.780
so he goes undefeated world series of fighting.

1241
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:57.781
One of the most interesting and intriguing contenders to enter into the UFC has

1242
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.980
a spectacular debut against Michael Johnson in a fucking war.

1243
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:08.130
I mean just a fucking war and then loses to Eddie Alvarez in spectacular fashion

1244
01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:11.980
and then loses to Dustin Poirier in spectacular fashion.

1245
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:16.930
But just in those three fights has taken so much damage.

1246
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:17.500
How much,

1247
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:22.390
it's just crazy to watch his style when you know that he's a very good wrestler.

1248
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.400
He's a smart guy and I mean his Trevor Whitman,
his coach,

1249
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:28.270
his striking coach.

1250
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:33.750
This is the same coach that coached thug rose and you look at her foot work and

1251
01:06:34.271 --> 01:06:36.460
move Marriner to do and technique machine.

1252
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:40.450
A technique machine sliding away from things entering in,
you know,

1253
01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:41.800
like constantly moving,

1254
01:06:41.801 --> 01:06:46.801
presenting angles and different looks and Justin is just hands up high moving in

1255
01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:52.270
on you and just leg kicks from close distance and brawling.
And uh,

1256
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.750
that guy can't do that very long.

1257
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.470
Crazy that he admitted that like he hit the interview,
just came out there.

1258
01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:02.800
He said,
I only have five fights left in me.
I want them to be good ones.
You know,

1259
01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:05.590
like,
is that what he said?
Yeah.
I mean,
I could be wrong,
but I mean,

1260
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:07.900
I'm pretty sure he had an interview that said I only had,

1261
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:10.060
I only have five fights left.
Enemy.
And it's,

1262
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:14.500
it's crazy to see that because when you're already,
and he's younger than I am.

1263
01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:17.780
He's like 29.
Any 28 thank you.
Something like that area.

1264
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:20.240
I don't even know if he's 30 you know,
I don't think he is.
And,

1265
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.050
and this might be a good,
didn't he start late?
Didn't he?

1266
01:07:23.051 --> 01:07:24.370
Didn't he wrestle in college?

1267
01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:28.560
I don't think he started even striking until he was 21 yeah.
So He's,

1268
01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:32.510
he's only been fighting for eight years,
you know,
and,

1269
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:37.300
and I think,
I think it goes back to when I look at him,
uh,
you know,

1270
01:07:37.301 --> 01:07:38.740
it's not a knock on him or whatever.

1271
01:07:38.741 --> 01:07:41.170
I just don't think he has the confidence in his abilities.

1272
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.130
I think there's a fine line between having confidence in your abilities,

1273
01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.790
confidence in your,
in your,
in your striking techniques,
your ability,

1274
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:52.210
your ability to win any other way than a brawl.

1275
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:55.540
Because I've had these thoughts too,
man.
I've sat and I've thought,

1276
01:07:55.930 --> 01:08:00.340
and the thought of me just outclassing somebody and piecing them up in the whole

1277
01:08:00.341 --> 01:08:02.830
world,
watching and hearing the announcer saying,
oh my God,

1278
01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:04.660
Michael Chandler striking is on another level.

1279
01:08:04.661 --> 01:08:06.490
Look at this and that and how he strings together.

1280
01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:09.250
His punches with his kicks in is blah,
blah.
That felt foreign.

1281
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:12.640
And it felt uncomfortable to me because I didn't a hundred percent truly believe

1282
01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:16.670
in that stuff until recently.
And you start in and I think he has the,

1283
01:08:16.671 --> 01:08:20.960
he only has,
he only has the capacity to believe in himself as a brawler.

1284
01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:23.870
Therefore,
that's the only way he knows how to win.

1285
01:08:23.871 --> 01:08:26.360
Therefore in his sparring rounds,
he's not,

1286
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:28.860
I bet you and I could go watch him and he's the same guy,

1287
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:32.630
Justin Geechee and those sparring rounds as he is in the cage.

1288
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:37.550
But is that because here's no regrets.
I have five slots left.

1289
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.670
Like that's a tough spot.
The peon,
you know,
that's just his mentality though.
I,

1290
01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:45.800
I wonder if you're right about that because I think he likes that kind of

1291
01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:49.430
fighting.
Well that's the thing too.
I mean I think that's what he enjoys.

1292
01:08:49.431 --> 01:08:53.030
He likes breaking people.
Like when he broke Michael Johnson,
he just broke them.

1293
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:56.420
And a man,
the fans love it.
You want some fan?
Do you want some fans?

1294
01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:00.080
You have a couple of those.
And I mean he's,
he's got a great following now after,

1295
01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:02.600
like you said,
just a couple of fights.
People believe in him.

1296
01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:07.601
I mean people still right now they see this like cyber war robots step into the

1297
01:09:07.851 --> 01:09:10.130
cage.
That's what they think.
They don't even look at him as a man.

1298
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:13.040
They don't look at him as a,
he has a heart and a spirit in his brain.

1299
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.330
They just look at a guy that who's was out.

1300
01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.910
He goes out there and he's going to just freak and trying to break somebody's

1301
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:18.230
just through sheer,

1302
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:22.670
not beautiful technique but just pressure and punched count and leg kicks in,

1303
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:24.020
that kind of stuff.
And he's going to step into the cage.

1304
01:09:24.021 --> 01:09:25.730
It gets whoever he steps in the cage against,

1305
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:30.440
even though he lost his last two fights and he's still going to be the favorite,

1306
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:33.620
I believe.
Well I just want a liberal best leg tickers in the sport.

1307
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.810
It's just crazy that he started striking so late.
He,

1308
01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:40.070
everybody gets their legs fucked up with that guy and he,
he led,

1309
01:09:40.071 --> 01:09:43.280
kicks the shit out of people from close range too,
which is weird.

1310
01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:48.230
Like literally be in the clinch and he's whipping down on your legs.

1311
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.830
You know,
I just think he loves chaos.
I just think he loves it.

1312
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.850
He embraces it when it,
when shit gets crazy.

1313
01:09:55.851 --> 01:09:58.230
That's when he's at his most comfortable and yeah.

1314
01:09:58.231 --> 01:10:00.410
And maybe that's me speaking from experience cause I saw,

1315
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:04.880
I mean I see a lot of my s my early career very similar to that just brawl and

1316
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:06.980
you know like that's,
that's what I did.
And then I,

1317
01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.580
then I decided I have these physical gifts in the speed and the power and the

1318
01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:14.630
ability,
the,
the mental capacity to,
to pick things up.
I mean I,

1319
01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:18.350
I have been blessed with very the ability to pick things up very,

1320
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:22.490
very quickly and two practices.
I'm like,
holy cow,
this stuff's working.

1321
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.560
Just after a couple of myths sessions,
you know,

1322
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:28.640
Justin's shown no indication that he even enjoys doing any other kind of

1323
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.670
fighting.
I know that's,
you use a lot of footwork and movement.

1324
01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:35.030
You slide and now like the tricky pitfall fight was a great example that you

1325
01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:37.280
slid in and drop that right hand on him.

1326
01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:42.140
It was a perfect closure of distance and you washed a missile on him.
He's just,

1327
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:46.100
here comes bitch here.
Comms.
That's common.
That's common.
And that's scary,
man.

1328
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:50.630
Nobody in the lightweight division is lying when they're not a little bit
shaken.

1329
01:10:50.631 --> 01:10:54.050
Like,
Dang,
I got to fricking fight that dude.
Like he's that guy and the bracket,

1330
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.260
you know,
wrestling,
wrestling there.

1331
01:10:56.261 --> 01:10:58.690
There's the guy who's not really ranked in our,

1332
01:10:58.691 --> 01:11:02.240
he's Branco seated number eight or he's not even seated,

1333
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:04.820
but you know he's a goer.
You know,
he's tough.
You know he's strong,

1334
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:06.140
you know he's not that good,

1335
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:09.290
but he's going to be in your face for seven minutes and you could lose to him

1336
01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:11.960
because he's that good.
He's not the guy you want to draw first round.

1337
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.020
If I was a biology,

1338
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:18.050
I would say take some time off and really reconsider your approach because that

1339
01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:21.360
chaos is always going to be there.
The chaos is always going to be there.

1340
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.590
He's always going to be able to do that.

1341
01:11:22.591 --> 01:11:25.200
He's always going to love that is always going to have some of the best leg

1342
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:28.260
kicks in the sport.
He's a little more footwork.
That's what,
that's what I say,

1343
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.330
the more movement.
How about some faints?

1344
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.870
How about every now and then a little bit of this habitat her every now and then

1345
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.540
switch up is a little bit of take downs.
How about throwing a take down,

1346
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.200
touch your leg,
just touch it,
like make,
make,
make them think,

1347
01:11:43.201 --> 01:11:48.180
make fucking good wrestler.
I was in Colorado,
you know,

1348
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:51.930
so,
but,
and then the other part of me says,
shut the fuck up.
Rogan,

1349
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:54.570
let apply it like that.
Cause it's awesome.
I mean that's his,
that's his thing.

1350
01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:56.970
That's his debt.
Poor.
Yay.
Fight was fucking amazing.

1351
01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.060
And the Michael Johnson fight was fucking,
to me,
even the Eddie Alvarez fight,

1352
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:01.140
it was chaos.
It was,

1353
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.600
I'll put to the moment eddy landed that knee and Eddie's leg was in trouble.
Bad.

1354
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.430
He was in trouble.
I thought I was waiting for it to go to go down.
I was like,

1355
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:13.080
well he's got that debt boxing stance and he gets low and he puts a lot of

1356
01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:15.750
weight on his legs and he's got a lot of confidence in his hands.

1357
01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:19.920
But Donald took advantage of that and his first fight in the UFC.
And you know,

1358
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:24.950
I mean just when you saw Eddie beat Hoffeld dos Santos and win the title,

1359
01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:30.180
what was that feeling for you knowing that you shared all those rounds with him?

1360
01:12:30.181 --> 01:12:34.830
Just to crazy wars.
Was that feeling like,
fuck,
that could be me.
Yeah.

1361
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.880
I mean that was that.
I mean,
that's kind of the,
yeah,
that was,

1362
01:12:38.881 --> 01:12:42.210
that was when I watched it.
I was in Salt Lake City actually,
or not park city,

1363
01:12:42.211 --> 01:12:42.660
Utah.

1364
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.900
I was at a wedding and so we were all just hanging out and I was like the fights

1365
01:12:45.901 --> 01:12:47.550
on and I was watching it,
I couldn't hear it,

1366
01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:49.530
but I was watching it and he was just throwing that,

1367
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.430
that flurry and everybody who I was with was like,
holy cow,
like that,
you know,

1368
01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:58.080
you beat that guy twice,
you know?
And that's once,
twice

1369
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:05.220
just disagree with I've,
I'm just joking.
I don't,
you know,
this is,

1370
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:09.600
that's the sport and I love it.
Um,
but fought that guy twice to two very,

1371
01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:11.700
two very close fights and you know,

1372
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.670
it was Kinda one of those things where it's like,
man,
yeah,
I mean,
but I knew it.

1373
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.230
I knew,

1374
01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:18.030
I knew he was going to go over there and he was going to do extremely well.

1375
01:13:18.031 --> 01:13:20.620
I didn't know he was going to come in.
And I mean he beat,
I mean he lost it.

1376
01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:24.630
The loss of Donald Cerrone beat Gilbert Gilbert.
He beat Pettis.

1377
01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.050
He'd been another guy.
I believe he,
I mean he was just those two or those two.

1378
01:13:28.051 --> 01:13:30.300
And then you think it was just those two and then he got the title fight.

1379
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:34.630
I think I might be wrong.
She does.
He would pull up his record,
but either way.
Um,

1380
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:35.840
what I admire about Eddie's,

1381
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:40.850
the same thing that I admire about you is that he does thrive on those wild

1382
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:46.120
fights.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,
he's just,
just an unbelievably tough guy.

1383
01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.030
And the gauge you fight was a perfect example of that.
I mean,

1384
01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:52.870
he got fucking hurt and that fight,
man,
his leg was chewed up.
Pad has his,
Whoa,

1385
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.330
I don't know what was going on with his face.
You guys were calling it out.

1386
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.490
We were trying to figure out what it was.
Yeah.
Uh,
okay.
Uh,

1387
01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.820
Gilbert Pettis,
and then they'll say,
yeah,
it was,
it was just those two.

1388
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.450
And then the loss to Donald.
But the,
the,
those two fights where,
you know,

1389
01:14:06.451 --> 01:14:11.350
Pettis was a champion,
you know,
at lightweight and was,

1390
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.070
you know,
at

1391
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.740
<v 0>that time,
still thought to be in the mix,
had beaten Gilbert,
you know,</v>

1392
01:14:15.741 --> 01:14:16.660
it's submitted.

1393
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:20.500
Gilbert and Gilbert of course from the strike force fights mad respect for

1394
01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:24.010
Gilbert.
It's one of the best in the fucking world.
I mean,

1395
01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:29.580
it's just when you really stop and think about how fucking tightly matched that

1396
01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:35.020
lightweight division is and how many killers are in that division,

1397
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:39.880
that is a fucking crazy division.
And in the UFC right now you got could be,

1398
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:42.820
you got Tony Ferguson,
you might have Max Holloway.
I mean,

1399
01:14:42.821 --> 01:14:45.940
it's crazy that Max Holloway got pulled from the New York car because he was

1400
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:50.500
having trouble making weight.
And he's the 145 pound champion,
which is just,

1401
01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:54.740
he's a tall boy,
he's a big fella to tall boy and he's a tough motherfucker.

1402
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:56.470
Holy Shit.
Is he tough?

1403
01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:01.780
She's just got this incredible wealth of talent in this one division,
you know?

1404
01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:06.700
And then Kevin Lee,
how fucking good did he look against?
Barboza Holy Shit.

1405
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:10.090
He did look really good.
I mean fucking Stud.
So it's,

1406
01:15:10.091 --> 01:15:14.470
you've got so many good fighters in this one division,
you know,

1407
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:17.240
and this is why we got to bring it into the UFC.
Come was that,

1408
01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:20.680
why are you going to do that kind of fucking contract?
You haven't Peloton.

1409
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:24.370
We've got to talk Michael Challenge about it.
32 men.

1410
01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:28.840
You're going to be 33 then you'll be 35 then you'll be 40 and then it'd be over.

1411
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.840
Yeah,
I'm 50 trust me,
it happens.
It just happens.

1412
01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:35.170
I hope I look like you went up 50 it just comes if you will.

1413
01:15:35.171 --> 01:15:37.990
You won't pass any drug den.
Yeah,
they right now.

1414
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:44.200
Now we got to get you in here,
man.
There's just no,
there's no other way to do it.

1415
01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:48.250
Well,
we're,
we're a,
we're trying to figure everything out.
No disrespect.

1416
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.300
Beltour some cross promotion.
Some people I'll go with that be,

1417
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:55.060
I would love that.
I really would.
I mean,

1418
01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:59.740
I think I said when Rory went over to fight in Beltour upset,

1419
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:03.510
he very well might be,
here's a shout out to power off the warriors.

1420
01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:04.660
I don't know if that's very well.

1421
01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:08.440
Might be the best 170 pound fighter in the world.
It's very possible.

1422
01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:13.070
It's very possible he has,
I mean if he's not,
he's certainly in the mix.
Yeah,

1423
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.580
and he might be on any given day,

1424
01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:18.250
I mean this is the thing like you just really don't know,

1425
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.710
but if you look at his fight with Tyron Woodley,

1426
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.620
I mean he essentially shut Woodley's main,

1427
01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:26.890
authentic down and used a brilliant strategy to beat him by decision.

1428
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.120
You look at his fight with Maya,
he got in the worst possible position with Maya.

1429
01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:35.080
Maya mounted on him in the first round when they're not even that sweaty yet,

1430
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.780
and he was able to survive that and then pick my apart.

1431
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.780
He's one of the best in the world.
Beats Lima,

1432
01:16:40.781 --> 01:16:43.680
who I think is extremely underrated.
Yeah.

1433
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:48.220
I think Lima is one of the very best fighters on the planet earth and it just,

1434
01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:51.730
people don't know because for whatever reason,

1435
01:16:51.731 --> 01:16:55.590
Bella toward just has not been able to capture the public's imagination the same

1436
01:16:55.591 --> 01:16:59.800
way the UFC.
I mean they,
I mean they've definitely grown.
I mean,
yes,
big time,

1437
01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:02.950
you know,
and that's,
his fight car was fucking incredible.
And it's cool.
I mean,

1438
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.920
it's cool because I've been there for the maturation of the whole thing.
I mean,

1439
01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:09.980
I fought,
my first fight was on ESPN Deportes days that,
that was on

1440
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.430
<v 1>that finally air to like two in the morning after like a couple of girls high</v>

1441
01:17:13.431 --> 01:17:16.970
school softball game,
stop the deal,
you know,
like that was our,
our slot.

1442
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:17.810
And then it moved to him,

1443
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:21.860
MTV two and then spike and now paramount network and now it's simulcasts and now

1444
01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:25.940
on CMT and Paramont at work.
So it's cool to see the growth.
It's cool to see.

1445
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:28.310
I mean,
it's growing,
you know?
Um,
and it's been,

1446
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.680
it's been cool to be a part of the growth.

1447
01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:34.640
I mean I will forever probably be in the biggest fights are the most exciting

1448
01:17:34.641 --> 01:17:36.800
fights in Bellator history.
You know,
so it's,
yeah.

1449
01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:40.270
<v 0>Beltour hater by any stretch to the imagination.
And I,
even though I've,</v>

1450
01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:42.660
obviously I've been working for the UFC for a long time,

1451
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:47.650
I'm a fan of fights and I like,
I like a high level of fights.
I don't,

1452
01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.180
I mean obviously I'm loyal to the UFC,
but I don't want Beltour to fail.

1453
01:17:52.181 --> 01:17:56.360
I want them to succeed.
I liked the fact that they have Rory Mcdonald.

1454
01:17:56.361 --> 01:17:59.860
So there is a,
there's an argument like you look at it and go,
hey these,

1455
01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:03.700
this might be the best 170 pound fighter in the world and he's not the of Saint.

1456
01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.170
Yeah.
Like this is all good.

1457
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:09.160
I felt at the same way when fate or was fighting and pride,
I was like,
look,

1458
01:18:09.161 --> 01:18:12.370
that might be the best fucking heavyweight on the planet earth and he's not
here.

1459
01:18:12.371 --> 01:18:16.300
And I tried very hard to try to figure out a way to get him over there,

1460
01:18:16.301 --> 01:18:20.890
but they were super unreasonable back then.
Yeah.
Now,
the UFC faders management,

1461
01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.710
they would be crazy,
unreasonable.
They wanted cope promotion.

1462
01:18:23.711 --> 01:18:27.760
They wanted a 50 50 split one,
get the fuck here.
They were like,

1463
01:18:27.761 --> 01:18:30.550
this ain't happening man.
And then they were also saying,
look,

1464
01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:35.140
this guy is one loss away from losing all of his value.

1465
01:18:35.141 --> 01:18:36.460
You have to understand this.
Yeah.

1466
01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.020
And then when Fabrizio over doom caught him with that triangle.
Oh yeah.

1467
01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.780
The UFC was like,
we fucking told you.
We told you.

1468
01:18:43.781 --> 01:18:46.870
And then big foot Silva's smashed him.
And then Dan Henderson,

1469
01:18:46.871 --> 01:18:48.580
Kaye owed him and the EOC is like,
look,

1470
01:18:48.581 --> 01:18:53.170
we fucking told you you had an opportunity to bring him over here.
And that was,

1471
01:18:53.171 --> 01:18:57.070
you know,
it was a different time.
It was when Fado was in his prime,
you know,

1472
01:18:57.071 --> 01:19:00.490
it was when,
you know,
fader was smashing people and pride.

1473
01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:05.491
It was just a different human being than what you're seeing today at 41 but I,

1474
01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:10.660
I'm a fan of the best fighters in the world getting together and whatever we

1475
01:19:10.661 --> 01:19:13.690
have to do to facilitate that,
that's what I want to see happen.

1476
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.270
You know what I mean?
I,
you know,

1477
01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:21.070
I just think that there's gotta be a way to make this happen.
There's got to be,

1478
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:26.110
<v 1>what are you talking about here?
You motherfucker.
Hey Man.
I mean,</v>

1479
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:29.740
I'm just,
I'm,
I'm going,
going day by day,
you know,

1480
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.150
I'm enjoying the process.
I mean,
we,
we're in talks right now.
Things are going,

1481
01:19:34.151 --> 01:19:37.450
things are going smoothly,
things are going,
things are moving forward.
We'll see.

1482
01:19:37.451 --> 01:19:39.950
Uh,
we'll see what happens.
I mean,
I know you have to say all this.
I know,

1483
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:44.980
but that,
that is true.
I mean,
I want to fight the best guys in the world and no,

1484
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:47.620
you don't.
There's not a day,
there isn't a day that goes by that I don't get,

1485
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.851
I mean,
shoot,

1486
01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:53.680
you posted that thing this morning and there was 287 likes and 30 or comments

1487
01:19:53.681 --> 01:19:57.460
in,
in,
you know,
five minutes and it was all like,
finally,
hey,

1488
01:19:57.461 --> 01:20:00.700
when are you going to come?
And I get that every single day.

1489
01:20:00.701 --> 01:20:02.170
So there's not a day that goes by that,

1490
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.900
that it doesn't get talked about or thought about,

1491
01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:08.070
but especially after anyone over there and became champion.
Yeah.
Right.

1492
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:09.480
<v 0>And everybody knows about,
I mean,
this,</v>

1493
01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:12.600
one of the things that I talked about when Eddie first came over to the UFC was

1494
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:14.310
go,
I was telling people,

1495
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:18.150
go watch the wars that he had with Michael Chandler.

1496
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:19.560
And then I've said that also too,

1497
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:21.840
when I've seen you coaching people or being in someone's corner,
I'm like,

1498
01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:24.200
that right there is one of the best lightweights in the planet.
Yeah.

1499
01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.270
And I just really would love to see you.
I mean,

1500
01:20:27.271 --> 01:20:31.550
I don't want to undercut Beltour I don't want to Dell toward,
you know,
no,

1501
01:20:31.551 --> 01:20:33.810
I mean it's at the end of the day,
I mean there's,
there's,

1502
01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:37.230
it's a competition between the two.
You know,
the two organizations,

1503
01:20:37.231 --> 01:20:40.150
there's guys in both organizations that are great,
like you said,
Lima and,

1504
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:43.810
and all these guys and course correct off.
I mean,
there's,
you know,

1505
01:20:43.811 --> 01:20:46.110
in the pit bull brothers or whatever.
I mean there's,

1506
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:48.870
there's some great talent in both [inaudible] and you saw it back in the day

1507
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:52.500
with Strikeforce and now all of a sudden a lot of these Strikeforce guys are,

1508
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:56.280
you know,
UFC champions as well.
You know,
so it's an interesting,
weird,

1509
01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:59.580
the way fighting is today as opposed to the way boxing.

1510
01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:01.680
It's like a perfect example is like,

1511
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:04.180
like the Gennady Golovkin fight this weekend.
You know,

1512
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.670
we went to see him and you know,
you go to your,

1513
01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:11.250
you're basically going to see one of the best boxers on the planet.

1514
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:13.770
You're not going to see him because he's,
you know,

1515
01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:18.650
the fucking WBC guy or the Ibf guy or the Wbo God.

1516
01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.560
People don't really give a shit about that.
He's a world champion,
but the,

1517
01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:26.700
the war,
but it's versus Bella tour versus the UFC.

1518
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.320
It's a big difference in the way people look at it.

1519
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:32.670
Like the average public,

1520
01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:37.440
the people don't give a shit if you're the WBA champion in boxing or the WBC

1521
01:21:37.441 --> 01:21:38.700
champions,
they don't give a shit.

1522
01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.540
They just want to know who's a bad motherfucker.
Like is it,
you know,

1523
01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:46.290
is it Deontay wilder?
Is it Anthony Joshua who these are heavyweight champions.

1524
01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:47.430
Let's see him fight.

1525
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.460
They don't look at it that way when it comes to Bella tour in the UFC.

1526
01:21:50.461 --> 01:21:54.330
I don't know why I have my,
my speculation is first of all,

1527
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:56.910
because UFC has been around forever and it's like the NFL,

1528
01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.610
it has that name value tips.

1529
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.500
They've done a good job of building the name value.
It's also a really good name.

1530
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:09.210
Yeah,
UFC is a great name.
Bella Torah is a shitty name.
It just is.
It's just,

1531
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:12.300
you know,
you go to the,
the average person like you like,
Oh,

1532
01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:15.360
I'm gonna Watch Bella towards tonight.
They're like,
the fuck is a ballot.
To her,

1533
01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.790
they didn't know what a Bella Torres,

1534
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:20.400
but ultimate fighting championship makes sense.
Makes Sense.

1535
01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:24.610
And it's funny that just call it paramount MMA,
I think.
Uh,
yeah.
I mean I,

1536
01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:25.540
I think there,

1537
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:29.500
I mean there was all kinds of new branding going on with the whole new paramount

1538
01:22:29.501 --> 01:22:30.570
stuff and all that kind of stuff.

1539
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:33.270
I mean there if there was ever a time it would have been now,

1540
01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:35.280
but I mean I think they're,
they're stuck to it.
They like it.

1541
01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:36.600
I mean it's kind of one of them things.

1542
01:22:36.601 --> 01:22:39.630
They should get their money back from spike Lee and when they had to pay spike

1543
01:22:39.631 --> 01:22:43.860
Lee,
did they?
Yeah,
they paid them off.
Yeah,
because he was clearly,
he we've sued,

1544
01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.700
he sued them.
He said that you stole the name from me and they're like,

1545
01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:51.600
what the fuck is basically just one of those frivolous lawsuits that you have to

1546
01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:55.410
settle?
Like fine.
Take like one,
some keg.
This clash.
Take this money.

1547
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.650
I want how much they gave him.
How much do you think they gave him?
Let's,

1548
01:22:57.670 --> 01:23:01.500
let's say,
guess how much you think they gave Spike Lee?
3.2 million.
Really?

1549
01:23:01.501 --> 01:23:04.740
That much?
No,
I don't know.
I made that up 1,000,050 gave him a million.

1550
01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.180
I bet they gave him a meal.
I bet you're right about it.

1551
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:09.940
I'm going to go with 1.2 I'm going to,
I'm going to be in the middle.

1552
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.210
I'm going to be the middle guy and see how much the guy,

1553
01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.750
do you think they disclosed it?
You think?
Yeah.
Did he,

1554
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:17.080
did he like actually trademark spike TV?

1555
01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:21.100
Like someday he might actually have his own TV channel.
You his,

1556
01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.050
his thought was,

1557
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:25.420
well what about Spike Jones is see like where's my fucking money?

1558
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.560
I think he just was felt like his name was so not like the name's spike was

1559
01:23:31.751 --> 01:23:36.280
synonymous with him?
No.
Well it's spike was a dog,
right?

1560
01:23:36.281 --> 01:23:38.890
Wasn't that like it was a logo aspect of it?
Yeah.
Okay.

1561
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:42.940
Well cause the UFC was the ultimate fighter was on spike TV.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

1562
01:23:42.941 --> 01:23:47.620
2005 Stephan Bonner and Forrest Griffin now forever in debt to those guys.

1563
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:51.070
They made the sport that one crazy fight.
Literally.

1564
01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:55.120
It was like probably one of the big pushes by undisclosed,
undisclosed,

1565
01:23:55.121 --> 01:23:59.560
undisclosed DePaul at me.
Spike Tom,
which got let us know,
let us know.

1566
01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:03.980
Spike Lee joint public statement that they settled their differences entry a

1567
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:08.410
greenback.
Yeah.
A lot of people were mad at spike for that.
Spike Lee.
Yeah.

1568
01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.600
I don't remember any trip that referee.
I actually don't know if he did it.

1569
01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:14.080
He tripped a referee.
It wasn't the Jay z song.
Remember that one?

1570
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:16.080
What are you talking about?
I had never even saw it.

1571
01:24:16.081 --> 01:24:20.620
I spike Lee tripped a referee.
He said being in the NBA,
a lot of Knicks games.

1572
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:24.100
Yeah,
so trip the referees supposedly.
Well that's what Jay z said.
He said,

1573
01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:28.210
I'm spiked out,
I could trip a referee and I'm like,
oh trip a spike.

1574
01:24:28.211 --> 01:24:31.180
Lee must have tripped to referee one time because he has always courtside at the

1575
01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:33.400
Knicks.
Is that supposedly,
is there video of this?

1576
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.300
I think he's saying it because he sits court side.

1577
01:24:37.301 --> 01:24:40.300
I don't think it actually one of those things.
One of those things,

1578
01:24:40.301 --> 01:24:44.140
one of those I could trip a rapper could trip a referee.
Yeah.
Isn't that weird?

1579
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.890
Like basketball?
Like you can get like right up to the ash so close.

1580
01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.270
You could literally get,
you could trip a referee.
Yeah.

1581
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:55.570
Whereas like you know football,
you're pretty fucked back.
20 feet,
50 feet.

1582
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.690
I mean,
I've talked to about this so many times people get angry at me,

1583
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:03.900
but what would you think about the idea of fighting in a big open area without a

1584
01:25:04.361 --> 01:25:08.060
cage?
Like a big open area?
Like a basketball ring?
Yeah,

1585
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:12.700
I mean a basketball arena.
Like a basketball court,
like that size.

1586
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:17.400
If you had like wrestling has where you have boundary lines.
Yeah.

1587
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:20.320
Could you actually go out of those boundary lines and they'll stop the bash,

1588
01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:23.770
stop the action.
I'd have to bring you back in.
It didn't have to be some reason.

1589
01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:26.180
It would be like a college.
It'd be like the coliseum.
Exactly.

1590
01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:29.070
So big that you're almost,
there almost are no barriers.
Well yeah,

1591
01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:33.640
because I think that there's something about a cage that presents an artificial

1592
01:25:33.641 --> 01:25:38.641
boundary and that artificial boundary can be used both to contain someone and to

1593
01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:43.030
get out to get up.
Like you could obviously wall walk and get up out.

1594
01:25:43.330 --> 01:25:47.530
I just think it makes take downs much more difficult when there's not a cage

1595
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.360
because you know you're not going to press someone against cage,

1596
01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:50.920
just scooped their legs out from under him.

1597
01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:54.010
You have to get a legitimate takedown.
Yeah.
Like an open area takedown.

1598
01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.490
And it makes getting up much more difficult when you're,

1599
01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:00.700
when someone does take you down,
smashing up against the gauge,

1600
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:04.070
you can't just scoot your backup to the wall and get back up.
You're

1601
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.310
<v 1>going to have to figure out a way to actually get up now.
Yeah.</v>

1602
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.300
Well that was one of the things too.
I mean,
going back to become,
you know,

1603
01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:09.951
being a wrestler,

1604
01:26:09.951 --> 01:26:13.520
I mean your wrestlers coming in should not just expect that they're going to be

1605
01:26:13.521 --> 01:26:15.470
able to take guys down and not get taken down.

1606
01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:17.690
I used to get taken down all the time off the gate and I'm like,
man,

1607
01:26:17.691 --> 01:26:20.060
I'm a division one wrestler.
Why am I getting taken down?
But it's,

1608
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:21.920
it is completely different.

1609
01:26:21.921 --> 01:26:26.900
I mean obviously I know a lot about maneuvering the body and,
and,
and you know,

1610
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:28.580
scrambling out and all that kind of stuff.

1611
01:26:28.581 --> 01:26:32.330
But adding the cage wall is a lot different,
you know,
you know,

1612
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:37.250
when you first started training,
um,
did you immediately start training in a cage?

1613
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:41.540
Uh,
I think at extreme get tour,
yeah.
There was,
there was a cage so we would,

1614
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:45.810
we would spar in a cage.
Um,
but now I don't,
I don't really spar engage anymore.

1615
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.860
You don't?
Not really.
How come?
I don't know.
I mean down in,

1616
01:26:48.861 --> 01:26:51.950
down in Florida we don't have one and we just spar in the open.
There's,

1617
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:56.240
there's cage walls.
Well there's cage walls that like if you're in training camp,

1618
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:58.180
you know,
if you've got a fight coming up soon,
uh,

1619
01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:00.710
you'll spar in this certain area where they might put some,

1620
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.740
some Thai pads on the floor,
like don't go past this.

1621
01:27:03.741 --> 01:27:06.920
And then there's your other barrier type of deal.
Right.
My Gym,

1622
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:10.610
we don't have a cage,
we just have a cage wall and then a padded wall too.

1623
01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.570
So the cage wall just so to work on wall walks and things like that,

1624
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.050
you get chewed up on those fucking things too.
That's why,
that's why I just,

1625
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:20.150
I like to use the padded wall,
you know?
And I mean,

1626
01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.450
the only difference is there's a little bit of a give a little bit of,

1627
01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:26.330
if we give you the cage wall,
there's not on the pattern wall,
but man,
yeah,

1628
01:27:26.331 --> 01:27:28.280
if you're not wearing gloves and elbow,

1629
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:32.180
I mean I've busted a bursa sac and my elbow before or it and it just takes a

1630
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.370
week to heal,
you know?

1631
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.600
Or you look at you and you look at your back in the mirror and it's just,

1632
01:27:35.601 --> 01:27:38.350
it looks like a bunch of hickeys all over your back,
your head.

1633
01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:41.350
You can get ripped apart.
You're evil,
there's cut open,
you know,

1634
01:27:41.351 --> 01:27:43.990
like I'm actually down,
gotten cut open like nick,

1635
01:27:43.991 --> 01:27:47.730
tell just a little bitty one on my,
from the fight.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1636
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:52.220
By just hitting the cage because it's metal,
you know,
it's not,
yeah.

1637
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:55.280
It's one of those things that I think is a legacy idea.
I just don't,

1638
01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:56.750
it's hard to see too,

1639
01:27:56.751 --> 01:27:59.600
when you're in the audience and you're looking at it like there's often,

1640
01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:04.250
and those pillars get in the way.
He cool.
It'd be cool if there was just,
just a,

1641
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:08.270
a single caves.
They didn't have to be bolted together.
Therefore there was no,

1642
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.030
there was no,
no posts posts.
But then again,
you know,

1643
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.000
you'd have to have a top post,
right?

1644
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:15.920
You have to have a top post and a bottom post,
and then the,

1645
01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:19.690
the cage would have to be so rigid that it held everything together.
You know,

1646
01:28:19.691 --> 01:28:23.030
how the fuck would you do that?
It would be almost impossible because it's,

1647
01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:27.470
or maybe it's if you lower the men or maybe it's too,
yeah,
exactly.

1648
01:28:27.471 --> 01:28:31.160
Just the guys just stand there and then they just get locked in and then big.

1649
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:36.230
Yeah,
there's no doors.
Spartans just like lock this thing down and yeah,

1650
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.810
there's like elevators that was like the,
the,
the big UFC back in the day.

1651
01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:42.890
W what was it got our Davey.
Yeah.
When they started talking about the,

1652
01:28:42.891 --> 01:28:45.650
all the ideas where they were talking about putting a moat around the cage and

1653
01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:49.110
sharks and alligators and like,
we're really gonna do this thing big.

1654
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.040
Everyone's going to love it.
That's our Davies,

1655
01:28:52.041 --> 01:28:55.850
the same guy that brought us a x arm wrestling or whatever the fuck it was.

1656
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:56.960
Oh yeah.
The armor,

1657
01:28:56.990 --> 01:29:00.110
you know when it is the tied your arms together and the beat the shit out of

1658
01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:02.460
each other.
Really like the Michael Jackson

1659
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.450
<v 0>bad video MMA arm wrestling event.</v>

1660
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.170
Oh it was actually a moment where you literally tied the guy's arm together.

1661
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.770
So you are in the RMS and the situation.
You sit down,

1662
01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:16.470
beach taped your arms together and then you were punching each other and kicking

1663
01:29:16.471 --> 01:29:20.880
each other in bars.
Yeah.
With the arm wrestling podium in front of you.

1664
01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:23.680
Here it is.
Oh my gosh.
I have no idea how you find these things.

1665
01:29:23.681 --> 01:29:28.380
So cause we made fun of this like a week ago.
It was so fucking stupid.

1666
01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:32.160
They taped their arms together and these guys,
first of all,

1667
01:29:32.161 --> 01:29:36.520
don't ever throw that kick.
Yeah.
Um,
but look at,
this guy's got an arm bar.

1668
01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:40.590
Oh my goodness.
I mean,
which is crazy cause your arm can get fucking snapped.

1669
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:43.760
I mean you have a table that you're doing as Armbar over you.

1670
01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:47.160
You don't even have time to tap and they can't separate you.
Once you do tap,

1671
01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:51.360
look at this.
Oh No,
look at how crazy that is.
They're stopping the fight,

1672
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.650
but even though they stopped the fight,

1673
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:57.540
paint his arm and his arm cause you can win by getting an arm like or knock him

1674
01:29:57.541 --> 01:29:59.100
out.
It was so stupid.

1675
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:03.090
This is one of the dumbest ideas that humans have ever come up.
Oh man,

1676
01:30:03.150 --> 01:30:05.790
look at this.
That dude,
but it's entertaining.
I would watch it.

1677
01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:09.960
I guess I would watch it horrible.
I'm watching it right now,

1678
01:30:09.961 --> 01:30:11.970
so I'm talking shit.
I would watch it,

1679
01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:17.940
watch it 100% but the arms are taped together,
which is just crazy.

1680
01:30:17.941 --> 01:30:19.290
I love how they,
I love how they,

1681
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:23.490
the ref comes out and does the tape job too while everyone's watching and you're

1682
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.120
like,
oh,
that guy's out cold hanging off and it's awesome.

1683
01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:28.410
Then you're connected to them.

1684
01:30:28.411 --> 01:30:32.010
You should just like run and start dragging him around the danger.

1685
01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:37.510
It was such a dumb idea,
but see it what?

1686
01:30:38.110 --> 01:30:41.250
What was that like?
Was that online?
Was that paper view?
Was that,
how was that?

1687
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.910
I don't know.
It's one of those things that just,
it was just,

1688
01:30:44.911 --> 01:30:48.070
it just existed for awhile.
It happened for a second.
Yeah,

1689
01:30:48.071 --> 01:30:50.190
it happened for a little bit knocked out and they're like,
okay,

1690
01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:52.230
is there a commission?
Do you have to have a commission?

1691
01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:56.820
They probably did that on some fucking island somewhere.
Exactly right.

1692
01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:00.810
Sounds good to national waters on a boat or something like that.

1693
01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:04.800
No idea how they got away with that thing.
It's just so stupid.

1694
01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:06.680
But that was our debut,
Huh?
Yeah.
I believe,

1695
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.320
didn't he just get a inducted to the hall of fame?
Yes I did.
Yes he did.

1696
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:11.101
Rather um,

1697
01:31:11.101 --> 01:31:16.101
wasn't there a frank shamrock had a good idea where they were doing one in like

1698
01:31:16.411 --> 01:31:20.130
a,
it was like a pit.
Okay.
Sort of a thing.

1699
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:23.280
Which would be cool cause you couldn't really climb out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1700
01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.410
I know they have something similar to that.

1701
01:31:25.411 --> 01:31:29.670
Now with this a karate thing that boss ruin is involved with Florida.

1702
01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.890
Yes.
Yes.
Luke.
Uh,
Luke Rockhold is,
has gone to a couple of live events I think.

1703
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.180
Yeah.
They're doing that now.

1704
01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:40.600
We would take like real high level karate guys and they were MMA gloves and
yeah,

1705
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:44.640
I think there are ladders.
Yeah.
Padded,
like kind of walls type of deal.
Yeah,

1706
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:48.120
well it's like a slanted area where you know,
you know,

1707
01:31:48.150 --> 01:31:52.140
you hit the barrier and it's weird like you could punch a little bit on the

1708
01:31:52.141 --> 01:31:54.540
ground.
It's very strange.
Like boss had it in.

1709
01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:56.580
You're allowed to punch on the ground for five seconds.

1710
01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:59.460
Like you take a guy down and you could punch him in the graphs for five just

1711
01:31:59.461 --> 01:32:00.294
stand up.

1712
01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:03.430
<v 2>Yeah.
Which is like,
oh,
okay.
It's like we had a little beat is facing.
Come on man.</v>

1713
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:06.370
Well it's like that.
This idea needs a little bit of work.

1714
01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:09.090
It's a little bit of show you think it's going to make it or you think they got

1715
01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.040
the bus route and thing.
I mean,
hopefully I look,
I think more,

1716
01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:13.540
the more stuff we can have the better,

1717
01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.600
but I just think they need to iron out the rules.
Like I love glory.

1718
01:32:16.601 --> 01:32:19.270
I love kickboxing.
I love lion fight when it was on,

1719
01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:22.560
but I think now it's only online or something like that.
Yeah.
You know,
it's,

1720
01:32:22.561 --> 01:32:27.561
it's hard to find good high level Moitai good high level striking.

1721
01:32:28.091 --> 01:32:31.300
That's not just boxing,
you know,
this,
it's really hard to find.
Well that's,
yeah,

1722
01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:31.871
exactly.

1723
01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:35.170
Well and that's why you've seen all these organizations come and go are these

1724
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.370
kind of crazy ideas?
Nothing is sticking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And a lot of instances,

1725
01:32:39.371 --> 01:32:42.460
but it's,
so that's why it's cool to see the growth of MMA,
you know?

1726
01:32:42.461 --> 01:32:45.760
And that's why it's,
it's a cool time to be a part of this.
You know,

1727
01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:48.460
this generation of in May as an MMA grows and,

1728
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.460
and like you talked about asking about myself.

1729
01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:55.400
I mean you see in all kinds of guys having success with karate style and,

1730
01:32:55.570 --> 01:33:00.280
and like kind of on your toes,
bouncing kickboxing style,
shoot point,

1731
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:04.330
kickboxing style.
Um,
and you're seeing a lot of people come in cause it's cool.

1732
01:33:04.331 --> 01:33:08.350
It's flashy.
The fans love it.
The promoters love it.
Michael Page.
Michael Page.

1733
01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:09.040
Exactly.
You know,

1734
01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.480
I mean he's a perfect example of a guy who was a real high level point karate

1735
01:33:13.481 --> 01:33:17.920
fighter who's now the real Tufts puzzled to solve in MMA.
Yeah.

1736
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.040
Who was he fighting next?
He's fighting one 70 right?

1737
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:24.160
Fighting one 70 I don't think he has a [inaudible] word.
I don't think he has a,

1738
01:33:24.161 --> 01:33:27.610
an MMA fight schedule.
He,
I know he had a fight in October,
but that was,

1739
01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.890
he had a boxing match.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was,
I knew one by chaos once ago.

1740
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:32.340
A long time ago.
May,

1741
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:36.140
and I know they were trying to set up a fight with him and Paul did layer,

1742
01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:40.480
which would be fucking chaos.
Yeah,
but Paul Daley was just saying something.

1743
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.250
I read an article,
I just read the headline,

1744
01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.690
said Bella toward thinks I'm a fool and I ain't one,
so I don't know.
Daily.
Yeah.

1745
01:33:46.691 --> 01:33:48.730
Paul Paul Daley was not very happy for a second.

1746
01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.260
That's why I was very interested or I was surprised to see him.
Who did he just,

1747
01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:56.110
he just signed to find a [inaudible].
Who was he fighting?

1748
01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:59.650
I don't know because this was the,
I read this.
He's fine.
Line one in London,

1749
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.240
I believe it was yesterday.
See if he was find out into it says Paul Daley.
Oh,

1750
01:34:04.241 --> 01:34:07.750
John Fish.
That's right.
He's coming back to FAU or John Fitch is coming back.

1751
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:10.900
That's terrible.
Fight for him though.
John Fitch is all rustler.

1752
01:34:10.901 --> 01:34:14.260
Have they fought yet ready to fight John Fitch?
I don't think I know.

1753
01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.020
I don't believe they did.
Coming off impressive.

1754
01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:20.710
Second round knockout a fair federal.
Yeah.
Fellow UFC veteran.
Lauren's Larkin.

1755
01:34:20.711 --> 01:34:25.030
So He's been,
he's been out for a while too.
Cause that fight with little wrens.

1756
01:34:25.031 --> 01:34:27.370
I want to say it was six months ago plus right?

1757
01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:31.930
That was on my card and September.
September.

1758
01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:36.190
Yeah.
September.
But yeah,
I mean he,
I know he came out,

1759
01:34:36.191 --> 01:34:37.870
he wasn't very happy about some stuff.

1760
01:34:37.871 --> 01:34:41.680
So that was eight months since his last fight.
So is that what he's upset about?

1761
01:34:41.681 --> 01:34:44.090
That he hasn't gotten a fight in a long time?
I mean,
I think it's,

1762
01:34:44.091 --> 01:34:47.440
it's like you said,
belt or thinks I'm a fool,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Then he's,
he said,

1763
01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:49.210
he basically said he was walking.
There you go.
Yeah,

1764
01:34:49.211 --> 01:34:53.450
Belle Belle tours playing me for an idiot and I ain't an idiot,
idiot,

1765
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.030
idiot.
When you say that one idiot,
his British accent even better.

1766
01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.620
But that's uh,
that's interesting.

1767
01:35:03.621 --> 01:35:06.080
I ain't happy with what you guys are finally a fight.
That makes sense.

1768
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:09.140
Hold on at,
scroll back up.
What is he saying?
Um,

1769
01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.070
Beltour wanted him to fight John Fitch belt to one nine,
nine to Saturday.

1770
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:16.130
One thing went through his mind.
I thought finally a fight.
That makes sense.

1771
01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:20.960
Daley said in case you couldn't tell.
Um,
I've had great times of belter.
Okay.

1772
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:23.280
Is it just they just,
um,

1773
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.990
they just take it a quote out of context and making it the title,

1774
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.310
which they always do,
right?

1775
01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:31.790
They play me for Nydia and ain't it just be done with all the bullshit?

1776
01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:35.720
Let me fight.
I love how they bull expletive just right.
Oh Shit.

1777
01:35:35.721 --> 01:35:38.990
You fucking pussies.
Let me fight.
Let me go.

1778
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:42.980
Or you treat me like you want me to be here.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
I mean,

1779
01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.240
well that's a good fight though.

1780
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:48.110
The John Fitch fight the good fight because striking wise obviously has,

1781
01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:51.560
he has a giant advantage,
but Fitch has been around a long time.

1782
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:55.970
He knows his shit and he's a fucking brutal wrestler and this is a fix his first

1783
01:35:55.971 --> 01:36:00.850
fight in Beltour.
Yeah,
yeah.
Just came over from profile league.
Yeah,

1784
01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.720
it was last.
Yeah.
Well,
there was it,

1785
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:05.830
what they're calling it world series back then.
Yeah.

1786
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:11.300
And Fitch fought Paul Horez and that was when Paul Harvey has got disqualified.

1787
01:36:11.301 --> 01:36:15.160
Right.
Lose the heel hook and he held on to,
yeah.
Yeah.

1788
01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:17.180
That was bad for a couple of fights in a row.

1789
01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:20.070
[inaudible] we'll do that man Harris.

1790
01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.550
I love when people call him Paul Harris like Paula,

1791
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:27.710
who's Paul Harris and well I didn't know he was good and I'm like,
okay.
Yeah,

1792
01:36:27.711 --> 01:36:31.970
he holds on to shit.
Yeah,
bad but refs like ripping a wall.
Yeah.

1793
01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:36.930
Well which is actually awesome.
It's Kinda crazy.
Terrible.
It's your knee.
Yeah,

1794
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.530
it's terrible if it's your knee,
but it's like awesome for fans.

1795
01:36:39.531 --> 01:36:40.370
But then the fans are like,

1796
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:45.260
half of them were ticked off having more pumped up like glocks.
Now you know,

1797
01:36:45.261 --> 01:36:46.940
you're really seen them in MMA.

1798
01:36:46.941 --> 01:36:49.400
You're seeing them a shit load of them in Jujitsu,

1799
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:50.870
professional submission matches.

1800
01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.760
You're seeing the leg lock game because of like the Donna,

1801
01:36:53.761 --> 01:36:57.770
her death squad and a lot of those guys just seeing it dominate competition.

1802
01:36:57.771 --> 01:37:01.040
I almost got my leg ripped off like a lot of things.

1803
01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:04.940
It'd be a lot different if I would've not,
if I would've tapped in in that fight,

1804
01:37:04.941 --> 01:37:08.270
that first fight against Marcy unhealed first round,
he's known more tournament,

1805
01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:09.470
phenomenal Jihad.

1806
01:37:09.610 --> 01:37:13.940
He had it so deep man and like sprained my hamstring a little bit,

1807
01:37:13.941 --> 01:37:14.451
like pulled it,

1808
01:37:14.451 --> 01:37:19.430
popped it and then I had to fight three or four weeks later again.
Wow.
But man,

1809
01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.470
almost almost written any of that.
Do you train a lot of leg lock submissions?

1810
01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:28.340
Do train defense?
Like not a lot.
You know what to do in a situation like that.

1811
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:31.770
I mean I think there's a couple,
you know,
there's a,
there's a couple like um,

1812
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:34.690
basics,
you know,
if you get,
if you get into,

1813
01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.480
he'll hook roll with it or if you get caught in a knee bar,
pop the legs open,

1814
01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:40.030
the open.
Um,

1815
01:37:40.210 --> 01:37:44.120
but do you work with like high level leg lock eyes now to really understand the

1816
01:37:44.121 --> 01:37:46.910
whole chain of events that happens?
No,
not,
I mean,

1817
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:49.580
it's hard to find good leg lock guys.
I mean it's,
it's,

1818
01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:52.340
it's almost like throwing elbows and knees and practice a guys.

1819
01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:56.040
Guys don't throw them or practice them as much because it's,
it's hard

1820
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.010
<v 1>to practice them without putting people in really bad danger.
You know,</v>

1821
01:37:59.011 --> 01:37:59.491
you were asking,

1822
01:37:59.491 --> 01:38:03.090
you accidentally hit someone with an elbow cause you were simulating it.

1823
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:05.430
You catch an eyebrow and it's over.
Right?
They've got 12 stitches.

1824
01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.160
Same thing with leg locks.
I mean people will get it.

1825
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:11.370
I actually got caught in a leg lock by Mario Sperry,
this last training camp.

1826
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:14.970
Now that I think about it,
Mario Sperry's still rolling.
Still Rolling man.

1827
01:38:14.971 --> 01:38:18.390
He's like,
you Gella come here.
And how old is z now?

1828
01:38:18.970 --> 01:38:22.830
Mario gotta be 15 he's the man,
man.
He's,
he's awesome.
Really,
really nice guy.

1829
01:38:22.831 --> 01:38:27.000
I deal veteran man.
A real pioneer.
Jujitsu and MMA.
Yeah,
we were,

1830
01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:28.080
it was a wrestling day.

1831
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:30.510
It was a wrestling day and we went to the ground and we just kept going.

1832
01:38:30.511 --> 01:38:32.970
I had wrestling shoes on.
He caught me in it.
I was like,

1833
01:38:32.971 --> 01:38:35.820
what can I give the old tap real quick?
Cause I'm like,
man,

1834
01:38:35.821 --> 01:38:39.090
you get wrestling with wrestling shoes on.
It is no joke.

1835
01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:42.270
You Ain't getting out and nothing.
So it's like,
Yep.
Got me.
Yeah.
Thanks coach.

1836
01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:47.460
Let's go again.
Yeah.
The whole leg lock game has evolved.

1837
01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.020
It's scary men cause that's especially like he'll,
I'm not a heel hook,

1838
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:56.610
but when they take the,
the ankle,
like just like bend it.
Right.

1839
01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:59.470
We know what it's calling Dennis did this week.
So that's what happened to me.

1840
01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.950
There you go.
I got caught in a knee bar,

1841
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:04.880
got out of the knee bar and then he switched to the toehold.
Felt my ankle pop,

1842
01:39:04.881 --> 01:39:07.050
pop,
pop.
And then just what,
um,

1843
01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.130
what inspired you to talk a bunch of shit about Dylan Dennis after his

1844
01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.620
disappointments?
I don't know.
I don't think he looked very good.

1845
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:16.260
I think if you don't think it's Jujitsu look good.
Oh he knows.
All right.

1846
01:39:16.261 --> 01:39:19.790
I mean he,
he was,
he,
you know,
he went there and I sold transition,
grabbed,

1847
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.371
grabbed the leg.

1848
01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:23.480
But I mean he looked like a fish out of water on the feet of which of course he,

1849
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:26.550
he shoots again a fine when they fight.
But I think it's,
I mean,

1850
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:31.620
do I respect what the wind,
do I respect what he's done.
And Him and baby Bjj.

1851
01:39:31.621 --> 01:39:34.380
That's cool.
But it's not mixed martial arts and it's just,

1852
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.470
it's funny how much he's getting called out for being literally just,
uh,

1853
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:38.400
you know,

1854
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.700
I want to be Connor with all the same thing saying the exactly the same exact

1855
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:46.400
style.
He realizes how good it gets you paid.
Exactly.
You know,
he's,

1856
01:39:46.401 --> 01:39:48.090
he's doing a good job with it,
but he also said he's,

1857
01:39:48.091 --> 01:39:50.600
he's the highest paid fighter in Beltour.
I mean,

1858
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:53.740
just all kinds of like silly stuff,
you know,
it's just like,
dude,

1859
01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:58.170
is that what he said?
No.
So he's chill son in a little bit.
He's a dark man.

1860
01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:01.460
Just huge door.
Okay,
so you just like one of those things where it's like,
well,

1861
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.690
when the guy's making his debut and you are a world champion or a former world

1862
01:40:06.691 --> 01:40:10.740
champion at this point,
what,
what inspires you to call a guy like that out?

1863
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:14.520
Just because I mean it,
doesn't it help him?
Yeah,
I guess.
I guess it does,

1864
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:17.850
but it also,
I mean I also woke up to 150 mentions on Twitter.

1865
01:40:17.851 --> 01:40:20.370
So it's like well at least people are talking,
you know,
at least people that,

1866
01:40:20.371 --> 01:40:22.560
you know,
people are talking.
I mean that's the other thing too is,

1867
01:40:22.561 --> 01:40:24.050
is always navigating the,

1868
01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:28.340
the narrative and talking about getting people to talk.
Yeah.

1869
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:31.230
Getting people to talk about,
I mean over the last couple of months,

1870
01:40:31.231 --> 01:40:33.900
the amount of times like our students could be before the amount of people that

1871
01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:35.490
were just talking like,
hey,

1872
01:40:35.491 --> 01:40:37.410
you're the only guy that can match Khabib's wrestling.

1873
01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:39.130
You're the only guy that could notify as wrestling.

1874
01:40:39.131 --> 01:40:42.480
I mean to get yourself in the conversation.
That's what it all is.

1875
01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:45.640
It's all well style's definitely make fights.
And that was what,

1876
01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:48.000
what became very interesting,
uh,

1877
01:40:48.001 --> 01:40:51.030
after the outlier Quinta fight where people were looking at,
okay,

1878
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:54.370
what about high level wrestlers who have more refined

1879
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:56.410
<v 2>striking.
Yeah.
And how do they line up?</v>

1880
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:58.780
And Kevin Lee was a big one that people kept talking about.

1881
01:40:58.781 --> 01:41:01.080
But you are a big one that people kept talking about too.
Yeah.

1882
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:06.390
Cause you were saying that you think you could beat him 100% and him having that

1883
01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:10.630
fight with,
I acquaint to who he was a prohibitive favorite over,

1884
01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:13.630
but it went the full five rounds.
And you know,
I Quinta,

1885
01:41:13.631 --> 01:41:17.470
although never wanna round showed some chinks in the armor.

1886
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:18.730
So shakes in the armor showed,

1887
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:22.720
it showed what happens when Khabib can't take you down.
I mean it's,

1888
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:26.950
it's tough whenever the one thing that you've always been used to dominating

1889
01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:28.870
with isn't working and then you're stuck.

1890
01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:33.050
You're stuck throwing punches and you're,
you're,
and you know,
you know,
he,

1891
01:41:33.051 --> 01:41:36.640
he just,
he's a,
he's a little bit behind in the striking aspect.
Dude,

1892
01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.130
I've got a ton of respect for the guy.
Mauler I mean,

1893
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:42.250
at certain times he looks unbeatable.

1894
01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:45.790
He has looked unbeatable where I've looked at it and other people have looked at

1895
01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:47.620
it and people that have fought him,

1896
01:41:47.621 --> 01:41:49.780
that have talked that I've talked to Barboza fight.

1897
01:41:50.210 --> 01:41:54.250
He just fucking mauled Barboza and it's,
and it's just a,
it's a battle of wills,

1898
01:41:54.251 --> 01:41:56.830
man.
You're inside of a cage and it's just like we talked about,

1899
01:41:57.010 --> 01:42:00.310
I knew I could outpace people.
I knew I could out out cardio.

1900
01:42:00.311 --> 01:42:02.280
Then I cut out tough them,
you know,

1901
01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.290
certain people get to that breaking point and they break and they can see it and

1902
01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:08.860
they go into their shell and they say,
I did a good job,
but this one's on him.

1903
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.240
This is guys who don't have that deep,
deep wrestling background.

1904
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.490
And they face a guy who does.

1905
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:19.930
There's moments in the fight where you see that where you saw that thousand yard

1906
01:42:19.931 --> 01:42:24.460
stare and Barboza his eyes were,
he was like,
fuck,
like I can't keep doing this.

1907
01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:27.320
Like he's,
he goes into defensive survival mode.
Yeah.

1908
01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:32.580
And you know when a guy does have a deep background in wrestling and also can

1909
01:42:33.601 --> 01:42:35.530
strike,
that's what makes it interesting.

1910
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.630
And this is why MMA is such a complex sport because there's so many variables.

1911
01:42:40.631 --> 01:42:42.070
There's so many techniques you can use.

1912
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:45.730
There's so many situations where you might have an advantage or your opponent

1913
01:42:45.731 --> 01:42:50.730
might have an advantage.
And it's just,
we live for these matchups,

1914
01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:52.330
these stylistic matchups.

1915
01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:57.360
So when something like that happens and a guy like could be B has a fight where

1916
01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:59.140
all these questions get presented,

1917
01:42:59.170 --> 01:43:02.740
that's where a guy like Michael Chandler comes into the mix.
Yeah.
Well,

1918
01:43:02.741 --> 01:43:07.450
and I love like after that fight to,
uh,
cause I said something,
I posted a video.

1919
01:43:07.451 --> 01:43:12.370
Do you see the video?
Me scrambling with Kamara crazy.
Yeah.
That was awesome.

1920
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:14.860
And I said,
if,
if a,
if all he has his wrestling,
how do you beat a man?

1921
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:18.930
Can't be taken down,
you know?
And,
and I got so many messages from,
you know,

1922
01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.700
Russian guys that had just said it could be,
it could beep time,
you know,

1923
01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:26.020
of course,
you know,
and it's like,
um,
yeah,
I mean it's,
uh,

1924
01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.780
it's one of those things,
man,
where I mean,
that,
that fight with Eddie.
I mean,

1925
01:43:28.781 --> 01:43:32.710
the fight with could be,
it's a,
it's exciting.
Kumara who smart.

1926
01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.840
It's gotta be going fucking crazy right now,

1927
01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:37.930
seeing Colby Covington getting a shot,
the interim title,
he's like,

1928
01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:42.040
you mother fuckers.
Yeah,
I know.
Yeah.
He's,
he wants to fight that dude.
No,

1929
01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.750
I have no,
I wouldn't,
I mean that dude is,
I mean he is,
he's a specimen.

1930
01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:51.100
He's got wrestling.
He's got striking.
I mean you,
you watch him spar,

1931
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.030
you watch them hit mid

1932
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:54.950
<v 1>or you watch his composure and his confidence while he's sparring and do all</v>

1933
01:43:54.951 --> 01:43:58.400
that kind of stuff.
You'd think he's been striking since he was 11 years old.

1934
01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:02.670
You know,
he just started after,
after college,
you know.
Well he had his good,

1935
01:44:02.671 --> 01:44:06.720
tough fight with uh,
with um,
meek mill.
Yeah.

1936
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:09.020
Email Mika or whatever,
Emil Meek.
Um,

1937
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:13.790
but I think that a meal meek is extremely underrated.
Extremely under.
I mean,

1938
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:18.290
he's a fucking tough guy.
Very physically strong.
Very,
very strong.

1939
01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:22.910
I was,
I was even email make a couple of times.
I was like trying to mimic him,

1940
01:44:22.911 --> 01:44:25.490
but where are you in training camps?
But yeah,
we are at the same time and he's,

1941
01:44:25.491 --> 01:44:26.031
and he's done that.

1942
01:44:26.031 --> 01:44:28.850
Him and I train a ton together and it works out well for me because he's a

1943
01:44:28.851 --> 01:44:29.371
bigger guy.

1944
01:44:29.371 --> 01:44:32.780
I like to go with a little bit bigger guys so I can just continue to get

1945
01:44:32.781 --> 01:44:35.540
stronger and manipulate bodies that are bigger than mine,
you know?
Yeah.

1946
01:44:35.541 --> 01:44:38.240
And a lot of people were criticizing him for not being able to finish meek,

1947
01:44:38.241 --> 01:44:41.730
but I'm like,
you're,
you're crazy.
Yeah.
That is a fucking animal.
It's,
it's,

1948
01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:45.860
it's nuts.
The amount of people you know,
armchair quarterbacks that are,

1949
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:47.780
that are literally out there think saying,

1950
01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:50.630
you should've finished this guy when you're all professional,

1951
01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.030
like professional fighters training day in and day out.

1952
01:44:53.031 --> 01:44:56.030
It's not easy to finish a guy sometimes.
We'll see how I was saying.

1953
01:44:56.031 --> 01:44:59.910
You got to stay the fuck away from,
you wouldn't mention,
yeah.
Yeah.
He's like,
man,

1954
01:44:59.911 --> 01:45:03.110
it just blows it.
Oh my goodness.
Especially for a guy like you,

1955
01:45:03.111 --> 01:45:05.380
if you do have something like an ankle injury like that,

1956
01:45:05.381 --> 01:45:09.650
that one fight and then you got to stay offline for a few weeks for sure.
I mean,

1957
01:45:09.651 --> 01:45:11.840
I still get it to this day.
Well,
how are you training?

1958
01:45:11.841 --> 01:45:15.380
Are you working on your rubber ankles?
Are couple other fuckers.

1959
01:45:15.381 --> 01:45:19.190
They know your soft spot is man.
I looked at my uncle said,

1960
01:45:19.191 --> 01:45:21.680
man that is a well enabled ankle and ready to kick somebody in the head with it.

1961
01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:26.750
So you didn't suffer any ill effects of it once it,
the nerves came back.

1962
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:29.960
Now once I came back,
I mean I've,
I've done a lot of rehabbing and I think,

1963
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.350
I think my legs or my,
my feet in general have,

1964
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:37.040
it's something that I've continued to work on.
I mean you got to look at each,

1965
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:42.030
each individual joint from hands,
wrists,
elbows and knees to ankles.
I mean,

1966
01:45:42.190 --> 01:45:45.950
and all of my strength and conditioning work,
a lot of it is very,
very hard.
Very,

1967
01:45:45.951 --> 01:45:47.240
very tough,
very,
very violent.

1968
01:45:47.241 --> 01:45:50.210
And then some of some of my stuff is stability stuff,
core stability stuff,

1969
01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.010
hip flexibility,
hip,

1970
01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:56.060
hip strengthening stuff because that's where the all your power and all that

1971
01:45:56.061 --> 01:45:59.560
kinds of stuff in a yoga at all.
Um,
I do yoga.
I,
I've done,

1972
01:45:59.570 --> 01:46:03.590
I've done hot yoga in the past and we just opened up my gym in Nashville has a

1973
01:46:03.591 --> 01:46:06.770
900 square foot yoga studio that actually opened up this morning at six at him.

1974
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:11.750
Oh,
so they go what a great yeah.
So I'm gonna show up and just show up and uh,

1975
01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.880
work on that core stability.
And is that a hot yoga place or regular yoga?

1976
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:20.900
Regular Yoga temperature to keep the room.
Um,
it'll be right around that 80.

1977
01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.960
That's fine.
Yeah.
I mean people,
we had that hot shit.

1978
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:27.290
Yeah we had training the other day and we had about 12 people in there were

1979
01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:28.880
shooting some content and had some training and,

1980
01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:31.160
and we had to bring towels back there because people were coming out and they're

1981
01:46:31.161 --> 01:46:33.710
like,
hey,
you got any towels?
Cause if people were sweating our butts off,
so,

1982
01:46:34.090 --> 01:46:37.310
and I think we're going to get some cool infrared panels to hang on the ceiling.

1983
01:46:37.311 --> 01:46:41.780
That could kind of add the add a little bit of heat to where it's not hot yoga,

1984
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:44.360
but it's definitely warm enough when you're going through your flows,
your,

1985
01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:46.640
you're definitely opening up the muscles in your opening,
you know,

1986
01:46:46.641 --> 01:46:50.170
getting that sweat out.
So,
um,
so how often

1987
01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:54.420
<v 2>do you work on your flexibility?
Do you work on stretching and I bro,</v>

1988
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:59.280
I'm on my roller every day,
so I mean,
I believe in Roller Roller Lacrosse ball.

1989
01:46:59.281 --> 01:47:02.070
I just found this really cool cross balls or awesome cross ball.
Yeah.

1990
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:05.610
Have you used those?
Uh,
do we have one in here,
Jamie?
No,
those uh,

1991
01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.700
mobility wads from rogue.
I need,

1992
01:47:08.890 --> 01:47:12.080
I need to call those the blue.

1993
01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:17.370
But was he called it star something star?
Uh,
uh,
fuck.

1994
01:47:17.371 --> 01:47:20.050
Does he call it?
I thought it was a wad.
The Blue Ones?
Yeah.

1995
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:24.210
Well why does it work out of the day?
Yeah.
Super.
Nova Supernova.
Yeah.

1996
01:47:24.211 --> 01:47:28.530
Wad supernova.
That's what he kept flat at the bottom and the,
no,
it's all right.

1997
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.390
We got one out there.
I'll show it to you after the thing.

1998
01:47:30.391 --> 01:47:33.480
But it's about the site about a little bit bigger than a softball,

1999
01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:36.530
but it's got all these little knobs on it.
It's hard.
It's track.

2000
01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:37.560
Here it is right there.

2001
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:42.450
I love that God damn thing built over 2.0 that seems like the smaller one,

2002
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:47.220
right is two of them.
He has a Kelly Start and yeah,
there you go.

2003
01:47:47.490 --> 01:47:49.620
You have a small one or a large one I whatever.

2004
01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:52.710
For whatever reason I think I prefer the larger one.
My,

2005
01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.940
my soft tissue guy down in Florida has one of those things that you show me

2006
01:47:56.950 --> 01:48:00.120
again.
Did I shut this thing called a so right look up to,
so right.

2007
01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.640
PSL that P.
S.
O.
R.
I.
T.
E.
I love you know what to sell as is.
Yes.

2008
01:48:05.641 --> 01:48:08.730
Here.
I mean that's always been one of my big,
one of my big things.

2009
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:13.110
You literally lay on that thing and if you know what it feels like to get your

2010
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:14.850
your,
so as worked on,

2011
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.080
you just kind of wobbled and wiggle until it hits it and then you can lift your

2012
01:48:19.081 --> 01:48:23.200
legs.
This guy does all kinds of videos where he's hitting.

2013
01:48:23.210 --> 01:48:25.830
And so as he hits the,
he gets the glutes,
he hits the quads,

2014
01:48:25.831 --> 01:48:27.420
he hits the literally everything.
And he's got the,

2015
01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:31.840
so as many southern plane on that,
the last couple of months,
um,

2016
01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.780
David Goggins was saying that his,

2017
01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:38.020
the tightness in his psoas muscles was like crippling is running.
It's d.
It's,

2018
01:48:38.021 --> 01:48:40.520
it's literally the,
in my,
uh,

2019
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:44.160
like you ever see people with the wrestler back where their butts out and it

2020
01:48:44.161 --> 01:48:47.940
takes you a second to stand up.
That's all.
So as pulling everything down,

2021
01:48:47.941 --> 01:48:51.780
being bent over or throwing,
throwing kicks,
I mean,
for whatever reason,

2022
01:48:51.781 --> 01:48:54.000
I've had horrible,
horrible problems with my,
so as,

2023
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:59.030
and every single kind of chink in my armor has gone back to the PSOAS muscles.

2024
01:48:59.041 --> 01:49:03.750
The so as which is connected to the,
to the spine,
down to the ILIAC crest,

2025
01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:05.340
I believe.
And then there's something called the Elio.

2026
01:49:05.341 --> 01:49:08.190
So as where the Iliacus and the PSOAS are connected,
that Jamie,

2027
01:49:09.150 --> 01:49:12.390
this is a peck thing that he do,
it does what it too.
So it's not just the,

2028
01:49:12.391 --> 01:49:16.970
so as muscle squeezes it to loosen up your packs and man,
it's,

2029
01:49:16.971 --> 01:49:19.470
it's incredible how much that relieves.

2030
01:49:19.530 --> 01:49:23.400
Like sometimes I get like some hip tightness,
tightness,
and I'll,
uh,

2031
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:27.150
get that supernova out and I'll roll on that fucker.

2032
01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.970
I know over my hips and my know or else it just,

2033
01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:33.300
he pounds every single day and gets worse and worse and worse.
And,
and,

2034
01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:37.380
and also too,
just lengthening everything.
Yup.
Your,
your diaphragm.

2035
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:40.320
All of that just continues to get crunched and crunched and crunched and you

2036
01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:43.010
can't breathe.
You know,
look at him.
He's having a good time over there and he's,

2037
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:46.820
it's a wall.
He's got a,
he,
I mean,
he only had his whole body with,

2038
01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.980
he actually has the exact

2039
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.670
<v 1>same thing in a mini.
It's like literally like only three inches long and heal.</v>

2040
01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.800
This is a feels underscore PSO,

2041
01:49:53.801 --> 01:49:58.630
underscore good lol.
That's on Instagram.

2042
01:49:58.650 --> 01:50:01.210
Yeah.
Um,
so what is your diet like?

2043
01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:04.480
Diet man embraced the monotony.
That's what,

2044
01:50:04.481 --> 01:50:08.980
that's what my hazmat and chicken and Broccoli,
I got a mega fit meals.
Um,

2045
01:50:09.010 --> 01:50:12.490
and that's,
and that's what I,
I make my own meals throughout all training camp.

2046
01:50:12.491 --> 01:50:16.360
When it's chicken and Broccoli,
or it's beef and Broccoli,
or it's chick peas,

2047
01:50:16.361 --> 01:50:20.170
Broccoli.
I love Broccoli.
I mean,
I don't love,
I don't love Broccoli.
Actually.

2048
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:21.610
I do love it Broccoli.

2049
01:50:21.611 --> 01:50:24.550
But I love the fact that a couple of weeks after I look in the mirror and say,

2050
01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:27.550
Dang man,
I'm getting down.
Fans are starting to pop out.
I mean,
that's,

2051
01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.360
and that's one of the biggest problems with people's fitness journeys.

2052
01:50:31.361 --> 01:50:32.830
They focus on the weight on the scale.

2053
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:35.050
Are they focused or not seeing the results that they want to see?

2054
01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:37.510
But you just got to,
the problem is the w the,

2055
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:40.690
the work that you put in this week and next week,

2056
01:50:40.691 --> 01:50:43.410
you're not going to see for two or three weeks.
You know,
that,

2057
01:50:43.411 --> 01:50:47.770
that delayed gratification.
But I mean,
I get my meals,
it's six ounces of chicken,

2058
01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.580
a cup of Broccoli,
um,
two or three times a day,

2059
01:50:52.150 --> 01:50:53.740
or I go beef and Broccoli.

2060
01:50:53.741 --> 01:50:57.850
Or now do you supplement it as essential fatty acids are?
Yeah,
I take,

2061
01:50:57.851 --> 01:51:02.410
I take flaxseed oil or uh,
I take fish oil officials,
it shows in the morning.

2062
01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:07.000
Um,
and then,
yeah,
I mean I,
I mean when it comes to supplementation,

2063
01:51:07.001 --> 01:51:09.850
I do protein and Aminos every single day.
That's been,

2064
01:51:09.851 --> 01:51:13.330
that's been my biggest thing.
I mean,
did you branch chains Aminos after exercise?

2065
01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:17.770
Diamond ties and is 50 50 blend?
They have the,
it's like a two one,
one two,

2066
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:22.480
two of the losing two of the Leucine,
one of the veiling,
one of the ISO,

2067
01:51:22.481 --> 01:51:25.120
leucine.
How long did you take that right after training?
Um,

2068
01:51:25.121 --> 01:51:29.890
I usually drink one blender bottle,
one serving of it as I'm going into practice.

2069
01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.250
And then I'll have another one going into the next practice and I'll have a

2070
01:51:33.251 --> 01:51:36.910
protein shake after.
Maybe that's what you're throwing up.
No,
I don't throw up.

2071
01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:40.010
I don't,
I tried to get myself to throw up,
but I don't.
Um,

2072
01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:43.000
and I drink the diamond ties.
I still have 100 protein,
which is like,

2073
01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:44.500
it's the big,
it's,
it's,

2074
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:48.280
it's the cleanest and like almost lightest protein.

2075
01:51:48.370 --> 01:51:50.860
Know a lot is based on what is it a whey protein,

2076
01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.760
but it's a weight whey protein isolate.
Okay.

2077
01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:56.230
So something in the way it breaks down or you know,

2078
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:59.410
[inaudible] know exactly all the,
all the specifics of it.
But I mean,

2079
01:51:59.411 --> 01:52:00.490
when it comes to bodybuilding,

2080
01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:03.580
a lot of those bodybuilders use that because of the fact that it's isolated.

2081
01:52:03.970 --> 01:52:07.960
Right.
So,
um,
and what about multivitamins,

2082
01:52:07.961 --> 01:52:11.380
things along those lines?
I mean,
I,
I,
we,
we go,
uh,

2083
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:14.080
I do like an athletic nutrients,
which is basically just like a,

2084
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:16.990
an extended version of a multivitamin.

2085
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:22.270
I have this daily detox one that I take that has a fish oils and a little bit of

2086
01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:26.500
Taurine,
a little bit of other stuff in it.
Um,
multivitamin,

2087
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:31.690
um,
tumeric,
honestly,
I mean with,
with grey amount of inflammation,

2088
01:52:31.691 --> 01:52:34.840
I have tried to do a lot of tumeric throughout the,
throughout training camps.

2089
01:52:34.841 --> 01:52:35.470
If I do,

2090
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:39.130
I try to stay away from the leaves and the Tylenols and that kind of stuff.

2091
01:52:39.131 --> 01:52:41.520
Unless I'm,
that's great in pain,
you know,

2092
01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:47.060
I want to try to get tumeric and drinking juices and that kind of stuff.
Tumeric,

2093
01:52:47.061 --> 01:52:51.420
ginger shots,
Cayenne pepper.
Did you do that every day?
I try to.
Yeah,
try to.

2094
01:52:51.421 --> 01:52:53.900
It's one of those things where it's like everyday but everyday loosely.

2095
01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:58.450
And I was like,
that sounds phenomenal.
I did this morning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And uh,

2096
01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.750
what about,
um,

2097
01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:04.780
do you do cryo or did get massages or sauna or anything like that?

2098
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:09.120
I do.
I do soft.
I tried to do a soft tissue massage or sports massage,
um,

2099
01:53:09.330 --> 01:53:13.280
kind of rolfing art almost every week.
I mean,
like I was saying,

2100
01:53:13.281 --> 01:53:16.540
I'm on my roller every single day before practice and that's,

2101
01:53:16.690 --> 01:53:19.130
that's when I really see,
you know,
like these,

2102
01:53:19.131 --> 01:53:23.840
these times after a fight when I'm not working out as much or I'm not,

2103
01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.030
you know,
not everything is on because you can't be on all the time.
You know,

2104
01:53:27.150 --> 01:53:30.320
everybody acts like they're on three 65 and 365 days a year,

2105
01:53:30.321 --> 01:53:34.130
but they're really not,
you know,
after a fight,
I kind of go less robot mode,

2106
01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.960
you know,
break my diet a little bit,

2107
01:53:35.961 --> 01:53:38.480
enjoy staying up late and joy and just doing whatever.

2108
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:41.570
And then that's when I really realized,
holy cow,

2109
01:53:41.571 --> 01:53:45.080
I've been on my roller in four days and that's why my back is hunched over and

2110
01:53:45.081 --> 01:53:48.040
stuff.
So you just get too busy and you just don't know what the time.
Yeah.

2111
01:53:48.110 --> 01:53:48.710
Give it in there.

2112
01:53:48.710 --> 01:53:52.700
So I'm hitting my roller and then I like to get a massage every single week.
Um,

2113
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:56.000
chiropractic often.
So yeah,

2114
01:53:56.001 --> 01:53:59.240
I saw something on Russian wrestlers where they were getting massage every day

2115
01:53:59.241 --> 01:54:03.630
after training and I was like,
wow.
Yeah,
I mean,
I,
I mean,
I do the roller everyday.

2116
01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:08.330
So I mean,
I imagine some sort of soft tissue work could be very,
I mean,
man,

2117
01:54:08.331 --> 01:54:12.230
we'd beat the crap out of our bodies,
you know,
nothing like it anywhere.
I mean,

2118
01:54:12.231 --> 01:54:13.910
other than football,
I guess.
I mean,

2119
01:54:13.911 --> 01:54:17.660
in terms of the amount of abuse your body takes,
the cons,
I mean,
you're,

2120
01:54:17.661 --> 01:54:22.610
you're basically in a sport where your desire is to break someone's body.

2121
01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:25.340
Yeah.
And,
and just the,
the little things,
man,

2122
01:54:25.341 --> 01:54:29.080
I was sparring with Nick lense two training camps ago and I threw it,

2123
01:54:29.081 --> 01:54:32.330
I threw a leg kick as he lifted his,

2124
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:36.840
his opposite leg up and literally just dead leg to me.
Like Charley Horse,

2125
01:54:36.841 --> 01:54:39.920
me with his knee.
It wasn't even supposed to happen.
He didn't mean to do it.

2126
01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:44.870
I didn't,
I was trying to throw the leg kick and I got the worst deep muscle,

2127
01:54:44.871 --> 01:54:47.480
like bone contusion in the middle of my,
like where,

2128
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:51.860
where your quads meat right between the muscles.
And I could not walk.

2129
01:54:51.861 --> 01:54:54.910
I fell right to the ground.
Practice was over,
you know,

2130
01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:57.470
this was like three weeks before the fight and I had to go see my,

2131
01:54:57.770 --> 01:55:01.250
my guy see Kay in Florida.
He just had to work the heck out of it,
man.
And that's,

2132
01:55:01.251 --> 01:55:03.430
I think that's one of the biggest things.
Um,

2133
01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:07.550
and I just talked to one of the guys at Marc pro about when we talk about

2134
01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:12.500
injuries,
we used to think rice,
you know,
rest,
uh Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

2135
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:15.250
Compression elevation and that kind of stuff is,

2136
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:19.400
there's some conflicting kind of knowledge on all that kind of stuff.

2137
01:55:19.401 --> 01:55:22.900
Whereas instead of resting it,
get in there right away and start moving it,

2138
01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:24.830
moving it and mobilizing it with certain things.

2139
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:28.370
Obviously got a broken leg and you need to get it set and get it,
get arrested.

2140
01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.630
But do you do cryotherapy at all?
I don't.
I mean,
I saw that a couple of times.

2141
01:55:32.631 --> 01:55:35.790
I've done it.
I've done that a couple of times.
I haven't done ice baths really.

2142
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:38.510
I mean,
a lot of times it's just,
you almost got to pick and choose.

2143
01:55:38.511 --> 01:55:42.170
There's only so many hours in the day too,
you know?
So it's like,
you know,

2144
01:55:42.171 --> 01:55:43.320
you're waking up and you got,

2145
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:45.780
you got only so much time before he go to practice and then,

2146
01:55:45.810 --> 01:55:48.720
then you only have so much time to recover before the next practice.
And it's,

2147
01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.000
and it's one of those things where I'm always getting a massage.

2148
01:55:51.001 --> 01:55:52.470
I'm always working on,
you know,

2149
01:55:52.471 --> 01:55:56.540
maybe I'm doing massage and chiropractic during one camp and you know,
it's,

2150
01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:58.950
it's almost like you got to pick and choose your battles.
If you know,

2151
01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:02.220
if you have an awesome man warehouse like this where everything's in one spot,

2152
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:03.480
I would do it all every day.

2153
01:56:03.481 --> 01:56:07.260
But if you're down in Florida and this is [inaudible] 45 minutes away and your

2154
01:56:07.261 --> 01:56:10.470
massage is 20 minutes the other direction and you're fighting Florida traffic,

2155
01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:14.430
you really got to pick and choose your,
your recovery methods.
You know,

2156
01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:17.070
right now your gym in Nashville,

2157
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:21.630
this is your gym and I was following you on social media where you're putting up

2158
01:56:21.631 --> 01:56:23.550
pictures,
you putting everything together.

2159
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:26.520
How satisfying is that been is awesome man.
I think,

2160
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.310
I think the satisfying now that it's open,

2161
01:56:29.311 --> 01:56:32.010
I mean obviously there's a lot of work that goes and tell people how they could

2162
01:56:32.011 --> 01:56:33.270
find out about it.
Where you go.

2163
01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:37.470
We are training Camp nashville.com and follow us on Instagram at training Camp

2164
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:39.730
Nashville.
Now that we're open.
I mean my,
my big thing is,
you know,

2165
01:56:39.731 --> 01:56:41.400
I'm very active on social media.
We want to,

2166
01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.960
we want to start doing a ton of video as a ton of,
um,
kind of cool,
same,

2167
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:49.590
similar workouts that like I do,
and pump out a bunch of information out there.

2168
01:56:49.591 --> 01:56:50.280
I mean,
my,

2169
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:53.880
my biggest thing is I wouldn't be where I am today without surrounding myself

2170
01:56:53.881 --> 01:56:56.880
with great people,
great coaches,
and be important too.
And I just wanted to,

2171
01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.410
I had this vision 17 years ago and I was like,
I told my dad,
I said,
dad,

2172
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:03.630
I want to open up a gym.
And he said,
well,
if you're gonna open up a gym,

2173
01:57:03.631 --> 01:57:04.950
I'm going to build it with my bare hands.

2174
01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:09.690
And my dad now just finished my gym with his bare hands,
so,
you know,

2175
01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:13.920
that's fucking cool.
So he,
uh,
yeah,
I mean,
every,
every screw,

2176
01:57:13.921 --> 01:57:18.150
every nail in that place was,
was put in by my father.
So it's,
it's cool.

2177
01:57:18.151 --> 01:57:22.020
And it was,
and it was when I was a,
you know,
15 years old or whatever.
Um,

2178
01:57:22.650 --> 01:57:25.620
very similar to my wife's vision of,
of adopting a child.

2179
01:57:25.621 --> 01:57:28.860
And like that came to fruition same exact year.

2180
01:57:28.861 --> 01:57:32.880
So it's like just these angels.
Yeah,
a lot of changes,
you know,
but I mean it's,

2181
01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.300
it's cool.
I wanted four walls and a roof where people can walk in and say,

2182
01:57:36.810 --> 01:57:39.660
you know,
they're,
they're looking for a change or they're looking to to eat.

2183
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:43.120
Whether it's get stronger,
get faster,
get you know,

2184
01:57:43.130 --> 01:57:46.260
lose that weight that they finally won had been putting off.
You know,

2185
01:57:46.261 --> 01:57:49.560
I wanted a place where people can say because of that guy or those people or

2186
01:57:49.561 --> 01:57:54.150
that coach,
I was able to enrich my life.
I was able to become a better person.

2187
01:57:54.151 --> 01:57:57.330
I was able to increase my self confidence or you know,

2188
01:57:57.450 --> 01:58:02.310
just so do you have actual life classes for like just general fitness classes

2189
01:58:02.311 --> 01:58:04.530
for martial arts,
beginner's classes?

2190
01:58:04.531 --> 01:58:07.110
Do you have like the full range and then also professional?
Yeah,

2191
01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:09.680
so I mean we have a lot of,
a lot of stuff going on.
I,

2192
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.160
I've almost been fighting a decade now.
I've been started out in Missouri,

2193
01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.510
went to the west coast,

2194
01:58:15.511 --> 01:58:18.030
now I'm turning it on the east coast and I've been to Canada.

2195
01:58:18.031 --> 01:58:19.860
I've been to numerous training camps in between.

2196
01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:22.020
And the gym is called training camp.

2197
01:58:22.110 --> 01:58:26.250
And the reason is because my life has always revolves around training camp,

2198
01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:26.731
you know,

2199
01:58:26.731 --> 01:58:30.180
and there's a difference between like we just talked about in training camp and

2200
01:58:30.181 --> 01:58:31.920
out of training camp.
Um,

2201
01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:35.520
how'd you settle on Nashville and my wife and I just loved the city.

2202
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:38.260
We're both fucking great city,
isn't it?
Great City.
Yeah,
we're both from A,

2203
01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:42.070
we're both from Missouri so it's closer to home where we grew.
Um,

2204
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.790
we were living in San Diego together and wanting to just move back closer to the

2205
01:58:45.791 --> 01:58:46.750
Midwest.
We'd love the city.

2206
01:58:46.751 --> 01:58:49.220
You have a bunch of friends in the music industry so we,
you know,

2207
01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.950
had some friends there already and visited and went to a couple of award shows

2208
01:58:53.951 --> 01:58:56.890
and said,
man,
this place is cool.
And it was just there a couple of weeks ago,

2209
01:58:57.350 --> 01:59:00.790
four or five weeks ago,
whenever it was.
I love it there.
It's a cool space.

2210
01:59:00.791 --> 01:59:04.120
It's an amazing city.
It really is.
From,
from top to bottom to Ama.
We,
I mean,

2211
01:59:04.121 --> 01:59:05.380
we met so many people and you know,

2212
01:59:05.381 --> 01:59:07.210
you kind of pride and ask questions and they just said,
man,

2213
01:59:07.211 --> 01:59:10.180
it's a great place to raise a family.
It's a great,
great school systems,
great.

2214
01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:14.460
You know,
the weather's is better than Missouri,
but it's,
you know,
it's,
you know,

2215
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:16.630
you get all four seasons,
it's a great place to raise a family.

2216
01:59:16.631 --> 01:59:18.970
And that's kind of what we knew we were about to start a family.

2217
01:59:18.971 --> 01:59:23.440
So we wanted to wanting to do that and uh,
love the city and now,

2218
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:26.710
and I saw an untapped him MMA market there too,
you know,
I mean,
there was,

2219
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:29.260
there was a couple of MMA gyms there,
but there was no,

2220
01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.780
there was no legitimate pro fighters that were there.
I mean,

2221
01:59:31.781 --> 01:59:35.820
Luke Sanders is from there in the UFC.
He went out to California.
Uh,

2222
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:38.500
Dustin Ortiz was there.
Both of those guys were born and raised there.

2223
01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:40.450
They both went other places.
I said,
you know what,

2224
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:44.140
I want to go to Nashville and I'm going to make it the premier place.

2225
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.280
Or my gym is going to be the premiere place to to do mixed martial arts training

2226
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:50.710
in Nashville.
And we're going to put Nashville on the,
on the map.

2227
01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:54.310
Now you're going to have wrestling classes,
kickboxing classes though,

2228
01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:57.100
the whole all of it.
So we have,
we have,
so back to that,

2229
01:59:57.101 --> 01:59:57.940
we have a lot of stuff going on.

2230
01:59:57.941 --> 02:00:01.780
We have 3000 square foot of just fitness area where it's rolled rubber flooring,

2231
02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:06.190
um,
turf plate loaded machine squat racks,
dumbbells group fitness area.

2232
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:09.430
Right next to that we have 3000 square foot of mat space where we're going to

2233
02:00:09.431 --> 02:00:13.240
have a youth wrestling club would that has four kind of for a half wall around

2234
02:00:13.241 --> 02:00:17.380
it.
We started youth wrestling club this week coupled with another 1500 or 3000

2235
02:00:17.381 --> 02:00:22.381
square foot of Matt's 1500 they're 1500 of of the Fuji Tatami Mats for boxing,

2236
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:25.750
kickboxing,
Bjj,
and they may,
all that kind of stuff.

2237
02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:27.970
And then that 900 square foot yoga studio.

2238
02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:32.060
Plus we have our recovery recovery area that we have a guy named Scott Dunaway

2239
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:35.810
at Kairos strengths.
He's a chiropractor,
art and corrective exercise guy.

2240
02:00:35.811 --> 02:00:38.680
Plus we're trying to bring in another massage therapist that's going to be there

2241
02:00:38.681 --> 02:00:39.341
three days a week.

2242
02:00:39.341 --> 02:00:42.100
And then I'm also going to talk to a Cryo guy as well who has uh,

2243
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:45.720
an extra tank that I'm going to try to set something up with.
I think it does.

2244
02:00:45.730 --> 02:00:49.090
So then when everything's under one roof then,
then when we were like,
Hey Joe,

2245
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:52.570
I've been doing cryo man,
cause it wasn't 45 minutes away,
you know?
Yeah.
What,

2246
02:00:52.571 --> 02:00:55.540
that is the thing,
right?
It's time management.
When you're in your training,

2247
02:00:55.541 --> 02:00:58.890
how many times a day and when you're in camp twice usually,
you know,

2248
02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:01.810
but then there's always,
there's always something to,
you know,

2249
02:01:01.811 --> 02:01:05.740
and then there's the media station media obligations or,
I mean just even,

2250
02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:09.370
even with your nutrition stuff,
it's like,
oh man,
got to go,
got to go get,

2251
02:01:09.371 --> 02:01:12.370
got to go make a whole foods around to get my almond milk and my Avocados.

2252
02:01:12.370 --> 02:01:16.150
Because I make my own breakfast,
but the rest of my stuff is in a mega fit meals,

2253
02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:18.210
uh,
containers,
you know?
Um,

2254
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:21.600
so there's always a grocery store to go to or there's always a media obligation

2255
02:01:21.601 --> 02:01:24.730
and there's always something and it's all time management.
You know,
I always,

2256
02:01:24.731 --> 02:01:27.520
I always,
it was always interesting when I heard some people like,
yeah,

2257
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:30.100
train 10 hours a day.
And I'm like,
really?

2258
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:33.600
How do you train 10 hours a day without your body falling apart?
You know?
Yeah.

2259
02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:36.190
People exaggerate a little bright.
And I'm like,
for sure.

2260
02:01:36.191 --> 02:01:38.950
I tried two hours in the morning balls to the wall and I trained two hours in

2261
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:40.220
day and at night balls

2262
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:45.080
<v 2>to the wall and I'm like,
okay,
pass out,
wake up,
do it all over again.</v>

2263
02:01:45.081 --> 02:01:48.800
Groundhog's day,
embrace them and not eat chicken,
broccoli,
eggs,
avocado.

2264
02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.280
Let's do it for eight weeks.
Make wait.
Well listen,
Michael,

2265
02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:56.150
I'm glad we finally got a chance to get together and have this conversation and

2266
02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:57.920
let people know what you're all about,
man.

2267
02:01:57.921 --> 02:02:01.070
And I'm a big fan and I really appreciate you coming in here.
And,
uh,

2268
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.610
I hope one day I can commentate one of your fights.
It won't be in belt or,
so.

2269
02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:08.900
Yeah.
That,
that will be great.
Well,
thank you.
I appreciate,
I really,

2270
02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:12.230
really appreciate it.
Absolutely.
Thank you,
Michael Chandler.
Ladies and gentlemen.
