1
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.110
<v Speaker 1>what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with Tovar surreally.</v>

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>He's got his pen and his notebook out</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's about to take notes.</v>

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>author of the mindful carnivore boy,</v>

7
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>you went to an unusual path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

8
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the reasons why I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really wanted to talk to you.</v>

9
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read some of your stuff and I've</v>

10
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>seen some interviews with you online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously a very intelligent,</v>

11
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>very thoughtful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started out a Vegan and became a</v>

12
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

13
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tricky path and it had to be a</v>

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 1>fraught with peril,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much grief did you take for that?</v>

16
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>First of all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>not as much as I kind of anticipate</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

18
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives you live in Vermont,</v>

19
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could be part of it,</v>

20
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get to you up there and it's,</v>

21
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's a funny blend.</v>

22
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>The cultures there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't become vegetarian until I was</v>

24
00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I spent basically 20 to 30 as</v>

25
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly Vegan that whole time.</v>

26
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>And so then in my early thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made this kind of bizarre transitioned</v>

27
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into being a hunter.</v>

28
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wondered how friends,</v>

29
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>not so much family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I had one uncle who,</v>

30
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>who was a hunter and was well respected</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

31
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.780
<v Speaker 1>but friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that going to be like?</v>

34
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>there were some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>some occasionally odd moments with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with friends or neighbors,</v>

37
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>but not as much as you might expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it that made you switch over?</v>

38
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Like what was there a moment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a realization?</v>

39
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Was it an accumulation of information?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was it?</v>

40
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the switch to being vegetarian had a lot</v>

41
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:53.731
<v Speaker 1>to do with ethics and animal welfare and</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and then it became other</v>

42
00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental,</v>

43
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:55.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>

44
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>The switchback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>the first step really was starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that my diet,</v>

46
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever I was eating was connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things that I didn't</v>

47
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>control of deer in soybean fields to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make tofu.</v>

49
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the control is a nice way.</v>

51
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gentle,</v>

52
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a gentle word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just the impact of agriculture on</v>

54
00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>the landscape as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk About Wildlife Habitat disappearing</v>

55
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:26.890
<v Speaker 1>in a hurry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the local organic farmer down</v>

57
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>the road where we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 1>go get organic strawberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>when there's enough crop damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls a friend and they shoot a deer</v>

60
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>or their smoke bomb in the woodchucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

61
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:45.611
<v Speaker 1>And so there are all kinds of impacts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I realized my diet was having,</v>

62
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>even though I wasn't eating animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>indirectly that didn't change my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just sort of soften these very</v>

64
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>black and white hard edges that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn in my,</v>

65
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>these ethical</v>

66
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

67
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 2>The shift to actually eating something</v>
<v Speaker 2>different had more to do with</v>

68
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.460
<v Speaker 2>nutritional needs in the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once I started eating some yogurt,</v>

69
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 2>which is a big radical step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've been Vegan for 10 years,</v>

70
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating a bowl of yogurt is a big deal.</v>

71
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Or if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 2>eggs and fish and chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I did that,</v>

73
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm going to go back to fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it did as a kid.</v>

74
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in a rural area,</v>

75
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the woods practically and I look</v>

76
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 2>around was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

77
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to get protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal protein,</v>

78
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>there's some of that running around here</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the woods and it's still part of the</v>

79
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>culture there where I live in Vermont,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 2>hunting is still alive as part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

81
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So it started to sort of sneak up on me</v>
<v Speaker 2>as his idea to,</v>

82
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>to get into hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

83
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

84
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 3>the eggs are an easy one because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to get hurt.</v>

85
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Like eating eggs is so easy if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially I have my own chicken,</v>

86
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 3>so it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey girls,</v>

87
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take the eggs.</v>

88
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 3>No one gets hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's fine.</v>

89
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to me to be the easiest and</v>

90
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 3>most ethical way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just want to get some animal</v>

91
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 3>protein in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one really is no one,</v>

92
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 3>no one's getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things I didn't,</v>

93
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so embarrassing,</v>

94
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was in my late thirties,</v>

95
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.751
<v Speaker 3>early forties when I found out that</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken eggs couldn't become a chicken</v>

96
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 3>because a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't fertilized by a rooster.</v>

97
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Like this is how stupid I was or more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more really removed from us.</v>

98
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Any farming or any idea of farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just a from my,</v>

99
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 3>in my stupid mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had this idea that,</v>

100
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 3>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a thing,</v>

101
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course there's still rooster and how,</v>

102
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are they laying eggs every day?</v>

103
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Like what the Hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't understand that part of it,</v>

104
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so easy to just get eggs from</v>

105
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 3>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

106
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're feeding the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken's exist off of so many different</v>

107
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cleaned your garden,</v>

108
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 3>they run around there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mostly bugs and grass and chicken</v>

109
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 3>in know healthy chicken food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you decide you're going to pull</v>

110
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 3>the trigger on a deer,</v>

111
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 2>things get real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a totally different experience.</v>

112
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.901
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's this one guy who's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy ethical Vegan who's walking</v>

113
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 2>around looking at the deer like hello</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>

114
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 2>And the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 2>you're elbows deep in that deer pulling</v>
<v Speaker 2>out its guts,</v>

116
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>hanging it up in a barn and taking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin off of it.</v>

117
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it took me a few years from when I</v>

118
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.620
<v Speaker 2>started hunting too and I was learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>through email to my uncle and reading</v>

119
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>articles and poking around in the woods</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a slow learning process</v>

120
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>and there aren't tons of deer running</v>
<v Speaker 2>around Vermont.</v>

121
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 2>There are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was not really,</v>

122
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back in the back in the sixties and</v>

123
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had all this young growth forest,</v>

124
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.144
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>

125
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 2>these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm fields that were coming back into</v>

126
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 2>forest and there were a ton of deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really rich habitat for deer.</v>

127
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a much more mature forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the numbers have,</v>

128
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 2>have really dropped down predators up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there where they have coyotes and bear.</v>

129
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing that is really a good Predator</v>

130
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.530
<v Speaker 2>on adult dear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

131
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.670
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to on but unsuccessful for</v>

132
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 2>several years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in retrospect,</v>

133
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad because I don't think I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was ready for that experience.</v>

134
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 2>So you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go hunting,</v>

135
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 2>but you weren't getting anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're trying to find the deer.</v>

136
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.780
<v Speaker 2>So it was more like some deer by hiking</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a backpack that has a gun in it.</v>

137
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

138
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I did a little bit of small game</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

139
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:48.191
<v Speaker 2>I took a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>a snowshoe Hare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too small,</v>

141
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a deer is a different experience.</v>

142
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

143
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something that big to,</v>

144
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

145
00:06:58.941 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 2>something that beautiful.</v>

146
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

147
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 2>they're stunning animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when it finally happened a few</v>

148
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 2>years in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a total shock.</v>

149
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 2>The actual experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I'd seen someone else with a</v>

150
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had just killed.</v>

151
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And I helped my uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doing it yourself,</v>

152
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 2>different games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did you prepare for this?</v>

153
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Did you take courses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you train yourself?</v>

154
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 2>How to shoot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you already know how to shoot?</v>

155
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I had shot a bit as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been around.</v>

156
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Firearms are up to you if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

157
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

158
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been around firearms a little bit as</v>

159
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 2>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never shot a deer rifle,</v>

160
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>centerfire rifle.</v>

161
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 2>So that was new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

162
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was learning from books,</v>

163
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 2>articles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my uncle,</v>

164
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 2>a lot of emails back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

165
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I was totally clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

166
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 2>about firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about deere,</v>

167
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:50.594
<v Speaker 2>about everything.</v>

168
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It was a starting from ground zero and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so slow.</v>

169
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 2>It was slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real commitment.</v>

170
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Like especially if you're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially by herself,</v>

171
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

172
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to decide to really get involved in</v>

173
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.150
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote gun culture and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what kind of round you need a</v>

174
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>rifle you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the best kind of rifle was the</v>

175
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 2>best way to pull the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

176
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>how do you keep yourself from jerking or</v>
<v Speaker 2>punching the trigger and you know,</v>

177
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of practice involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

178
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton to learn and I think</v>

179
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the interesting things</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what I call adult onset hunters.</v>

180
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Those of us who come to it later in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

181
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.270
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

182
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.180
<v Speaker 2>onset hunters that we don't know a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million things that those people who</v>

183
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>grew up doing it take for granted about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods,</v>

184
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 2>about firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all kinds of things.</v>

185
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.920
<v Speaker 2>And they forgot they even learned them</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they,</v>

186
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learned it when they were 10 or 15.</v>

187
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't know any of that.</v>

188
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>We've lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe</v>

189
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>we've spent some time in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we know something about fishing</v>

190
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know that whole world.</v>

191
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's a challenge without a mentor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

192
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 1>my uncle was really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

193
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but having a mentor is really key I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think for folks who come to it later in</v>

194
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It's so much so that I was thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be some way to start a</v>

196
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 1>program that teaches people the ethics</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

197
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

198
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to do because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about something that reasonably</v>

199
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:30.070
<v Speaker 1>should take a long time before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

200
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I think the way you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a long time before you actually</v>

201
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>shoot a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the way to go.</v>

202
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I got a crazy crash course from Steven</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rinella,</v>

203
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

204
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.010
<v Speaker 1>where I did his television show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot literally a couple times at a</v>

205
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>piece of paper and I'm not bullshitting.</v>

206
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 1>We set up a target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on like a,</v>

207
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 1>a patch of dirt and a shot a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times where he's explaining how you have</v>

208
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 1>to squeeze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't jerk it.</v>

209
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:56.790
<v Speaker 1>You have to squeeze and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then next thing you know,</v>

210
00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm shooting a deer like five days later</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it was.</v>

211
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 1>It was a very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it took me a while to sort of let</v>

212
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 1>all the information set in and then get</v>
<v Speaker 1>my skills up to like,</v>

213
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I pulled it off the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I easily could have fucked up.</v>

214
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I easily could a wounded animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

215
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't ready,</v>

216
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get someone,</v>

217
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>especially someone with a fulltime job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with a family obligations to get</v>

218
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>them somehow another set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a course that allows them</v>

219
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:27.290
<v Speaker 1>to learn how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

220
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's demand for it.</v>

221
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of states that are</v>

222
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like Wisconsin,</v>

223
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have really good programs,</v>

224
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>adult learn to hunt programs and they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it over the course of like six or nine</v>

225
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.260
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an intro workshop usually at</v>

226
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 1>the local food co op or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It recruit people there and then they</v>

227
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 1>end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

228
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>having these weekend sessions throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of the year.</v>

229
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And it culminates with a sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor at hunt on public land in,</v>

230
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Wisconsin or Minnesota or other</v>

231
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>states that have similar programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's enough demand that there are</v>

232
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>private courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>there's work we can workshops being</v>
<v Speaker 1>offered by folks I know not associated</v>

234
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>with the state program at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just teaching people because they didn't</v>

235
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a huge demand,</v>

236
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for hunting,</v>

237
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but people want these old skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>hands on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:23.721
<v Speaker 1>whether it's how to physically build</v>
<v Speaker 1>something out of wood or had a can your</v>

240
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>own food or how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 1>hunt and butcher a deer and there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in that sort of do it yourself.</v>

242
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote primitive or just basic</v>

243
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.590
<v Speaker 1>self-reliant skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not thinking about being</v>

245
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 1>a prepper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>

246
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not getting ready for the end</v>

247
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>

248
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating thing to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of yourself and learn how to</v>

249
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 1>get your own food from the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>wilderness.</v>

250
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or even or from the garden.</v>

251
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that hands on experience.</v>

252
00:11:52.121 --> 00:11:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I direct experience is really different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from seeking sitting in a cubicle,</v>

253
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 1>getting paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then going and buying food at the</v>

254
00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 1>grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

255
00:11:58.391 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

256
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 1>author Richard Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's written great books about deer and</v>

257
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

258
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.620
<v Speaker 1>he lives up in Alaska and he calls the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

259
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 1>the supermarket an agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an agent of our forgetfulness,</v>

260
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>and we forget where things come from if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't live on a farm,</v>

261
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't grow up doing that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

262
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an issue that a lot of</v>

263
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>people who have paid attention to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different videos that have been</v>

264
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>released from these factory farms that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are horrific and they try to figure out,</v>

265
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a way to get around this?</v>

266
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a way to get around</v>

267
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the most ethical way,</v>

268
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people think is if it's</v>

269
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 1>possible to hunt it yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're getting an animal that was</v>

270
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>never caged up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a wild animal.</v>

271
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And in one brief moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's life ends.</v>

272
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And realistically that life was probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>on its way out anyway.</v>

273
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 1>If you're shooting a mature deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shooting something that's six years</v>

274
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years old.</v>

275
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that deer live that long in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

276
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most wild animals are prey.</v>

277
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most prey animals and even most</v>

278
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 1>predators in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>die when they're pups basically.</v>

280
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mortality rate is incredibly high.</v>

281
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

282
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 1>even the mortality rate for bears is</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely high.</v>

283
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And the Predator of bears is bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a bear's kill half of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moose calves and um,</v>

285
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and deer Fonz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like half of them that get born get</v>

286
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 1>killed by bears or coyotes or wolves or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

287
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.360
<v Speaker 1>So to get something that's five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

288
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you essentially stepping in just before</v>

289
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>nature did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

290
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about all the</v>

291
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>ecology and biology of all these species</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak authoritatively on that side of</v>

292
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:45.550
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of it being an ethical</v>

293
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 1>alternative make sense to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

294
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it resonates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that I've interviewed who are</v>

295
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 1>adult onset hunter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

296
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 1>and from my own experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty common theme.</v>

297
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 1>There's an ethical drive involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's practical for a huge</v>

298
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 1>portion of the population to really do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a different,</v>

299
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical question.</v>

300
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

301
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:07.271
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>it's also not practical for the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States to feed every country in the</v>

303
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not practical for everyone to exist</v>

304
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:14.540
<v Speaker 1>off all the crops grown in England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not private.</v>

305
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

306
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that those things do exist,</v>

307
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:22.861
<v Speaker 1>but what you can do as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still today in the United States</v>

308
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 1>and still learn how to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>

309
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>and get all your food from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is still possible.</v>

310
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 1>It might not be possible for everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the country to do it,</v>

311
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in the country is not going to</v>

312
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>do in anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

313
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

314
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.440
<v Speaker 1>like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible to write a book?</v>

315
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

316
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Guess how few fucking people write</v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

317
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 1>You wrote a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people write books?</v>

318
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go all day without meeting</v>

319
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:45.030
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's ever written a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

320
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book that you wrote,</v>

321
00:14:47.411 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 1>the mindful carnivore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

322
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever even seen a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>written</v>

323
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.190
<v Speaker 2>by a guy who started off as a vegetarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a Vegan and was compelled to,</v>

324
00:14:58.851 --> 00:14:59.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to become a hunter.</v>

325
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems when I first got into the idea</v>

326
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 2>of writing a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seemed crazy and still in</v>

327
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:09.570
<v Speaker 2>retrospect seems kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

328
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 2>but when I started even writing a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>essays about that,</v>

329
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 2>about going from being a Vegan and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian to being a hunter,</v>

330
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what people are going to</v>

331
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.280
<v Speaker 2>make of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over time I've met more and more people</v>

332
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 2>who have actually had a pretty similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

333
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 2>other vegetarians who became hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>

334
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a logic to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were that concerned about</v>

335
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:41.591
<v Speaker 2>animals that you decided to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian or Vegan and then you changed</v>

336
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 2>your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are still a pretty serious issue</v>

337
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 2>for you unless you just abandoned your</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire philosophy and left out the door.</v>

338
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.540
<v Speaker 2>If you still have those basic values and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still take animal welfare and</v>

339
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.630
<v Speaker 2>environmental conservation and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of issues,</v>

340
00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then</v>

341
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a interest in engaging directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like confronting it,</v>

342
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just saying,</v>

343
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 2>oh well just go to the supermarket now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just buy some ground chuck.</v>

344
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for those of us who still have animal</v>

345
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:22.190
<v Speaker 2>ethics and welfare in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we make that transition out of</v>

346
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:24.020
<v Speaker 2>being vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

347
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.220
<v Speaker 2>there's a way to confront it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

348
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I know some folks who were vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young couple,</v>

349
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when their diet changed,</v>

350
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided they're going to raise it</v>

351
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:43.590
<v Speaker 2>on animals instead of hunt started</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising chickens and</v>

352
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 2>now they do it full time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chicken farmers,</v>

353
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.910
<v Speaker 2>chicken cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbits,</v>

354
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 2>they run a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a CSA community supported agriculture.</v>

355
00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.380
<v Speaker 2>They supply meat to these two x</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegetarians,</v>

356
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 2>supply meat to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 2>whole area up where we live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

358
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.360
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to confront it directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

359
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same kind of thing.</v>

360
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to do this,</v>

361
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do it ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you say your diet changed,</v>

362
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:17.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it used to be spraying and now it's</v>

363
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:18.690
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now mean what does,</v>

364
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean you're diet changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why did you die change?</v>

365
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 2>What was the reason?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

366
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me it was that my health was</v>
<v Speaker 2>iffy.</v>

367
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.613
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in,</v>

368
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on death's door,</v>

369
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.400
<v Speaker 2>but my immune system was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed and that sort of thing.</v>

370
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.990
<v Speaker 2>And several people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including my wife and my doctor said,</v>

371
00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is part of the picture,</v>

372
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about your diet and start adding</v>

373
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:49.290
<v Speaker 2>some other things in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I started to add in some</v>

374
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yogurt,</v>

375
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>some local chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing,</v>

376
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 1>it did change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>

377
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 1>So for me it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a nutrition issue.</v>

378
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 1>But is it possible that you just weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing veganism correctly?</v>

379
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.880
<v Speaker 1>That's always the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

380
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.710
<v Speaker 1>that's always the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

381
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 1>could I have done some things</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently?</v>

382
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you,</v>

383
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.800
<v Speaker 1>will you eating for your protein?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

384
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was eating plenty of what they used to</v>

385
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:14.660
<v Speaker 1>call sort of mixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know rice and beans and veggies and</v>

387
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.570
<v Speaker 1>fruit and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even on very strict Vegan websites,</v>

388
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you need to take b12 something right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

390
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 1>There's things that are really hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get if you're not eating any animal.</v>

391
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people deny that.</v>

392
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a really fascinating conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had with a friend of mine who's a</v>

393
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Vegan who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

394
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you really need very little b12 and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get plenty of b 12 from your diet.</v>

395
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:43.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

396
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:45.660
<v Speaker 1>that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's controversial.</v>

397
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Like for you to be real confident about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

398
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that's necessarily correct</v>

399
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 1>because I've seen both really strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements on both sides.</v>

400
00:18:54.121 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Really strong statements that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely can't get it from your diet</v>

401
00:18:56.791 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 1>and really strong statements that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can and I don't know who to believe.</v>

402
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm known nutrition expert</v>

403
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's primarily from animals though,</v>

404
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 1>be 12 correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I understand,</v>

405
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean flax seeds and there are ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you can get it,</v>

406
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but whether it's that easy to assimilate</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your body and actually use,</v>

407
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on the source and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

408
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It traditionally,</v>

409
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 1>as I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between a Vegan diet and the vegetarian</v>

410
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating some eggs or reading</v>

411
00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some dairy,</v>

412
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a different ballgame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have cultures and traditions of</v>

413
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.460
<v Speaker 1>vegetarianism around the world that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained themselves.</v>

414
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know of any communities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures or traditions around the world</v>

415
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 1>where they've been Vegan for generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>after generation.</v>

416
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it exists.</v>

417
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it possible though that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires more education,</v>

418
00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 1>more understanding about what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutritional requirements are like as far</v>

419
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:54.840
<v Speaker 1>as like mixing your proteins and making</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

420
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 1>cause we had some guys on from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary cowspiracy and we talked</v>

421
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really wish I'd read a little bit</v>

422
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:03.810
<v Speaker 1>more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arguments against what they were</v>

423
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:08.340
<v Speaker 1>saying before I had him on because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we talked about is</v>

424
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:12.570
<v Speaker 1>like complete proteins and a complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>amino acid profiles.</v>

425
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 1>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very few complete proteins and</v>

426
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.350
<v Speaker 1>plant form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very few.</v>

427
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you're getting like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to get all your protein</v>

428
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 1>from Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

429
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 1>you've got to eat like pounds of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in order to like,</v>

430
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and so I don't think it's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things it becomes with a lot of people,</v>

431
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.420
<v Speaker 1>it becomes almost like you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their deity.</v>

432
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.590
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a religious argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to be objective</v>

433
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 1>about it in any one exception to that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich roll rituals,</v>

434
00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>very objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

435
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a another name.</v>

436
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.180
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance athlete,</v>

437
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good guy and has a great podcast</v>

438
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and he's been a guest on the podcast a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of times here.</v>

439
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Really cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>

440
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 1>he's very non dogmatic and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

441
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 1>not a judgemental guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

442
00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 1>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

443
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 1>he's not preaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

444
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.280
<v Speaker 1>but for a lot of them they just don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to admit the difficulty in getting</v>

445
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 1>complete sources of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

446
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.140
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a few Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilders.</v>

447
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are hilarious.</v>

448
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.980
<v Speaker 1>You find out they're doing steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Dick Dickhead.</v>

449
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

450
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like Vegan bodybuilding is,</v>

451
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 1>it's is fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking infested with people that</v>

452
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 1>are doing steroids that aren't being</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest about it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that are getting gigantic that or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>meanwhile they've got fucking synthetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>

457
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made with yams.</v>

458
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Speaker 1>You can make synthetic testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't Mexican wild yams.</v>

459
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a way,</v>

460
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just hilarious.</v>

461

<v Speaker 1>fucking scientists have made your body</v>

<v Speaker 1>Scientists in a weight room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

464
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.241
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 1>that's neither here nor there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>

466
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 1>for some people it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very difficult if you're,</v>

467
00:22:02.531 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be Vegan to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything your body requires.</v>

468
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who travis barker is the</v>

469
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 1>drummer from blink one eight two really</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool guy,</v>

470
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.780
<v Speaker 1>got in a plane crash and a was burned</v>
<v Speaker 1>really badly.</v>

471
00:22:14.781 --> 00:22:17.400
<v Speaker 1>He had a bunch of skin graphs and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

472
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't taking until he ditched his</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan Diet.</v>

473
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Who's having a real hard time healing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hear things like that.</v>

474
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:25.151
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

475
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because how come some people can tell me</v>

476
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.660
<v Speaker 1>that they're doing so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they heal quicker,</v>

477
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:35.110
<v Speaker 1>they recover quicker on a Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel better on a Vegan Diet.</v>

478
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And then other people are telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 1>it's just their body just wasn't healing</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

480
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Their immune system was floundering like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

481
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of it is probably that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

482
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.770
<v Speaker 1>our bodies are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have somewhat,</v>

483
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're the same species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have basic profile,</v>

484
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but we have all kinds of end of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>science progressed is looking at,</v>

485
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our microflora inside our bodies.</v>

486
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're all really different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it may be that we processed and need</v>

487
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 1>things in different ways and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many people,</v>

488
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real change in over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

489
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 1>So in a short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been eating a really crappy</v>

490
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:19.711
<v Speaker 1>diet full of tons of fried food and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start eating a whole foods vegan</v>

491
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:22.750
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lo and behold,</v>

492
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

493
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Because you're suddenly eating in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

494
00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:26.950
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaner food.</v>

495
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after 10,</v>

496
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:34.891
<v Speaker 1>20 years for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are depletions and</v>

497
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:39.480
<v Speaker 1>consequences in the body of being strict</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan for all,</v>

498
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that long period of time.</v>

499
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Did you attempt to talk to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutritionist and find out like are there</v>

500
00:23:44.501 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 1>any foods that I should like keen</v>

501
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 3>war things on hemp protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I need to mix in that or</v>

502
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.590
<v Speaker 2>pleat proteins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really,</v>

503
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by that point because my,</v>

504
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.470
<v Speaker 2>those sort of black and white lines I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had drawn,</v>

505
00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:03.780
<v Speaker 2>it was really rigid ethical ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of deity concept that I had in</v>

506
00:24:03.781 --> 00:24:08.781
<v Speaker 2>a way and it's attachment to my identity</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had started to blur and loosened</v>

507
00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:10.321
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

508
00:24:10.321 --> 00:24:13.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in this world,</v>

509
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:18.840
<v Speaker 2>not in some fantasy world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live here and even the local farmer</v>

510
00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:22.800
<v Speaker 2>who grows our strawberries is smoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming woodchucks and shooting deer and</v>

511
00:24:22.801 --> 00:24:27.300
<v Speaker 2>he's eating venison and like I'm part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this interconnected system,</v>

512
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this natural community of all kinds of</v>

513
00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:32.340
<v Speaker 2>creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>

514
00:24:32.341 --> 00:24:35.430
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not separate from that.</v>

515
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:40.610
<v Speaker 2>And why do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I so fixated have I been for,</v>

516
00:24:40.951 --> 00:24:44.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this past decade so fixated on</v>

517
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 2>separating myself from this world that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually inhabit?</v>

518
00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I think not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that's true for all</v>

519
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:54.090
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all vegans by any means.</v>

520
00:24:54.091 --> 00:24:59.091
<v Speaker 2>But for me there was in a sense a</v>
<v Speaker 2>desire to live in this ideal</v>

521
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 2>philosophical world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in this like physical,</v>

522
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:12.911
<v Speaker 2>natural world that I actually inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually an animal that inhabits</v>

523
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:15.530
<v Speaker 2>this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a footprint here,</v>

524
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just my carbon footprint comes with</v>

525
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:18.240
<v Speaker 2>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drive,</v>

526
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a physical footprint no</v>

527
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>matter what I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

528
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm impacting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole network of connections,</v>

529
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through agriculture and all kinds of</v>

530
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not separate from this.</v>

531
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I actually</v>

532
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.133
<v Speaker 4>eat</v>

533
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:38.430
<v Speaker 2>more of the kinds of foods that human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings have been eating forever that we</v>

534
00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:39.940
<v Speaker 2>evolved on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

535
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.870
<v Speaker 2>And so I just start to experiment with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and see both how it felt physically,</v>

536
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.350
<v Speaker 2>but also sort of emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically,</v>

537
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.580
<v Speaker 2>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophically.</v>

538
00:25:48.581 --> 00:25:51.130
<v Speaker 2>How did it feel to start to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that?</v>

539
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.420
<v Speaker 2>And it was strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

540
00:25:52.421 --> 00:25:54.910
<v Speaker 2>it was a kind of a bizarre experience to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to eat,</v>

541
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.880
<v Speaker 2>especially to start eating meat again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weird,</v>

542
00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:59.680
<v Speaker 2>even before I was hunting,</v>

543
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's going on is all connected</v>

544
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:08.240
<v Speaker 3>to what your friend calls the supermart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you call an agent of</v>

545
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 3>forgetfulness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

546
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's connected to that in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are so disconnected from our food</v>

547
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.070
<v Speaker 3>that even people that are are vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

548
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 3>they think that they're causing no harm</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they just eat plants.</v>

549
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 3>If you're eating commercial grain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

550
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you're a part of a massive widescale</v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

551
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably,</v>

552
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:34.781
<v Speaker 3>there's probably more dead animals per</v>
<v Speaker 3>acre in if you're getting commercial</v>

553
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:40.181
<v Speaker 3>grain than almost anything when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they grind up that grain to chew it</v>

554
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 3>up and to turn it into like if you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a corn wheat and they chop</v>

555
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those combines are indiscriminate.</v>

556
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They kill everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

557
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've made some improvements in that,</v>

558
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the decades.</v>

559
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 1>But sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small mammals,</v>

560
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 1>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's also just the fact that</v>

561
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 1>when you create something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever natural wildlife would have</v>

562
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 1>been there has been completely removed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you turned it into this weird new</v>

563
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:07.700
<v Speaker 1>thing where it's a monoculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

564
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 1>where you're just growing soybeans or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just growing whatever,</v>

565
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:14.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that by not participating in it,</v>

566
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 1>and by not participating in any aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gathering of the food,</v>

567
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you get this detachment from it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

568
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

569
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I can remove myself from any cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had ethical concerns by just</v>

570
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 1>establishing a cruelty free Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

571
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes a lot easier to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think in those black and white terms,</v>

572
00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 1>either not there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

573
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:37.381
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to separate that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't experience it and realize,</v>

575
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:42.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants eat animals,</v>

576
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.120
<v Speaker 1>animals eat animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then animals die and plants eat film.</v>

577
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>It's all this whole system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything including us as part of,</v>

578
00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we as a culture,</v>

579
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 1>as a society for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

580
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

581
00:27:56.521 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 1>centuries have been various ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>separating ourselves from that through</v>

582
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 1>industrialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

583
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.640
<v Speaker 1>just our ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

585
00:28:05.641 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 1>this is culturally specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not every culture in the world thinks</v>

586
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:11.100
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do think of ourselves as very</v>

587
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:12.600
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

588
00:28:12.601 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

589
00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental philosopher,</v>

590
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

591
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.060
<v Speaker 1>who's now passed on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

592
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her name was val plumwood.</v>

593
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 1>She was in Australia and she talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and she talked about how even</v>

594
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.730
<v Speaker 1>our practices around and our ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>around our own life and death as humans</v>

595
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:36.140
<v Speaker 1>and how we bury ourselves in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete boxes to sort of keep ourselves</v>

596
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 1>from decomposing supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

597
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I said like protect ourselves from death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of us being part of that</v>

598
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Speaker 1>world in a physical way.</v>

599
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.213
<v Speaker 1>We actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:55.380
<v Speaker 1>ending up being food eventually she</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that we,</v>

601
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's right,</v>

602
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 1>that we reject that as a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

603
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.450
<v Speaker 1>we don't have room for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

604
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the things what we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our bodies we embalm than when we</v>

605
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:06.750
<v Speaker 1>sort of remove ourselves permanently</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the cycle,</v>

606
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>which is really kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have some formaldehyde buddy.</v>

607
00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we,</v>

608
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.950
<v Speaker 1>do we really need to stare at our dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies?</v>

609
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Like sitting with perfect clothing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

610
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you're not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so fucked up that we,</v>

611
00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen it a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember when it was my</v>

612
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:27.900
<v Speaker 1>grandfather and now I was really close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my grandfather.</v>

613
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So when I went to his funeral and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>him sitting there in that box,</v>

614
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.330
<v Speaker 1>and I realize how bizarre it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

615
00:29:33.331 --> 00:29:34.740
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not there.</v>

616
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a shell does not my grandpa,</v>

617
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 1>he's gone like this is some strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

618
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:45.291
<v Speaker 1>And like they've pumped him full of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff so he doesn't stink because</v>

619
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 1>the stinking is natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what supposed to happen</v>

620
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 1>to a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were supposed to put them in the</v>

621
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 1>ground and the bacteria eats them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fertilize the soil and make it</v>

622
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:55.890
<v Speaker 1>better for everything around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

623
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And when we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

624
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:00.910
<v Speaker 1>We burn ourselves to turn ourselves into</v>
<v Speaker 1>powder.</v>

625
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Right till fucking totally useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're real weird with how we treat our</v>

626
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:07.940
<v Speaker 1>bodies and the concept of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

627
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally true.</v>

628
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I love to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have,</v>

629
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much of a Disney view of animals and</v>

630
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

631
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that you would hunt.</v>

632
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you would kill deer.</v>

633
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that deer eat birds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go,</v>

634
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:22.840
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

635
00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Deer eat birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just tell me a bizarre a,</v>

636
00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a couple of those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean probably pretty darn rare,</v>

637
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:31.440
<v Speaker 1>but they chase them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been known to very,</v>

638
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 1>again very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've been known to like in the</v>

639
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:38.430
<v Speaker 1>shallows like whack fish and eat pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual behavior.</v>

640
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time they can't pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they can pull it,</v>

641
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.830
<v Speaker 1>it's like dear are designed essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>to graze.</v>

642
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.990
<v Speaker 1>It's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the way they are,</v>

643
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:52.020
<v Speaker 1>but they'll take their food any way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get it and that is really hard for</v>

644
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 1>people to believe like cows as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like cows eat ground nesting birds all</v>

645
00:30:56.561 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of cows doing it and when</v>

646
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you show that to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

647
00:31:00.161 --> 00:31:04.150
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe what we're doing is we're</v>

648
00:31:04.151 --> 00:31:07.480
<v Speaker 1>ruining the earth so much that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals themselves are killing each</v>

649
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:09.340
<v Speaker 1>other and hating it and they've always</v>
<v Speaker 1>done this.</v>

650
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.300
<v Speaker 1>They just don't do it a lot because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not designed for it.</v>

651
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And there's plenty of vegetation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deer live,</v>

652
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.230
<v Speaker 1>especially like white tail deer who live</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily around agriculture.</v>

653
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 1>They were around so much vegetation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much food that the last thing do you</v>

654
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:26.830
<v Speaker 1>have to worry about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time it's starving to death</v>

655
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:29.130
<v Speaker 1>when they were around like farmlands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

656
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean up our way in the north and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some other parts of,</v>

657
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.240
<v Speaker 1>of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the new s and up into Canada where</v>

658
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:41.230
<v Speaker 1>you get into mostly forested areas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get over populations of deer.</v>

659
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 1>They wipe out their winter habitat if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have too many deer and they're</v>

660
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 1>starvation time is winter right there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the deep snow.</v>

661
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 1>They're compressed into tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny fractions of their usual usual</v>

662
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can in fact,</v>

663
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starve to death and in vast numbers,</v>

664
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but around agriculture and more moderate</v>
<v Speaker 1>climates.</v>

665
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got no shortage of food.</v>

666
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And deer.</v>

667
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:04.450
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting how they're set</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

668
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a,</v>

669
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.130
<v Speaker 1>it's making sure that they don't last</v>
<v Speaker 1>through when they're the older strong,</v>

670
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:17.131
<v Speaker 1>mature bucks cause a mature buck will go</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the prime of its life to on death's</v>

671
00:32:19.361 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 1>door within a couple months during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rut.</v>

672
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drive them.</v>

673
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.130
<v Speaker 1>So they use all their fat reserves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>burn it,</v>

674
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.230
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing it right when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>winter's coming.</v>

675
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes bad design,</v>

676
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like it's on purpose</v>

677
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 1>because for people who aren't aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process,</v>

678
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>what happens is the deer will eat all</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout</v>

679
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.873
<v Speaker 3>the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

680
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.511
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:42.560
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll fatten up,</v>

682
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 3>they look great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their antlers grow.</v>

683
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as the air starts getting crisp</v>

684
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:48.980
<v Speaker 3>around the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get ready to party.</v>

685
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the velvet falls off their antlers,</v>

686
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:53.660
<v Speaker 3>their antlers start to get hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

687
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.720
<v Speaker 3>and then the females go into heat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the party starts and they just run</v>

688
00:32:59.031 --> 00:33:02.780
<v Speaker 3>around running for so long that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes forget to eat.</v>

689
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:06.380
<v Speaker 3>They burn off all their fat and they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>skinny and scrawny,</v>

690
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.290
<v Speaker 3>and then by the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cold.</v>

691
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.300
<v Speaker 3>And when it's cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when they die.</v>

692
00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:16.301
<v Speaker 3>So they'll go from being like a stud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>primary their life dear to being a dead,</v>

693
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.860
<v Speaker 3>starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen to death,</v>

694
00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:21.080
<v Speaker 3>deer within a couple of months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really weird,</v>

695
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.610
<v Speaker 3>and especially in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

696
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.380
<v Speaker 3>in those kinds of harsh climates where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

697
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 3>where it is cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep snow,</v>

698
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:27.890
<v Speaker 3>limited food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be really risky.</v>

699
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the like mule deer in particular,</v>

700
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:30.951
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

701
00:33:30.951 --> 00:33:31.641
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

702
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what happens to white tails but</v>

703
00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 3>may happen with mule deer as much or</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

704
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a nature almost has like these</v>

705
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:41.540
<v Speaker 3>fail safe system set up to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these mature bucks only have their</v>

706
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:43.770
<v Speaker 3>time in the sun for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

707
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you get your party on all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the females love Ya,</v>

708
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>you're having a great time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you father a lot of offspring and then</v>

709
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.433
<v Speaker 3>that's a wrap.</v>

710
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I find</v>

711
00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.540
<v Speaker 2>fascinating is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>different groups,</v>

712
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.790
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters and others who often seem</v>

713
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.570
<v Speaker 2>diametrically opposed on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an issue like hunting,</v>

714
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often are motivated by really similar</v>

715
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 2>values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

716
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 2>a concern for environmental</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation,</v>

717
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 2>a concern for even animal welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in hunting,</v>

718
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.970
<v Speaker 2>the ethic of the clean kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

719
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:36.130
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you should only shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants and it should be virtually</v>

720
00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:37.310
<v Speaker 2>instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

721
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.300
<v Speaker 2>and even the concern that you express</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

722
00:34:39.301 --> 00:34:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this crash course so fast,</v>

723
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I could have wounded an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

724
00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 2>the concern about wounding an animal is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concern about,</v>

725
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not causing suffering,</v>

726
00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:52.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undue suffering,</v>

727
00:34:52.821 --> 00:34:54.420
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

728
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>violating essentially an animal welfare</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethic.</v>

729
00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

730
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 2>and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's such different languages being</v>

731
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:05.950
<v Speaker 2>spoken often by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.680
<v Speaker 2>folks who are on a sort of an animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights or animal welfare activist side</v>

733
00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 2>and folks who are on sort of a hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hunting conservation activist side</v>

734
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:17.804
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

735
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 2>and often they're speaking very</v>
<v Speaker 2>different languages and don't realize</v>

736
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:22.420
<v Speaker 2>that they have some things in common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

737
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.690
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 2>back at the beginning of January,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>

739
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:27.890
<v Speaker 2>is it filled?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demars the guy with the greenland.</v>

740
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

741
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's an animal rights activists doing</v>

742
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.000
<v Speaker 2>really important work related to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:38.290
<v Speaker 2>orcas and other captive captive animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

744
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:43.550
<v Speaker 1>and he has a real respect for and gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're coming from in your</v>

745
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Speaker 1>interest in hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

746
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there are people who do get it</v>

747
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:48.840
<v Speaker 1>across those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

748
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.490
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's different.</v>

749
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he eats meat.</v>

750
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he say he eats meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he may be,</v>

751
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 1>but also on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

752
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:03.990
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about marine mammals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are super intelligent and I have,</v>

753
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I have a deep appreciation and respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those things.</v>

754
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:11.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're basically like water</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

755
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think they don't fingers,</v>

756
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a language that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>really accurately interpret.</v>

757
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:23.270
<v Speaker 1>But when you pay attention to Helen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely smart dolphins and orchids are,</v>

758
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>locking them up is akin to a slavery.</v>

759
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insanity.</v>

760
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I just despise it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sick.</v>

761
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.370
<v Speaker 1>It costs me money because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the best comedy room in Vegas is</v>

762
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:43.200
<v Speaker 1>in the Mirage and I won't work it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it in the past and then I was</v>

763
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:46.020
<v Speaker 1>told that the Mirage has dolphins and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

764
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

765
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't work there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>

766
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

767
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I can't do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't have a fucking,</v>

768
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and Aha show a above a slave ship.</v>

769
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

770
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 1>But that idea that there are water</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

771
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because in many</v>

772
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:10.730
<v Speaker 1>traditional hunting societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they speak of animals as people you</v>

773
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.910
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have them as,</v>

774
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.960
<v Speaker 1>and even deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

775
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.790
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a society,</v>

776
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same say as a dolphin pod</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a wolf pack,</v>

777
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know those animals really</v>

778
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 1>intimately as a species and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as individuals,</v>

779
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 1>but the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of them as,</v>

780
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.370
<v Speaker 1>as other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

781
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 1>as animal people.</v>

782
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And yet they're hunting cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

783
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:36.180
<v Speaker 1>and so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking lives.</v>

784
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also have a deep respect.</v>

785
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not that Obo will kill the ones we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't respect.</v>

786
00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.680
<v Speaker 1>What were the kill the ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of ugly.</v>

787
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 1>But the ones that we respect are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that are beautiful.</v>

788
00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 1>We won't touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not it.</v>

789
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.810
<v Speaker 1>That's not how they're thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

790
00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we often do my agent,</v>

791
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I have an agent and I love her to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's awesome.</v>

792
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 1>But she loves animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's vegetarian,</v>

793
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.220
<v Speaker 1>she loves animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she doesn't mind if I hunt wild</v>

794
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:00.690
<v Speaker 1>pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's disgusting,</v>

795
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:06.440
<v Speaker 1>ugly and disgusting was art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this arbitrary aesthetic that,</v>

796
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.920
<v Speaker 1>that some people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

797
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an ugly kind of fish or it's an</v>

798
00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:13.080
<v Speaker 1>ugly kind of mammal where any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish really,</v>

799
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.110
<v Speaker 1>there's very few people give a fuck if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kill a fish,</v>

800
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 1>they just really don't care.</v>

801
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

802
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's a different experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

803
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

804
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.450
<v Speaker 1>It's totally different and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

805
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:26.220
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is weird and moving.</v>

806
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

807
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 1>here's a tangible sense of a loss of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

808
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was big into fishing when I was a kid,</v>

809
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.680
<v Speaker 1>when I was probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

810
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess I moved to Boston when I was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I really got into fishing</v>

811
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and I used to fish every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to live in this place called</v>

812
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:46.951
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica plain and they had this lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're called Jamaica pond and uh,</v>

813
00:38:46.961 --> 00:38:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they had bass and trout and I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go there every day and I'd catch</v>

814
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.730
<v Speaker 1>fish there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whenever I killed one and 82,</v>

815
00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I always felt weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just killed some.</v>

816
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:56.591
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

817
00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 1>that was the experience that actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me decide to be vegetarian.</v>

818
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I fished all my childhood growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved it.</v>

819
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:02.351
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

820
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing mentor was a guy from Boston who</v>

821
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 1>grew up in the bronx and he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a furniture builder in Boston.</v>

822
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:10.600
<v Speaker 1>And he come up and visit us in southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Hampshire and we'd,</v>

823
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd fish all the time,</v>

824
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:15.580
<v Speaker 1>but when I was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been thinking a lot about,</v>

825
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of life I wanted to leave,</v>

826
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 1>what my values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went fishing and I caught this</v>

827
00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:20.890
<v Speaker 1>trout and I killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

828
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

829
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to kill that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have had,</v>

830
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rice and veggies or whatever.</v>

831
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't have to.</v>

832
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the big arguments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people even say against hunting,</v>

833
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:34.600
<v Speaker 1>even if they eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to the supermarket.</v>

834
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

835
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the voluntary participation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people is hard to fathom.</v>

836
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you get all your meat from hunting</v>

837
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.770
<v Speaker 1>all my red meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have red meat,</v>

838
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean we'll buy local chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

839
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we happen to have red meat in the</v>

840
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because I was lucky the previous</v>

841
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:57.250
<v Speaker 1>November and you won't go to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that,</v>

842
00:39:57.251 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that raise chickens and cows and</v>

843
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's just,</v>

844
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.320
<v Speaker 1>there's no really good rational argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

845
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I just never got back into the habit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like buying beef.</v>

846
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

847
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ecologically and ethically,</v>

848
00:40:11.381 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 1>it probably makes pretty good sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

849
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a big argument against it.</v>

850
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I just never got into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back into that habit.</v>

851
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the experience of taking a deer is so</v>

852
00:40:27.011 --> 00:40:30.040
<v Speaker 1>profoundly different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously from going to the grocery</v>

853
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:32.470
<v Speaker 1>store or even go to a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

854
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having that is so valuable to me.</v>

855
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's such a reminder,</v>

856
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the opposite of the</v>

857
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:46.150
<v Speaker 1>supermarket as an agent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgetfulness.</v>

858
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you take a package of innocent or</v>

859
00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 1>the freezer and you remembered that deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you killed,</v>

860
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no forgetting where that comes</v>

861
00:40:56.561 --> 00:40:57.540
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

862
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always present.</v>

863
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's indescribable to someone who hasn't</v>

864
00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

865
00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:05.620
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

866
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 1>to even imagine what it's like because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

867
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the word spiritual because</v>

868
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it just gets so beaten down and overused</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watered down.</v>

869
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 1>But there is a weird spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between your meat or a</v>

870
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:24.180
<v Speaker 1>tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

871
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's connected to the experience that</v>

872
00:41:27.941 --> 00:41:29.890
<v Speaker 1>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat that you're eating,</v>

873
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge that you were the one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>took the life of the knowledge.</v>

874
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It was a life,</v>

875
00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.780
<v Speaker 3>it was a living being and now it's food</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your plate and you're watching your</v>

876
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:40.700
<v Speaker 3>family eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're having friends that come</v>

877
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 3>over and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

878
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that cities are something</v>

879
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:51.980
<v Speaker 3>really unusual and alien and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think human beings have created them</v>

880
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.790
<v Speaker 3>out of convenience and it's wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's allowed us to gather</v>

881
00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:59.840
<v Speaker 3>information and to create these</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible places where you can just</v>

882
00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:02.780
<v Speaker 3>group together millions and millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and you just ship all the food</v>

883
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in doing so,</v>

884
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 3>we've created this really convenient way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of looking at things.</v>

885
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is what I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get at with this whole series of</v>

886
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:15.320
<v Speaker 3>interviews and series of conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm having with different hunters,</v>

887
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 3>different vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

888
00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 3>there are different people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to ethically source their food.</v>

889
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get a sense of how the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell this happened and how it's so</v>

890
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 3>pervasive and how there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance to understanding and</v>

891
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 3>appreciating what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

892
00:42:32.781 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 3>the overall what the really big picture</v>
<v Speaker 3>of where our food comes from.</v>

893
00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it actually is instead of this a</v>

894
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 3>utopian view that I think like we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

895
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 3>you had this idea before separating</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself from this world of animals and</v>

896
00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:50.020
<v Speaker 3>it's not just food obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean every material that a city that</v>

897
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.770
<v Speaker 3>the city uses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

898
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.790
<v Speaker 3>huge issue here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge issue in Atlanta,</v>

899
00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge issue in many places.</v>

900
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 3>That water's coming from somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every material that,</v>

901
00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:05.450
<v Speaker 3>that city uses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very little as being produced actually</v>

902
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.910
<v Speaker 3>the raw materials coming from that</v>
<v Speaker 3>location.</v>

903
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.580
<v Speaker 3>So we're constantly drawing on rural</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>

904
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far flung around the globe sometimes,</v>

905
00:43:12.831 --> 00:43:17.510
<v Speaker 3>but certainly the immediate surroundings</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cities are utterly dependent on</v>

906
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

907
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.430
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plastic and then waste products.</v>

908
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:23.210
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

909
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's a surfer as a Yoga</v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher and he loves surfing and he's,</v>

910
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.630
<v Speaker 3>he's a real interesting cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a free spirit.</v>

911
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he told me,</v>

912
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's lived all over the world and um,</v>

913
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of very bizarre accident cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a combination of like a bunch</v>

914
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:42.110
<v Speaker 3>of different places where you live for</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years here in Argentina for 10 years</v>

915
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.220
<v Speaker 3>and he serves everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went surfing in Los Angeles.</v>

916
00:43:46.221 --> 00:43:51.221
<v Speaker 3>He went surfing in Malibu after the rain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and didn't know that you can't do that.</v>

917
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't because there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>waste that comes from our cities.</v>

918
00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 3>When it rains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it pours into the ocean and it's like</v>

919
00:44:00.501 --> 00:44:05.501
<v Speaker 3>you're bathing in a toxic soup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was sick for days just from</v>

920
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.140
<v Speaker 3>surfing in the water right off our</v>
<v Speaker 3>shores.</v>

921
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Just from all these chemicals and paths</v>
<v Speaker 3>sloughing off,</v>

922
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 3>landing all the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

923
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:16.970
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the residue brake dust residue that's on</v>

924
00:44:16.971 --> 00:44:18.380
<v Speaker 3>the roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

925
00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 3>When you have a pouring rain that comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>down that La River and it just goes</v>

926
00:44:21.321 --> 00:44:22.310
<v Speaker 3>right into the ocean.</v>

927
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say for like five or six days,</v>

928
00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to stay out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>

929
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.870
<v Speaker 3>It takes a while to filter all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff out and get it back to the where</v>

930
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 3>the state that it normally is at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

931
00:44:32.521 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 3>we live in this really dirty gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>polluted city that's right next to this</v>

932
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:40.140
<v Speaker 3>beautiful ocean and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

933
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

934
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 3>When you took your first year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>

935
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 3>what was that like as an experience?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shocking.</v>

936
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

937
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.860
<v Speaker 3>a definite tangible feeling of loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

938
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.270
<v Speaker 3>the loss of this life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also a,</v>

939
00:44:57.271 --> 00:45:02.271
<v Speaker 3>an incredible feeling of exhilaration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird primal connection when you're</v>

940
00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:05.040
<v Speaker 3>actually eating the meat over a</v>
<v Speaker 3>campfire.</v>

941
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Cause we did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

942
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 3>hardcore back country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back country,</v>

943
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 3>public land in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Off the Missouri River camping,</v>

944
00:45:15.481 --> 00:45:17.460
<v Speaker 3>like the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did it the right way.</v>

945
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

946
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 3>you're around a campfire with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you really care about and</v>

947
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 3>you're all eating this meat from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal that you just killed isn't tense.</v>

948
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the male bonding experience,</v>

949
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

950
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

951
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 3>there's like football games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

952
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:37.170
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But hunting,</v>

953
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:41.370
<v Speaker 3>going out and hunting parties together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a conversation with my friend</v>

954
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Duncan trussell yesterday about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think that there's some things</v>

955
00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

956
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.140
<v Speaker 3>don't know that we have a requirement</v>
<v Speaker 3>for in our minds or in our bodies or in</v>

957
00:45:51.631 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe perhaps in our DNA that our</v>

958
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 3>bodies are set up with these certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>reward systems.</v>

959
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.670
<v Speaker 3>It's rewarding to gather up your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>

960
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone who's ever grown a garden</v>

961
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.310
<v Speaker 3>completely outside of hunting gardening</v>
<v Speaker 3>is super satisfying.</v>

962
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing when you eat some food that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've grown yourself.</v>

963
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 3>When you're chopping up some Kale and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomatoes and you're making a nice salad</v>

964
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 3>and you made all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you grew all this yourself and you paid</v>

965
00:46:16.951 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 3>attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fertilized it and you added water.</v>

966
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 3>There's this amazing feeling like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exubera ration,</v>

967
00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 3>this like weird exhilaration feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're eating food that you grew</v>

968
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:31.740
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these things I think are these</v>

969
00:46:31.741 --> 00:46:36.150
<v Speaker 3>reward systems that are in place because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was always good to do that because it</v>

970
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 3>ensured survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like helping other people.</v>

971
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:39.930
<v Speaker 3>That feeling of that good feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get.</v>

972
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helping others in your community.</v>

973
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helping us.</v>

974
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.940
<v Speaker 3>And also I'm hunting I think is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

975
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of weird things that</v>

976
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:51.320
<v Speaker 3>are in there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

977
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being uh,</v>

978
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.660
<v Speaker 3>sexually attractive is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in there too.</v>

979
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Having someone think you're attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a normal primal reward</v>

980
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 3>system that we all love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even people that are in committed</v>

981
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:04.950
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like women in committed relationships</v>

982
00:47:04.951 --> 00:47:08.640
<v Speaker 3>like to go out with their girlfriends</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dress up and look nice to get looked</v>

983
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:10.260
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>

984
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might not have any desire to find a</v>

985
00:47:12.271 --> 00:47:15.270
<v Speaker 3>new man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they want to get looked at because</v>

986
00:47:15.271 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 3>it fulfills these primal reward systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are in our,</v>

987
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.010
<v Speaker 3>in our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think archery is in there too.</v>

988
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I definitely think hunting and</v>

989
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.710
<v Speaker 3>eating your own meat from an animal or</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a fish or something that you've</v>

990
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 3>gotten</v>

991
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.620
<v Speaker 1>and pulled from the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about,</v>

992
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say it's a male bonding experience.</v>

993
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's fascinating is that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

994
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:39.640
<v Speaker 1>so many of the old mythologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

995
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.530
<v Speaker 1>the deity of hunting is a goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

996
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.350
<v Speaker 1>the earth itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

997
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean Artemis and Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that women,</v>

998
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 1>and I know many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many women who hunt and they,</v>

999
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>

1000
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 1>just like men have a wide range of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and views and values and</v>

1001
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:58.390
<v Speaker 1>attitudes toward it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1002
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they of course also have this experience</v>

1003
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of giving life,</v>

1004
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually mothers or not.</v>

1005
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:08.210
<v Speaker 1>They have this potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1006
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the combination of that,</v>

1007
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays out differently for different</v>

1008
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:14.431
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1009
00:48:14.431 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to both be a giver of life and a hunter</v>

1010
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 1>and a taker of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1011
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:22.180
<v Speaker 1>talk about being sort of spiritually</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the world and to life and</v>

1012
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:23.014
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

1013
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The giver of life thing,</v>

1014
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.910
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that men will never</v>

1015
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly understand.</v>

1016
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1017
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I have this whole bit I'm doing about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my act because we will never</v>

1018
00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:38.050
<v Speaker 1>understand what it's like to even have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to have a baby in your body.</v>

1019
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so alien.</v>

1020
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 1>So alien to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the earth itself,</v>

1021
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought that the earth and that</v>

1022
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 1>nature itself is a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nature itself is a mother,</v>

1023
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 1>a mother that provides mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives life and gives birth to life.</v>

1024
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it totally makes sense.</v>

1025
00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Women hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting thing because</v>

1026
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella wrote this really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting article about sexism in the</v>

1027
00:49:06.041 --> 00:49:11.041
<v Speaker 1>way we perceive hunters because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this cute girl who was going</v>

1028
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:13.540
<v Speaker 1>on these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1029
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.410
<v Speaker 1>African Safaris and taking photos with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals that she had shot.</v>

1030
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1031
00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:21.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people are so angry at her.</v>

1032
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 1>And this was pre cecil the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1033
00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:26.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this take on it.</v>

1034
00:49:26.581 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 1>He was like trying to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is with all this hate,</v>

1035
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 1>like where's all this hate coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he believes that a certain</v>

1036
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:36.010
<v Speaker 1>percentage of it is just sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that someone looking at this girl,</v>

1037
00:49:36.011 --> 00:49:37.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this girl going over there and</v>

1038
00:49:37.961 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 1>shooting a Kudu?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why does she do that?</v>

1039
00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Why does she even want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then beautiful animal.</v>

1040
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Why did she want to go over there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot that?</v>

1041
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And that if it was like some fat old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly dude,</v>

1042
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.150
<v Speaker 1>nobody would care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because it was this pretty,</v>

1043
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I think her name was Kendall Jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joan's Kendall,</v>

1044
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Kendall Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kendall Jenner's like one of the</v>

1045
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1046
00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1047
00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm talking about it.</v>

1048
00:49:58.930 --> 00:49:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

1049
00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had death threats and got hundreds</v>

1050
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:05.680
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of facebook likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's probably got more facebook</v>

1051
00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:07.610
<v Speaker 1>friends than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1052
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.680
<v Speaker 1>and it was all really quick and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

1053
00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:14.060
<v Speaker 1>How many pete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just turned out and uh,</v>

1054
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:17.080
<v Speaker 1>and attacked her and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunting community supported her and</v>

1055
00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:18.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1056
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hateful people,</v>

1057
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:23.920
<v Speaker 1>the things that I would read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good portion of it was that she</v>

1058
00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:26.050
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to eat meat,</v>

1059
00:50:26.051 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>you can go to a store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that stuff.</v>

1060
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fly flyer and there's a,</v>

1061
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of really good arguments</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

1062
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1063
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 2>not that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get meat,</v>

1064
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you go to store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for real,</v>

1065
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to fly all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa to get meat,</v>

1066
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.970
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no eco friendly in what you're</v>

1067
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:41.804
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to get a jet and you're</v>

1069
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 2>gonna fly 16 hours across the ocean to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go get meat,</v>

1070
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest about what we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1071
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 2>We're having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1072
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

1073
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1074
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.270
<v Speaker 2>like Steve or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that article by Steve and I</v>

1075
00:50:58.271 --> 00:51:02.110
<v Speaker 2>think that there are a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things going on in a situation</v>

1076
00:51:02.111 --> 00:51:04.870
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the</v>

1077
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:09.340
<v Speaker 2>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1078
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.220
<v Speaker 2>of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>

1079
00:51:12.221 --> 00:51:15.370
<v Speaker 2>so called trophy hunting or so called</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport hunting.</v>

1080
00:51:15.371 --> 00:51:17.680
<v Speaker 2>And the language is really problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1081
00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is about us,</v>

1082
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say us,</v>

1083
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:25.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hunters who do that,</v>

1084
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:27.610
<v Speaker 2>who I going to fly to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1085
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I never done that and don't intend to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1086
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:33.700
<v Speaker 2>but a hundred and flies to Africa and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're hunting lions or kudu or</v>

1087
00:51:33.701 --> 00:51:38.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever they're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're clearly not hunting that.</v>

1088
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:39.640
<v Speaker 2>So they have food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1089
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that ethic of respecting life and</v>

1090
00:51:44.291 --> 00:51:47.140
<v Speaker 2>therefore you take life for a serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose,</v>

1091
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:51.730
<v Speaker 2>including food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an ethic that actually not just</v>

1092
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.870
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1093
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.330
<v Speaker 2>those who are criticizing trophy</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

1094
00:51:55.331 --> 00:51:57.130
<v Speaker 2>But in hunting traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1095
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.820
<v Speaker 2>there are many wanton waste laws in many</v>
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

1096
00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:03.130
<v Speaker 2>You cannot kill a deer and just leave it</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1097
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you have a hunting license,</v>

1098
00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:05.440
<v Speaker 2>it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1099
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.230
<v Speaker 2>That's understood as wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1100
00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.180
<v Speaker 2>And there are many traditional hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>prayers from hunting cultures where</v>

1101
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.313
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I took your life because I needed</v>

1103
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.990
<v Speaker 2>the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hide,</v>

1104
00:52:15.991 --> 00:52:17.060
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1105
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that basic respect for life and also</v>

1106
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:22.460
<v Speaker 2>like in the Cecil case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:27.490
<v Speaker 2>there was the fact that he was shot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then 40 hours later killed the animals</v>

1108
00:52:29.591 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 2>suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not a clean kill.</v>

1109
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1110
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 2>and there was outrage over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that ethic also is part of hunting</v>

1111
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:38.500
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that well,</v>

1112
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 2>you also don't leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:43.150
<v Speaker 2>you don't take the head and leave behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the body.</v>

1114
00:52:43.151 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the things that Rinella</v>
<v Speaker 2>said about line on thing.</v>

1115
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I shot a lion,</v>

1116
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I would eat that line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can eat align I guess.</v>

1117
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:50.931
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

1118
00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're edible,</v>

1119
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he has this,</v>

1120
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1121
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that there are these</v>
<v Speaker 2>values about respect for life and about</v>

1122
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:05.561
<v Speaker 2>animal welfare and suffering and so on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are seen as being violated by</v>

1123
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.000
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Likes the salt or by,</v>

1124
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other hunters,</v>

1125
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Kendall Jones or others who go over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you didn't need to do the,</v>

1126
00:53:13.411 --> 00:53:14.360
<v Speaker 2>why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>

1127
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:16.220
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not using it yourself,</v>

1128
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.770
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

1129
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 2>So does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put it,</v>

1130
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Africa is one of the problematic place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to,</v>

1131
00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be,</v>

1132
00:53:22.371 --> 00:53:25.230
<v Speaker 2>in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people go to New Zealand and</v>

1133
00:53:25.231 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>they hot over there and they</v>

1134
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 3>do bring back the meat is still</v>
<v Speaker 3>ecologically you're flying in a plane,</v>

1135
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:31.404
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1136
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really kind of re,</v>

1137
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:35.430
<v Speaker 3>but it is an ethical way to acquire</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting.</v>

1138
00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:37.950
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the lamb and most of the elk</v>

1139
00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:40.320
<v Speaker 3>that you buy commercially in America</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from New Zealand.</v>

1140
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.020
<v Speaker 3>So the import elk from there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

1141
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

1142
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 3>There's deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elk or red deer.</v>

1143
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 3>A lot of venison comes from New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lamb comes from a lot of lamb comes from</v>

1144
00:53:50.611 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any predators.</v>

1145
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 3>So if you ever been over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever watched a video about it</v>

1146
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:55.291
<v Speaker 3>last night?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1147
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 3>they have fucking enormous herds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep.</v>

1148
00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd never seen anything like,</v>

1149
00:53:59.761 --> 00:54:02.730
<v Speaker 3>it was insane and elk and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1150
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.200
<v Speaker 3>well not elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stags,</v>

1151
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.940
<v Speaker 3>red deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer.</v>

1152
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.090
<v Speaker 3>And they have so many of them and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1153
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 3>it's really easy to go over there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot them because they don't have any</v>

1154
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:14.100
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no predators there.</v>

1155
00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:15.930
<v Speaker 3>And all the animals had been imported</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1156
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:16.610
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1157
00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.770
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand is a very strange place</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's almost like a paradise.</v>

1158
00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.460
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably large.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen footage of it.</v>

1159
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.420
<v Speaker 3>I haven't either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1160
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I've only seen footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1161
00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:28.410
<v Speaker 3>I want to go just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even in hunting just as a</v>

1162
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 3>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to take my family over there and</v>

1163
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:31.230
<v Speaker 3>just check it out.</v>

1164
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just looks so cool.</v>

1165
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:38.230
<v Speaker 2>But I think in addition to the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trophy in sports issues,</v>

1166
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.840
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what is</v>

1167
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.790
<v Speaker 2>objectionable to a lot of people about</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of hunting,</v>

1168
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I think there also is in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in the Cecil case,</v>

1169
00:54:51.351 --> 00:54:52.650
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>

1170
00:54:52.651 --> 00:54:53.510
<v Speaker 2>in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1171
00:54:53.511 --> 00:54:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Kendall Jones and others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a gender issue.</v>

1172
00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.240
<v Speaker 2>There's also an issue about women as</v>
<v Speaker 2>killers.</v>

1173
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1174
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:06.290
<v Speaker 2>and I think that is even more</v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing.</v>

1175
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree that that's the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason people jumped on it because</v>

1176
00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:13.670
<v Speaker 2>people jumped on the dentist too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1177
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:14.960
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it also,</v>

1178
00:55:14.961 --> 00:55:18.740
<v Speaker 2>it is troubling in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis killed a lion that had a name and</v>

1179
00:55:18.741 --> 00:55:22.670
<v Speaker 2>that's where things got really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the anthropomorphization of these</v>

1180
00:55:22.671 --> 00:55:27.671
<v Speaker 2>animals that we've experienced in movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and television shows and commercials and</v>

1181
00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:29.450
<v Speaker 2>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1182
00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:34.220
<v Speaker 2>it gets real weird with people cause you</v>
<v Speaker 2>named something and all of a sudden they</v>

1183
00:55:34.221 --> 00:55:36.890
<v Speaker 2>think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing is like someone's pad or</v>

1184
00:55:36.891 --> 00:55:37.724
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1185
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the naming has a,</v>

1186
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.490
<v Speaker 2>it certainly adds a dimension to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that,</v>

1187
00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:45.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out to be,</v>

1188
00:55:45.231 --> 00:55:47.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a famous lion.</v>

1189
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1190
00:55:48.711 --> 00:55:50.960
<v Speaker 2>there've been other cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1191
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump jr or you know,</v>

1192
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.690
<v Speaker 2>one of the trump sons was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1193
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.910
<v Speaker 2>several years back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:55:55.911 --> 00:55:59.420
<v Speaker 2>It isn't all trump jr and it wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 2>named animal.</v>

1195
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still the,</v>

1196
00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:04.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole trophy.</v>

1197
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The image of trophies and you know,</v>

1198
00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you've got these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1199
00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:11.060
<v Speaker 2>these skulls of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of deer and elk you've taken.</v>

1200
00:56:11.061 --> 00:56:16.061
<v Speaker 2>And I have some too</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there for me anyway,</v>

1201
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:21.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not a trophy in the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

1202
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.790
<v Speaker 2>here's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1203
00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>it's some,</v>

1204
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of macho proving,</v>

1205
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm a hang up in the living room</v>

1206
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:34.411
<v Speaker 1>and show off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has some sort of totemic or a</v>

1207
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.870
<v Speaker 1>symbolic power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.940
<v Speaker 1>it reminds me of that hunt and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1209
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them not to just throw it</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1210
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.320
<v Speaker 1>It's something that I value and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1211
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1212
00:56:44.351 --> 00:56:46.300
<v Speaker 1>it's art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be seen as art.</v>

1213
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's nature's art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1214
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 1>that's why I don't have anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been taken care of.</v>

1215
00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no stuffed things because</v>

1216
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:56.080
<v Speaker 1>they're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at,</v>

1217
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not knocking anybody that kills</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elk and wants to put,</v>

1218
00:56:59.471 --> 00:57:01.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a quarter on their wall or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1219
00:57:01.461 --> 00:57:03.610
<v Speaker 1>or put his head on their wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1220
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 1>the bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see those things,</v>

1221
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a foam body and they tan the hide</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they stretched the hide over it and</v>

1222
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much,</v>

1223
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.793
<v Speaker 1>it's fake.</v>

1224
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 1>These skulls are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the actual skull of the animal.</v>

1225
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And to me that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful piece of art.</v>

1226
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:22.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating to me when I look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

1227
00:57:22.081 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first animal I killed over to your</v>

1228
00:57:24.341 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 1>left right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that thing every day and I</v>

1229
00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 1>look at it and then every day I find</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new area on it.</v>

1230
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:34.250
<v Speaker 1>The just the design of the deer skull is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

1231
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't ever shoot an animal just for</v>

1232
00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 1>its skull or just for its antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would never leave it behind</v>

1233
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:42.890
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1234
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I would want to keep that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1235
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1236
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.200
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of trophy and the language of</v>

1237
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:53.940
<v Speaker 1>trophy and the symbols like cruelty is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1238
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 1>that's troubling for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1239
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's important for hunters</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get better.</v>

1240
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Steven Ellis spoken about this too,</v>

1241
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:07.110
<v Speaker 1>to get better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing what's meaningful about the</v>

1242
00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 1>experience of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's meaningful about the meat as</v>

1243
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you've spoken about a bit,</v>

1244
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.170
<v Speaker 1>what's meaningful about a skull or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1245
00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that is that is meaningful</v>

1246
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people can actually understand</v>

1247
00:58:21.461 --> 00:58:26.461
<v Speaker 1>that if we can move past just black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white hunting's good or bad,</v>

1248
00:58:27.431 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 1>trophy hunting is good or bad and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>

1249
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:30.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they can too.</v>

1250
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 1>We're always going to have problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are really hardcore vegans</v>

1251
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 1>that have they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really interesting,</v>

1252
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I got in this conversation with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>really recently about it where I found a</v>

1253
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.300
<v Speaker 1>bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram page if they were talking all</v>

1254
00:58:46.301 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 1>kinds of crazy shit about hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1255
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 1>she told me that she's only been a Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>for seven months.</v>

1256
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:54.850
<v Speaker 1>She was like one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>outspoken,</v>

1257
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.740
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forceful,</v>

1258
00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:58.570
<v Speaker 1>like every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about it was like,</v>

1259
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 1>like it must be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must stop.</v>

1260
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're killing.</v>

1261
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 1>You have a blt on your fucking instagram</v>
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>

1262
00:59:05.921 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here?</v>

1263
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:09.110
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The causes that well,</v>

1264
00:59:09.111 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like when you get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something for the first time,</v>

1265
00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't shut the fuck up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1266
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I've been guilty of that many times in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

1267
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 1>If I got into a race car driving or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1268
00:59:19.481 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 1>people in the podcast probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you shut the fuck up about race</v>

1269
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.843
<v Speaker 3>car driving?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1270
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Speaker 3>And it got to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1271
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:26.230
<v Speaker 3>with hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of that like,</v>

1272
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 3>so to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'll put this podcast hop and</v>

1273
00:59:28.701 --> 00:59:29.511
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh great.</v>

1274
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:34.511
<v Speaker 3>And other hunting podcast Zzz Zzz</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1275
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk about what's</v>

1276
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 3>interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I think part of these podcasts</v>

1277
00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:45.641
<v Speaker 3>is these things will last for as long as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get shared and spread around in the</v>

1278
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:47.750
<v Speaker 3>digital form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think these conversations are</v>

1279
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.180
<v Speaker 3>important right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this conversation,</v>

1280
00:59:50.181 --> 00:59:52.100
<v Speaker 3>the conversation about where's your food</v>
<v Speaker 3>come from?</v>

1281
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.070
<v Speaker 3>What made you make these choices?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these are important</v>

1282
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:58.580
<v Speaker 3>conversations because I think the</v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnect and recognizing the</v>

1283
00:59:58.581 --> 01:00:03.260
<v Speaker 3>disconnect that we have between where</v>
<v Speaker 3>our food comes from and these attitudes</v>

1284
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:07.250
<v Speaker 3>that we develop and have a that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>really don't,</v>

1285
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.070
<v Speaker 3>don't have any problem with or we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't think there's anything wrong</v>

1286
01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:15.071
<v Speaker 3>with the way we're alienating people or</v>
<v Speaker 3>pointing out the flaws over the people's</v>

1287
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:17.690
<v Speaker 3>behaviors and we're not looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>herself.</v>

1288
01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:20.050
<v Speaker 3>There's a blind spot there and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think this is,</v>

1289
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 3>is a very important conversation because</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1290
01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:26.480
<v Speaker 3>I think we've created something really</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird with cities,</v>

1291
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:32.170
<v Speaker 3>with cities and with with supermarkets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've created this really weird thing</v>

1292
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:35.540
<v Speaker 3>where for our entire history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1293
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 3>as long as people have been people we</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew where our food was kind of coming</v>

1294
01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:40.280
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew you went to a butcher,</v>

1295
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:41.990
<v Speaker 3>you got the food that butcher kill that</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

1296
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:44.210
<v Speaker 3>He knew you go to a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he grew the vegetables.</v>

1297
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:48.590
<v Speaker 3>You knew that when they came ready to</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and those were that it was real</v>

1298
01:00:48.591 --> 01:00:51.620
<v Speaker 3>clear and now it's not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's real weird,</v>

1299
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to a drive through and you give</v>

1300
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:58.010
<v Speaker 3>them paper and within seconds you get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground to animal sandwich and you're</v>

1301
01:00:58.011 --> 01:00:59.570
<v Speaker 3>eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>

1302
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:04.190
<v Speaker 3>the whole process takes a minute and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating something that's already</v>

1303
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 3>cooked right and you're drinking this</v>
<v Speaker 3>vat of sugary liquid with ice cubes in</v>

1304
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how the fuck the ice cubes,</v>

1305
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 3>it's 95 degrees outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you get the ice?</v>

1306
01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:18.060
<v Speaker 3>W W there's this weird sort of removal</v>
<v Speaker 3>from nature that we have and the natural</v>

1307
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:24.341
<v Speaker 3>process of collecting and gathering and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then enjoying the food that you've</v>

1308
01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 3>gathered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1309
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:26.760
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1310
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.740
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interest in reconnecting those</v>

1311
01:01:31.741 --> 01:01:36.741
<v Speaker 2>things and being aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>where things come from and how they're,</v>

1312
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:44.010
<v Speaker 2>how they're connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what led me to be a vegetarian,</v>

1313
01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's also 11 you'd be a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1314
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.270
<v Speaker 2>wanting to understand and recognize the</v>
<v Speaker 2>connection and not turn away,</v>

1315
01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:54.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the turning away when people</v>

1316
01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:58.740
<v Speaker 2>willfully like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know that willful</v>

1317
01:01:58.741 --> 01:01:59.460
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if someone's vegetarian,</v>

1319
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they hunt or not.</v>

1320
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.240
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't matter to me as long as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to at least look at what</v>

1321
01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.790
<v Speaker 2>and how things are connected and look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

1322
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:16.170
<v Speaker 2>One of the first reviews of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my book that was written was by a</v>

1323
01:02:16.171 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1324
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>the book actually made her think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to being vegan because she</v>

1325
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>was disturbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>and she also said that she thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the author and she didn't know me,</v>

1327
01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would consider it a compliment to know</v>

1328
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>that it led her in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was actually right because I</v>

1329
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>wasn't trying to convert her into being</v>
<v Speaker 1>an omnivore or being a hunter.</v>

1330
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I was asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at these issues,</v>

1331
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>think about these values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about animals,</v>

1332
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>think about nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about our relationship with these</v>

1333
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>things and you decide what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do in your personal life.</v>

1334
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that she could respect me</v>

1335
01:02:56.251 --> 01:03:01.110
<v Speaker 1>enough and anticipate that I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect her decision was great because</v>

1336
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.630
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't doing that willful ignorance</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1337
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're lucky that there's so much</v>

1338
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1339
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a fascinating time to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

1340
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're lucky that everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so bizarre because it makes these</v>

1341
01:03:14.671 --> 01:03:18.000
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the crackle because there's</v>

1342
01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:19.800
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something so weird about it.</v>

1343
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>There's something so weird about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1344
01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil as an animal,</v>

1345
01:03:23.881 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>a life form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a species that has developed for</v>

1346
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever hundreds of thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been people eating meat.</v>

1347
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially when you look at</v>

1348
01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:35.910
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they discover the,</v>

1349
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference in the size of the lower</v>

1350
01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 1>hominids brains and humans' brains and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to figure out what the</v>

1351
01:03:41.581 --> 01:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>fuck went wrong or right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather where we developed this gigantic</v>

1352
01:03:45.781 --> 01:03:47.820
<v Speaker 1>brain or wrong or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1353
01:03:47.821 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be wrong.</v>

1354
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to get back to the garden,</v>

1355
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1356
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.680
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was what they think it is,</v>

1357
01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 1>it's because we started eating meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started hunting.</v>

1358
01:03:57.781 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 1>We had to develop ways to be more clever</v>
<v Speaker 1>and capture.</v>

1359
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 1>These animals were soft and spongy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>were very weak animals.</v>

1360
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.170
<v Speaker 1>So we had to get smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And compared to the saber tooth,</v>

1361
01:04:07.171 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>tigers were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're crunchy.</v>

1362
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A ridiculous,</v>

1363
01:04:10.081 --> 01:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>we cannot run anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a video pull this video up</v>

1364
01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that I tweeted yesterday cause if any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody wants to know how hard it is out</v>

1365
01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:20.280
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video of a Martin,</v>

1366
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.630
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1367
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:24.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal that a lot of people associate</v>

1368
01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:25.614
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1369
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>for trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people go,</v>

1370
01:04:27.511 --> 01:04:30.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you kill a Martin Weasel</v>

1371
01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:33.570
<v Speaker 1>family big weasel and it's chasing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit.</v>

1372
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of them as carnivores.</v>

1373
01:04:36.751 --> 01:04:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have thought of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>carnivores.</v>

1374
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking Martin chasing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit and it chases this thing for</v>

1375
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:45.210
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a spread.</v>

1376
01:04:45.211 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up at the screen.</v>

1377
01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess you do it right over here.</v>

1378
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.410
<v Speaker 1>You look to your right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to look behind you.</v>

1379
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I think this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this Martin is chasing after this</v>

1380
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>rather unusual terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1381
01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>well it's open road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open road and ice and it's a dead heat</v>

1382
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:04.430
<v Speaker 1>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Martin is just slowly relentless</v>

1383
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:08.430
<v Speaker 1>are closing in on this rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where these people are,</v>

1384
01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>but they were speaking a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

1385
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rabbits trying to zig and trying</v>

1386
01:05:13.441 --> 01:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>to zag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Martin is just one step after</v>

1387
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>one step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an inch closer,</v>

1388
01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>a little closer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little closer and there fucking</v>

1389
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>hustling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this rabbit is like shit,</v>

1390
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he gets them.</v>

1391
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking evil little animal.</v>

1392
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>It is the size of the rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what's really crazy.</v>

1393
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>It might actually be smaller than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>round,</v>

1394
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably lighter.</v>

1395
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>And he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had jack that he had essentially the</v>

1396
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>same thing happened in front of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>front porch a year or two ago.</v>

1397
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.990
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think were on the porch or out in the</v>

1398
01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly we hear this squealing as</v>

1399
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:51.780
<v Speaker 1>horrible Shriek and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1400
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>a young snowshoe hare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1401
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:58.540
<v Speaker 1>little little rabbit and a tiny weasel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an urban,</v>

1402
01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean things like as big around as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot dog.</v>

1403
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tiny little thing.</v>

1404
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Much small rabbit killed that rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're intense.</v>

1405
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1406
01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:10.124
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1407
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was host still horrifying to see.</v>

1408
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1409
01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 1>it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1410
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Plants getting eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1411
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Speaker 1>eating animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insects,</v>

1412
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:22.090
<v Speaker 1>birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1413
01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>everything's eating everything all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1414
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't see it most of the time.</v>

1415
01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless we are out,</v>

1416
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the outdoors a lot or paying</v>

1417
01:06:30.371 --> 01:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>attention to the garden and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it happening all the time in Alaska.</v>

1418
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And a brown bear killed a moose in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>driveway and they had to shoot the bear.</v>

1419
01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.980
<v Speaker 1>The people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1420
01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>whoever the wildlife management people</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to shoot the bear because of</v>

1421
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>decided to bury this fucking moose in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his garage and he keep coming into his</v>

1422
01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1423
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:50.584
<v Speaker 1>Or in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1424
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.120
<v Speaker 1>his lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1425
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.720
<v Speaker 1>like this is his territory now coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>back for that and there's a 600 pound</v>

1426
01:06:55.721 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking bear who just killed a moose in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his driveway and that's not even a big</v>

1427
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:02.260
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really terrifying.</v>

1428
01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.960
<v Speaker 1>They embarrassed for brown bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1429
01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so big.</v>

1430
01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.430
<v Speaker 1>And to think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he loves it there and to think that</v>

1431
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:13.570
<v Speaker 1>he's watching out his window like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little piece of glass will thin piece of</v>

1432
01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.220
<v Speaker 1>glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family's luck.</v>

1433
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1434
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of the same thing</v>

1435
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:21.790
<v Speaker 1>happening of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of one habit.</v>

1436
01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:25.810
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of a bear killing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>moose in this family's driveway where</v>

1437
01:07:25.811 --> 01:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>they're looking out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time because you know</v>

1438
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:31.420
<v Speaker 1>these people that live in these parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

1439
01:07:31.421 --> 01:07:35.560
<v Speaker 1>especially Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so like you've got like anchorage</v>

1440
01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when I was up in Anchorage,</v>

1441
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 1>we would just drive a little bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1442
01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:42.070
<v Speaker 1>here's one right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one.</v>

1443
01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like fucking comment up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a bear that's dragging this</v>

1444
01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>moose and this Mousse is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this one.</v>

1445
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:50.740
<v Speaker 1>This moose is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1446
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>or is it still alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks dead.</v>

1447
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>This one's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some where the,</v>

1448
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:57.130
<v Speaker 1>there's another video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to see.</v>

1449
01:07:57.131 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these videos is enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's one where it's still alive</v>

1450
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's killing it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the driving things,</v>

1451
01:08:03.421 --> 01:08:07.270
<v Speaker 1>screaming and trying to get back up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bear drags it away and,</v>

1452
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.880
<v Speaker 1>and alls it and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1453
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:10.980
<v Speaker 1>it's tough for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1454
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.120
<v Speaker 1>as humans because we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1455
01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>we have this moral conscience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably the bear doesn't have right</v>

1456
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 1>about the suffering of another animal of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its prey.</v>

1457
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we do as hunters,</v>

1458
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>as farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as pet owners,</v>

1460
01:08:26.991 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have companion animals.</v>

1461
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:33.341
<v Speaker 1>We have this moral compass of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're conscious entities are aware</v>

1462
01:08:33.771 --> 01:08:36.880
<v Speaker 1>of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have compassion and,</v>

1463
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>and a moral code built around these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of impulses to protect</v>

1464
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:48.430
<v Speaker 1>animals from suffering as anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet we see what happens in nature on</v>

1465
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least we get to witness something</v>

1466
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>like that and we have to integrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1467
01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 1>what's real in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way animals do things.</v>

1468
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:58.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1469
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.720
<v Speaker 1>our moral frameworks aren't terribly</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant in that world,</v>

1470
01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but we still evaluate them like say it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil in what I mean,</v>

1471
01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:11.930
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't literally mean the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martins evil.</v>

1472
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

1473
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:14.840
<v Speaker 1>we think in those moral terms about</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1474
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

1475
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the real argument that</v>

1476
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:22.310
<v Speaker 1>vegans have that we're trying to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from any suffering and this is what</v>

1477
01:09:22.311 --> 01:09:26.030
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do by trying to take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty free path,</v>

1478
01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.460
<v Speaker 1>by trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to choose what they think is the</v>

1479
01:09:28.461 --> 01:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>most ethical lifestyle.</v>

1480
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:35.290
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is they're sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>answering this call of evolving this,</v>

1481
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this call that they have of the evolving</v>

1482
01:09:39.621 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 1>species right away from away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of practices that we</v>

1483
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:46.490
<v Speaker 1>historically who have abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1484
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 1>not saying slavery has been banished</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide,</v>

1485
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>but we as a society said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1486
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:55.760
<v Speaker 1>we can no longer do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to evolve socially beyond</v>

1487
01:09:55.761 --> 01:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the argument which has,</v>

1488
01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:00.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some legitimacy to it in a sense is that</v>

1489
01:10:00.621 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 1>we have to evolve beyond eating meat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

1490
01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think this conversation so</v>

1491
01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:08.750
<v Speaker 1>fascinating is because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument does have a little bit of</v>

1492
01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:13.520
<v Speaker 1>merit to it is not a black and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue and neither is what you would call</v>

1493
01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:15.980
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote trophy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a black and white issue</v>

1494
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 1>either because Zimbabwe just announced</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to call 200 lions because</v>

1495
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:22.340
<v Speaker 1>they've outlawed lion hunting.</v>

1496
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.810
<v Speaker 1>So now they have a surplus of lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a problem with the Angela to</v>

1497
01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:27.950
<v Speaker 1>getting decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

1498
01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:30.110
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to fucking kill some lions.</v>

1499
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And each one of those 200 lines that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to call would have brought</v>

1500
01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:39.710
<v Speaker 1>them $50,000 of revenue towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation that would stop poaching,</v>

1501
01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1502
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:43.450
<v Speaker 1>keep wildlife habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

1503
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:45.470
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really complicated,</v>

1504
01:10:45.471 --> 01:10:50.471
<v Speaker 1>and the people that are on the outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>conveniently ignorant to all these facts</v>

1505
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:53.130
<v Speaker 1>that are incredibly complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1506
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.123
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

1507
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.190
<v Speaker 1>they're not aware of this big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1508
01:10:57.191 --> 01:11:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you should go to Lyon to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and go hunt lines.</v>

1509
01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

1510
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any desire to kill anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lion,</v>

1511
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but to that part of the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought in a considerable amount of</v>

1512
01:11:10.371 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>revenue and there's a balance that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to</v>

1513
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:17.190
<v Speaker 3>achieve with the predators and with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>prey.</v>

1514
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:22.530
<v Speaker 3>And that balance is kind of screwed up</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that they've taken out hunting of</v>

1515
01:11:22.531 --> 01:11:25.980
<v Speaker 3>lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hard for people to imagine,</v>

1516
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you'll read about Africa that some</v>

1517
01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:31.090
<v Speaker 3>areas the lines are threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1518
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:34.800
<v Speaker 3>there's this really interesting pace</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I follow on instagram called save</v>

1519
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 3>the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have all these really cool photos</v>

1520
01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:40.750
<v Speaker 3>and lions and I think lines are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad they're around.</v>

1521
01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like looking at videos of them.</v>

1522
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see them in real life</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than a zoo,</v>

1523
01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:47.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get too many of them.</v>

1524
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 3>You've got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only animal that can figure that</v>

1525
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:51.480
<v Speaker 3>out as us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's it,</v>

1526
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:52.523
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1527
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.750
<v Speaker 3>the goats aren't going to get together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>

1528
01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:57.120
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to fucking do something about</v>

1529
01:11:57.121 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 3>this mountain lion population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just,</v>

1530
01:11:58.831 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Speaker 3>there's no more goats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've gotta,</v>

1531
01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:01.730
<v Speaker 3>we've gotta we've gotta help you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1532
01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.361
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1533
01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:06.150
<v Speaker 3>it's only people that can count the</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of wildlife biologists that can</v>

1534
01:12:06.151 --> 01:12:11.151
<v Speaker 3>figure out what's the right amount and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that can study the results of</v>

1535
01:12:11.851 --> 01:12:15.000
<v Speaker 3>having a disproportionate population of</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators and realize that we've got to</v>

1536
01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:15.910
<v Speaker 3>do something about that.</v>

1537
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1538
01:12:17.211 --> 01:12:21.170
<v Speaker 2>the Predator Predator predators are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really complicated all over the world.</v>

1539
01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here they're complicated in Africa,</v>

1540
01:12:22.641 --> 01:12:23.960
<v Speaker 2>the complicated in many parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1541
01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecologically in relationship to pray.</v>

1542
01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1543
01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>if we had a very large area and we just</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't part of the picture,</v>

1544
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:39.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not as though predators would just</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely wipe out the prey.</v>

1545
01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.990
<v Speaker 2>They will run out of food as prey gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder to catch.</v>

1546
01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Prase not going to disappear entirely</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because of a lion,</v>

1547
01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:49.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of lions or,</v>

1548
01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:52.790
<v Speaker 2>or wolves a or any other kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>predator.</v>

1549
01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.560
<v Speaker 2>They will ebb and flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have different sort of states of</v>

1550
01:12:57.561 --> 01:13:00.200
<v Speaker 2>equilibrium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high density of both low density of both</v>

1551
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.240
<v Speaker 2>changes and those sorts of things happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to us and our different</v>

1552
01:13:05.391 --> 01:13:07.280
<v Speaker 2>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture,</v>

1553
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:11.330
<v Speaker 2>livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know ungulates that the local human</v>

1554
01:13:11.331 --> 01:13:12.350
<v Speaker 2>population values.</v>

1555
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Then it gets really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1556
01:13:15.801 --> 01:13:18.770
<v Speaker 2>the issue you're bringing up about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're calling lions and it could</v>

1557
01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:23.771
<v Speaker 2>have brought in so many tens of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars from hunters and</v>

1558
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I've just been working on this essay</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these sorts of issues.</v>

1559
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:32.290
<v Speaker 2>There's all these practical issues about</v>
<v Speaker 2>money conservation and those sorts of</v>

1560
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:36.770
<v Speaker 2>things that are happening in Zimbabwe</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1561
01:13:36.771 --> 01:13:41.390
<v Speaker 2>or other countries or here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the,</v>

1562
01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:45.770
<v Speaker 2>the moral and ethical issues around</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal welfare.</v>

1563
01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:50.771
<v Speaker 2>And is it respectful of life to kill an</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal just for the head or do you have</v>

1564
01:13:51.171 --> 01:13:53.030
<v Speaker 2>to eat it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's,</v>

1565
01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:58.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a language of practicality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does the Zimbabwe need to fund</v>

1566
01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:00.230
<v Speaker 2>given programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you fund that?</v>

1567
01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.370
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the whole discussion in</v>
<v Speaker 2>language of,</v>

1568
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.510
<v Speaker 2>of the morals and ethics of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1569
01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are active discussions among</v>

1570
01:14:07.131 --> 01:14:08.510
<v Speaker 2>hunters too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:10.970
<v Speaker 2>they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the end they should,</v>

1572
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>

1573
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.470
<v Speaker 3>this is not a black and white issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very complicated.</v>

1574
01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.930
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a country like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zimbabwe,</v>

1575
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:21.610
<v Speaker 3>which is incredibly poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which could have benefited from $1</v>

1576
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:26.380
<v Speaker 3>million in money that would aid</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation if they allowed these hunts</v>

1577
01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.830
<v Speaker 3>to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So each one of these 200 lions that were</v>

1578
01:14:29.831 --> 01:14:34.040
<v Speaker 3>killed would be worth $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know that's a,</v>

1579
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating cause it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1580
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really that simple.</v>

1581
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And also Africa's enormous and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that a lot of people don't</v>

1582
01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 3>consider either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think of Africa,</v>

1583
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 3>you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well lions are in danger while they're</v>

1584
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 3>in danger in some spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know that's like saying,</v>

1585
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.150
<v Speaker 3>I looked out my yard today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no deer.</v>

1586
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay well go to upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a shitload of them.</v>

1587
01:14:58.841 --> 01:15:01.040
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1588
01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:05.470
<v Speaker 3>they have to hire assassins essentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go in and call the deer because</v>

1589
01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:06.670
<v Speaker 3>they've got so many of them.</v>

1590
01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 3>They've got to go in and shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>

1591
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:13.840
<v Speaker 3>this is a big problem in a lot of places</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the east coast.</v>

1592
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:18.850
<v Speaker 3>There's areas in Pennsylvania that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a hunting season for deer and in</v>

1593
01:15:18.851 --> 01:15:21.250
<v Speaker 3>people's neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just shoot them all the time.</v>

1594
01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 3>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bring an archer's.</v>

1595
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:26.330
<v Speaker 3>There's this television show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's archery bowhunting show where it</v>

1596
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.460
<v Speaker 3>was in the middle of the spring and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1597
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:34.420
<v Speaker 3>they brought in these archers to set up</v>
<v Speaker 3>tree stands in these like residential</v>

1598
01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:35.800
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1599
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rebound in white tails and you know,</v>

1600
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:40.570
<v Speaker 3>in the country as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but particularly,</v>

1601
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:42.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>along the eastern seaboard has created</v>

1602
01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 3>some bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre situations,</v>

1603
01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:48.370
<v Speaker 3>particularly in suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The animals that used to be symbols of</v>

1604
01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:53.360
<v Speaker 3>the wild and still are from any of us</v>
<v Speaker 3>are hanging out in people's lawns.</v>

1605
01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that giving people lyme disease,</v>

1606
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a big concern about that.</v>

1607
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:00.400
<v Speaker 3>That's a big concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ticks that carry lyme disease.</v>

1608
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:05.430
<v Speaker 3>They say something like 60% of the ticks</v>
<v Speaker 3>in New York state have lyme disease,</v>

1609
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.370
<v Speaker 3>some insane number like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just made that up.</v>

1610
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>

1611
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:11.801
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>

1612
01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:15.220
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's some really bizarre Lee high</v>

1613
01:16:15.221 --> 01:16:20.221
<v Speaker 3>number of ticks in certain areas of</v>
<v Speaker 3>upstate New York where there's a giant,</v>

1614
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:25.740
<v Speaker 3>a prevalence of deep bolt dear and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and lyme disease that they have a huge</v>

1615
01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:29.050
<v Speaker 3>issue and they really don't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop it.</v>

1616
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Cause lyme disease is devastating if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>

1617
01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:34.690
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible on your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rough.</v>

1618
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get into nervous system,</v>

1619
01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:37.030
<v Speaker 3>do all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>

1620
01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's also a problem that happens</v>

1621
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:44.410
<v Speaker 3>when you have overpopulation of deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all chronic wasting disease,</v>

1622
01:16:44.411 --> 01:16:48.890
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different diseases that come</v>
<v Speaker 3>through overpopulation and you know,</v>

1623
01:16:48.891 --> 01:16:51.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the chronic wasting disease of</v>

1624
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:51.994
<v Speaker 3>course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1625
01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the risks associated with that brings up</v>

1626
01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.840
<v Speaker 3>the whole sort of captive deer hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>industry and issues when that they start</v>

1627
01:17:02.171 --> 01:17:07.150
<v Speaker 3>moving animals around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe carry cwd or other diseases</v>

1628
01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.520
<v Speaker 3>and then they have contact with wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>populations</v>

1629
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and while they're doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the whole trophy hunting</v>

1630
01:17:14.841 --> 01:17:18.050
<v Speaker 1>thing that's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing these fenced in</v>

1631
01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>establishments where you go and hunt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hunting these animals that have</v>

1632
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:24.050
<v Speaker 1>been grown just for their enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>antlers.</v>

1633
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.070
<v Speaker 1>We covered it a couple of days ago with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Doug Durham and uh,</v>

1634
01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 1>we showed some photos that animals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look like deer,</v>

1635
01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:32.270
<v Speaker 1>they're bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>They have like these weird sculptures on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their heads like bushes,</v>

1637
01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a Bush growing out of their head.</v>

1638
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1639
01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much antler material.</v>

1640
01:17:42.321 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Indianapolis Star,</v>

1642
01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:52.361
<v Speaker 1>I think a few years ago did a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good long form expo's a on,</v>

1643
01:17:53.231 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 1>on that whole industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is bizarre.</v>

1644
01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that just how it's always going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be though?</v>

1645
01:17:57.411 --> 01:18:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sort of a,</v>

1646
01:18:00.491 --> 01:18:03.410
<v Speaker 1>a discipline and he sort of a pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have people that are</v>

1647
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 1>unethical.</v>

1648
01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.960
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1649
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:09.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race car drivers that are using just</v>

1650
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:13.160
<v Speaker 1>stronger engines and they're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use or cheating somehow or another on</v>

1651
01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:14.990
<v Speaker 1>this or on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it's just,</v>

1652
01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.870
<v Speaker 1>it's how it is all across the board in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1653
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that people who want to do that,</v>

1654
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 1>whether it's legal or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much industry is allowed to be</v>

1655
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 1>built up around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1656
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>So you have like the hunting industry or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunting community,</v>

1657
01:18:29.811 --> 01:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>the hunting world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have people like</v>

1658
01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:36.740
<v Speaker 1>yourself that are doing it to provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>their family with sustainable meat.</v>

1659
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And then you're going to have a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants a collection of different animals</v>

1660
01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:45.080
<v Speaker 1>from all of the world's stuffed in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>room so he could show everybody,</v>

1661
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1662
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:48.410
<v Speaker 1>this is my zebra room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1663
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:49.640
<v Speaker 1>like you ever seen those fucking guys.</v>

1664
01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrains,</v>

1665
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the television show once</v>

1666
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and this guy brought these people into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this room that looked like a high school</v>

1667
01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:03.041
<v Speaker 1>auditorium and he was just like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>super wealthy guy who hunts all over the</v>

1668
01:19:03.771 --> 01:19:04.820
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all he does.</v>

1669
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And it was just like a stuffed zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the strangest thing.</v>

1670
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Birds and fucking baboons and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff things.</v>

1671
01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the weirdest guy.</v>

1672
01:19:15.111 --> 01:19:17.810
<v Speaker 1>This guy's like a serial killer of</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1673
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 1>like some weird thing that he's attached</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself to.</v>

1674
01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's tricky is</v>

1675
01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:28.430
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a relatively small percentage of</v>

1676
01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:31.040
<v Speaker 1>the population here in the states hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:32.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how small is it?</v>

1678
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.823
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1679
01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:36.620
<v Speaker 1>it varies depending on how it's millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

1680
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1681
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:39.051
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1682
01:19:39.051 --> 01:19:44.051
<v Speaker 1>it's on the order of 10% will ever take</v>
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of Vegan fewer than</v>

1683
01:19:46.101 --> 01:19:47.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

1684
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:48.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a small number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1685
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.850
<v Speaker 1>In La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's higher vegans to hunters.</v>

1686
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I bet the hunters are way out numbered</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this fucking Koofie city.</v>

1687
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:58.270
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

1688
01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because,</v>

1689
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:03.590
<v Speaker 1>because it's this true for Vegetarians</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vegans too,</v>

1690
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:08.790
<v Speaker 1>because we're a minority population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy for</v>

1691
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:14.250
<v Speaker 2>most people to have sort of a stereotype</v>
<v Speaker 2>view and to lump them all together.</v>

1692
01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:18.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the analogy I sometimes draw is,</v>

1693
01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because such a huge percentage of the</v>

1694
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:26.661
<v Speaker 2>population drives cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can distinguish between good drivers</v>

1695
01:20:27.151 --> 01:20:30.300
<v Speaker 2>and bad drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who get into road rage and people</v>

1696
01:20:30.301 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 2>who were polite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can distinguish these things and we</v>

1697
01:20:32.881 --> 01:20:36.690
<v Speaker 2>have understandings of it because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience it and we see it and we don't</v>

1698
01:20:36.691 --> 01:20:39.280
<v Speaker 2>judge people for being drivers or lump</v>
<v Speaker 2>them all together.</v>

1699
01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1700
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.500
<v Speaker 2>but any minority community runs the</v>
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>

1701
01:20:43.501 --> 01:20:45.270
<v Speaker 2>This is true for Vegetarians to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for hunters.</v>

1702
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.010
<v Speaker 2>True for any minority community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We run the risk of being identified as a</v>

1703
01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:53.640
<v Speaker 2>sort of a monolithic singular group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get,</v>

1704
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:59.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hunter who portrays a certain image of</v>

1705
01:20:59.361 --> 01:21:00.980
<v Speaker 2>hunting and if fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1706
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what hunting is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1707
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1708
01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:06.960
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this identity gets attached to all</v>

1709
01:21:06.961 --> 01:21:07.794
<v Speaker 2>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not,</v>

1710
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it always happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a risk of that.</v>

1711
01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the part of the gift of this</v>

1712
01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in relation to the food</v>

1713
01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:16.981
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1714
01:21:16.981 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Michael Pollan's work and is that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are asking questions,</v>

1715
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:23.130
<v Speaker 2>people are thinking about agriculture</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuel,</v>

1716
01:21:23.131 --> 01:21:25.140
<v Speaker 2>thinking about wild foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are thinking about their</v>

1717
01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:27.720
<v Speaker 2>relationships ecologically and ethically</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what they eat.</v>

1718
01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's great.</v>

1719
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:32.200
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1720
01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these weird sort of,</v>

1721
01:21:36.231 --> 01:21:38.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotypes that we have about,</v>

1722
01:21:38.331 --> 01:21:40.790
<v Speaker 3>about hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really easy to do in this day</v>

1723
01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:41.870
<v Speaker 3>and age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

1724
01:21:41.871 --> 01:21:42.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're attractive.</v>

1725
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the time Bambi was released,</v>

1726
01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.960
<v Speaker 3>it's attractive to lump hunters into</v>
<v Speaker 3>this evil.</v>

1727
01:21:47.961 --> 01:21:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Like if you see hunters in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're almost always these cruel</v>

1728
01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:52.304
<v Speaker 3>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1729
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:54.990
<v Speaker 3>did you ever see the movie wolverine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1730
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Rain got mad because there was a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunters and they poisoned a bear and</v>

1731
01:21:58.611 --> 01:22:01.650
<v Speaker 3>he beats him up at a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all mean people like that</v>

1732
01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:02.503
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A wolverine.</v>

1733
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:03.530
<v Speaker 3>What do you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Dude,</v>

1734
01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:04.720
<v Speaker 3>look at the size of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1735
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you eat?</v>

1736
01:22:05.901 --> 01:22:08.410
<v Speaker 3>And Hugh Jackman and ain't lentils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1737
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:10.920
<v Speaker 3>you're eating a lot of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's,</v>

1738
01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:12.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1739
01:22:12.591 --> 01:22:16.940
<v Speaker 3>it's this strange thing that we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided because we're conveniently</v>

1740
01:22:16.941 --> 01:22:20.300
<v Speaker 3>removed from the process of killing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>

1741
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:22.210
<v Speaker 3>seeing the animal alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1742
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:23.450
<v Speaker 3>killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>butchering it,</v>

1743
01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:24.980
<v Speaker 3>chopping it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then cooking it.</v>

1744
01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:29.720
<v Speaker 3>We just get to the gimme a piece or even</v>
<v Speaker 3>more disconnected.</v>

1745
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:32.570
<v Speaker 3>We'd go to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so disconnected.</v>

1746
01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:36.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're 18 steps removed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1747
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.260
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real convenient to look at hunters</v>

1748
01:22:39.261 --> 01:22:41.000
<v Speaker 3>like some horrible evil thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1749
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:43.070
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

1750
01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:45.740
<v Speaker 3>my favorite is the people that eat meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

1751
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:49.100
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do that because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can just go to the supermarket.</v>

1752
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Why would you want to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You only do it because you're cruel,</v>

1753
01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:54.500
<v Speaker 3>but they can't imagine that you would do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it because you want to kind of</v>

1754
01:22:54.501 --> 01:22:56.420
<v Speaker 3>understand what are the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing.</v>

1755
01:22:56.421 --> 01:22:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Is this what you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1756
01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.473
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

1757
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.830
<v Speaker 2>you're right about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movies,</v>

1758
01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:04.203
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1759
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:07.730
<v Speaker 2>from Bambi having that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1760
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:11.500
<v Speaker 2>cultural impact and portrayal of hunters</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1761
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a force of evil and being sort of anti</v>

1762
01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1763
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:15.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1764
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.280
<v Speaker 2>the sort of disruptors of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this</v>

1765
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 2>eden like natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1766
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:28.350
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of times hunting</v>

1767
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:33.630
<v Speaker 2>industry and hunters today and the media</v>
<v Speaker 2>around hunting,</v>

1768
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 2>forget how the rest of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceives like the,</v>

1769
01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.390
<v Speaker 2>the trophy photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's an animal you're going to</v>

1770
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.800
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're smiling with the picture.</v>

1771
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:45.634
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1772
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:50.700
<v Speaker 2>as like what is seen in that from</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's not experienced that and</v>

1773
01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:55.740
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a image of respect for the</v>

1774
01:23:56.141 --> 01:23:57.910
<v Speaker 2>animal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

1775
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:01.270
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a hunter is expressing joy in that</v>

1776
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:02.680
<v Speaker 2>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it joy?</v>

1777
01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Is that joy at the death?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1778
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:05.770
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

1779
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:08.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those sorts of images in,</v>

1780
01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:13.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tv shows and just photos posted online.</v>

1781
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hard for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1782
01:24:16.231 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost even hard for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1783
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's hard for a lot of 900.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1784
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:21.190
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1785
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of disturbing.</v>

1786
01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1787
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Is it that you're happy that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished this very difficult thing</v>

1788
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:33.310
<v Speaker 2>or is it that you're proud of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're a killer,</v>

1789
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:35.050
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

1790
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.250
<v Speaker 2>are you a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you posing with this thing because</v>

1791
01:24:39.251 --> 01:24:41.980
<v Speaker 2>it's your trophy and you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1792
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:44.390
<v Speaker 2>are you cruel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you happy because you're happy,</v>

1793
01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.900
<v Speaker 2>you're smiling because that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do for cameras,</v>

1794
01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've never been terribly comfort.</v>

1795
01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I've taken photos like when I've hunted</v>
<v Speaker 2>and succeeded in and the first time I</v>

1796
01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:56.370
<v Speaker 2>did it I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1797
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.440
<v Speaker 2>took a photo of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I want it to be able to send it to</v>

1798
01:24:59.441 --> 01:25:00.050
<v Speaker 2>my uncle.</v>

1799
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wasn't smiling.</v>

1800
01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it was like I had to have to</v>

1801
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:07.000
<v Speaker 2>force a smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually not,</v>

1802
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't experience the same sort of rush</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some people do in it.</v>

1803
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find hunting meaningful and I find</v>

1804
01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.290
<v Speaker 2>that moment incredibly powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1805
01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:22.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's never been only until just this</v>
<v Speaker 2>past fall I finally took a photo that I</v>

1806
01:25:23.891 --> 01:25:28.450
<v Speaker 2>actually felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that I really felt good about,</v>

1807
01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:29.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would,</v>

1808
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:32.800
<v Speaker 2>what were you doing the photo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually on my facebook page.</v>

1809
01:25:32.801 --> 01:25:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I think my books facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1810
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 2>the deer was down and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kneeling there and have my hands on the</v>

1811
01:25:39.671 --> 01:25:41.650
<v Speaker 2>deer and I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1812
01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.420
<v Speaker 2>just being in that moment with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

1813
01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.390
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1814
01:25:49.810 --> 01:25:51.250
<v Speaker 2>the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about smiling,</v>

1815
01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:53.050
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about this is what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished.</v>

1816
01:25:53.051 --> 01:25:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an important,</v>

1817
01:25:55.811 --> 01:25:56.830
<v Speaker 2>there it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1818
01:25:57.090 --> 01:25:57.923
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1819
01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:03.420
<v Speaker 2>that's like the first time I've taken a</v>
<v Speaker 2>photo after a hunt that really felt good</v>

1820
01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

1821
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.510
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1822
01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 3>that's a great picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1823
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a great picture because boy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the wild.</v>

1824
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:12.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are in the woods and that's less</v>

1825
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:14.240
<v Speaker 3>than a half a mile from home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

1826
01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Great Place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're there with a really wild</v>

1827
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 3>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice big mature whitetail that was</v>

1828
01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 3>probably at the end of his voyage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>took them out.</v>

1829
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've posed with pictures of animals that</v>

1830
01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I shot and I've done it smiling because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy because it's difficult to do.</v>

1831
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take away from the reverence</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I have for the animal,</v>

1832
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:39.161
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1833
01:26:39.161 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 3>especially elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elk are,</v>

1834
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:43.640
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like almost like a mythical</v>

1835
01:26:43.641 --> 01:26:45.170
<v Speaker 3>creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very,</v>

1836
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.440
<v Speaker 3>very happy when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I've killed an elk,</v>

1837
01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.520
<v Speaker 3>especially the one that I killed with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bow because it's so hard to do.</v>

1838
01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.580
<v Speaker 3>It's insanely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the same amount of pressure and</v>

1839
01:26:55.581 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 3>when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've accomplished it.</v>

1840
01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.910
<v Speaker 3>Like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I get ready for a rifle hunt,</v>

1841
01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 3>I cite my rifle in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1842
01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I go to the range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I squeeze off a few rounds,</v>

1843
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I make sure my form is good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make sure my trigger discipline is</v>

1844
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:12.200
<v Speaker 3>good and I'm ready to rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good to go.</v>

1845
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:16.940
<v Speaker 3>If I am thinking about hunting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>September,</v>

1846
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:22.570
<v Speaker 3>I will start preparing in October for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the following September.</v>

1847
01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm not bull around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause once I started hunting with a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized like this is insanely</v>

1849
01:27:31.341 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not something you can kind of</v>

1850
01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:36.920
<v Speaker 3>dabble in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know some people do and I don't</v>

1851
01:27:36.921 --> 01:27:38.690
<v Speaker 3>know how the hell they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1852
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:41.360
<v Speaker 3>maybe they just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're not,</v>

1853
01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 3>they're not worried about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences as much as I am.</v>

1854
01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1855
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're just better at it than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so though.</v>

1856
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:52.820
<v Speaker 3>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think archery is something that you</v>

1857
01:27:52.821 --> 01:27:56.660
<v Speaker 3>have to do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could take 10 months</v>

1858
01:27:56.661 --> 01:28:00.290
<v Speaker 3>off of archery practice for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks and be as proficient as if you</v>

1859
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:04.460
<v Speaker 3>were practicing those entire 10 months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the people that I know,</v>

1860
01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.510
<v Speaker 3>there's meet with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1861
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 3>an elk that I shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy right there.</v>

1862
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:11.240
<v Speaker 3>People got mad at me for that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

1863
01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.050
<v Speaker 3>it's hard I think for people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1864
01:28:15.051 --> 01:28:17.150
<v Speaker 3>you've experienced that you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what you felt,</v>

1865
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:19.310
<v Speaker 3>you know what your reverence was for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that animal.</v>

1866
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:21.650
<v Speaker 3>You know what you were happy about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1867
01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy it died quick to write you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what all the things that went</v>

1868
01:28:25.191 --> 01:28:26.170
<v Speaker 3>on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1869
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:30.530
<v Speaker 3>As a snapshot to someone who's never</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced anything like that,</v>

1870
01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know any that you look like a</v>

1871
01:28:34.981 --> 01:28:37.790
<v Speaker 3>a mean person who's happy that you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>just killed.</v>

1872
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1873
01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.980
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1874
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:43.790
<v Speaker 3>There's so much going on when it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to a photo with that</v>

1875
01:28:43.791 --> 01:28:45.470
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not just about,</v>

1876
01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.600
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I took that photo just for me,</v>

1877
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 3>that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's just my photo and I keep it on</v>

1878
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:52.550
<v Speaker 3>my phone and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

1879
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:55.700
<v Speaker 3>I want to look at it every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the moment where I shot that elk</v>

1880
01:28:55.701 --> 01:28:58.820
<v Speaker 3>and I was really happy that I was able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a clean shot.</v>

1881
01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:01.290
<v Speaker 3>The animal died in seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything went great.</v>

1882
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.690
<v Speaker 3>All my training paid off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the hard work,</v>

1883
01:29:03.691 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 3>all the thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the preparation,</v>

1884
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:08.070
<v Speaker 3>all the paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not just for me,</v>

1885
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:09.580
<v Speaker 3>that's for everybody else too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1886
01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.700
<v Speaker 3>But that's also why it has a really long</v>
<v Speaker 3>paragraph attached to it where I went</v>

1887
01:29:13.701 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually there's not that context.</v>

1888
01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for me,</v>

1889
01:29:16.561 --> 01:29:17.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very important.</v>

1890
01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.650
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very important.</v>

1891
01:29:19.651 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 3>It was important to thank my friend</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cameron hanes because without his help</v>

1892
01:29:23.881 --> 01:29:25.350
<v Speaker 3>and without his teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1893
01:29:25.351 --> 01:29:27.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have taken a lot longer to</v>

1894
01:29:27.151 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 3>learn how to get good with a bow and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

1895
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did,</v>

1896
01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:35.970
<v Speaker 3>what a difficult pursuit it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just to keep your nerves together.</v>

1897
01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:40.971
<v Speaker 3>When this thousand pound tree full</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest horse is coming up the hill</v>

1898
01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:44.760
<v Speaker 3>screaming at you and you have to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing with a bow and Arrow,</v>

1899
01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on there man.</v>

1900
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:49.140
<v Speaker 3>And there's consequences is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1901
01:29:49.141 --> 01:29:52.140
<v Speaker 3>decides to kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a whole lot you could do,</v>

1902
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's know.</v>

1903
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever hunted elk?</v>

1904
01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out in New Mexico this fall for,</v>

1905
01:29:58.571 --> 01:30:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I had a writing residency down there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a month and I had a,</v>

1906
01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.660
<v Speaker 2>a mule deer tag for a few days at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of that,</v>

1907
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:06.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not end up shooting,</v>

1908
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't shoot it all when I was down</v>

1909
01:30:08.411 --> 01:30:09.970
<v Speaker 2>there at an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1910
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.460
<v Speaker 2>saw a few deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1911
01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:14.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but saw a few elk close.</v>

1912
01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't hunting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they came through.</v>

1913
01:30:16.901 --> 01:30:18.340
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we heard him comment links like,</v>

1914
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:21.700
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost like a moose up where I</v>

1915
01:30:21.701 --> 01:30:22.930
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big animal.</v>

1916
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.830
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty close,</v>

1917
01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.310
<v Speaker 3>pretty close to the size of a moose</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1918
01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing.</v>

1919
01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:30.030
<v Speaker 3>They're so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's</v>

1920
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:33.210
<v Speaker 2>her and I heard at least one beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was wild.</v>

1921
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard it might hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1922
01:30:35.041 --> 01:30:37.240
<v Speaker 2>I heard a tape of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never actually heard one view.</v>

1923
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:38.790
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what time of the year was it when you</v>

1924
01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:40.320
<v Speaker 2>were there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there in October</v>

1925
01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.290
<v Speaker 3>when I go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1926
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:47.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go hunting again in</v>
<v Speaker 3>September and I'm going to bring my kids</v>

1927
01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 3>and on one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1928
01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:53.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping that I could be successful</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have a day just to take them out and</v>

1929
01:30:53.621 --> 01:30:55.780
<v Speaker 3>bugle for them and just make some cow</v>
<v Speaker 3>calls.</v>

1930
01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Just they can hear the screams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it is amazing,</v>

1931
01:30:59.651 --> 01:31:03.830
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat for someone who's never been like</v>

1932
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:08.850
<v Speaker 3>in a canyon while they're all around you</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming as the morning light is</v>

1933
01:31:09.101 --> 01:31:10.450
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up.</v>

1934
01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.480
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the weirdest things and all</v>

1935
01:31:13.481 --> 01:31:17.440
<v Speaker 3>of nature and the fact that this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in the American wilderness and</v>

1936
01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:22.330
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country will never experienced that</v>

1937
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:25.600
<v Speaker 3>outside of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just take the hunting out of it and</v>

1938
01:31:25.601 --> 01:31:26.830
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be there.</v>

1939
01:31:26.831 --> 01:31:31.831
<v Speaker 3>And here</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this huge barrel chested thousand</v>

1940
01:31:32.311 --> 01:31:36.270
<v Speaker 3>pound animal screaming at the top of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>lungs.</v>

1941
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:39.140
<v Speaker 2>There's really nothing like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1942
01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we have these populations</v>

1943
01:31:44.301 --> 01:31:46.160
<v Speaker 2>of these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these amazing,</v>

1944
01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:48.320
<v Speaker 2>amazing animals and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the places,</v>

1945
01:31:48.321 --> 01:31:50.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big debate that I know Steve and</v>

1946
01:31:50.301 --> 01:31:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Mel has been involved in the politics of</v>
<v Speaker 2>public lands.</v>

1947
01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:55.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people who want to</v>

1948
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:57.020
<v Speaker 2>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1949
01:31:57.021 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>federal lands over to the state and</v>
<v Speaker 2>privatized</v>

1950
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of that off.</v>

1951
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big issue with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican politicians.</v>

1952
01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why Rinella</v>
<v Speaker 1>considers himself a political unit.</v>

1953
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats wanted to take your guns</v>

1954
01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:11.770
<v Speaker 1>away and the Republicans want to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>your land.</v>

1955
01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real interesting.</v>

1956
01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:16.930
<v Speaker 1>This land that we have in this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>was established,</v>

1957
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these wild lands.</v>

1958
01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:23.050
<v Speaker 1>He's public lands by Theodore Roosevelt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he established it because he was a</v>

1959
01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:24.950
<v Speaker 1>hunter and a conservationist and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>

1960
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you've got to lock this stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need,</v>

1961
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

1962
01:32:29.651 --> 01:32:33.490
<v Speaker 1>we are founding a Sierra club who yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had a lot in common with Roosevelt,</v>

1963
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:36.940
<v Speaker 1>disagree to them about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But equally important,</v>

1964
01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equally committed to preserve,</v>

1965
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:41.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have Samedi preserve these places.</v>

1966
01:32:41.621 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1967
01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.910
<v Speaker 1>not everything has to be helped like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we need public land and even</v>

1968
01:32:45.911 --> 01:32:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Yosemite's an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1969

<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're shooting bison,</v>

1971
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Yosemite or yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yellowstone.</v>

1972
01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always fuck those two of those wise,</v>

1973
01:32:54.821 --> 01:32:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a yet at y I guess.</v>

1974
01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>having a real issue.</v>

1976
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:03.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to,</v>

1977
01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:06.180
<v Speaker 1>they have to call them now and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

1978
01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:09.790
<v Speaker 1>that want to be able to hunt yellowstone</v>
<v Speaker 1>or kind of angry about the whole thing,</v>

1979
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:11.500
<v Speaker 1>they're eventually going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

1980
01:33:11.501 --> 01:33:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Some of the grizzlies are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the grizzlies are getting too</v>

1981
01:33:13.931 --> 01:33:17.250
<v Speaker 1>crazy and they're getting too</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with people you have,</v>

1982
01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:22.280
<v Speaker 1>they have real issues even in Yosemite I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think with bears not,</v>

1983

1987
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even a smaller blackberry,</v>

1988
01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:36.160
<v Speaker 1>he just can't believe how strong those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>

1989
01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1990
01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.350
<v Speaker 1>because we live in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1991
01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:43.980
<v Speaker 1>we have them come investigate our house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you'll see the prints or I've</v>

1992
01:33:44.531 --> 01:33:47.740
<v Speaker 1>seen him on the back porch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1993
01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:49.720
<v Speaker 1>through the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1994
01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

1995
01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're pretty skittish.</v>

1996
01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1997
01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.370
<v Speaker 1>we are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1998
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 1>they do not hang around people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1999
01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and so I have to do is make noise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take off.</v>

2000
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.240
<v Speaker 1>They're not really dangerous to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

2001
01:34:01.241 --> 01:34:02.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty neat to be that close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2002
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And you see even a small one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2003
01:34:04.530 --> 01:34:06.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good sized,</v>

2004
01:34:06.181 --> 01:34:08.350
<v Speaker 1>powerful Animal Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His friend,</v>

2005
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took this young guy,</v>

2006
01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:12.041
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2007
01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:15.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if it's one of his relatives or</v>

2008
01:34:15.251 --> 01:34:18.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took him on a black bear hunt a while</v>

2009
01:34:18.881 --> 01:34:20.870
<v Speaker 1>they're sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took them on some kind of haunts.</v>

2010
01:34:20.871 --> 01:34:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it was a black bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>

2011
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:27.340
<v Speaker 1>but while they were sleeping was</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked by 500 pound black bear in his</v>

2012
01:34:27.341 --> 01:34:28.730
<v Speaker 1>tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2013
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:32.500
<v Speaker 1>big melee and sue's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's screaming.</v>

2014
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.930
<v Speaker 1>One of his friends shoots the bear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits this kid.</v>

2015
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Then his first hunt ever in the elbow</v>
<v Speaker 1>shatters his elbow with the gun.</v>

2016
01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2017
01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wind up killing the bear.</v>

2018
01:34:46.210 --> 01:34:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Seven foot tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 pound black bear that had come to</v>

2019
01:34:51.281 --> 01:34:54.460
<v Speaker 1>kill this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malden cut them up pretty bad.</v>

2020
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.830
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears are,</v>

2021
01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 1>there are crazy</v>

2022
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:02.660
<v Speaker 2>thing that if they weren't real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if a grizzly bear wasn't a real</v>

2023
01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 2>creature and you saw it in a movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

2024
01:35:04.581 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a star wars it animal and a</v>

2025
01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 2>lot of ways very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.220
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to think about,</v>

2027
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:16.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional subsistence hunting cultures</v>

2028
01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:21.791
<v Speaker 2>that hunted bears of that scale went</v>
<v Speaker 2>into their den sometimes that's pretty</v>

2029
01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.480
<v Speaker 2>hard core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2030
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.000
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2031
01:35:26.001 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 2>you have to do what you have to do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay alive.</v>

2032
01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's what again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't appreciate that.</v>

2033
01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in some strange state now.</v>

2034
01:35:33.621 --> 01:35:38.621
<v Speaker 2>We're our meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We associate meet with a thin plastic</v>

2035
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:41.960
<v Speaker 2>wrap over a styrofoam tray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2036
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.943
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's me.</v>

2037
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:44.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to the idea of,</v>

2038
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal people and spirituality,</v>

2039
01:35:47.151 --> 01:35:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about these sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional hunting cultures too.</v>

2040
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:56.050
<v Speaker 2>There's this great film documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Diet of souls that was done by</v>

2041
01:35:56.871 --> 01:35:57.860
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2042
01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:01.760
<v Speaker 2>up in the north up in like Alaska.</v>

2043
01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:07.120
<v Speaker 2>And one of the basic questions in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>film is how can an animal be your</v>

2044
01:36:10.521 --> 01:36:13.610
<v Speaker 2>spiritual equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how it's thought of in many</v>

2045
01:36:13.611 --> 01:36:14.670
<v Speaker 2>traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2046
01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:18.350
<v Speaker 2>hunting cultures there you're equals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they aren't just animals.</v>

2047
01:36:18.730 --> 01:36:20.120
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're powerful.</v>

2048
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet they're also your daily bread</v>

2049
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.780
<v Speaker 2>there also what you eat every day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that get integrated in these</v>

2050
01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:28.100
<v Speaker 2>traditions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2051
01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:30.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fascinating cause we don't</v>

2052
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:31.490
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2053
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:35.840
<v Speaker 2>as a sort of Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've developed these [inaudible],</v>

2054
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:38.720
<v Speaker 2>the lower animals and the higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>primates,</v>

2055
01:36:38.721 --> 01:36:39.700
<v Speaker 2>as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2056
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have these,</v>

2057
01:36:40.641 --> 01:36:44.780
<v Speaker 2>this sort of hierarchy and we'll eat the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower ones or the ugly ones we talked</v>

2058
01:36:44.781 --> 01:36:48.340
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ones that are equal to us or</v>

2059
01:36:48.341 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 2>higher or better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe there's nothing higher,</v>

2060
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:54.190
<v Speaker 2>better than us in Western civilization</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I in our imagination Unicorns,</v>

2061
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unicorn,</v>

2062
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:56.743
<v Speaker 2>Rainbow Unicorn.</v>

2063
01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've had this convenient way of,</v>

2064
01:37:02.391 --> 01:37:04.260
<v Speaker 2>of creating this hierarchy and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2065
01:37:04.261 --> 01:37:07.700
<v Speaker 2>and thinking of ourselves sort of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of this pyramid in some way.</v>

2066
01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in cultures that see themselves</v>

2067
01:37:11.331 --> 01:37:16.331
<v Speaker 2>still is very much part of a more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>circle of peers,</v>

2068
01:37:16.761 --> 01:37:18.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the community and yet also are eating</v>

2069
01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:22.850
<v Speaker 2>these animal people all the time is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different world view.</v>

2070
01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegans will say,</v>

2071
01:37:24.801 --> 01:37:26.450
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you start eating people then</v>

2072
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:29.090
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be all spiritually</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to your food.</v>

2073
01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about hey friends,</v>

2074
01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an eater now you're going to feed my</v>

2075
01:37:34.251 --> 01:37:35.640
<v Speaker 2>whole neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2076
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2077
01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2078
01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:43.550
<v Speaker 2>there's something that we appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these native American cultures</v>

2079
01:37:43.551 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 2>that had a deep reverence for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that they change and European</v>

2080
01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:49.210
<v Speaker 2>cultures for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know what ancient European,</v>

2081
01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.091
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean pre,</v>

2082
01:37:50.091 --> 01:37:52.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before agriculture,</v>

2083
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 2>before um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

2084
01:37:56.071 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have traditions and all of us,</v>

2085
01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.120
<v Speaker 2>they go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2086
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 2>arguably all of us back to Africa or all</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world where,</v>

2087
01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

2088
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2089
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:09.100
<v Speaker 2>the caves of Lascaux in France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2090
01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:14.120
<v Speaker 2>were painted by ancient European people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had probably a somewhat similar,</v>

2091
01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:21.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shamanistic spiritual and hunting</v>

2092
01:38:21.601 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 2>relationship with these other animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2093
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:25.913
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2094
01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:27.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time I went deer hunting,</v>

2095
01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I really do believe that like locking</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes on that deer and about being about</v>

2096
01:38:33.011 --> 01:38:33.844
<v Speaker 3>to shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>

2097
01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:37.420
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was some weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experience in some sort of a</v>

2098
01:38:37.421 --> 01:38:39.910
<v Speaker 3>strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost felt like I had taken a drug</v>

2099
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:44.800
<v Speaker 3>because I felt like there was some</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange connection or some strange</v>

2100
01:38:44.801 --> 01:38:48.640
<v Speaker 3>frequency that I had tuned into that</v>
<v Speaker 3>never been a part of before.</v>

2101
01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I'd never experienced that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I could,</v>

2102
01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a protein bar in my pocket.</v>

2103
01:38:54.071 --> 01:38:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I can go back to camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a cooler full of food.</v>

2104
01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.910
<v Speaker 3>I was still pretty detached even while</v>
<v Speaker 3>being interconnected.</v>

2105
01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:05.900
<v Speaker 3>But those people that painted those</v>
<v Speaker 3>paintings on the walls in the caves in</v>

2106
01:39:05.901 --> 01:39:09.190
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were desperately connected,</v>

2107
01:39:09.191 --> 01:39:14.191
<v Speaker 3>intensely connected and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>without the burden of our are are these</v>

2108
01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:21.280
<v Speaker 3>sort of strange moral ideas we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what's okay to eat and what's not</v>

2109
01:39:21.281 --> 01:39:23.560
<v Speaker 3>okay to eat and what's ethical and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's not ethical.</v>

2110
01:39:23.890 --> 01:39:25.450
<v Speaker 3>They were free from those burdens.</v>

2111
01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:30.010
<v Speaker 2>And yet in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in hunting cultures for thousands of</v>

2112
01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:32.860
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey has been surrounded by ceremony,</v>

2113
01:39:32.861 --> 01:39:36.280
<v Speaker 2>right and ritual and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been very much part of the religion</v>

2114
01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:38.680
<v Speaker 2>celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

2115
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:40.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2116
01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.260
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sending the hunters out and</v>

2117
01:39:44.261 --> 01:39:49.261
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies for welcoming them back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you are out there doing violence</v>

2118
01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.280
<v Speaker 2>to another large mammal and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies and those sort of a religious</v>

2119
01:39:57.671 --> 01:40:02.671
<v Speaker 2>or spiritual practices are different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from but also kind of similar to how</v>

2120
01:40:03.671 --> 01:40:07.300
<v Speaker 2>we've dealt again in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in big time history,</v>

2121
01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:09.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the large scale,</v>

2122
01:40:09.371 --> 01:40:11.140
<v Speaker 2>how we've dealt with warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2123
01:40:11.141 --> 01:40:14.740
<v Speaker 2>how you send a warrior out and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome on warrior back into the</v>

2124
01:40:14.741 --> 01:40:17.530
<v Speaker 2>community after he's gone out and done</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence to other human,</v>

2125
01:40:17.531 --> 01:40:19.540
<v Speaker 2>to other humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that case is different.</v>

2126
01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.430
<v Speaker 2>And yet they're also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2127
01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:23.640
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing two other animal people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

2128
01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:25.150
<v Speaker 2>the buffalo people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dear people,</v>

2129
01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:28.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is still a similar,</v>

2130
01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral ambiguity about this,</v>

2131
01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2132
01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:37.240
<v Speaker 2>they were free in a sense from some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baggage we carry now.</v>

2133
01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

2134
01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:44.220
<v Speaker 2>But was there still moral ambiguity</v>
<v Speaker 2>about taking life and needing to respect</v>

2135
01:40:45.611 --> 01:40:48.580
<v Speaker 2>that animal by using it fully?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think so.</v>

2136
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.820
<v Speaker 3>There was ambiguity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was certainly probably a</v>

2137
01:40:51.821 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 3>deeper reverence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2138
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and an understanding of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these were inevitable decisions that</v>

2139
01:40:57.551 --> 01:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>people had a Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's to defend your life against</v>

2140
01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:03.640
<v Speaker 1>other humans that want to take your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can take their life instead,</v>

2141
01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 1>or whether it was to eat an animal that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hunted.</v>

2142
01:41:07.210 --> 01:41:08.920
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were sort of unavoidable.</v>

2143
01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2144
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what year do you think it was for?</v>

2145
01:41:13.781 --> 01:41:18.460
<v Speaker 1>The first Vegan was invented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was it the eighties.</v>

2146
01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably tell you earlier than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2147
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Sixties could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2148
01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:26.080
<v Speaker 1>But it had to be within a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2149
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean vegetarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been around for a long time.</v>

2150
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.300
<v Speaker 1>It's been around for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even here,</v>

2151
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean since the 18 hundreds came over</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of this Christian group from,</v>

2152
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:37.810
<v Speaker 1>from England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2153
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and has been around in other parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world for much longer,</v>

2154
01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in India and other parts of the world.</v>

2155
01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veganism is I think a relatively new</v>

2156
01:41:47.411 --> 01:41:50.770
<v Speaker 1>invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tammy's got to answer the Vegan society.</v>

2157
01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.240
<v Speaker 1>1944.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2158
01:41:52.241 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 1>A couple of decades off the first modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>day vegans,</v>

2159
01:41:54.521 --> 01:41:58.720
<v Speaker 1>in November of 1944,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Watson called a meeting with five</v>

2160
01:41:58.721 --> 01:42:03.721
<v Speaker 1>other nondairy vegetarians including</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elise Shrigley to discuss nondairy</v>

2161
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:09.050
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian diets and lifestyles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2162
01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he died of a common cold a week</v>

2163
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:13.743
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

2164
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:22.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's what he was a non dairy eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian in 1944 that was back before</v>

2165
01:42:23.861 --> 01:42:26.890
<v Speaker 1>they really totally understood how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your vitamins and what the amino</v>

2166
01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:31.891
<v Speaker 1>acid profiles of vegetables were too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So taking somewhere chances back then.</v>

2167
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2168
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I probably had very little little idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing nutritionally and</v>

2169
01:42:37.211 --> 01:42:40.870
<v Speaker 1>well that's the weird thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people like the show a picture of a</v>

2170
01:42:40.871 --> 01:42:43.450
<v Speaker 1>gorilla and show the gorilla only eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

2171
01:42:43.451 --> 01:42:44.600
<v Speaker 1>you can do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2172
01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not gross.</v>

2173
01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Try feeding the cat on the vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go blind.</v>

2174
01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did not.</v>

2175
01:42:50.290 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 1>They did not do do well and then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>still do it.</v>

2176
01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard you were talking about that on</v>

2177
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:57.400
<v Speaker 1>one of your shows reading about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2178
01:42:57.401 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I was reading another article about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2179
01:42:59.231 --> 01:43:02.140
<v Speaker 1>this morning about Vegan cat owners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2180
01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:03.613
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky.</v>

2181
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Blind.</v>

2182

<v Speaker 1>They must eat well.</v>

2184
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.760
<v Speaker 1>So much so that they actually have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>add taurine to cat food because a lot of</v>

2185
01:43:15.161 --> 01:43:20.161
<v Speaker 1>cat food just in the process of loses</v>
<v Speaker 1>that loses taurine like they're brutal.</v>

2186
01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:23.890
<v Speaker 1>They are the fucking cleanup crew of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

2187
01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.010
<v Speaker 1>The cats and anything with a limp gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken out.</v>

2188
01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have these two cute fluffy ragdoll</v>

2189
01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:32.590
<v Speaker 1>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the sweetest cats in the world,</v>

2190
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.770
<v Speaker 1>but they're fucking vicious man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're vicious to each other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They definitely a vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the catch something outside.</v>

2192
01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I had kept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my cat was 18 years old and she killed a</v>

2193
01:43:42.581 --> 01:43:44.590
<v Speaker 1>bird in the courtyard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Teen.</v>

2195
01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.430
<v Speaker 1>The estimates on the number of wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>birds,</v>

2196
01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>songbirds that are killed by cats,</v>

2197
01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:54.270

<v Speaker 1>both domestic and feral in the states is</v>

<v Speaker 1>the biggest threat,</v>

2201
01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's estimated to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest threat to a wild songbirds in</v>

2202
01:44:07.131 --> 01:44:10.430
<v Speaker 1>North America because cas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are hunters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They are hardcore and there's way too</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All my God.</v>

2208
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Cats that live in the wild or indoor</v>
<v Speaker 1>pets allowed to roam outdoors,</v>

2209
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:34.300

<v Speaker 1>What a crazy animal a cat is.</v>

2216
01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:59.930
<v Speaker 1>They're just these little killers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow us to take care of them and they</v>

2217
01:44:59.931 --> 01:45:02.060
<v Speaker 1>pick them up and they per,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just can't eat you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>saber tooth tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:13.430
<v Speaker 1>My friend's a cop and he said one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>craziest things was where they would</v>

2222
01:45:13.431 --> 01:45:17.960
<v Speaker 1>find people that had died in their house</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have gats like conscious,</v>

2223
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.020
<v Speaker 1>go right for your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat your face off.</v>

2224
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 1>So they'd find this person who had died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2225
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:26.060
<v Speaker 1>we could go and they just ran out of cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2226
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:31.550
<v Speaker 1>The cat just eats your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this domestic oh six point</v>

2227
01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:37.460
<v Speaker 1>9000000020.7 billion mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly mice.</v>

2228
01:45:37.461 --> 01:45:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Shrews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbits,</v>

2229
01:45:38.361 --> 01:45:40.880
<v Speaker 1>squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what a volt aa is.</v>

2230
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Vol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:45:41.851 --> 01:45:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a mouse a little bit each year</v>

2232
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:49.330
<v Speaker 1>according to a study published last year</v>
<v Speaker 1>in nature communications that you saying</v>

2233
01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:55.300
<v Speaker 1>between 1.4 and 3.7 billion birds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>6.9 and 20.7 billion mammals.</v>

2234
01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:03.220
<v Speaker 1>While I'm not a big fan of mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fuck 'em I like cats.</v>

2235
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not big into mice.</v>

2236
01:46:07.090 --> 01:46:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I pick sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all pick.</v>

2237
01:46:09.341 --> 01:46:10.220
<v Speaker 1>So we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

2238
01:46:10.221 --> 01:46:11.054
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2239
01:46:11.190 --> 01:46:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we have a cat that's part of our</v>

2240
01:46:14.661 --> 01:46:17.690
<v Speaker 1>family or a dog as part of our family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously they're,</v>

2241
01:46:17.710 --> 01:46:21.560
<v Speaker 1>they're very different species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they become family,</v>

2242
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another vegetarian argument</v>

2243
01:46:26.271 --> 01:46:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that has a real logic to it and has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic to it of well,</v>

2244
01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:33.290
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't eat your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you eat a deer or a cow?</v>

2245
01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2246
01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:36.043
<v Speaker 5>And yet</v>

2247
01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:40.980
<v Speaker 1>we as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a species,</v>

2248
01:46:41.010 --> 01:46:42.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very tribal.</v>

2249
01:46:42.330 --> 01:46:46.230
<v Speaker 1>We identify with a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's all humans or whether we</v>

2250
01:46:46.231 --> 01:46:47.130
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2251
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 1>will that become dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2252
01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hunt with us or,</v>

2253
01:46:51.170 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 1>or cats that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we adopt for various reasons and</v>

2254
01:46:54.061 --> 01:46:55.800
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2255
01:46:55.801 --> 01:46:59.010
<v Speaker 1>that group becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2256
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have your family.</v>

2257
01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.130
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2258
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:03.510
<v Speaker 1>if you ever watched that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2259
01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Penn and teller show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2260
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.570
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an episode on animal activists</v>

2261
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and the people for the ethical treatment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of animals,</v>

2262
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:15.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the roots of their argument</v>

2263
01:47:15.601 --> 01:47:17.790
<v Speaker 1>and their ideas are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want pets.</v>

2264
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't think we should have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>captive animals.</v>

2265
01:47:20.731 --> 01:47:22.260
<v Speaker 1>No pets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pet dogs,</v>

2266
01:47:22.261 --> 01:47:25.050
<v Speaker 1>no pet cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's free to roam and do as it</v>

2267
01:47:25.051 --> 01:47:26.780
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2268
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.040
<v Speaker 1>and no eating any animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

2269
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:30.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of,</v>

2270
01:47:30.781 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 1>where are we going to live in then?</v>

2271
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2272
01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:36.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a Cleveland Amery who,</v>

2273
01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.370
<v Speaker 1>one of the founders of the fund for</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

2274
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I believe I have this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2275
01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.750
<v Speaker 1>had a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2276
01:47:42.751 --> 01:47:43.560
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2277
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:48.510
<v Speaker 1>the future world and it was separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators and prey separate them.</v>

2278
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wild,</v>

2279
01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:53.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do the predators eat magic magic</v>

2280
01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.370
<v Speaker 1>unicorns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2281
01:47:56.371 --> 01:47:57.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2282
01:47:57.331 --> 01:48:00.540
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he wanted to stop any sort of cruelty</v>

2283
01:48:00.570 --> 01:48:01.760
<v Speaker 1>even in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2284
01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you're gonna get cannibalism</v>

2285
01:48:04.381 --> 01:48:05.790
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2286
01:48:05.791 --> 01:48:08.970
<v Speaker 1>there's already a huge problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannibalism and the bear community like</v>

2287
01:48:08.971 --> 01:48:11.670
<v Speaker 1>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when male bears come out of dens,</v>

2288
01:48:11.671 --> 01:48:14.580
<v Speaker 1>they actively search for cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to eat cubs.</v>

2289
01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the first things they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it to try to bring the female to</v>

2290
01:48:18.181 --> 01:48:20.370
<v Speaker 1>estrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also do it because they're</v>

2291
01:48:20.371 --> 01:48:22.320
<v Speaker 1>hungry and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cannibals.</v>

2292
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:23.990
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2293
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:27.540
<v Speaker 1>in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some friends of mine run a hunting camp</v>

2294
01:48:27.541 --> 01:48:32.541
<v Speaker 1>up there and they saw a male bear kill a</v>
<v Speaker 1>female bear's cub.</v>

2295
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the female chased the mail off the</v>

2296
01:48:36.241 --> 01:48:41.241
<v Speaker 1>carcass and then the female finished it</v>
<v Speaker 1>off her own baby.</v>

2297
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Speaker 1>She's eight at once it was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She started eating it and they were</v>

2298
01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2299
01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And they said they had been around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2300
01:48:47.761 --> 01:48:49.650
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live in northern Alberta.</v>

2301
01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been around some animals and</v>

2302
01:48:52.321 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 1>wildlife their whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

2303
01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 1>eat free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even for us,</v>

2304
01:48:55.021 --> 01:48:56.370
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2305
01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Because there's really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentation and research also,</v>

2307
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that animals and not just,</v>

2308
01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orkos there's some dolphin,</v>

2309
01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:10.930
<v Speaker 2>something that we assume is or bill or</v>
<v Speaker 2>have good evidence that they're at a</v>

2310
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:13.170
<v Speaker 2>really intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2311
01:49:13.730 --> 01:49:18.060
<v Speaker 2>that they have a wide emotional range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2312
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:23.270
<v Speaker 2>and including grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including mourning for the death of</v>

2313
01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>family members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including their,</v>

2314
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the calf.</v>

2315
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:28.870
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2316
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:30.600
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2317
01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:33.990
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate things that happens is that</v>

2318
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.570
<v Speaker 2>when we get into these black and white</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggles,</v>

2319
01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:39.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters versus animal rights activists</v>

2320
01:49:39.001 --> 01:49:42.060
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that and he's similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of black and white,</v>

2321
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:47.620
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>each side has its argument and each site</v>

2322
01:49:47.621 --> 01:49:52.150
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really want to acknowledge too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much that there might be some validity</v>

2323
01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:57.690
<v Speaker 2>to either the argument on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just to the reality of the world.</v>

2324
01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Like animals have feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just they can physically suffer,</v>

2325
01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:04.730
<v Speaker 2>but they have emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2326
01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.580
<v Speaker 2>they have emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see it in your dog.</v>

2327
01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:11.020
<v Speaker 2>You can see it in wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they have emotions and that's</v>

2328
01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.900
<v Speaker 2>tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And often on the hunting side it'd be,</v>

2329
01:50:13.901 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just so-called anthropomorphism.</v>

2330
01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:16.990
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2331
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:21.460
<v Speaker 2>you're just projecting human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While there's pretty good research on a</v>

2332
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:25.410
<v Speaker 2>wide range of species that they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions as well as the ability to</v>

2333
01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:28.520
<v Speaker 2>physically feel pain and suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2334
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:33.900
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really helpful when we get</v>

2335
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:37.450
<v Speaker 2>into these kinds of conversations across</v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines to be able to at least</v>

2336
01:50:37.451 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2337
01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:42.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or acknowledge where,</v>

2338
01:50:42.641 --> 01:50:43.474
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2339
01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Peta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2340
01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:50.210
<v Speaker 2>or other animal rights groups at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>not acknowledge where they're coming</v>

2341
01:50:50.211 --> 01:50:52.400
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not agree with the arguments</v>

2342
01:50:52.410 --> 01:50:54.170
<v Speaker 2>that are conclusions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2343
01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.790
<v Speaker 2>same as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people might not agree with you</v>

2344
01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.930
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2345
01:50:56.931 --> 01:50:59.510
<v Speaker 2>but at least acknowledge there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you hunting,</v>

2346
01:50:59.511 --> 01:51:02.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a valuable experience and an ethical</v>

2347
01:51:02.991 --> 01:51:04.940
<v Speaker 2>impulse to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2348
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:07.460
<v Speaker 2>confront what it means to eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2349
01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:11.720
<v Speaker 2>for Vegetarians and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and animal rights activists of various</v>

2350
01:51:11.721 --> 01:51:15.020
<v Speaker 2>kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an impulse to prevent suffering</v>

2351
01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.220
<v Speaker 2>and respect life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2352
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:22.700
<v Speaker 2>they're honorable and understandable</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulses on both sides.</v>

2353
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Even if we don't agree with you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what all the kids,</v>

2354
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.621
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2355
01:51:26.621 --> 01:51:29.410
<v Speaker 3>and I think it speaks to what we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier about reward</v>

2356
01:51:29.411 --> 01:51:33.280
<v Speaker 3>systems that are in place to ensure</v>
<v Speaker 3>survival and ensure certain types of</v>

2357
01:51:33.281 --> 01:51:35.620
<v Speaker 3>behavior and activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it only makes sense that an</v>

2358
01:51:35.621 --> 01:51:38.920
<v Speaker 3>animal would feel remorse if it's child</v>
<v Speaker 3>got killed.</v>

2359
01:51:39.370 --> 01:51:42.160
<v Speaker 3>That's why you take care of it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect it.</v>

2360
01:51:42.161 --> 01:51:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you've ever seen a mother cow</v>
<v Speaker 3>around it's calves,</v>

2361
01:51:46.331 --> 01:51:49.620
<v Speaker 3>if you go near those calves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mother will go crazy and it's,</v>

2362
01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:53.560
<v Speaker 3>there's built in systems that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>established to make sure that these</v>

2363
01:51:53.561 --> 01:51:58.150
<v Speaker 3>animals continue to procreate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to stay alive and make sure</v>

2364
01:51:58.151 --> 01:52:01.600
<v Speaker 3>they have healthy populations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the same reason why our</v>

2365
01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 3>emotions are in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all really kind of a grand</v>

2366
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 3>scheme to ensure breeding and ensure</v>
<v Speaker 3>community and ensure all these that mean</v>

2367
01:52:09.851 --> 01:52:13.630
<v Speaker 3>we will call it emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll call it civilization,</v>

2368
01:52:13.631 --> 01:52:16.300
<v Speaker 3>we'll call it communication between</v>
<v Speaker 3>sentient beings.</v>

2369
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:20.830
<v Speaker 3>But really it's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is all these different systems that are</v>

2370
01:52:20.831 --> 01:52:23.770
<v Speaker 3>established to make sure that we stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

2371
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:25.690
<v Speaker 3>we keep together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we breed,</v>

2372
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:30.460
<v Speaker 3>we ensure that we stay alive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to have food and make sure we</v>

2373
01:52:30.461 --> 01:52:32.800
<v Speaker 3>make more people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean it's,</v>

2374
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to break it down it's crew</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say like,</v>

2375
01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2376
01:52:36.301 --> 01:52:38.890
<v Speaker 3>all romance songs and every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every book on,</v>

2377
01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.630
<v Speaker 3>on companionship is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every movie that shows an awesome</v>

2378
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:46.940
<v Speaker 3>relationship is just a ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological trick that's established to</v>

2379
01:52:46.941 --> 01:52:49.580
<v Speaker 3>make sure that you continue to stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>alive long enough to make more people.</v>

2380
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:54.710
<v Speaker 3>But really that's kind of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2381
01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:55.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2382
01:52:55.441 --> 01:53:00.441
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to break it down so much to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because I think there's beauty in</v>

2383
01:53:00.531 --> 01:53:01.490
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2384
01:53:01.491 --> 01:53:03.710
<v Speaker 3>there's beauty and love and oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2385
01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.430
<v Speaker 3>in a strange way there's beauty and</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching that grizzly bear mall,</v>

2386
01:53:07.431 --> 01:53:09.050
<v Speaker 3>that Moose in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>driveway,</v>

2387
01:53:09.051 --> 01:53:11.630
<v Speaker 3>this beauty and watching that Martin</v>
<v Speaker 3>chase down that rabbit.</v>

2388
01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to be the rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not really sure I want to be the</v>

2389
01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:15.830
<v Speaker 3>martin either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2390
01:53:15.831 --> 01:53:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2391
01:53:16.901 --> 01:53:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I have to identify with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to appreciate the spectacle,</v>

2392
01:53:20.650 --> 01:53:23.330
<v Speaker 3>the amazing spectacle that nature is</v>
<v Speaker 3>providing.</v>

2393
01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.220
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2394
01:53:25.210 --> 01:53:27.590
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we throw the word awesome around a lot</v>

2395
01:53:27.591 --> 01:53:28.340
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2396
01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:29.720
<v Speaker 3>the last 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years.</v>

2397
01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.040
<v Speaker 3>But the old word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awe know the power of that.</v>

2398
01:53:34.041 --> 01:53:37.040
<v Speaker 3>And there's beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also sometimes borderline</v>

2399
01:53:37.041 --> 01:53:38.510
<v Speaker 3>horror fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2400
01:53:40.130 --> 01:53:45.130
<v Speaker 3>but nature is awesome in that life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>death and our own lives and deaths,</v>

2401
01:53:45.970 --> 01:53:47.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the creation of life,</v>

2402
01:53:47.061 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 3>the taking of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching it happen around us doing it,</v>

2403
01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:53.300
<v Speaker 3>it's theirs off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's beauty.</v>

2404
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:55.910
<v Speaker 3>There is undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undeniable,</v>

2405
01:53:55.911 --> 01:53:56.780
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2406
01:53:56.781 --> 01:54:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I watched this documentary on Komodo</v>
<v Speaker 3>dragons and they're intense.</v>

2407
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so gross.</v>

2408
01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.320
<v Speaker 3>But they're so awesome and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>gross.</v>

2409
01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Snus and one of the things about it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they will bite like a water buffalo</v>

2410
01:54:10.191 --> 01:54:14.200
<v Speaker 3>on the leg and their mouth is so toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really toxic,</v>

2411
01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:18.200
<v Speaker 3>so toxic with bacteria in their saliva,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sub funky,</v>

2412
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:21.230
<v Speaker 3>that just one bite and that thing's</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

2413
01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.390
<v Speaker 3>So they just follow it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait around,</v>

2414
01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:27.380
<v Speaker 3>and they wait around a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And slowly but surely all the toxic shit</v>

2415
01:54:27.381 --> 01:54:28.250
<v Speaker 3>from their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2416
01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:29.091
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2417
01:54:29.091 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2418
01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:33.290
<v Speaker 3>that's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even see their teeth.</v>

2419
01:54:33.291 --> 01:54:35.780
<v Speaker 3>And that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like look at the one above it where you</v>

2420
01:54:35.781 --> 01:54:38.570
<v Speaker 3>see their teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2421
01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:41.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a crazy animal.</v>

2422
01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:45.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's another thing that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing and beautiful is just the</v>

2423
01:54:45.741 --> 01:54:49.580
<v Speaker 3>biodiversity of the world that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

2424
01:54:49.581 --> 01:54:51.740
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to keep bringing up the same</v>

2425
01:54:51.741 --> 01:54:53.450
<v Speaker 3>theme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think we've done ourselves a</v>

2426
01:54:53.451 --> 01:54:55.880
<v Speaker 3>disservice by creating these cities.</v>

2427
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:59.000
<v Speaker 3>We've done ourselves an amazing service</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>

2428
01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.390
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the Fox,</v>

2429
01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:04.250
<v Speaker 3>which ruled off of his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking,</v>

2430
01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I was like drastic park or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be the monster.</v>

2431
01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Komodo dragons are funky slide coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of his mouth.</v>

2432
01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.430
<v Speaker 3>But we've done ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2433
01:55:13.431 --> 01:55:15.560
<v Speaker 3>we've made an incredible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2434
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:18.500
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to go out and hunt our</v>

2435
01:55:18.501 --> 01:55:20.170
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of that we could develop by</v>

2436
01:55:20.171 --> 01:55:22.430
<v Speaker 3>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could figure out how to make four g</v>

2437
01:55:22.431 --> 01:55:27.431
<v Speaker 3>lte and better laptops and cars that</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive themselves and all this cool shit</v>

2438
01:55:27.831 --> 01:55:29.300
<v Speaker 3>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

2439
01:55:29.301 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 3>It's great because without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without our easy access to food,</v>

2440
01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:36.950
<v Speaker 3>none,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one would have the free time to</v>

2441
01:55:36.951 --> 01:55:40.640
<v Speaker 3>develop all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's imperative that we do</v>

2442
01:55:40.641 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 3>have cities imperative that we do have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an easy supply of food because</v>

2443
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna get all this electronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment and all this stuff that we</v>

2444
01:55:48.481 --> 01:55:50.760
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just not going to get it if</v>

2445
01:55:50.761 --> 01:55:54.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody has to forage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've,</v>

2446
01:55:54.210 --> 01:55:59.210
<v Speaker 1>we've enriched our lives in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in doing so,</v>

2447
01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 1>we've somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another forgotten that there were a</v>

2448
01:56:02.521 --> 01:56:06.150
<v Speaker 1>part of this wild world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're part of wildlife,</v>

2449
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:10.380
<v Speaker 1>we are wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just not wild anymore.</v>

2450
01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:15.660
<v Speaker 1>We're wa or if we are wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not wild in the sense that the way</v>

2451
01:56:15.961 --> 01:56:18.090
<v Speaker 1>we look at the rest of the wild world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2452
01:56:18.091 --> 01:56:19.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we are,</v>

2453
01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:21.750
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean there's,</v>

2454
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.600
<v Speaker 2>there's arguments in anthropology that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

2455
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:28.110
<v Speaker 2>there were lots of societies that had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot more leisure time than we do.</v>

2456
01:56:28.770 --> 01:56:29.551
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

2457
01:56:29.551 --> 01:56:30.630
<v Speaker 2>gathering societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>

2458
01:56:30.631 --> 01:56:31.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to five hours a day,</v>

2459
01:56:31.861 --> 01:56:34.800
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote working hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering and had lots of time for,</v>

2460
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:37.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies and all kinds of other</v>

2461
01:56:37.831 --> 01:56:39.450
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on where you are in the world</v>

2462
01:56:39.451 --> 01:56:40.860
<v Speaker 2>and how harsh the conditions were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2463
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:42.150
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2464
01:56:42.151 --> 01:56:43.770
<v Speaker 2>sort of the original leisure society</v>
<v Speaker 2>May,</v>

2465
01:56:43.771 --> 01:56:46.250
<v Speaker 2>it may have predated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did agriculture,</v>

2466
01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:47.620
<v Speaker 2>certainly they had no i-phones and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2467
01:56:47.621 --> 01:56:48.454
<v Speaker 2>maybe that was a blessing,</v>

2468
01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:51.220
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But four or five hours of hunting and</v>

2469
01:56:51.221 --> 01:56:53.680
<v Speaker 1>gathering is exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2470
01:56:53.681 --> 01:56:56.320
<v Speaker 1>and you really don't have enough time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a car.</v>

2471
01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:57.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no cars.</v>

2472
01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After you've figured that out,</v>

2473
01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:01.240
<v Speaker 1>after you've done your hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering,</v>

2474
01:57:01.241 --> 01:57:04.600
<v Speaker 1>then it's about cooking and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also there's no days off because you</v>

2475
01:57:04.601 --> 01:57:05.860
<v Speaker 1>don't have any refrigeration.</v>

2476
01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depending on,</v>

2477
01:57:07.361 --> 01:57:08.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on your climate.</v>

2478
01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>

2479
01:57:09.190 --> 01:57:11.320
<v Speaker 2>they could try things and do certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2480
01:57:11.321 --> 01:57:13.320
<v Speaker 2>but clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly not the,</v>

2481
01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:17.050
<v Speaker 2>not a frigidaire around the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what you're talking about,</v>

2482
01:57:17.051 --> 01:57:20.590
<v Speaker 2>about whether it's cities or just modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

2483
01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:23.800
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>high tech,</v>

2484
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:27.070
<v Speaker 2>high speed world that most of us live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2485
01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.950
<v Speaker 2>where many of us don't feel like we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>much free time and we're running around</v>

2486
01:57:29.951 --> 01:57:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and doing all these things in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually.</v>

2487
01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talk to people who become hunters</v>

2488
01:57:36.581 --> 01:57:37.414
<v Speaker 2>as adults,</v>

2489
01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:41.580
<v Speaker 2>by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of why they did it.</v>

2490
01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.070
<v Speaker 2>They want it to reconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:45.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of why they garden.</v>

2492
01:57:46.050 --> 01:57:48.780
<v Speaker 2>It's part of why they raised chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of why they do all sorts of</v>

2493
01:57:48.781 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 2>other things that you understand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>value to.</v>

2494
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 2>They want to get back in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

2495
01:57:56.220 --> 01:58:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Not only the hands on skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the world they inhabit.</v>

2496
01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:06.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the domesticated concretized city</v>

2497
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:07.790
<v Speaker 2>concretize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2498
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you know that word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the pavement,</v>

2499
01:58:10.501 --> 01:58:13.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the payment into nature and</v>

2500
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.560
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a little garden patch in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your backyard or hunting around the</v>

2501
01:58:19.801 --> 01:58:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Missouri breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2502
01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:26.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a sense of wanting to reconnect</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that all of these practices,</v>

2503
01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gardening,</v>

2504
01:58:28.171 --> 01:58:32.280
<v Speaker 2>raising chickens in part are like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidote</v>

2505
01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:35.140
<v Speaker 1>to modern life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2506
01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:38.170
<v Speaker 1>people want to reconnect to some of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it,</v>

2507
01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 1>or are we clinging to the past and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to ward</v>

2508
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.600
<v Speaker 2>off the inevitable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2509
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Are we trying to ward it off this</v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable symbiotic relationship we're</v>

2510
01:58:48.251 --> 01:58:50.370
<v Speaker 2>going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers are going to be a planet or</v>

2511
01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:51.280
<v Speaker 2>hoard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2512
01:58:51.730 --> 01:58:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2513
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:54.420
<v Speaker 2>have you read Richard Lubes work at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2514
01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.100
<v Speaker 2>He um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a journalist,</v>

2515
01:58:57.101 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I believe for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His first really famous book was called</v>

2516
01:59:00.821 --> 01:59:03.940
<v Speaker 2>last child in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then his followup book was called</v>

2517
01:59:03.941 --> 01:59:06.560
<v Speaker 2>the nature principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long ago?</v>

2518
01:59:06.561 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2519
01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.900
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last child in the woods came out,</v>

2520
01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.990
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2006.</v>

2521
01:59:13.991 --> 01:59:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong about that date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>

2522
01:59:15.491 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 2>we'll know in a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2523
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2524
01:59:19.511 --> 01:59:23.560
<v Speaker 2>his argument is in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you spell the last name?</v>

2525
01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:24.940
<v Speaker 2>L.</v>
<v Speaker 2>O.</v>

2526
01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:25.990
<v Speaker 2>U.</v>
<v Speaker 2>V right there.</v>

2527
01:59:25.991 --> 01:59:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks very serious.</v>

2528
01:59:27.881 --> 01:59:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

2529
01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:30.850
<v Speaker 2>he's a neat guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2530
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:37.290
<v Speaker 2>and his argument is that we all need</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature for our mental,</v>

2531
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:39.760
<v Speaker 2>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>

2532
01:59:39.761 --> 01:59:40.630
<v Speaker 2>spiritual health.</v>

2533
01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:45.160
<v Speaker 2>First he focused on kids and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved it to focusing on 2005,</v>

2534
01:59:45.161 --> 01:59:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was the first book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2535
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:52.800
<v Speaker 2>and he says that actually the more high</v>
<v Speaker 2>tech we get,</v>

2536
01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:57.880
<v Speaker 2>the more we need these sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

2537
01:59:57.881 --> 01:59:58.251
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2538
01:59:58.251 --> 02:00:02.020
<v Speaker 2>he's not a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does fish and he spends a lot of</v>

2539
02:00:02.021 --> 02:00:07.021
<v Speaker 2>time outdoors and that we need that</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurologically mean,</v>

2540
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.420
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2541
02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:13.030
<v Speaker 2>in some romantic sort of throwback</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy.</v>

2542
02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.970
<v Speaker 2>But we deeply need it because we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>

2543
02:00:15.971 --> 02:00:19.270
<v Speaker 2>And what does he use to establish that</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that we need it?</v>

2544
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got all kinds of,</v>

2545
02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:23.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research and you know,</v>

2546
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:25.970
<v Speaker 2>umpteen citations of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different sorts of,</v>

2547
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000
<v Speaker 2>of studies and cultures and different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that happen to kids at first.</v>

2548
02:00:31.481 --> 02:00:33.190
<v Speaker 2>And his first book and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then two adults,</v>

2549
02:00:33.191 --> 02:00:36.580
<v Speaker 2>if we're deprived of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're always in front of a screen,</v>

2550
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:40.150
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're just never out in the dirt,</v>

2551
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:42.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never out in the woods.</v>

2552
02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we certainly evolved in the real world</v>

2553
02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:48.880
<v Speaker 2>in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in cities.</v>

2554
02:00:48.881 --> 02:00:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2555
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:52.240
<v Speaker 2>and our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2556
02:00:52.241 --> 02:00:57.241
<v Speaker 2>we're hardwired for that three</v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensional textured,</v>

2557
02:00:59.340 --> 02:00:59.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2558
02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's textures in the city</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

2559
02:01:01.511 --> 02:01:04.060
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that kind of natural surrounding,</v>

2560
02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm in whatever climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what really nourishes us,</v>

2561
02:01:10.721 --> 02:01:15.721
<v Speaker 2>not just physically in terms of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but keeps us sort of sane at some level</v>

2562
02:01:16.450 --> 02:01:19.360
<v Speaker 2>as a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still saying,</v>

2563
02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:21.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the argument.</v>

2564
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Are we saying and is saying even a re a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rational request or,</v>

2565
02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:29.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2566
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:30.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope is it,</v>

2567
02:01:30.731 --> 02:01:32.040
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is saying?</v>

2568
02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:35.800
<v Speaker 2>What is sanity and our sanity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's health in comparison to the</v>

2569
02:01:35.801 --> 02:01:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Saturday of someone who lives in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribal environment in the Amazon?</v>

2570
02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they</v>

2571
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>would look at us and laugh and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2572
02:01:41.931 --> 02:01:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not saying you people are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2573
02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>He went crazy for 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet.</v>

2574
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2575
02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's right because I don't</v>

2576
02:01:49.011 --> 02:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>want to live in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2577
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.931
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2578
02:01:50.931 --> 02:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even have tvs and it's</v>

2579
02:01:54.261 --> 02:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to have that either or like</v>

2580
02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>now in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2581
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>or where in the Amazonian jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2582
02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not some kind of romantic</v>

2583
02:02:06.201 --> 02:02:06.711
<v Speaker 1>throwback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2584
02:02:06.711 --> 02:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>we should go back to the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2585
02:02:08.241 --> 02:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that these experiences that you</v>

2586
02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experiences that you have gardening</v>

2587
02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>with the experiences you have hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>are deeply human,</v>

2588
02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>valuable experiences for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to not have them have a culture and</v>

2589
02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>they have an individual life or a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>society that has no connection.</v>

2590
02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It's all supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all drive thru,</v>

2591
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>but big MACs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2592
02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>during the time that we're not hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not gathering and we're not</v>

2593
02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's time for philosophical pursuits,</v>

2594
02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>creation of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of writing and different</v>

2595
02:02:48.261 --> 02:02:51.770
<v Speaker 1>communication and wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations over meals.</v>

2596
02:02:51.771 --> 02:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>You had no part in creating and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>building of community and the bonding of</v>

2597
02:02:55.491 --> 02:02:58.880
<v Speaker 1>friendships in the evolving of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of these things can be</v>

2598
02:02:58.881 --> 02:03:02.480
<v Speaker 1>thought of by some people as being more</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable than the collection of food.</v>

2599
02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2600
02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could be,</v>

2601
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the risk is in having it be like,</v>

2602
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:13.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to go back to the woods and live</v>

2603
02:03:13.521 --> 02:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>in the woods to be real humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2604
02:03:16.170 --> 02:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2605
02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2606
02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:21.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or say that's just ancient history.</v>

2607
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop having these fantasies about the</v>

2608
02:03:24.561 --> 02:03:25.130
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

2609
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Just live in our cyborg future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2610
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>To be healthy human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's uh,</v>

2611
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to walk in a park or being part of</v>

2612
02:03:33.171 --> 02:03:35.480
<v Speaker 1>a community garden in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to leave the city.</v>

2613
02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You can have some experiences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection with the,</v>

2614
02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>

2615
02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:41.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In La,</v>

2616
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:44.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have some,</v>

2617
02:03:44.661 --> 02:03:45.411
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2618
02:03:45.411 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is like a reoccurring theme</v>

2619
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are we,</v>

2620
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing as a race,</v>

2621
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:55.340
<v Speaker 1>as a species?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could step outside of</v>

2622
02:03:55.341 --> 02:03:57.800
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could hover a mile above earth</v>

2623
02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:01.550
<v Speaker 1>and your objective free from any</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of our culture,</v>

2624
02:04:01.551 --> 02:04:05.300
<v Speaker 1>you are some calculating being that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of as gathering up all the data and</v>

2625
02:04:05.301 --> 02:04:08.810
<v Speaker 1>information and all the behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that you're seeing exhibited by</v>

2626
02:04:08.811 --> 02:04:11.630
<v Speaker 1>this bizarre species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this thing doing?</v>

2627
02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing is creating technology.</v>

2628
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:15.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2629
02:04:15.411 --> 02:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's involved in some sort of uh,</v>

2630
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>ever accelerating path of innovation</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever accelerating path of creating new</v>

2631
02:04:26.901 --> 02:04:30.710
<v Speaker 1>and better technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new and better devices,</v>

2632
02:04:30.711 --> 02:04:34.370
<v Speaker 1>new and better things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it works all day in order to obtain</v>

2633
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>the latest and greatest of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that therefore fueling</v>

2634
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:43.250
<v Speaker 3>the creation of these things while</v>
<v Speaker 3>longing for the past while longing for</v>

2635
02:04:43.891 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 3>some little house in the prairie type</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking situation where,</v>

2636
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:49.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody died of polio and those</v>

2637
02:04:49.621 --> 02:04:52.260
<v Speaker 3>terrible time to be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you look at it on tv and you're</v>

2638
02:04:52.261 --> 02:04:52.981
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2639
02:04:52.981 --> 02:04:55.430
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandpa.</v>

2640
02:04:55.590 --> 02:04:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2641
02:04:56.130 --> 02:04:59.460
<v Speaker 3>we long towards the simple past we</v>
<v Speaker 3>longed towards,</v>

2642
02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:02.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that would hold hands in front of</v>

2643
02:05:02.671 --> 02:05:04.600
<v Speaker 3>the dinner table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And say our prayers and,</v>

2644
02:05:04.601 --> 02:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>and everybody was a good person except</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the few bad people wore black hats.</v>

2645
02:05:08.461 --> 02:05:10.440
<v Speaker 3>You could spot him a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2646
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I think in this ever more and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>complex life.</v>

2647
02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:18.000
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we long towards this time where things</v>

2648
02:05:18.001 --> 02:05:23.001
<v Speaker 3>were simple and it's one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I believe is very appealing about</v>

2649
02:05:23.881 --> 02:05:26.340
<v Speaker 3>the idea of hunting and gathering your</v>
<v Speaker 3>own meat.</v>

2650
02:05:26.341 --> 02:05:30.000
<v Speaker 3>And it's very primally enriching because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do,</v>

2651
02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:33.870
<v Speaker 3>we do reward our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our system.</v>

2652
02:05:33.871 --> 02:05:37.380
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we give ourselves the opportunity to</v>

2653
02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:40.860
<v Speaker 3>participate in those reward systems that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are set up and they've been established</v>

2654
02:05:40.861 --> 02:05:42.720
<v Speaker 3>for thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>generations.</v>

2655
02:05:42.721 --> 02:05:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's one of the only ways.</v>

2656
02:05:44.381 --> 02:05:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2657
02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Do so and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2658
02:05:45.590 --> 02:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>that experience that you talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like locking eyes with that deer and,</v>

2659
02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:53.990
<v Speaker 2>and having that intense experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2660
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.050
<v Speaker 2>have seen at your live the intense</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of taking a life</v>

2661
02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sense as you were describing it is</v>

2662
02:06:01.701 --> 02:06:06.020
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prime wellness of that in part is a</v>

2663
02:06:06.021 --> 02:06:09.620
<v Speaker 2>sense that this is really familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2664
02:06:09.621 --> 02:06:11.480
<v Speaker 2>This is really old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2665
02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>like a cellular level memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is old,</v>

2666
02:06:14.811 --> 02:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>old stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2667
02:06:16.761 --> 02:06:17.780
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

2668
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:21.680
<v Speaker 2>when I took my first year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so shocking emotionally.</v>

2669
02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a shocking,</v>

2670
02:06:23.121 --> 02:06:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I finally succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised of the usage you try</v>

2671
02:06:26.181 --> 02:06:27.014
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2672
02:06:27.110 --> 02:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I did not succeed the first three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2673
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:32.960
<v Speaker 2>how many days were you going out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2674
02:06:32.970 --> 02:06:36.230
<v Speaker 2>it's on the main season we have in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vermont as a two week rifle season and I</v>

2675
02:06:36.231 --> 02:06:38.120
<v Speaker 2>wasn't able to hunt the full two weeks.</v>

2676
02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually it was,</v>

2677
02:06:39.730 --> 02:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than half of that time probably,</v>

2678
02:06:43.410 --> 02:06:45.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit in other seasons,</v>

2679
02:06:45.471 --> 02:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>but mainly it was in the rifle season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't really years of hunting.</v>

2680
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:53.450
<v Speaker 2>That was weeks of awning stretched out</v>
<v Speaker 2>over years.</v>

2681
02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:57.820
<v Speaker 2>But the deeper shock was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2682
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:59.660
<v Speaker 2>as you say it sort of that sense of loss</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life,</v>

2683
02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:02.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that for me it was a sense of grief that</v>

2684
02:07:03.590 --> 02:07:05.400
<v Speaker 2>this beautiful animals dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2685
02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And do I ever want to do that again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wasn't sure at first.</v>

2686
02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And you were by yourself this entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

2687
02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>When I took the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2688
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was by myself.</v>

2689
02:07:15.770 --> 02:07:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

2690
02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:24.610
<v Speaker 2>it was the process over the next few</v>
<v Speaker 2>days of,</v>

2691
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:26.890
<v Speaker 2>of butchering that dear,</v>

2692
02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:29.613
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

2693
02:07:30.650 --> 02:07:32.550
<v Speaker 2>felt really familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2694
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:34.850
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like a ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2695
02:07:34.890 --> 02:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing this,</v>

2696
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.900
<v Speaker 2>the knife and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2697
02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:42.960
<v Speaker 2>skinning and then in the kitchen with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg on and taking apart this amazing</v>

2698
02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:47.740
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these layers of muscle and bone.</v>

2699
02:07:47.741 --> 02:07:52.741
<v Speaker 2>And that is what gave me the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really old and familiar and I'll</v>

2700
02:07:58.031 --> 02:08:00.160
<v Speaker 2>probably do this again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2701
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:02.230
<v Speaker 2>in another year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not next week,</v>

2702
02:08:02.231 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 2>but next time deer season rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably hunt again.</v>

2703
02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sense of deep sort of primal</v>

2704
02:08:11.981 --> 02:08:13.700
<v Speaker 2>familiarity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2705
02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:15.100
<v Speaker 2>is common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2706
02:08:15.101 --> 02:08:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read accounts of this people who</v>

2707
02:08:18.251 --> 02:08:20.920
<v Speaker 2>are not hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who have had a sort of hunting like</v>

2708
02:08:20.921 --> 02:08:22.810
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2709
02:08:23.170 --> 02:08:26.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Monbiot or Mamby,</v>

2710
02:08:26.230 --> 02:08:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure how you say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2711
02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:31.750
<v Speaker 2>he's from the UK and has advocated for</v>
<v Speaker 2>veganism and against beginnings at</v>

2712
02:08:31.751 --> 02:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>various times and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2713
02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>or conflicted gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2714
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2715
02:08:37.481 --> 02:08:38.314
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2716
02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:41.020
<v Speaker 2>very much in ecology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental advocate,</v>

2717
02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:44.740
<v Speaker 2>he has this passage that he wrote about</v>
<v Speaker 2>having this experience of,</v>

2718
02:08:45.130 --> 02:08:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it was being with a like a spear</v>
<v Speaker 2>going after fish,</v>

2719
02:08:50.711 --> 02:08:53.590
<v Speaker 2>like flounder in shallow water and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ex,</v>

2720
02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:58.360
<v Speaker 2>his account of it is very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this felt like it was thousands of years</v>

2721
02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.720
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this primal connection with ancient</v>

2722
02:09:01.721 --> 02:09:04.630
<v Speaker 2>human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's valuable for people,</v>

2723
02:09:04.631 --> 02:09:07.840
<v Speaker 2>even if we live in a high tech world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have some connection to that.</v>

2724
02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these are genetic imprints.</v>

2725
02:09:10.670 --> 02:09:12.690
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are things that are written into</v>

2726
02:09:12.691 --> 02:09:17.490
<v Speaker 3>our code that it was really important</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you kill an animal in order to</v>

2727
02:09:17.491 --> 02:09:20.190
<v Speaker 3>survive x amount of thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

2728
02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Those people that did that and bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe they gave that genetic</v>

2729
02:09:25.111 --> 02:09:27.780
<v Speaker 3>information to their offspring and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>carried on,</v>

2730
02:09:27.781 --> 02:09:30.900
<v Speaker 3>on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you tap into it,</v>

2731
02:09:30.930 --> 02:09:33.150
<v Speaker 3>it lights up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I locked eyes,</v>

2732
02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:37.350
<v Speaker 3>that deer and the deer was bouncing</v>
<v Speaker 3>around on the side of this hill and it</v>

2733
02:09:37.351 --> 02:09:40.590
<v Speaker 3>saw me and I saw it and I locked eyes</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

2734
02:09:40.591 --> 02:09:42.330
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm looking at it through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rifle scope.</v>

2735
02:09:42.570 --> 02:09:46.830
<v Speaker 3>There was like this light bulb that went</v>
<v Speaker 3>off in this area of my mind that was</v>

2736
02:09:46.831 --> 02:09:48.990
<v Speaker 3>illuminated for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2737
02:09:48.991 --> 02:09:52.380
<v Speaker 3>check out this part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you don't even get in here without</v>

2738
02:09:52.381 --> 02:09:53.214
<v Speaker 3>doing this.</v>

2739
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:54.570
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2740
02:09:54.571 --> 02:09:59.340
<v Speaker 3>this is what the hunting thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get illuminates this ancient genetic</v>

2741
02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:04.500
<v Speaker 3>variable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ancient genetic pathway and it felt</v>

2742
02:10:04.501 --> 02:10:07.500
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like I was on a drug and I'm not</v>

2743
02:10:07.501 --> 02:10:11.730
<v Speaker 3>like not like a lustful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must kill and we know it was like this</v>

2744
02:10:11.731 --> 02:10:13.800
<v Speaker 3>weird sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an altered state.</v>

2745
02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Animals,</v>

2746
02:10:15.401 --> 02:10:18.450
<v Speaker 3>spiritual connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very strange.</v>

2747
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Strange experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I was shocked.</v>

2748
02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.530
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I expected the sense of loss.</v>

2749
02:10:25.770 --> 02:10:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I expected the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sorrow.</v>

2750
02:10:28.291 --> 02:10:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I expected all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sorrow never really came.</v>

2751
02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.680
<v Speaker 3>There was a sense of loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there wasn't a sense did something</v>

2752
02:10:33.681 --> 02:10:34.430
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

2753
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:37.670
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a sense like I shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done it and part of it was also</v>

2754
02:10:37.671 --> 02:10:41.390
<v Speaker 1>because I was seeing bones everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mountain lions shit.</v>

2755
02:10:41.391 --> 02:10:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the Goddamn war zone I'm in.</v>

2756
02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:45.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the breaks,</v>

2757
02:10:45.041 --> 02:10:47.090
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find these ropes of shit.</v>

2758
02:10:47.091 --> 02:10:52.091
<v Speaker 1>And I say ropes because shit that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with hair because these animals</v>

2759
02:10:52.221 --> 02:10:55.250
<v Speaker 1>were just jacking deer and whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell else they got ahold of.</v>

2760
02:10:55.670 --> 02:10:56.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2761
02:10:56.091 --> 02:10:58.700
<v Speaker 1>we're in a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a nature war zone.</v>

2762
02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:01.370
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't for a bunch of reasons.</v>

2763
02:11:01.371 --> 02:11:02.750
<v Speaker 1>And also because I knew it was gonna eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2764
02:11:02.751 --> 02:11:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel bad about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did feel like,</v>

2765
02:11:06.261 --> 02:11:08.930
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is intense.</v>

2766
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:13.550
<v Speaker 1>This is intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the surprising part was the altered</v>

2767
02:11:13.551 --> 02:11:16.970
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel that still,</v>

2768
02:11:16.971 --> 02:11:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changed over the years.</v>

2769
02:11:19.130 --> 02:11:21.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been hunting for the dozen years or</v>

2770
02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:22.723
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has,</v>

2771
02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:24.500
<v Speaker 1>my experience has changed.</v>

2772
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:24.681
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2773
02:11:24.681 --> 02:11:26.680
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a shocking and quite as intense</v>

2774
02:11:26.681 --> 02:11:29.450
<v Speaker 1>as it was the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still remains powerful.</v>

2775
02:11:29.451 --> 02:11:34.451
<v Speaker 1>And I'm still in an altered state for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hours or days afterward and a state</v>

2776
02:11:35.241 --> 02:11:39.860
<v Speaker 1>of thankfulness too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also like there's a warm</v>

2777
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:42.140
<v Speaker 1>happiness to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2778
02:11:42.141 --> 02:11:46.720
<v Speaker 1>thankfulness that you are successful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you have this meat and you're going</v>

2779
02:11:46.721 --> 02:11:48.680
<v Speaker 1>to provide this mean to your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2780
02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:52.060
<v Speaker 1>like my friend Duncan sent me a photo of</v>
<v Speaker 1>some um,</v>

2781
02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:57.220
<v Speaker 1>elk meat balls that his girlfriend had</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked for them and their friend from an</v>

2782
02:11:57.861 --> 02:12:00.200
<v Speaker 1>elk that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some elk that I gave him.</v>

2783
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And it made me feel so good that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend was eating some meat that I had</v>

2784
02:12:05.571 --> 02:12:07.400
<v Speaker 1>given him from an animal that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

2785
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

2786
02:12:08.241 --> 02:12:11.300
<v Speaker 1>You're grateful to the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the lands and then grateful to be</v>

2787
02:12:11.301 --> 02:12:12.230
<v Speaker 1>able to provide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2788
02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm grateful that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2789
02:12:14.301 --> 02:12:19.301
<v Speaker 1>you have this established community</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling bond feeling with your friend</v>

2790
02:12:21.291 --> 02:12:24.320
<v Speaker 1>who you give them meat and cooking this</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat and he takes a photo of it and,</v>

2791
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:25.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's all bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2792
02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:30.320
<v Speaker 1>like this digital representation of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's sent to you through the</v>

2793
02:12:30.321 --> 02:12:33.260
<v Speaker 1>air and smell it and arise on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

2794
02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:33.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2795
02:12:33.650 --> 02:12:35.210
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the woods,</v>

2796
02:12:35.211 --> 02:12:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Bros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is nature.</v>

2797
02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.410
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of sort of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2798
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2799
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all very odd.</v>

2800
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:45.270
<v Speaker 1>It's all very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2801
02:12:45.271 --> 02:12:50.271
<v Speaker 1>I do wonder if what I'm doing by getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>into hunting and is just clean til the</v>

2802
02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>last remaining gasps of a dying world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

2803
02:12:58.460 --> 02:12:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

2804
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.640
<v Speaker 1>But I sure hope it's not really dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do much hunting outside of your</v>

2805
02:13:04.641 --> 02:13:07.070
<v Speaker 1>home state of Vermont or is that mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do?</v>

2806
02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:08.630
<v Speaker 1>That's mostly what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2807
02:13:08.631 --> 02:13:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I've hunted a little bit Danna</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts where I have a friend and</v>

2808
02:13:11.931 --> 02:13:13.700
<v Speaker 1>my uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2809
02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I've got it out of state a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you go on trips?</v>

2810
02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:19.490
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never got on a moose trip or I</v>

2811
02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:20.330
<v Speaker 1>haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2812
02:13:20.690 --> 02:13:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Moose technically do get hundred of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vermont and small numbers.</v>

2813
02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it hard to get a tag?</v>

2814
02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:25.611
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2815
02:13:25.611 --> 02:13:28.010
<v Speaker 1>because it's such small numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2816
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for when I was in New Mexico,</v>

2817
02:13:30.921 --> 02:13:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but was in New Mexico already</v>

2818
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.990
<v Speaker 2>for something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2819
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:36.130
<v Speaker 2>And I've never really gone on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2820
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:40.050
<v Speaker 2>a hunting trip somewhere far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I dunno,</v>

2821
02:13:40.690 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I might some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's been trying to get</v>

2822
02:13:42.871 --> 02:13:46.020
<v Speaker 2>me out to Colorado and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who lives in Colorado as</v>

2823
02:13:46.021 --> 02:13:50.160
<v Speaker 2>well for deer elk either either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2824
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:51.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love,</v>

2825
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:53.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular friend in Colorado I'm</v>

2826
02:13:53.341 --> 02:13:54.450
<v Speaker 2>thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to hunt with him.</v>

2827
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy I'd love to hunt with,</v>

2828
02:13:56.970 --> 02:13:59.400
<v Speaker 2>really enjoy his company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2829
02:14:00.090 --> 02:14:03.390
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have like these fantasies of</v>

2830
02:14:03.391 --> 02:14:04.224
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2831
02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:06.930
<v Speaker 2>big western or Alaskan hunts or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2832
02:14:06.931 --> 02:14:10.480
<v Speaker 2>And so you're hunting is almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2833
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:14.550
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it almost entirely for</v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

2834
02:14:14.970 --> 02:14:17.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2835
02:14:17.071 --> 02:14:22.071
<v Speaker 2>But if I just wanted food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are much more efficient ways to</v>

2836
02:14:23.041 --> 02:14:24.870
<v Speaker 2>produce that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could raise chickens,</v>

2837
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:26.303
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2838
02:14:26.730 --> 02:14:27.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a guaranteed thing.</v>

2839
02:14:28.270 --> 02:14:29.460
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless the,</v>

2840
02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:31.950
<v Speaker 2>they get taken out by predators or</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease or something.</v>

2841
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:34.710
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you raised these chickens and then you</v>

2842
02:14:34.711 --> 02:14:38.400
<v Speaker 2>have meat or you raise chickens and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs or so on.</v>

2843
02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the prime motive for me to hunt as</v>

2844
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:49.320
<v Speaker 2>the prime motive for humans to hunt when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started,</v>

2845
02:14:49.770 --> 02:14:52.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back is food.</v>

2846
02:14:53.170 --> 02:14:58.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's essentially why I hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's often been this split that's</v>

2847
02:15:00.541 --> 02:15:05.541
<v Speaker 2>been drawn between this distinction</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawn between hunting for utility,</v>

2848
02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:11.230
<v Speaker 2>utilitarian food and hunting because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed a hoe,</v>

2849
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:13.020
<v Speaker 2>you enjoy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2850
02:15:13.021 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 2>what do you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sport hunting or recreational hunting or</v>

2851
02:15:14.971 --> 02:15:17.460
<v Speaker 2>whatever you call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2852
02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:23.070
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for most of us,</v>

2853
02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.200
<v Speaker 2>they're not separate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2854
02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you hunt because you enjoy something</v>
<v Speaker 2>about hunting and it's meaningful to you</v>

2855
02:15:29.850 --> 02:15:33.000
<v Speaker 2>and the food is meaningful and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>food from it.</v>

2856
02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:38.240
<v Speaker 2>That's why I hunt both of those reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traditional subsistence hunting</v>

2857
02:15:39.601 --> 02:15:40.434
<v Speaker 2>cultures,</v>

2858
02:15:42.110 --> 02:15:43.910
<v Speaker 2>those people love to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2859
02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:45.950
<v Speaker 2>They also totally depend on the food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2860
02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:47.870
<v Speaker 2>So both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's both,</v>

2861
02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really a separate thing.</v>

2862
02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it probably really ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been for any hunting culture.</v>

2863
02:15:55.230 --> 02:15:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so more fishing or fishing.</v>

2864
02:15:57.921 --> 02:15:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2865
02:15:59.001 --> 02:16:00.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's for both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enjoyable.</v>

2867
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:03.510
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2868
02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:06.060
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2869
02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:09.470
<v Speaker 2>we'd probably find other ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't do it.</v>

2870
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:13.130
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably why it's enjoyable</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it provides food.</v>

2871
02:16:13.190 --> 02:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean it stimulates these areas that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>

2872
02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:18.920
<v Speaker 2>these primal need areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2873
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:23.600
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food is my primary sort of motive in</v>

2874
02:16:23.601 --> 02:16:25.940
<v Speaker 2>terms of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a product materially,</v>

2875
02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:29.560
<v Speaker 2>materially food is my motive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not to have a big of antlers on the</v>

2876
02:16:29.561 --> 02:16:32.560
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I end up with a big set of antlers,</v>

2877
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably keep that skull and</v>
<v Speaker 2>antlers like you do.</v>

2878
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.540
<v Speaker 2>But it's not the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2879
02:16:37.810 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 2>But it's the experience of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I got into it more,</v>

2880
02:16:41.170 --> 02:16:46.170
<v Speaker 2>as I started to have more relationships</v>
<v Speaker 2>with other people that I really</v>

2881
02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:51.331
<v Speaker 2>respected and who also hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's also part of that if I'm</v>

2882
02:16:52.391 --> 02:16:55.720
<v Speaker 2>hunting with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that I really enjoy their</v>

2883
02:16:55.721 --> 02:16:58.990
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's social and you know,</v>

2884
02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:03.310
<v Speaker 2>natural experience motives that are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much just about the process and the</v>

2885
02:17:03.311 --> 02:17:05.350
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the food,</v>

2886
02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:08.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all interwoven.</v>

2887
02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some people that want</v>

2888
02:17:10.301 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 2>you to feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't want,</v>

2889
02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.070
<v Speaker 2>they don't want you to be enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2890
02:17:15.071 --> 02:17:18.430
<v Speaker 2>And if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sadistically enjoyed killing.</v>

2891
02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would find that disturbing.</v>

2892
02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do find that disturbing when I see</v>

2893
02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:28.750
<v Speaker 2>people talking about or acting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting or anything else.</v>

2894
02:17:28.751 --> 02:17:33.751
<v Speaker 2>That way I don't care whether it's a cat</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a dog or a wild deer or to</v>

2895
02:17:34.001 --> 02:17:37.810
<v Speaker 2>sadistically enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing pain and,</v>

2896
02:17:37.811 --> 02:17:40.600
<v Speaker 2>or taking life that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's problematic.</v>

2897
02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Which is one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the number one accusation that</v>

2898
02:17:43.991 --> 02:17:46.420
<v Speaker 3>anti hunters will label on hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2899
02:17:46.421 --> 02:17:48.550
<v Speaker 3>you're a sadistic person you enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2900
02:17:48.551 --> 02:17:50.410
<v Speaker 3>This is the only reason why he possibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this</v>

2901
02:17:50.470 --> 02:17:52.570
<v Speaker 2>and when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you say you enjoy hunting,</v>

2902
02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.320
<v Speaker 2>if the understanding is what you enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is simply that moment of taking life,</v>

2903
02:17:59.081 --> 02:18:02.620
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing else about it that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy and what the way you enjoy that</v>

2904
02:18:02.621 --> 02:18:04.920
<v Speaker 2>moment is sadistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2905
02:18:05.230 --> 02:18:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Not the kind of light bulb goes off in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some part of this ancient,</v>

2906
02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:12.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human mind that</v>

2907
02:18:14.590 --> 02:18:17.080
<v Speaker 2>that's a different kind of in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>altered state.</v>

2908
02:18:18.250 --> 02:18:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Some people might describe that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting or pleasurable,</v>

2909
02:18:20.831 --> 02:18:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a,</v>

2910
02:18:24.521 --> 02:18:29.050
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for you a lust to kill.</v>

2911
02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:30.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that.</v>

2912
02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:33.760
<v Speaker 2>But there's something that is magnetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and powerful about it.</v>

2913
02:18:34.130 --> 02:18:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something insanely primal about</v>

2914
02:18:36.111 --> 02:18:38.780
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the weirder things that</v>

2915
02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:42.050
<v Speaker 3>people lobby at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2916
02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:45.200
<v Speaker 3>that the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the insults that they send your way.</v>

2917
02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:48.680
<v Speaker 3>One of the big ones is you can't get an</v>
<v Speaker 3>erection,</v>

2918
02:18:48.681 --> 02:18:51.890
<v Speaker 3>so you go kill animals or you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little penis,</v>

2919
02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:56.630
<v Speaker 3>so you kill animals like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets brought to this weird sexual</v>

2920
02:18:56.631 --> 02:18:58.160
<v Speaker 3>lust thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's I,</v>

2921
02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm really confused about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always get confused.</v>

2922
02:19:00.741 --> 02:19:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the root of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because so many people go to that one,</v>

2923
02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:06.020
<v Speaker 3>like they go to that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>

2924
02:19:06.021 --> 02:19:09.800
<v Speaker 3>whenever I watched even no matter who</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunter is that people are attacking,</v>

2925
02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:13.970
<v Speaker 3>like whether it was the Walter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the dentist guy who killed Cecil or</v>

2926
02:19:13.971 --> 02:19:16.870
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so many of them go to that,</v>

2927
02:19:17.050 --> 02:19:20.270
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person is sexually inadequate so</v>

2928
02:19:20.271 --> 02:19:23.720
<v Speaker 3>they're going out and killing animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this bizarre connection.</v>

2929
02:19:23.721 --> 02:19:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now maybe we should just blame Freud</v>

2930
02:19:26.841 --> 02:19:27.674
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2931
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2932
02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:33.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it is we have a tendency to,</v>

2933
02:19:33.890 --> 02:19:37.140
<v Speaker 2>to in our society and culture maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>since Freud to,</v>

2934
02:19:37.290 --> 02:19:41.250
<v Speaker 2>to link any kind of like aberrant</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior or,</v>

2935
02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:43.320
<v Speaker 2>or motive or desire with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2936
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2937
02:19:46.670 --> 02:19:51.530
<v Speaker 2>but there's also been a longstanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>story that's been told,</v>

2938
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by critics of,</v>

2939
02:19:53.241 --> 02:19:55.160
<v Speaker 2>of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2940
02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.980
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2941
02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:03.040
<v Speaker 2>violence toward animals through hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the same as sort of sexual violence</v>

2942
02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:09.440
<v Speaker 2>toward women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that women like mother Earth did</v>

2943
02:20:09.450 --> 02:20:14.150
<v Speaker 2>associates between women in Earth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature and men are these dominating,</v>

2944
02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:17.270
<v Speaker 2>domineering Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>macho,</v>

2945
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:18.200
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2946
02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a,</v>

2947
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:24.920
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of see the logic and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of cultural roots of all of that.</v>

2948
02:20:25.430 --> 02:20:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem.</v>

2949
02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:32.840
<v Speaker 2>And then Mary Mary Stage wrote this</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating book called woman the</v>

2950
02:20:32.841 --> 02:20:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2951
02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.450
<v Speaker 2>back 25 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2952
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:40.610
<v Speaker 2>and part of her argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's very much a feminist,</v>

2953
02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:41.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2954
02:20:41.781 --> 02:20:43.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a hunter.</v>

2955
02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of her rebuttal to that</v>

2956
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:53.590
<v Speaker 2>parallel around sexuality is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same story is told both by the sort</v>

2957
02:21:00.741 --> 02:21:05.741
<v Speaker 2>of mainstream culture that portrays men</v>
<v Speaker 2>as domineering and women as nurturing.</v>

2958
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:15.530
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men is as violators and women as</v>

2959
02:21:15.531 --> 02:21:16.370
<v Speaker 2>victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2960
02:21:16.371 --> 02:21:19.880
<v Speaker 2>which has happened certainly</v>
<v Speaker 2>historically that relationship exists,</v>

2961
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:20.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2962
02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:25.430
<v Speaker 2>But the parallel to to nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2963
02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:28.580
<v Speaker 2>as ma'am the hunter as a cultural myth</v>
<v Speaker 2>myth,</v>

2964
02:21:28.581 --> 02:21:33.581
<v Speaker 2>which is very strong in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our culture that the critics I sort</v>

2965
02:21:36.111 --> 02:21:39.980
<v Speaker 2>of ecological feminists and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the critics of that are retelling the</v>

2966
02:21:39.981 --> 02:21:44.981
<v Speaker 2>same story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's men play this role and women are</v>

2967
02:21:45.951 --> 02:21:48.890
<v Speaker 2>inherently nurturing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inherently</v>

2968
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:54.800
<v Speaker 2>not the sort of sexual violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2969
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:58.190
<v Speaker 2>lust driven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of male.</v>

2970
02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and her argument is,</v>

2971
02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:08.080
<v Speaker 2>let's break this down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's also have women as hunters being</v>

2972
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:15.670
<v Speaker 2>honored and respected and accept that</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong women and hunting</v>

2973
02:22:18.850 --> 02:22:19.590
<v Speaker 5>okay</v>

2974
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:22.860
<v Speaker 2>can be compatible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And women are not inherently</v>

2975
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:25.883
<v Speaker 2>nurturing,</v>

2976
02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:28.200
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be life takers,</v>

2977
02:22:28.201 --> 02:22:29.760
<v Speaker 1>they can be hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2978
02:22:29.761 --> 02:22:32.400
<v Speaker 1>they can provide for their family</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

2979
02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:36.330
<v Speaker 1>through taking life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hunting does not have to be</v>

2980
02:22:36.331 --> 02:22:39.840
<v Speaker 1>motivated and isn't motivated for most</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters.</v>

2981
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:42.300
<v Speaker 1>By some bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted sexual thing.</v>

2982
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2983
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:46.880
<v Speaker 1>whether it's women or men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what the real experience for</v>

2984
02:22:46.881 --> 02:22:48.600
<v Speaker 1>me really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning I think there's just,</v>

2985
02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:51.900
<v Speaker 1>it's just a simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goto criticism.</v>

2986
02:22:51.901 --> 02:22:55.050
<v Speaker 1>They like to latch onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think if you,</v>

2987
02:22:55.051 --> 02:22:57.000
<v Speaker 1>if you gave them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2988
02:22:57.001 --> 02:23:00.060
<v Speaker 1>a quiet room and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2989
02:23:00.061 --> 02:23:03.300
<v Speaker 1>why do you think people hunt if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to,</v>

2990
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:05.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna win $1 million.</v>

2991
02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So I want you to really do your best to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to calculate and formulate their,</v>

2992
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:14.190
<v Speaker 1>the actual process that's going on in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person's brain when they're hunting an</v>

2993
02:23:14.191 --> 02:23:16.680
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] either guarantee you they're</v>

2994
02:23:16.681 --> 02:23:18.270
<v Speaker 1>not going to go with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it up there.</v>

2995
02:23:18.271 --> 02:23:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Not because then they want to get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>million bucks.</v>

2996
02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:22.170
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would try to figure it out and they</v>

2997
02:23:22.171 --> 02:23:24.010
<v Speaker 1>would try to be objective about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2998
02:23:24.050 --> 02:23:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cheap go to insult.</v>

2999
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:27.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3000
02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that when it's something</v>

3001
02:23:32.101 --> 02:23:35.580
<v Speaker 1>that's when people here</v>

3002
02:23:37.430 --> 02:23:40.880
<v Speaker 1>a hunter talk about the experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

3003
02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>the way you're talking about it and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that food means and what that moment is</v>

3004
02:23:46.011 --> 02:23:51.011
<v Speaker 1>like when they hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they respect that in general,</v>

3005
02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:52.843
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3006
02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Most non hunters who do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no experience as long as they</v>

3007
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:57.550
<v Speaker 1>meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely though,</v>

3008
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:59.320
<v Speaker 1>even even some vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3009
02:23:59.350 --> 02:24:00.650
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the attorneys,</v>

3010
02:24:00.651 --> 02:24:02.150
<v Speaker 1>we'll make exceptions for meat that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been hunted.</v>

3011
02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:03.613
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3012
02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:10.180
<v Speaker 1>they can really respect that in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when there's no experience of</v>

3013
02:24:12.831 --> 02:24:16.850
<v Speaker 1>someone speaking about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just some picture of some guy</v>

3014
02:24:16.851 --> 02:24:18.380
<v Speaker 1>with some zebra or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3015
02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so in comprehensible.</v>

3016
02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so removed and then there's</v>

3017
02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:23.713
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3018
02:24:25.690 --> 02:24:28.420
<v Speaker 1>there's no story that can be understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3019
02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get having been a Vegan and having had</v>

3020
02:24:35.111 --> 02:24:37.900
<v Speaker 1>a pretty dim view of hunting myself for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time,</v>

3021
02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:41.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having,</v>

3022
02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:44.710
<v Speaker 1>having had very strong feelings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still having very strong feelings about,</v>

3023
02:24:45.070 --> 02:24:49.450
<v Speaker 1>about animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get where that hostility and outrage</v>

3024
02:24:49.451 --> 02:24:50.740
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3025
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can understand why someone would</v>

3026
02:24:56.441 --> 02:24:58.120
<v Speaker 1>even come up with that sort of bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

3027
02:24:58.690 --> 02:25:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can as well a lot of ways.</v>

3028
02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w w w without again,</v>

3029
02:25:04.390 --> 02:25:07.910
<v Speaker 1>like if I wanted to win $1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they left me alone in a room and I'd</v>

3030
02:25:07.930 --> 02:25:09.670
<v Speaker 1>never had it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I wanted to come up with a mode</v>

3031
02:25:09.671 --> 02:25:11.070
<v Speaker 1>of that wouldn't be on the list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3032
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't really believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody else does either.</v>

3033
02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:18.310
<v Speaker 1>But before I first haunted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking to myself,</v>

3034
02:25:18.311 --> 02:25:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to either going to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan or I'm going to become a hunter.</v>

3035
02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 1>That was what this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first went hunting,</v>

3036
02:25:24.311 --> 02:25:24.911
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3037
02:25:24.911 --> 02:25:26.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the things can happen either when</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot this animal.</v>

3038
02:25:26.681 --> 02:25:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be horrified with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be like,</v>

3039
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat this animal and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done or I'm going to become a</v>

3040
02:25:32.351 --> 02:25:33.950
<v Speaker 1>hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3041
02:25:34.210 --> 02:25:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this is one of those things</v>

3042
02:25:38.261 --> 02:25:41.930
<v Speaker 1>that will not be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of those things that the,</v>

3043
02:25:41.931 --> 02:25:45.040
<v Speaker 1>the debate will continue to rage on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see both sides.</v>

3044
02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely see and admire the motive</v>

3045
02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:54.220
<v Speaker 1>that the ethical vegans want or are</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to pursue.</v>

3046
02:25:54.690 --> 02:25:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also see the intense hypocrisy when I</v>

3047
02:25:58.391 --> 02:26:00.460
<v Speaker 1>find out they have cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3048
02:26:00.490 --> 02:26:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super common,</v>

3049
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and amongst my friends,</v>

3050
02:26:03.641 --> 02:26:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I have a good French wages to the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

3051
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:07.780
<v Speaker 1>She's got a bunch of fucking cats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a Vegan.</v>

3052
02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:09.760
<v Speaker 1>She gives people a hard time about meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pitch,</v>

3053
02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you're feeding your monsters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vampires.</v>

3054
02:26:12.101 --> 02:26:15.700
<v Speaker 1>You live with you bringing them home</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead things and they're probably</v>

3055
02:26:15.701 --> 02:26:18.130
<v Speaker 1>bringing her home dead things to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out probably if they get out.</v>

3056
02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3057
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3058
02:26:22.421 --> 02:26:25.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of a stage,</v>

3059
02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:29.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human civilization is going</v>

3060
02:26:29.351 --> 02:26:32.290
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to take a few hundred years</v>

3061
02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and in that few hundred years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to evolve to be something</v>

3062
02:26:37.691 --> 02:26:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that's almost unrecognizable to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in comparison to what we are now and</v>

3063
02:26:42.611 --> 02:26:46.510
<v Speaker 1>that we're going through this process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this process where longing or</v>

3064
02:26:46.511 --> 02:26:49.630
<v Speaker 1>longing towards the idea of wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>flannel shirt and going into the woods</v>

3065
02:26:49.631 --> 02:26:51.130
<v Speaker 1>with a bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3066
02:26:51.131 --> 02:26:54.340
<v Speaker 1>like that's what grandpa did know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GRANDPA seemed happy all the time.</v>

3067
02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandpa didn't even have an email,</v>

3068
02:26:56.580 --> 02:26:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was happier for it.</v>

3069
02:26:59.830 --> 02:27:01.090
<v Speaker 1>He might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3070
02:27:01.091 --> 02:27:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3071
02:27:02.261 --> 02:27:03.094
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3072
02:27:03.490 --> 02:27:05.440
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that's been surprising</v>

3073
02:27:05.470 --> 02:27:09.010
<v Speaker 1>about this process and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and creating this book and all this</v>

3074
02:27:09.011 --> 02:27:10.390
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3075
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it goes back in a way where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation started because you asked,</v>

3076
02:27:15.611 --> 02:27:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much grief did you get?</v>

3077
02:27:16.991 --> 02:27:21.991
<v Speaker 1>How much flack did you take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's been most surprising in a way</v>

3078
02:27:22.751 --> 02:27:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most rewarding,</v>

3079
02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:26.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3080
02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:27.613
<v Speaker 4>hmm.</v>

3081
02:27:27.690 --> 02:27:32.690
<v Speaker 1>That I've had opportunities to talk with</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a wide range of people and I've</v>

3082
02:27:33.601 --> 02:27:38.130
<v Speaker 1>done</v>
<v Speaker 1>seminars for a hunter education</v>

3083
02:27:38.131 --> 02:27:43.131
<v Speaker 1>instructors and I've talked to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms full of non hunters,</v>

3084
02:27:43.951 --> 02:27:48.951
<v Speaker 1>including some vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the conversations have been</v>

3085
02:27:49.771 --> 02:27:54.771
<v Speaker 1>remarkably</v>
<v Speaker 1>respectful and civil across those</v>

3086
02:27:55.011 --> 02:27:59.240
<v Speaker 1>different and signs in the same room</v>
<v Speaker 1>size is a mix of those people in the</v>

3087
02:27:59.241 --> 02:28:00.900
<v Speaker 1>same room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3088
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3089
02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:07.730
<v Speaker 1>very similar to this sort of experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about with what it felt</v>

3090
02:28:07.731 --> 02:28:09.560
<v Speaker 1>like to hunt and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually take an animal.</v>

3091
02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I went out to Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3092
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:17.000
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years ago and did some seminars</v>

3093
02:28:17.001 --> 02:28:21.260
<v Speaker 1>for hundreds Keisha instructors and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a little uncomfortable because of</v>

3094
02:28:21.261 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 1>the topics they</v>

3095
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.640
<v Speaker 2>asked me to speak on was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3096
02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:26.180
<v Speaker 2>ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

3097
02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a new hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3098
02:28:27.381 --> 02:28:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I just started a few years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's all these lifelong hunter is</v>

3099
02:28:29.871 --> 02:28:31.760
<v Speaker 2>pretty much in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>75 guys,</v>

3100
02:28:31.761 --> 02:28:34.790
<v Speaker 2>mostly guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to tell them about hunting</v>

3101
02:28:34.791 --> 02:28:36.040
<v Speaker 2>ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3102
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:37.820
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to preach to them?</v>

3103
02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3104
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.250
<v Speaker 2>but it went well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I opened it up for q and</v>

3105
02:28:43.251 --> 02:28:47.960
<v Speaker 2>a and we got into discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are talking really deeply</v>

3106
02:28:47.961 --> 02:28:52.490
<v Speaker 2>about the experience of taking life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of emotional dimensions of that</v>

3107
02:28:52.850 --> 02:28:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and they're talking to each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging each other to bring that</v>

3108
02:28:56.961 --> 02:28:59.030
<v Speaker 2>into the classroom with their students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3109
02:28:59.031 --> 02:28:59.864
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3110
02:29:01.350 --> 02:29:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Two days later I was just outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>boulder and I'm sure you know boulder</v>

3111
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:10.800
<v Speaker 2>boulder's the button of every joke in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado and vice versa,</v>

3112
02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you know soapies exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3113
02:29:12.691 --> 02:29:13.770
<v Speaker 2>so they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3114
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.903
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3115
02:29:14.970 --> 02:29:17.610
<v Speaker 2>all these hundred education instructors</v>
<v Speaker 2>were actually joking about boulder.</v>

3116
02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:19.230
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were up in the mountains at this</v>

3117
02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:21.090
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were joking about boulder and</v>

3118
02:29:21.091 --> 02:29:21.451
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3119
02:29:21.451 --> 02:29:22.390
<v Speaker 2>how do you get to boulder?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3120
02:29:22.391 --> 02:29:24.840
<v Speaker 2>you go to the edge of reality and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn left</v>

3121
02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:29.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's always laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The joke is always,</v>

3122
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:31.140
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3123
02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably one of the most liberal</v>
<v Speaker 2>places on earth.</v>

3124
02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:34.613
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3125
02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:38.880
<v Speaker 2>And of course boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stereotype of boulder is telling</v>

3126
02:29:38.881 --> 02:29:43.350
<v Speaker 2>the same jokes are different jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but jokes in return about evergreen.</v>

3127
02:29:43.650 --> 02:29:44.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3128
02:29:44.251 --> 02:29:44.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3129
02:29:44.671 --> 02:29:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean about the rednecks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3130
02:29:47.221 --> 02:29:48.150
<v Speaker 2>And the hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:29:48.151 --> 02:29:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know these,</v>

3132
02:29:49.981 --> 02:29:52.320
<v Speaker 2>you know all these hunting jokes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>redneck jokes.</v>

3133
02:29:53.970 --> 02:29:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I was in boulder because I was being</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewed by this x vegetarian who ran</v>

3134
02:29:57.931 --> 02:30:02.880
<v Speaker 2>this a show for Gaiam TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this online TV station.</v>

3135
02:30:03.210 --> 02:30:05.730
<v Speaker 2>It's all eastern spirituality and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3136
02:30:05.850 --> 02:30:06.683
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of thing.</v>

3137
02:30:08.260 --> 02:30:08.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3138
02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who would make fun of each</v>

3139
02:30:10.121 --> 02:30:10.954
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3140
02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:13.540
<v Speaker 2>A hundred education instructors and guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>MTV.</v>

3141
02:30:14.830 --> 02:30:16.870
<v Speaker 2>As soon as we got into the conversation.</v>

3142
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:18.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3143
02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:22.010
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the emotional and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical dimensions of taking life.</v>

3144
02:30:22.011 --> 02:30:24.410
<v Speaker 2>She's an ex vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's now eating meat,</v>

3145
02:30:24.411 --> 02:30:27.050
<v Speaker 2>but she's not a hunter or she's thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these issues about confronting</v>

3146
02:30:27.051 --> 02:30:29.570
<v Speaker 2>life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I got done the trip,</v>

3147
02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:30.411
<v Speaker 2>I looked back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3148
02:30:30.411 --> 02:30:31.244
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3149
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:32.270
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3150
02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Those two conversations were really</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar,</v>

3151
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:38.450
<v Speaker 2>complete different communities who</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally would think they had nothing in</v>

3152
02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:41.780
<v Speaker 2>common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially around hunting and yet the</v>

3153
02:30:41.781 --> 02:30:45.170
<v Speaker 2>very basic human questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic moral,</v>

3154
02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:48.440
<v Speaker 2>ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional issues around taking another</v>

3155
02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:50.900
<v Speaker 2>creature's life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a big,</v>

3156
02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:56.290
<v Speaker 2>big mammal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a similar conversation and so</v>

3157
02:30:56.610 --> 02:30:58.890
<v Speaker 2>that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess in a way,</v>

3158
02:30:58.891 --> 02:31:02.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the most rewarding and surprising</v>
<v Speaker 2>things about about the whole process and</v>

3159
02:31:02.821 --> 02:31:07.821
<v Speaker 2>the and the journey since is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to see and talk with people in these</v>

3160
02:31:08.971 --> 02:31:11.580
<v Speaker 2>places where you know there's common</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

3161
02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In different cultures,</v>

3162
02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:15.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radically different communities demar</v>

3163
02:31:15.870 --> 02:31:18.630
<v Speaker 2>there most certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I'm hoping is</v>

3164
02:31:18.631 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 2>going to common ground</v>

3165
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:24.840
<v Speaker 3>or bring some common ground or at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring an understanding is the emerging</v>

3166
02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:29.730
<v Speaker 3>science behind understanding the</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence of plants and that plants</v>

3167
02:31:29.731 --> 02:31:34.410
<v Speaker 3>are in fact a life form that we take for</v>
<v Speaker 3>granted because they're not in motion</v>

3168
02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:38.000
<v Speaker 3>because they're stationary w and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly grow and we were,</v>

3169
02:31:38.001 --> 02:31:39.060
<v Speaker 3>we don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3170
02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:42.720
<v Speaker 3>we don't really associate them with</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a life form,</v>

3171
02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:46.050
<v Speaker 3>but they are a life form and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange life form that has some form of</v>

3172
02:31:46.051 --> 02:31:48.450
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them can make calculations,</v>

3173
02:31:48.690 --> 02:31:51.240
<v Speaker 3>some of them in fact rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they exist.</v>

3174
02:31:51.241 --> 02:31:55.230
<v Speaker 3>They're carnivorous there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange type of life.</v>

3175
02:31:55.650 --> 02:32:00.650
<v Speaker 3>And as we grow to understand that life</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper and deeper and have more respect</v>

3176
02:32:02.761 --> 02:32:07.560
<v Speaker 3>for it and really understand what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly they're doing when they're</v>

3177
02:32:07.561 --> 02:32:09.660
<v Speaker 3>making calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly they're doing.</v>

3178
02:32:09.661 --> 02:32:13.020
<v Speaker 3>The communicating with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how this network of,</v>

3179
02:32:13.050 --> 02:32:15.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intertwined lifeforms,</v>

3180
02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:19.030
<v Speaker 3>similar plant life forms that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this topsoil,</v>

3181
02:32:19.170 --> 02:32:24.060
<v Speaker 3>which is also some sort of a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre ecosystem of life that these</v>

3182
02:32:24.061 --> 02:32:27.750
<v Speaker 3>electrical impulses that they're sharing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other or some sort of form of</v>

3183
02:32:27.751 --> 02:32:31.540
<v Speaker 3>communication and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Miss Holst traditions.</v>

3184
02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The spiritual dimension is not going to</v>

3185
02:32:33.991 --> 02:32:35.060
<v Speaker 3>be animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but plants do.</v>

3186
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that this is the,</v>

3187
02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:43.940
<v Speaker 3>this is an unshakable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undeniable truth that life eats life.</v>

3188
02:32:45.690 --> 02:32:46.740
<v Speaker 3>And we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>

3189
02:32:46.741 --> 02:32:49.170
<v Speaker 3>and every animal on the planet is</v>
<v Speaker 3>utterly dependent on plants.</v>

3190
02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:50.033
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3191
02:32:50.310 --> 02:32:51.930
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of us are none of us that are</v>

3192
02:32:51.931 --> 02:32:53.490
<v Speaker 3>photosynthesizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3193
02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:55.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there's any way ever to</v>

3194
02:32:55.801 --> 02:33:00.801
<v Speaker 3>get away from what we've established in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country with a giant numbers of</v>

3195
02:33:00.961 --> 02:33:04.140
<v Speaker 3>human beings and these population</v>
<v Speaker 3>centers and the factory farms.</v>

3196
02:33:04.141 --> 02:33:07.770
<v Speaker 3>It's support these population centers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the way of getting</v>

3197
02:33:07.771 --> 02:33:11.940
<v Speaker 3>around that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that people like yourself</v>

3198
02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:14.940
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people that are proponents of</v>

3199
02:33:15.310 --> 02:33:20.310
<v Speaker 3>least removing your own existence from</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in as clear a way as possible by</v>

3200
02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:26.700
<v Speaker 3>doing some growing and gardening by</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing some hunting,</v>

3201
02:33:26.701 --> 02:33:31.701
<v Speaker 3>by experiencing the wild of this world</v>
<v Speaker 3>and going out there and getting into it</v>

3202
02:33:32.251 --> 02:33:37.251
<v Speaker 3>and understanding of this is this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a real environment that coexists</v>

3203
02:33:37.410 --> 02:33:42.410
<v Speaker 3>with the city during the same timeframe</v>
<v Speaker 3>on earth and you,</v>

3204
02:33:43.050 --> 02:33:44.040
<v Speaker 3>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3205
02:33:44.041 --> 02:33:47.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't think as a person that looks at</v>
<v Speaker 3>those factory farm videos and goes,</v>

3206
02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:48.360
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

3207
02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:49.860
<v Speaker 3>Fuck those calves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3208
02:33:50.130 --> 02:33:52.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad those chickens get stuff to</v>
<v Speaker 3>those boxes,</v>

3209
02:33:52.321 --> 02:33:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't think is a single person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that.</v>

3210
02:33:55.111 --> 02:33:58.530
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's also why those ag gag</v>
<v Speaker 3>laws are in effect to protect those</v>

3211
02:33:58.531 --> 02:34:00.840
<v Speaker 3>businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if that stuff gets out,</v>

3212
02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:04.590
<v Speaker 3>people get horrified and then they vote</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their dollar and they,</v>

3213
02:34:04.610 --> 02:34:08.700
<v Speaker 3>they make choices that reflect the</v>
<v Speaker 3>horror that they experience when they're</v>

3214
02:34:08.701 --> 02:34:09.950
<v Speaker 3>watching those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3215
02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:10.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3216
02:34:10.861 --> 02:34:14.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we can all collectively</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a group get out of this,</v>

3217
02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 3>but I think as individuals we can start</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving away from it.</v>

3218
02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:21.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're doing when you were</v>

3219
02:34:21.910 --> 02:34:24.130
<v Speaker 3>or what your friends are doing when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about these people that</v>

3220
02:34:24.131 --> 02:34:25.850
<v Speaker 3>used to be vegetarians and now they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grid,</v>

3221
02:34:25.851 --> 02:34:28.840
<v Speaker 3>their on chickens now they provide food</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these other people.</v>

3222
02:34:28.841 --> 02:34:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Like that's ideal.</v>

3223
02:34:30.310 --> 02:34:32.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding the people that are involved in,</v>

3224
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:37.000
<v Speaker 3>in growing and butchering this meat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it from them.</v>

3225
02:34:37.390 --> 02:34:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easier way of,</v>

3226
02:34:40.901 --> 02:34:44.680
<v Speaker 3>of existing [inaudible] I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3227
02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:47.560

3228
02:34:47.561 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of people that we have</v>

3229
02:34:49.271 --> 02:34:51.730
<v Speaker 3>stuffed in the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How else,</v>

3230
02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:52.361
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>How are you going to pay this?</v>

3240
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:18.730
<v Speaker 3>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't feed all those people the real</v>
