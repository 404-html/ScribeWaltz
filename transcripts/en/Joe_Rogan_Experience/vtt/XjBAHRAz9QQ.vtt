1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>So you require conflict in order to be engaged.</v>

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>You must have it now.</v>

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I found one of the things that I've found really fascinating about your show was</v>

7
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the episode on Indian Gurus.</v>

8
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

9
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>That was my favorite.</v>

10
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

11
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>He's just so fucking bizarre.</v>

12
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>The American physicist was the most bizarre to me.</v>

13
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>There was a for folks,</v>

14
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

15
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>that was a long time ago.</v>

16
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Mike from California.</v>

17
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.083
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

20
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy,</v>

21
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Swami g's,</v>

22
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll you freak out to Patty Satyananda Swami Gee,</v>

23
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>what a you of those names.</v>

24
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>The Indians have fantastic language.</v>

26
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Their names are amazing.</v>

27
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>But there was this character who is this a yoga master,</v>

28
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>quasi spiritual leader,</v>

29
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.643
<v Speaker 1>whatever he is.</v>

30
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:55.224
<v Speaker 1>without judging.</v>

33
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>And there's this guy named Mike who was a Divo Tay who lived in this guy's off</v>

34
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Schrom I guess.</v>

35
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:04.284
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Believed that this man could materialize jewelry and objects and the story of</v>

37
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>him stomping his foot down and a 50 pound note appeared in his hand.</v>

38
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.134
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

39
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a fucking physicist.</v>

40
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

41
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Which is so strange.</v>

42
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>That was a good one.</v>

43
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>It was my favorite,</v>

44
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.011
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

45
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:28.011
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite moments was you sitting on the edge of the bed talking to him</v>

46
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>and you asked him whether or not he said,</v>

47
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>try not to take this the wrong way,</v>

48
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>but did you have sadness in your life before you,</v>

49
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>before you met the sky?</v>

50
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.641
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

51
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

52
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 2>and he got angry.</v>

53
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 2>He took it a myth and he didn't like that question.</v>

54
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

55
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 2>he said something like,</v>

56
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 2>he said something like,</v>

57
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.700
<v Speaker 2>what are you asking me?</v>

59
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.551
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

60
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 2>am I a burnout and burnout?</v>

61
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And his quote was a fascinating because it was about fundamentalism.</v>

62
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:01.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

65
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 2>says like,</v>

66
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I always say that,</v>

67
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 2>having a breakdown is the,</v>

69
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 2>is like the precursor to fundamentalism.</v>

70
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Decide he was going to say that he had a break.</v>

71
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of went with the question,</v>

73
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 2>but what he said,</v>

74
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he was setting me up for that,</v>

75
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't see himself as a fundamentalist.</v>

76
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

77
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.211
<v Speaker 2>it was a really,</v>

78
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 2>it was a misunderstanding.</v>

79
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I normally try and get into the,</v>

80
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 2>the difficult questions a little more gracefully.</v>

81
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 2>And because I had misunderstood what he was saying.</v>

82
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you did.</v>

83
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I slid into it a bit.</v>

84
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think he did.</v>

85
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 2>I think he changed gears.</v>

86
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>

87
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

88
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I think he was sort of that,</v>

89
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:35.811
<v Speaker 2>you know what happened?</v>

90
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Like the deep story there is that I spent,</v>

91
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 2>that was a weird weekends days,</v>

92
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 2>which was about 10 years ago and I used to try and spend,</v>

93
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 2>it was like a little rule of thumb.</v>

94
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd try and I'd find a contributor who I could relate to the most.</v>

95
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Like you take something that seemed really out of whack,</v>

96
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 2>like something that on the face of it you think that how could people really</v>

97
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 2>think it's cool to move to Idaho and not pay taxes and think the UN is going to</v>

98
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:57.631
<v Speaker 2>invite.</v>

99
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 2>How could people really think?</v>

100
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Indian guru is going to manifest Rolex watches.</v>

101
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 2>They call them cities by meditating and cure cancer by jamming on a keyboard.</v>

102
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

103
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 2>And an old bon Tempe keyboard.</v>

104
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

105
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.101
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

106
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:12.391
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

107
00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 2>the technique we used was to try and find the most likable,</v>

108
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 2>reasonable seeming person who exemplified that belief system.</v>

109
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 2>So you would,</v>

110
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.611
<v Speaker 2>it was like you,</v>

111
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:20.861
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

112
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>you take a weird sound check but cost it normal.</v>

113
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Like cast it a person who's likable and relatable when Mike was the guy we</v>

114
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>thought and when you found that guy and say that and I'll move in,</v>

115
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll spend a night with them.</v>

116
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

117
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>it was like to supposed to signal my commitment to the story as well.</v>

118
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 2>So in that story I spent the night,</v>

119
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

120
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Mike's Ashram and um,</v>

121
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.460
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

122
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>they had very thin mattresses,</v>

123
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 2>although I later found out there were different thicknesses depending on how</v>

124
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>committed you were,</v>

125
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 2>you would choose a thinner mattress so you can choose a thick when buying in</v>

126
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:51.491
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

127
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I just found a thin one so I put it on.</v>

128
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had one of the worst nights of sleep in my life and I woke up the</v>

129
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 2>next morning kind of groggy and as you are a offer night sleep,</v>

130
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 2>not just I'm going to bad tempered,</v>

131
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.210
<v Speaker 2>but also just my ci wasn't flowing right now,</v>

132
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 2>wasn't in tune with what was going on around me.</v>

133
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 2>And so when he asks,</v>

134
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>he said something about if you're,</v>

135
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:12.351
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

138
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 2>you fundamentalist because you've had a breakdown.</v>

139
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.431
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

140
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.830
<v Speaker 2>oh he's saying he had a breakdown.</v>

141
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

142
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Did you have some sadness in your life?</v>

143
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.010
<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>

144
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

145
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.921
<v Speaker 2>he kind of flipped.</v>

146
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Let's play that and you can find that.</v>

147
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 2>You can find that Jamie,</v>

148
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it's that video that you just showed if you back up about three or four minutes</v>

149
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:29.550
<v Speaker 2>before that find it is,</v>

150
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 2>is you'll see Louie getting out of bed and he looks very groggy and then he</v>

151
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>communicates with this guy and they have this sort of a weird breakdown.</v>

152
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 2>That's also the one where I try and call it.</v>

153
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Cause then the guru says he's a big fan of Siegfried and Roy or David</v>

154
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.891
<v Speaker 2>Copperfield's.</v>

155
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 2>They recover field.</v>

156
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.820
<v Speaker 2>He says he went to Vegas and I took it as a kind of slightly very subtle coded</v>

158
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>possible admission that he takes an interest in magic and therefore what he does</v>

159
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 2>is it kind of conjuring.</v>

160
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.691
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of,</v>

161
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to edge towards getting him to admit,</v>

162
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 2>like we know that you can't make a Rolex watch appear out of thin air.</v>

164
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

165
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And so why not just,</v>

166
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 2>let's just get that out there and admit that,</v>

167
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.331
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do.</v>

169
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 2>But he's a guru so he couldn't really admit it.</v>

170
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

172
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.823
<v Speaker 3>it's like this</v>

173
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.653
<v Speaker 3>just</v>

174
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.370
<v Speaker 3>does foot cause here</v>

175
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 3>he's working on a cosmic level.</v>

176
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.601
<v Speaker 3>Don't take this,</v>

177
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 3>don't take this the wrong way.</v>

178
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Mind who,</v>

179
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 3>was there any sadness in your life before you came to see the Swami and</v>

180
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:38.524
<v Speaker 3>committed to him?</v>

181
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I'd always have a little saying,</v>

182
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalism is the aftermath of a nervous breakdown.</v>

183
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

184
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.640
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

185
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

187
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit of course,</v>

188
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.414
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

189
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 3>did you ever but</v>

190
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.820
<v Speaker 3>come up with that please?</v>

191
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

192
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.401
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

193
00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:59.234
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

194
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.343
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

195
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

196
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.800
<v Speaker 3>the drugs,</v>

197
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

198
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.051
<v Speaker 1>she paused this,</v>

199
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:06.411
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>

200
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:06.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:07.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:07.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:08.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>burn out and then he goes down.</v>

206
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

207
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I think these are all towels.</v>

209
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I think he changed gears on you.</v>

210
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I really think his statement,</v>

211
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>there's initial statement,</v>

212
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:21.030
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism and,</v>

213
00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>and you know about nervous breakdowns.</v>

214
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he's really saying.</v>

215
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

216
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

217
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And then when you confront him on it,</v>

218
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>he realizes he's on camera.</v>

219
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>This is why the all the,</v>

220
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:31.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:31.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>he's thinking too much.</v>

224
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to come up with a way to spin that story in a,</v>

225
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:36.884
<v Speaker 1>in a better light.</v>

226
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>He's not just free flowing,</v>

227
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in his mind.</v>

228
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>He's dancing around the subject trying to wrestle it into a more acceptable,</v>

229
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>palatable flight deck.</v>

230
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

231
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.751
<v Speaker 2>I agree that,</v>

232
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:47.610
<v Speaker 2>but I think what I see my take on it,</v>

233
00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:48.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

234
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.523
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

235
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.480
<v Speaker 2>he's emotionally,</v>

236
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

237
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.610
<v Speaker 2>close to the surface and probably has been through a lot of difficult things.</v>

238
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.653
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

239
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

240
00:06:58.081 --> 00:06:58.771
<v Speaker 2>I know what I mean.</v>

241
00:06:58.771 --> 00:06:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

242
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I getting dangerously close to kind of diagnosing him,</v>

243
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

244
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.181
<v Speaker 2>in absentia.</v>

245
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:04.230
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

246
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

247
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.610
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

248
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.280
<v Speaker 2>but I also think he's trying to step outside it.</v>

249
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.173
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to say like,</v>

250
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>

251
00:07:10.021 --> 00:07:10.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

252
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.580
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not one of them.</v>

253
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.821
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

254
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he thinks that he did have a breakdown.</v>

255
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

256
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.721
<v Speaker 2>it could be bold.</v>

257
00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:16.650
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to play it off.</v>

258
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

259
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe he was a lovely guy though.</v>

260
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.900
<v Speaker 2>He was from the bay area happy it's doing it.</v>

261
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>He seemed like a very nice guy,</v>

262
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the interesting aspects of it.</v>

263
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>He also seemed fairly intelligent,</v>

264
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but he also claimed to be a total complete scan</v>

265
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.510
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>

266
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.871
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

267
00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:32.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:07:32.231 --> 00:07:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Isaac,</v>

269
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

270
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go on a little lecture,</v>

271
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:34.691
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

272
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Isaac Newton believed in Alchemy,</v>

273
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

274
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Did it?</v>

275
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

276
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Hailey spent like the last 20 years of his life.</v>

277
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Have you made probably the most important scientific breakthroughs,</v>

278
00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.763
<v Speaker 2>of all time,</v>

280
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.690
<v Speaker 2>the last 20 years of his life?</v>

281
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Kind of calculating the dimensions of Noah's Ark based on biblical,</v>

282
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

283
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.331
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

284
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:52.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

285
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:54.120
<v Speaker 2>just Wacko stuff and,</v>

286
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>and believed in the philosopher's stone,</v>

287
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:56.644
<v Speaker 2>in the idea of,</v>

288
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

289
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

290
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:58.981
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

291
00:07:58.981 --> 00:07:59.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

292
00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly surprised and the ways in which your rationality or what we could</v>

293
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

294
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.230
<v Speaker 2>choose to think of his rationality,</v>

295
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:07.390
<v Speaker 2>can coexist with rationalities.</v>

296
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 2>But I'm curious about the fact that you enjoyed the,</v>

297
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 2>the guru story.</v>

298
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

299
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

300
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

301
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.610
<v Speaker 2>cause I look back at that and it's not one that I would,</v>

302
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I feel is kind of one of my finest moment.</v>

303
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

304
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And I also love the part where you met the woman who was his guru,</v>

305
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>this female girl,</v>

306
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:28.514
<v Speaker 1>and she hugged,</v>

307
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:28.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

308
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 2>And I had it sort of transcendental experience.</v>

309
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.760
<v Speaker 2>What happened there?</v>

310
00:08:32.761 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

311
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

312
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.730
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to explain,</v>

313
00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:36.240
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

314
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

315
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:39.450
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I think,</v>

316
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:39.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.741
<v Speaker 2>in a male way,</v>

318
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that connected to like the deepest sources of my,</v>

319
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.391
<v Speaker 2>of my emotions.</v>

320
00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:46.224
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

321
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what it was,</v>

322
00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:51.900
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that being hugged is a very simple,</v>

323
00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:52.920
<v Speaker 2>and it's a physical act,</v>

324
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:53.211
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

325
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:53.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

326
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:53.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:54.090
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

328
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.923
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

329
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 2>it creates all kinds of emotions inside of you.</v>

330
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>And it just sort of welled up from nowhere.</v>

331
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 2>It was just really odd.</v>

332
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know exactly what happened.</v>

333
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:03.931
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

334
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that quite a bit after I watched it.</v>

335
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I took from it was the emotions.</v>

336
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>And just the whole group of people waiting in line to hug someone.</v>

337
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 1>The anticipation of it and the love that's in the air.</v>

338
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of this group minded thing is going on</v>

339
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of music.</v>

340
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Loud music is a lot of people around.</v>

341
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

342
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.710
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

343
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a very heightened atmosphere.</v>

344
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 2>And then she gave me a sort of turbo hug too.</v>

345
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:36.561
<v Speaker 2>Like she gave me the executive platinum card hog and I think they whispered to</v>

346
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.231
<v Speaker 2>her like,</v>

347
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 2>give this guy,</v>

348
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

349
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.103
<v Speaker 2>the works.</v>

350
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

351
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 2>so she hugged me for longer and she was actually muttering things into my ear.</v>

352
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.263
<v Speaker 2>What was she saying?</v>

353
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:48.631
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

354
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 2>not words that I recognize,</v>

355
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:50.724
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

356
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.563
<v Speaker 2>he was sort of like,</v>

357
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.853
<v Speaker 2>ah</v>

358
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Ha,</v>

359
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.643
<v Speaker 2>they'd have it.</v>

360
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.480
<v Speaker 1>So it was comforting noises.</v>

361
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.681
<v Speaker 1>That's the word.</v>

362
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Poon job as the word for their language.</v>

363
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

364
00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:03.221
<v Speaker 2>it's several levels.</v>

365
00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:08.221
<v Speaker 2>It's UAA spoken Hindi or I'm this or there's a few others too.</v>

366
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Too many to mention.</v>

367
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I would think that just the experience itself of being around all those people</v>

368
00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:19.381
<v Speaker 1>that were in this sort of dancing joyous state in this long line to get to this</v>

369
00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:24.451
<v Speaker 1>woman and she probably had some sincere loving gesture towards everyone as well.</v>

370
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean imagine what it would be like to be adored by so many people in such a</v>

371
00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:34.630
<v Speaker 1>large group of people that are established there to come see you and get in line</v>

372
00:10:34.631 --> 00:10:35.464
<v Speaker 1>to hug you.</v>

373
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.730
<v Speaker 1>But then you did it and,</v>

374
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.550
<v Speaker 1>but you are really like move.</v>

375
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.191
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

376
00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:39.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

377
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think as well I was under a lot of pressure.</v>

378
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

379
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.780
<v Speaker 2>when I'm doing those stories,</v>

380
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I feel very pent up and I'm aware that I have one chance to kind of get the</v>

381
00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:51.040
<v Speaker 2>thing that I'm trying to get.</v>

382
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.600
<v Speaker 2>And Weed was one of those classic things where I was supposed to hug her the day</v>

383
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.780
<v Speaker 2>before and then we took a crew break and went for an Indian meal.</v>

384
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.670
<v Speaker 2>And then when we arrived at the,</v>

385
00:11:00.671 --> 00:11:04.240
<v Speaker 2>the hugging tent that packed up and left and I was like,</v>

386
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.103
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

387
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.220
<v Speaker 2>we missed the hug.</v>

388
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.260
<v Speaker 2>And then it turned out she was doing two nights,</v>

389
00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:11.230
<v Speaker 2>she was doing like two dates in that city because she was on tour,</v>

390
00:11:11.231 --> 00:11:12.850
<v Speaker 2>like hugging her way around India.</v>

391
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:13.930
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

392
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:14.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

393
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:14.711
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked.</v>

394
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:16.540
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to get the hug now?</v>

395
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Just because like our crew wanted a nice meal and,</v>

396
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.433
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

397
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

398
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.210
<v Speaker 2>and so we took it up,</v>

399
00:11:22.211 --> 00:11:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I got to hear another night.</v>

400
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.040
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

401
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.040
<v Speaker 2>it was this long lead up to getting the hog and so it was a tightly wound coil</v>

402
00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:29.620
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

403
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.580
<v Speaker 2>of anxiety.</v>

404
00:11:30.581 --> 00:11:32.500
<v Speaker 2>So when I finally got there and had the hog,</v>

405
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.550
<v Speaker 2>it was several levels on which I felt just sort of relieved.</v>

406
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:37.961
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

407
00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:38.950
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

408
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

409
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.681
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

410
00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:41.251
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>

411
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:41.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

412
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:42.324
<v Speaker 2>it's one of lives,</v>

413
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>the one in life's mysteries and um,</v>

414
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do a thing on Scientology at the moment and that's a proven quiet,</v>

415
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 2>quite a difficult road.</v>

416
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:53.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

417
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 2>religion</v>

418
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.173
<v Speaker 1>is certainly,</v>

419
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 1>it certainly is one of life's great mysteries,</v>

420
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:02.821
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is also group states of like-mindedness that I find quite</v>

421
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 1>fascinating and you could get them when the people,</v>

422
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I was at a military base once it was a UFC fight for the troops and uh,</v>

423
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.020
<v Speaker 1>they sang the national anthem.</v>

424
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>It's in the middle of the Iraq war.</v>

425
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

426
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.761
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

427
00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

428
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

429
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 1>when they sang the national anthem,</v>

430
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the intensity and the feeling in the air,</v>

431
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:24.511
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

432
00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 1>that patriotism,</v>

433
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.321
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

434
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

435
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 1>just the emotions involved in,</v>

436
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with thousands of people in the audience who have lost loved</v>

437
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>

438
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 1>lost friends,</v>

439
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe been wounded themselves,</v>

440
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:39.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe taken lives themselves.</v>

441
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Many of them have shore taken lives themselves.</v>

442
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

443
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:43.041
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

444
00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>the palpable,</v>

445
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.380
<v Speaker 1>the patriotism and the emotion and the invite.</v>

446
00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And I am a person who was absolutely against all of these wars,</v>

447
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the Iraq invasion,</v>

448
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 1>the Afghanistan war.</v>

449
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I thought the whole thing was about money and the whole thing was ill advised.</v>

450
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the idea of going in for these supposed weapons of mass</v>

451
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>destruction was incredibly transparent.</v>

452
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought that the government and the military industrial complex was</v>

453
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:13.840
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing on a horrible event in September 11th and using that as an impetus</v>

454
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>to go and invade these countries and,</v>

455
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

456
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 1>and take over,</v>

457
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

459
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.930
<v Speaker 1>But that moment when that thing was happening and that person was singing the</v>

460
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:27.191
<v Speaker 1>national anthem,</v>

461
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 1>it was a soldier that was singing the national anthem and everyone was standing</v>

462
00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:33.970
<v Speaker 1>there proud and the energy in the air and they cheer.</v>

463
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:35.090
<v Speaker 1>When it was over,</v>

464
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you were ready to go to war.</v>

465
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

466
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:39.430
<v Speaker 1>you are ready to support the troops.</v>

467
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:41.980
<v Speaker 1>You're ready to not just support the troops but support the war.</v>

468
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.900
<v Speaker 1>You're ready to back them.</v>

469
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

470
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 1>there's this weird thing that happens,</v>

471
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:50.780
<v Speaker 1>these group minded sort of states that should,</v>

472
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 1>did you get into a kind of altered consciousness in that moment?</v>

473
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I felt something for sure.</v>

474
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel I could have easily cried if I,</v>

475
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 1>if I coaxed myself into it or if I entertain those thoughts,</v>

476
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.353
<v Speaker 1>the feeling,</v>

477
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

478
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I was working at the time I was,</v>

479
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:06.191
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

480
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:06.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I was there for the ultimate fighting championship.</v>

482
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.031
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

483
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:10.864
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

484
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.011
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

485
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>the state of mind,</v>

486
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:13.871
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

487
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:14.111
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

488
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>the group state was fucking intense and it was,</v>

489
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>it was palpable.</v>

490
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:21.700
<v Speaker 1>It was tangible.</v>

491
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>It was in the air.</v>

492
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.281
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

493
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>this is coming from a person who I believe that it's very important to have</v>

494
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:29.381
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>

495
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there are bad people in the world.</v>

496
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there's sometimes no other solutions.</v>

497
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

498
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in pacifism when you're dealing with thugs and evil people in</v>

499
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

500
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:41.643
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

501
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>But I also believe that there's good people that are sent into bad situations</v>

502
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.860
<v Speaker 1>for all the wrong reasons,</v>

503
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>by people that are trying to make money.</v>

504
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>But in that state,</v>

505
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.210
<v Speaker 1>in that state was being there with all those soldiers being there with all these</v>

506
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:56.541
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

507
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:56.841
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

508
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you got swept away by it.</v>

509
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>He just kept carried away by this.</v>

510
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.890
<v Speaker 1>This intense feeling of patriotism is an indescribable because you could feel</v>

511
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 1>the emotions of those people that are in that,</v>

512
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

513
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.463
<v Speaker 1>that room.</v>

514
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder if that's similar to what you were experiencing when you were</v>

515
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:15.224
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

516
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

517
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it very close.</v>

518
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:17.691
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

519
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:17.901
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

520
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:19.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's not the only time when,</v>

521
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:21.331
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

522
00:15:21.331 --> 00:15:25.440
<v Speaker 2>if the only time I think I felt that exact sort of emotion of as a sort of</v>

523
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever that was at a religious transcendence.</v>

524
00:15:27.601 --> 00:15:28.800
<v Speaker 2>But I've,</v>

525
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

526
00:15:29.311 --> 00:15:31.770
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of times when you are around people.</v>

527
00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

528
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.240
<v Speaker 2>in a way,</v>

529
00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:37.320
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the stories I do are about the altered consciousness of being exposed</v>

530
00:15:37.321 --> 00:15:39.450
<v Speaker 2>to people who believe things passionately.</v>

531
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And that slight sense of Stockholm Syndrome that sets in when you were there for</v>

532
00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:45.750
<v Speaker 2>prolonged periods,</v>

533
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

534
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:46.321
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

535
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

536
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.730
<v Speaker 2>and the weird,</v>

537
00:15:47.731 --> 00:15:48.564
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

538
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Cha did the change in consciousness that takes place.</v>

539
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:52.621
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

540
00:15:52.621 --> 00:15:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

541
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.230
<v Speaker 2>I did a story where I was with the Phelps clan,</v>

542
00:15:55.231 --> 00:15:56.550
<v Speaker 2>the Westboro Baptist church,</v>

543
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.280
<v Speaker 2>and I was spent three weeks with them.</v>

544
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

545
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.410
<v Speaker 2>if I did two different things,</v>

546
00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:02.520
<v Speaker 2>but for the first one I was at for three,</v>

547
00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:04.530
<v Speaker 2>which is called the most hated family in America.</v>

548
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.250
<v Speaker 2>And it was really odd because when you're inside there,</v>

549
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.180
<v Speaker 2>there are little compound in their,</v>

550
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 2>in their castle imbibing there and their doctrine around the clock,</v>

551
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 2>stuff that seems really weird and hateful on the outside starts to seem mundane.</v>

552
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

553
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.290
<v Speaker 2>you're still able to step outside of their lives.</v>

554
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to do a job and this is wrong.</v>

555
00:16:27.031 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

556
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.071
<v Speaker 2>you get a nice,</v>

557
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:29.850
<v Speaker 2>the ties,</v>

558
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.480
<v Speaker 2>your mind,</v>

559
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.610
<v Speaker 2>your mind starts to get influenced.</v>

560
00:16:32.611 --> 00:16:33.210
<v Speaker 2>It's really</v>

561
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:33.720
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

562
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it is.</v>

563
00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

564
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I've found the Phelps one very fascinating because of the one guy that came</v>

565
00:16:40.231 --> 00:16:43.980
<v Speaker 1>there to film a documentary on them and then became one of them.</v>

566
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 2>He joined up Steve.</v>

567
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:45.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

568
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.850
<v Speaker 2>he's very high up there now.</v>

569
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

570
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:48.651
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

571
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 2>and his daughter,</v>

572
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

573
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.773
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

574
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:51.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

575
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years ago we went back and did a followup because a couple of the</v>

576
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 2>people we featured in the first one then left.</v>

577
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 2>But Steve almost,</v>

578
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:04.870
<v Speaker 2>you could argue by dint of having been born outside the church was compensating</v>

579
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 2>by being even more hardcore cause he was the fiercest and the most,</v>

580
00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:11.924
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

581
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.070
<v Speaker 2>in conversation.</v>

582
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 2>He was the hardest and the most,</v>

583
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:16.814
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

584
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 2>the most abusive.</v>

585
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I get most verbally full of bile.</v>

586
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And he also,</v>

587
00:17:22.451 --> 00:17:25.300
<v Speaker 1>when you questioned anything that he was saying,</v>

588
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:26.410
<v Speaker 1>what starting salting you.</v>

589
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

590
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:27.431
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

591
00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And aggressively and salting you and I found that fascinating as well.</v>

592
00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:33.490
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that you could have questions.</v>

593
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.181
<v Speaker 1>It was that,</v>

594
00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 1>what do you fucking idiot.</v>

595
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>It was like immediately this aggressive sort of,</v>

596
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.420
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

597
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 2>told me I was the most,</v>

598
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the phrase he said,</v>

599
00:17:41.391 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 2>it sound like the most iniquitous are the most evil man in the history of the</v>

600
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 2>earth or one of the three most evil men.</v>

601
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.781
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

602
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 2>you're right up there with punches.</v>

603
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Like I was one of the three most evil men of all time,</v>

604
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:53.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

605
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.930
<v Speaker 2>way beyond Hitler.</v>

607
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 2>And the reason was,</v>

608
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 2>the reason was because I'd been exposed to the teachings,</v>

609
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 2>like I'd been given a special opportunity.</v>

610
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:10.221
<v Speaker 2>Like I was blessed beyond measure because I had been exposed for three weeks to</v>

611
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:15.681
<v Speaker 2>the pure teachings of the only people preaching salvation on earth.</v>

612
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 2>And having seen that and still rejected it,</v>

613
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 2>then that put me way beyond the Pale.</v>

614
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I found it incredibly fascinating.</v>

615
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:31.071
<v Speaker 2>How effective of a guy who sucks at speaking is at running a cop.</v>

616
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a terrible orator.</v>

617
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 2>He's not like this really charismatic ramps.</v>

618
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:37.284
<v Speaker 2>The main guy.</v>

619
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 2>He's very old now.</v>

620
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Like he's in his time.</v>

621
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 2>He could,</v>

622
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 2>he could do it.</v>

623
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.331
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was,</v>

624
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 2>I think you're being a little unfair.</v>

625
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 2>You remember the bit where he says,</v>

626
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:45.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat.</v>

627
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 2>You can eat your babies.</v>

628
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.361
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

629
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 2>he's still,</v>

630
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.330
<v Speaker 2>he's very old and,</v>

631
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.690
<v Speaker 2>and kind of decrepit,</v>

632
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 2>but he still cranks it up and he goes,</v>

633
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you're going to eight.</v>

634
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 2>You're made A's.</v>

635
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.301
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

636
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree.</v>

637
00:18:58.171 --> 00:18:58.901
<v Speaker 2>I follow.</v>

638
00:18:58.901 --> 00:19:00.030
<v Speaker 2>So one note,</v>

639
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.230
<v Speaker 2>it was like death metal.</v>

640
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.380
<v Speaker 2>You can eat.</v>

641
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.270
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

642
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

643
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:06.180
<v Speaker 2>it was just so obvious.</v>

644
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

645
00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just there.</v>

646
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:08.390
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

647
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 2>who do you like Billy Graham?</v>

648
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Like what preaching style do you prefer?</v>

649
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 2>A Sam Kinison this is my favorite.</v>

650
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

651
00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

652
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I just think that there are people who are better at it than Phelps.</v>

653
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Phelps is so negative and so abrasive.</v>

654
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I think there's almost his,</v>

655
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.110
<v Speaker 2>he's so believably evil bill,</v>

656
00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 2>he starts dearly beloved.</v>

657
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.530
<v Speaker 2>He did has a slow bill,</v>

658
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:32.364
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

659
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 2>And then he ramps it up and then he get,</v>

660
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:35.124
<v Speaker 2>he hits his,</v>

661
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.860
<v Speaker 2>his kind of power chorus,</v>

662
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.580
<v Speaker 2>if you can eat your babies.</v>

663
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something when someone's unbelievably evil and aggressive where</v>

664
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you don't want them to be angry at you.</v>

665
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.410
<v Speaker 2>So you're willing to sort of like bend your mind to what they're saying and</v>

666
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:53.640
<v Speaker 2>accept it and allow it in.</v>

667
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I felt watching that guy.</v>

668
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen that in him before and in his speeches I've tried to sort of</v>

669
00:20:00.331 --> 00:20:02.560
<v Speaker 2>rationalize or understand what's going on when,</v>

670
00:20:02.561 --> 00:20:03.241
<v Speaker 2>when he talks,</v>

671
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:03.571
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

672
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 2>when anybody gets sucked into all this evil,</v>

673
00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>hateful talk and not question it.</v>

674
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's,</v>

675
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 2>he's so over the top and so aggressive that he's frightening to people.</v>

676
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Like when you sat down with them and talk to them about the thing.</v>

677
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean by and large,</v>

678
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 2>they don't really make converts.</v>

679
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:19.291
<v Speaker 2>They make a few,</v>

680
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 2>but he's not trying to recruit,</v>

681
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

682
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>new personnel.</v>

683
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:23.881
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>

684
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:24.720
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>

685
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 2>They re they view it as a,</v>

686
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

687
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.590
<v Speaker 2>as a confirmation of the holy status and of their salvation that they're</v>

688
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.470
<v Speaker 2>rejected because there's some verse somewhere in the Bible saying,</v>

689
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:41.310
<v Speaker 2>you will be hated of men and people will throw things at you.</v>

690
00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 2>It's somewhere in the Bible.</v>

691
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.180
<v Speaker 2>And so every time someone says you're full of it,</v>

692
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:45.961
<v Speaker 2>you're scum,</v>

693
00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:46.830
<v Speaker 2>we hate you.</v>

694
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 2>That what they hear is,</v>

695
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:49.151
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

696
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

697
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.830
<v Speaker 2>we're saved.</v>

698
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 2>So and so when he,</v>

699
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

700
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

701
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 2>so like 90% of the people in there were born into it and a family members and in</v>

702
00:20:57.941 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 2>fact they Lou,</v>

703
00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 2>they hemorrhage membership constantly.</v>

704
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 2>They kick people out.</v>

705
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.390
<v Speaker 2>So when he's preaching,</v>

706
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 2>he's not thinking,</v>

707
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 2>how do I get new new followers?</v>

708
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

709
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that he's thinking that.</v>

710
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering the effectiveness of retaining anyone out of tickets even.</v>

711
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Well there I guess there is the main effectiveness is that,</v>

712
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

713
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.333
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it,</v>

714
00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:21.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

715
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you would know obviously much more than I,</v>

716
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you were there for three weeks deeply embedded into that organization.</v>

717
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 2>He hated me.</v>

718
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.451
<v Speaker 2>Gramps did.</v>

719
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 2>And he was one of the few times where you try and do an interview with someone</v>

720
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.670
<v Speaker 2>who clearly can't stand you.</v>

721
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.250
<v Speaker 2>And I did an,</v>

722
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I said something like,</v>

723
00:21:39.441 --> 00:21:39.601
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

724
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 2>how can you really believe that there's no like even if you accept that what you</v>

725
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:44.770
<v Speaker 2>say is true,</v>

726
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.451
<v Speaker 2>you know that position is,</v>

727
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 2>there is no other church in the world that is preaching the doctrine.</v>

728
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:50.711
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

729
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 2>how would you even know?</v>

730
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Like there could be some tiny church in Nigeria that's preaching the exact same</v>

731
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:56.734
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>

732
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.690
<v Speaker 2>How would you know?</v>

733
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.451
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't even know.</v>

734
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 2>He goes and he says,</v>

735
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:00.141
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

736
00:22:00.141 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I know about them.</v>

737
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:01.961
<v Speaker 2>And I asked another question.</v>

738
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:03.920
<v Speaker 2>It goes asked and answered and I also,</v>

739
00:22:03.921 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 2>and another because asked an answer and he just kept saying,</v>

740
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Austin answered,</v>

741
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 2>which is a legal term.</v>

742
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

743
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:10.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

744
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.793
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

745
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.431
<v Speaker 2>What did you do?</v>

746
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Then there's nothing you could chuck.</v>

747
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 2>He's the epitome of a close minded person.</v>

748
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean he is closed minded,</v>

749
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Speaker 2>not just that,</v>

750
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 2>but this arrogant assumption that he's the man with the word of God and that it</v>

751
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 2>comes out of this angry old fuckheads face.</v>

752
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

753
00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:29.411
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

754
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:29.711
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

755
00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing thing that this guy is able to put together this group.</v>

756
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

757
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

758
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.570
<v Speaker 2>this is the moment where he sat down and talked to this guy,</v>

759
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

760
00:22:38.331 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

761
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 2>how long have you been with him by then?</v>

762
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.003
<v Speaker 2>Thickness was,</v>

763
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:42.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think.</v>

764
00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 2>It was the end of it.</v>

765
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.800
<v Speaker 2>We made three trips each of a week.</v>

766
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 2>This was the second trip last day.</v>

767
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.940
<v Speaker 3>If you had just a little knowledge of the Bible,</v>

768
00:22:50.941 --> 00:22:54.410
<v Speaker 3>you will know that what you just said is stupidity in Spain.</v>

769
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to deal with a question like that.</v>

770
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

771
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.590
<v Speaker 3>we just took down.</v>

772
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:00.643
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

773
00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.870
<v Speaker 3>You've got the duty to know the Bible as well as I do.</v>

774
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.883
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

775
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Because you are human beings called God Almighty major and got all my,</v>

776
00:23:10.011 --> 00:23:11.320
<v Speaker 3>are going to send your ass to hell.</v>

777
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Is it accurate to say that you regard the Westboro Baptist church is the only</v>

778
00:23:15.971 --> 00:23:19.520
<v Speaker 3>church giving biblical preaching according to the word?</v>

779
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.483
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

780
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 3>The answer your question is yeah,</v>

781
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.351
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

782
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:24.370
<v Speaker 3>it was five minutes.</v>

783
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:24.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

784
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:26.380
<v Speaker 3>but I already talked to them.</v>

785
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.120
<v Speaker 3>So there's three left.</v>

786
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

787
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.510
<v Speaker 3>the real fucking shitty,</v>

788
00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:35.130
<v Speaker 3>nasty preaching that is according to the word of God is fancy.</v>

789
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Ashton answered next question.</v>

790
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.990
<v Speaker 3>As far as your concerned.</v>

791
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.850
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>

792
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

793
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is angry shitty man</v>

794
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.070
<v Speaker 1>who's able to get a bunch of people to listen to him.</v>

795
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.450
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

796
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 2>he gets his five kids,</v>

797
00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 2>his kids and his grandkids.</v>

798
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:52.541
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

799
00:23:52.541 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 2>how many people were there?</v>

800
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.870
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there was a little 20 or 30 or 90.</v>

801
00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

802
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:57.950
<v Speaker 2>That's hip hop.</v>

803
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:58.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

804
00:23:58.131 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 2>He had 11.</v>

805
00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

806
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I think I want to get this right.</v>

807
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 12 kids,</v>

808
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:07.541
<v Speaker 2>but for them had left the church and each of them had had quite a few kids.</v>

809
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.181
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

810
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:12.014
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

811
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're an EGOMANIAC,</v>

812
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.313
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

813
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:15.981
<v Speaker 2>number two,</v>

814
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:20.981
<v Speaker 2>if whatever reason you cleave to a certain kind of dogmatic religious outlook is</v>

815
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:24.190
<v Speaker 2>probably not that difficult to,</v>

816
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

817
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.220
<v Speaker 2>to run,</v>

818
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 2>to have a cult.</v>

819
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:27.991
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunate.</v>

820
00:24:27.991 --> 00:24:28.830
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're right.</v>

821
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

822
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.511
<v Speaker 1>it's shocking.</v>

823
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:31.330
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're right.</v>

824
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

825
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I've often said that all you have to do is speak confidently and clearly and</v>

826
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 1>most people would be like,</v>

827
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

828
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.990
<v Speaker 2>And have no compunction about saying that you speak the word of God or whatever</v>

830
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:42.450
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

831
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.650
<v Speaker 1>That's really all you have to do,</v>

832
00:24:43.651 --> 00:24:43.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

833
00:24:43.951 --> 00:24:45.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the guy with the answers.</v>

834
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.570
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the guy that absolutely not just the answers like as a human,</v>

835
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:50.280
<v Speaker 1>but the answer is from above from it.</v>

836
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

837
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:54.000
<v Speaker 2>have you read the new Manson book then you Charles Manson Book by Jeff Gwyn?</v>

838
00:24:54.001 --> 00:24:55.040
<v Speaker 2>It came out last year.</v>

839
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.461
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

840
00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I try not to read anything that comes out about Manson.</v>

841
00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

842
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

843
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask you why in a second.</v>

844
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 2>But when you read it,</v>

845
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:02.594
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

846
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh my word.</v>

847
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Speaker 2>You just have to be kind of come out with a few kind of riddles that you've</v>

848
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:12.971
<v Speaker 2>learned from street pimps and people fall into your lap or so it would seem,</v>

849
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.750
<v Speaker 2>you made me,</v>

850
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.771
<v Speaker 2>I ain't sure.</v>

851
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Garbage man.</v>

852
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.160
<v Speaker 2>He people made me,</v>

853
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm your product.</v>

854
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.420
<v Speaker 1>All that fucking maniacal shit.</v>

855
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that that guy's the Bob hope of serial killers.</v>

856
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:28.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

857
00:25:28.381 --> 00:25:31.650
<v Speaker 1>cause Bob hope was a comedian that never really made anybody that in my</v>

858
00:25:31.651 --> 00:25:32.580
<v Speaker 1>generation laugh.</v>

859
00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:32.821
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

860
00:25:32.821 --> 00:25:34.290
<v Speaker 1>we always knew him as a comedian,</v>

861
00:25:34.291 --> 00:25:36.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's like just really wasn't funny.</v>

862
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Manson was never scary to me.</v>

863
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some real serial killers that we're fucking terrifying.</v>

864
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.860
<v Speaker 1>But when you think of serial killers,</v>

865
00:25:43.861 --> 00:25:45.390
<v Speaker 1>it's always Manson.</v>

866
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Manson Manson is the guy,</v>

867
00:25:47.431 --> 00:25:48.270
<v Speaker 1>the crazy guy,</v>

868
00:25:48.271 --> 00:25:49.140
<v Speaker 1>the wild guy.</v>

869
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Cause he carved a fucking swastika in his head.</v>

870
00:25:51.211 --> 00:25:52.030
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

871
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean Henry Lee Lucas,</v>

872
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.240
<v Speaker 1>the guy from that,</v>

873
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.290
<v Speaker 1>they made that movie about him.</v>
