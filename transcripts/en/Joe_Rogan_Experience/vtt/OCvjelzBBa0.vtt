<v Speaker 1>Phil,</v>

8
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>how you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ecstatic.</v>

9
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.014
<v Speaker 1>Joy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even begin to thank you for </v>

10
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

11
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:17.864
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for my having been on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast two years ago and returning now </v>

12
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>in a very timely manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd be a fish out of water.</v>

13
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:27.794
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the cars that I sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent and all the multiple lawsuits </v>

15
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:32.390
<v Speaker 1>that are levied against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>all the animal activists that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm amongst.</v>

17
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>But let's explain to everybody who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfamiliar.</v>

18
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>had a lawsuit with a marine world used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work for marine world marine.</v>

20
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Larry Marine land skews me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like seaworld for Canada,</v>

21
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>something like that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A type of seaworld.</v>

22
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Seaworld is a day at the spa for animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to marine land.</v>

23
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

24
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that much worse.</v>

25
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Significantly worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you worked for them.</v>

26
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were released from your job fired as</v>

27
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit voluntarily.</v>

28
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I quit amidst a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say you're fired.</v>

29
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

30
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody admits her.</v>

31
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never gave him the opportunity to fire</v>

32
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made there were going to,</v>

33
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's the inclination I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had at the time.</v>

34
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.203
<v Speaker 1>But you were a trainer and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you opened up a lot of people's </v>

35
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>eyes to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was actually pre blackfish,</v>

37
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was pre blackfish.</v>

38
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>You came on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

39
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate pot candy and uh,</v>

40
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.533
<v Speaker 1>was in Hawaii once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like many years ago and I hadn't </v>

41
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>experienced with dolphins were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>these dolphins were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were fishing in.</v>

43
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:44.444
<v Speaker 1>These dolphins were coming by the boat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were jumping and playing with </v>

44
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:51.281
<v Speaker 1>us and I remember thinking like this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they might as well be people,</v>

45
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>they might as well be like water people </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

46
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something weird about this,</v>

47
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're enjoying playing with us.</v>

48
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Like as we yell to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do more stuff.</v>

49
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Like they came by and they were jumping </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were clearly looking at us when</v>

50
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:04.994
<v Speaker 1>they jumped to the water and I'd never </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to seaworld before because I had </v>

51
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:10.424
<v Speaker 1>seen some documentaries on dolphins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they were really smart and had </v>

52
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:13.694
<v Speaker 1>seen some documentaries and orcas as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and it just always seemed really </v>

53
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 1>fucked up to me that they make them stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these swimming pools.</v>

54
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>But when you came on the podcast two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and illuminated what it's like</v>

55
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that marine land,</v>

56
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.243
<v Speaker 1>it was horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man and I got a lot of tweets from </v>

57
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.813
<v Speaker 1>and facebook messages that said they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never go to seaworld or marine </v>

59
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:36.524
<v Speaker 1>land again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they realized really what it </v>

60
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

61
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.163
<v Speaker 1>Then the documentary blackfish came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole world was sort of forced </v>

62
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:49.781
<v Speaker 1>to take a look at this and understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these animals are super intelligent</v>

63
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.923
<v Speaker 1>just because they can't manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>things just because they can't pick </v>

64
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>things up and they can't write their </v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

65
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.203
<v Speaker 1>They can't send you an email in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that's unnecessary and </v>

66
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in the natural world.</v>

67
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>They're moving through three d space and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

68
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.403
<v Speaker 1>they have free food and fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a huge community of fellow </v>

69
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.114
<v Speaker 1>orcas and fellow dolphins and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other through a </v>

70
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>very complex language that we barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

71
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>They have a fucking language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>

72
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.880
<v Speaker 1>like monkeys go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

73
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>and the other monkey goes like kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

74
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Now they have a complex language with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>

75
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>They might as well be water</v>

76
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.913
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've already evolved to be the top </v>

77
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.124
<v Speaker 3>Predator of the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's no need for them to learn to </v>

78
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 3>email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no use for it,</v>

79
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.224
<v Speaker 3>so they've all their already the the </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute top predators of the sea and </v>

80
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 3>that's a way to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

81
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Like we have this kind of view of</v>

82
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>our position being the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let mean we're kind of the top Predator,</v>

83
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.953
<v Speaker 1>but we're only the top Predator because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our minds because we figured out how </v>

84
00:03:50.601 --> 00:03:53.840
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have huge minds,</v>

85
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:56.420
<v Speaker 1>they have incredible brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're also.</v>

86
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>They eat everything they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to evolve any further.</v>

87
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Speaker 1>They've sort of mastered there</v>

88
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 3>and they're amazingly adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They evolve in every which capacity to,</v>

89
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to,</v>

90
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.113
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to adjust to the ever changing world </v>

91
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 3>killer whales now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

92
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.373
<v Speaker 3>I recently watched the documentary and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>on account of the melting ice in the </v>

93
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Arctic in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

94
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

95
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice floes are receding,</v>

96
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:23.250
<v Speaker 3>they're becoming smaller and smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>

97
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.383
<v Speaker 3>So now orchids are now going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>territories that they'd never had </v>

98
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:26.994
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're in nun have documented that </v>

99
00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:30.960
<v Speaker 3>they've seen orcas actually hunt bowl </v>
<v Speaker 3>whales,</v>

100
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:34.110
<v Speaker 3>which are 50 ton larger than an ORC </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

101
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 3>And what they do is they isolate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

102
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.150
<v Speaker 3>They bite their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

103
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.080
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fins,</v>

104
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.990
<v Speaker 3>they hold them underwater while another </v>
<v Speaker 3>oracle goes on top of their blow hole to</v>

105
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:43.771
<v Speaker 3>try to drown it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

106
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adapting.</v>

107
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.170
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>that's where they got their name killer </v>
<v Speaker 1>whales from killing whales.</v>

110
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

111
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.543
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think they're a type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>will there actually a cousin to a </v>

112
00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:55.394
<v Speaker 1>dolphin.</v>

113
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.570
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are dolphins.</v>

114
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 3>They're just the largest dolphin and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dolphin family,</v>

115
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.930
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat dolphins too,</v>

116
00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:02.630
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killer whales,</v>

117
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.570
<v Speaker 3>humans eat monkeys unbenounced to most </v>
<v Speaker 3>killer whales are and you have to,</v>

118
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.853
<v Speaker 3>you have to sort of disassociate things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to sort of draw a line between </v>

119
00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:14.804
<v Speaker 3>killer whales being cute and loving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just how you want to use the word </v>

120
00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:18.291
<v Speaker 3>statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

121
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 3>they are evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>

122
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.300
<v Speaker 3>evil in the way that they hunt and kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are merciless,</v>

123
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we have this idea of earth,</v>

124
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

125
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.853
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart things are supposed to be </v>

126
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.534
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and we're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stewards of the land and take care </v>

127
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>of the little chipmunks and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>

128
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>But because we're so far ahead of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other animals that we kinda.</v>

129
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

130
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of feel bad the way we treat </v>

131
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.444
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to kind of treat other animals </v>

132
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why,</v>

133
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal rights organizations and all </v>

134
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

135
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>these people that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really love and care about animals.</v>

136
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.840
<v Speaker 1>That's where they sort come under fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>

137
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>they want people to treat animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than animals.</v>

138
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.054
<v Speaker 1>Treat animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals are fucking mean shit to each </v>

139
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the way of the world.</v>

140
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.653
<v Speaker 3>One of the videos that stood out for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually it was like a sort of a </v>

141
00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:14.200
<v Speaker 3>wake up call for me was just how was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how nasty nature is,</v>

142
00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:15.034
<v Speaker 3>and it was a video that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>shared and it was of a bear taking down </v>

143
00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:19.420
<v Speaker 3>a deer yard.</v>

144
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's back.</v>

145
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's tough to watch,</v>

146
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

147
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It was screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deer was screaming.</v>

148
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 1>The bear was just eating it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ferociously.</v>

149
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about bears as opposed </v>

150
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>to cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a cat gets a deer,</v>

151
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.063
<v Speaker 1>they go right for the neck and they kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pretty quick because that's all they </v>

152
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But bears do a lot of thing.</v>

153
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>They eat berries and roots and plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't always kill things.</v>

154
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>That matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably eat more plant matter then</v>

155
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>they do animal matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they kill things,</v>

156
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>they basically just hold these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and start eating.</v>

157
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a question of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

158
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>if it arises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

159
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.053
<v Speaker 1>eat a lot of funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big issue in Canada where </v>

160
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you're from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

161
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat a lot of moose,</v>

162
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 1>moose calves and a deer fonds they eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like as they're coming out,</v>

163
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 1>they actually smell the placenta and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

164
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.601
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.434
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that surrounds the baby </v>

166
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.223
<v Speaker 1>and they'll find these moose as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving birth and just literally pull </v>

167
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>them right out of their body fucked up.</v>

168
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an animal rights activist by a,</v>

169
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 3>I suppose that's the label that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been given,</v>

170
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.670
<v Speaker 3>but I should mention that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

171
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.683
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of animal rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>activists that owe you a great deal of </v>

172
00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:37.360
<v Speaker 3>credit for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

173
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 3>for your sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

174
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I want to use your sort of advocacy </v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that there are,</v>

175
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.823
<v Speaker 3>there's a stark line between those who </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in not killing animals and </v>

176
00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:51.084
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there are also other people </v>

177
00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:53.034
<v Speaker 3>that can appreciate how nature operates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator prey relationship and can also </v>

178
00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:58.470
<v Speaker 3>appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 3>at least in what you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you've said before,</v>

180
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.730
<v Speaker 3>you yourself are opposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>captivity of animals.</v>

181
00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last time we were on,</v>

182
00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:07.794
<v Speaker 3>you've mentioned of going to a zoo and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe eating a cookie and having a look </v>

183
00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:12.120
<v Speaker 3>at the monkeys and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

184
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.310
<v Speaker 3>you're throwing bose through animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

185
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.333
<v Speaker 3>and I very much respect the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that you hunt in the way that </v>

186
00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:18.534
<v Speaker 3>you eat is a kill what you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement or whatever you want to call </v>

187
00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:22.224
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as an animal rights activist I can </v>

188
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:25.770
<v Speaker 3>say that that is a far more responsible </v>
<v Speaker 3>way than,</v>

189
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to take a look at the factory </v>

190
00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Speaker 3>farming things and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

191
00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

192
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.141
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

193
00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I forgot the point I was making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

194
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's sort of almost would seem like</v>

195
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a against them in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way because I eat meat.</v>

196
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is a lot of animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights activists have fucking cats,</v>

197
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they feed their cats cat food.</v>

198
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.213
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit ain't grown on a cat food </v>

199
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

200
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reality to the world.</v>

201
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 1>And cats are brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cats are vicious little fuckers and they</v>

202
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>need protein and if you have a cat and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have two of them,</v>

203
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>

204
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>They come cuddle with me and while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching TV</v>

205
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.080
<v Speaker 3>on any given day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got five cats,</v>

206
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.113
<v Speaker 3>three that I claim as my own too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just sort of come and go at will </v>

207
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.910
<v Speaker 3>wildcats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

208
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is one of the neighbors sort of,</v>

209
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I would say that he's sort of neglected </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

210
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 3>And in terms of how you care for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>domestic cat.</v>

211
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when he moved away he said,</v>

212
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:15.961
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take care of this cat,</v>

214
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 3>which I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on my second level balcony.</v>

215
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 3>I built this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it the Taj mckinney.</v>

216
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 3>It was this place where the cat could </v>
<v Speaker 3>come live in the winter.</v>

217
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:24.954
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's real cold.</v>

218
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he said,</v>

219
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to keep this cat?</v>

220
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.593
<v Speaker 3>So I got it fixed and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he likes to show his gratitude by </v>

221
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 3>bringing us a baby rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever seen a baby rabbit,</v>

222
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:35.694
<v Speaker 3>the cutest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he maliciously licks them down to </v>

223
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 3>the point of just chewing them until the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sound stops and leaving them as gifts.</v>

224
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 3>And you can't help but love Eugene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eugene is the is amazing and loving cat.</v>

225
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 3>He's also a just a cold blooded killer.</v>

226
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.603
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to think about it that </v>

227
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:57.084
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But animals today that are alive today </v>

228
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 are alive because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors,</v>

229
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>especially predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cats were fucking vicious.</v>

230
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.043
<v Speaker 1>They were vicious and ruthless and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>made sure they killed everything they </v>

231
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.150
<v Speaker 1>could because if you don't kill that </v>
<v Speaker 1>little baby rabbit,</v>

232
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 1>the there might not be anything left for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to eat that day and you might starve</v>

233
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 1>or you might be too weak to get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from something that wants to kill you.</v>

234
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.933
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be too weak to get away from a </v>

235
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>bowl for you might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

237
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>we have a beautiful situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd go to the store,</v>

238
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>we buy food that someone else killed for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and we can get it every time.</v>

239
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.753
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a rare thing like you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wait for it if you have to put in a </v>

240
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 1>lot of effort to get it throughout human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

241
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 1>It's always been difficult to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 1>food until recently.</v>

242
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.833
<v Speaker 1>Recently it's become so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to get out of your </v>

243
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:46.884
<v Speaker 1>fucking car to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You literally pull into a fucking drive </v>

244
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:50.964
<v Speaker 1>thru you hand these people paper within </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds they hand you already cooked </v>

245
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>meat in a sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ground beef sandwich.</v>

246
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.563
<v Speaker 1>You put it on your seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you a glass of liquid sweet </v>

247
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:04.944
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's stick that in your Little Cup </v>

248
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>holder and you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

249
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.623
<v Speaker 1>Never before in human history is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and that lack of effort and </v>

250
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:13.854
<v Speaker 1>lack of connection has bred a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have a really distorted </v>

251
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:18.174
<v Speaker 1>understanding of life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love really distorted understanding of </v>

252
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:25.050
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to make a ground beef </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>

253
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to raise a cow yourself and </v>

254
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 1>go through that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a few friends that do it.</v>

255
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I have my good friend Doug in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grows his own cows.</v>

256
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>They're all grass fed and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

257
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me some,</v>

258
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>some meat from it last time I was there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does it all himself.</v>

259
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>He shoots him himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he does the whole deed.</v>

260
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.340
<v Speaker 1>He butchers them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hangs them,</v>

261
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.473
<v Speaker 1>the whole deed and that guy understands </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to make a ground beef </v>

262
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:53.703
<v Speaker 1>sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of us is pulling to that drive </v>

263
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

264
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.343
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a privileged perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's people that have never had to do </v>

265
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:59.060
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

266
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Put any effort in raising their food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that are farmers and it's</v>

267
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 3>the same story and they love and respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>their animals through and through,</v>

268
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:05.974
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

269
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a contradiction,</v>

270
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:09.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

271
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 3>loving your animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put killing it.</v>

272
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.083
<v Speaker 3>I think in defense of anyone that likes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to call out hypocrisy is that you have </v>

273
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:17.134
<v Speaker 3>to take a look at the fact that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypocrisy in absolutely everything you </v>

274
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the fact that loan that.</v>

275
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to use vegans as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

276
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.060
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to look at what,</v>

277
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.423
<v Speaker 3>what an abomination of nature is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>the functions of society as a whole </v>

278
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.653
<v Speaker 3>city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a city of physical city is an </v>

279
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:32.960
<v Speaker 3>abomination of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

280
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a Vegan and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

281
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 3>renting an apartment and driving a car </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately,</v>

282
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:38.224
<v Speaker 3>there's hypocrisy in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this is not me calling out at </v>

283
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 3>the idea of living a compassionate life </v>
<v Speaker 3>or propagating that.</v>

284
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great.</v>

285
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I encourage that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the world needs more compassion,</v>

286
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the judgment,</v>

287
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the judgment.</v>

288
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

289
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.143
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you start looking from the </v>

290
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 3>perspective of someone who's privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yeah,</v>

291
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.130
<v Speaker 3>the judgment.</v>

292
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.450
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judgment comes.</v>

293
00:12:57.451 --> 00:13:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it comes from a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where people are like,</v>

294
00:13:00.271 --> 00:13:02.790
<v Speaker 1>fuck this factory farming shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

295
00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:03.810
<v Speaker 1>People who eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

296
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:04.740
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get angry,</v>

297
00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:05.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love animals,</v>

298
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.223
<v Speaker 1>but it's so hilarious when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat that's feasting on a multitude of </v>

299
00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 1>animals that have been raised in </v>
<v Speaker 1>captivity.</v>

300
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:17.250
<v Speaker 1>All of them being the way they raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

301
00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:18.120
<v Speaker 1>When you you're buying</v>

302
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.890
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

303
00:13:19.891 --> 00:13:20.724
<v Speaker 3>you're buying like</v>

304
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.603
<v Speaker 1>the worst treated animals ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of like ethically </v>

305
00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:27.890
<v Speaker 1>source cat food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it exists.</v>

306
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I haven't heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even as it'd be sourced cat food,</v>

307
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.383
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

308
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.233
<v Speaker 1>it's murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you feed your cats plants and there </v>

309
00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:37.610
<v Speaker 1>are people who do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have organ failure.</v>

310
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.980
<v Speaker 1>They fucking get heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They die,</v>

311
00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.140
<v Speaker 1>they can't live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people.</v>

312
00:13:42.141 --> 00:13:42.974
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found these people because I found </v>

313
00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:48.440
<v Speaker 1>these people because they're hating on </v>
<v Speaker 1>me after my last,</v>

314
00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:51.200
<v Speaker 1>a comedy central special where I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bit about vegans.</v>

315
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

316
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.053
<v Speaker 1>whenever people get really mad at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to go to their twitter page and </v>

317
00:13:55.011 --> 00:13:55.844
<v Speaker 1>read what they're into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's fucking people's twitter </v>

318
00:13:58.221 --> 00:14:02.270
<v Speaker 1>page and I found out that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole Vegan cat forum,</v>

319
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Vegan cat owners and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag cruelty free and these fuckers,</v>

320
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.713
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feed their cats plants and they </v>

321
00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:12.500
<v Speaker 1>don't live long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They die.</v>

322
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those cats.</v>

323
00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be nice if we could bridge that</v>

324
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:17.570
<v Speaker 1>language barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

325
00:14:17.571 --> 00:14:19.130
<v Speaker 1>If you rolled a mouse by one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>

326
00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:21.620
<v Speaker 1>they would dive on it like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dress,</v>

327
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.680
<v Speaker 1>like a man in the ocean that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally got to land.</v>

328
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you just barely made it this </v>

329
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.063
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling that you get when you get </v>

330
00:14:32.211 --> 00:14:34.700
<v Speaker 1>to land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

331
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.551
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

332
00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:36.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a line in,</v>

333
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.390
<v Speaker 3>in all advocacy where how far are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to go?</v>

334
00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:40.224
<v Speaker 3>And it's a question of it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a question of how willing are you </v>

335
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.373
<v Speaker 3>to sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in South Korea for awhile and </v>

336
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.000
<v Speaker 3>this is a country that was leveled back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the mid fifties.</v>

337
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:50.220
<v Speaker 3>They had to rebuild from essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

338
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.740
<v Speaker 3>And so I saw a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I saw a pig heads being served up</v>

339
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:55.574
<v Speaker 3>on the side of roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can appreciate that these people </v>

340
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:57.764
<v Speaker 3>had suffered so much so that they had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat everything that was available to </v>

341
00:15:00.301 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 3>them and I don't want to sit here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend that,</v>

342
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.021
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

343
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 3>So South Koreans are eating dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatnot.</v>

344
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

345
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.670
<v Speaker 3>it's symbolic of their history and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatnot,</v>

346
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 3>but if you've got nothing left to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see how quickly your,</v>

347
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ethics change,</v>

348
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because truly,</v>

349
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 3>if you are truly suffering</v>

350
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.110
<v Speaker 1>and a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love dogs.</v>

351
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I have two dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest about what a dog is.</v>

352
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.883
<v Speaker 1>A dog is a little captive pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're your buddies because you feed </v>

353
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 1>them and you take care of them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this relationship with them and you</v>

354
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 1>have this agreement with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you ran into a wild dog,</v>

355
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.753
<v Speaker 1>there was a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elderly couple I want to say like </v>

356
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.413
<v Speaker 1>maybe seven or eight years ago that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed by a pack of wild dogs in </v>

357
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia,</v>

358
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>United States Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know that area.</v>

359
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck man?</v>

360
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Like dogs will fucking kill you if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have any food.</v>

361
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.643
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think that they are like old </v>

362
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 1>yeller or lassie or some know what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

363
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 1>is exactly how you treat them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>

364
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 1>If you get a puppy like my dog johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a dog named Johnny cash.</v>

365
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.120
<v Speaker 1>He's the sweetest dog of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is so nice.</v>

366
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.890
<v Speaker 1>He's just so gentle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

367
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a mastiff and he's just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>

368
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.153
<v Speaker 1>He just like anybody that comes over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never worried about him barking at </v>

369
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>them or if he barks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

370
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come play with me,</v>

371
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you go up to and be like,</v>

372
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:17.354
<v Speaker 1>what's up dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's always like super happy and </v>

373
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:19.874
<v Speaker 1>super sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's because I've had them from the </v>

374
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>time he was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who bred him,</v>

375
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

376
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.813
<v Speaker 1>he's always been like really ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how he breeds these dogs and </v>

377
00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:30.674
<v Speaker 1>they're very smart and kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's because of the relationship </v>

378
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 1>that I had with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows I'm the Daddy.</v>

379
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I give him the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give them the love,</v>

380
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all this,</v>

381
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.610
<v Speaker 1>this agreement as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

382
00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

383
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:41.803
<v Speaker 3>they're physically cute on account of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that we selectively bred them </v>

384
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 3>through and they themselves learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

385
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:47.690
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm like really Das island cute,</v>

386
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 3>look what these big puppy dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get more food and I get a better place</v>

387
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:51.464
<v Speaker 3>to live and get more of a warm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a warm or shelter and I'm not likely to </v>

388
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:54.950
<v Speaker 3>wind up in the backyard and winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

389
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was actually a radio lab podcast.</v>

390
00:16:57.961 --> 00:17:02.961
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely fascinating on raising</v>
<v Speaker 1>foxes and they raised foxes.</v>

391
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say Fox is right.</v>

392
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not like dear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

393
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to correct you.</v>

394
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like fishes foxes.</v>

395
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Fishes isn't acceptable word</v>

396
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:17.591
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

397
00:17:17.591 --> 00:17:19.000
<v Speaker 3>But you can use the word fishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

398
00:17:19.001 --> 00:17:19.834
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was a large debate about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this was figured out back in </v>

399
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 3>the mid nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started this as part of my.</v>

400
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

401
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

402
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:27.134
<v Speaker 1>the radio lab about foxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they selectively bred fox is based on </v>

403
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:31.274
<v Speaker 1>their behavior based on whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were aggressive in the ones that </v>

404
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:34.964
<v Speaker 1>were aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed and the ones that reacted a </v>

405
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:37.094
<v Speaker 1>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the actual parameters </v>

406
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 1>that they set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately what it was,</v>

407
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>and if you're into this google it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't remember the name of the</v>

408
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was amazing.</v>

409
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Within a few generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like within less than 10 years,</v>

410
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.253
<v Speaker 1>they had completely changed with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>foxes looked like their ears had become </v>

411
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:57.744
<v Speaker 1>droopy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their jaws would become less pronounced </v>

412
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:03.060
<v Speaker 1>and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their behavior was markedly different.</v>

413
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.013
<v Speaker 1>They were literally were almost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different species and it was within 10 </v>

414
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:08.214
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things adapt and change and that's the </v>

415
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 1>reverse to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I heard on your podcast,</v>

416
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:14.154
<v Speaker 1>is that if you were to release a wild or</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather a pig and then it eventually </v>

417
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:19.760
<v Speaker 1>starts growing hair again and like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>protruding some tests because I'm out of</v>

418
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 1>six weeks.</v>

419
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within six weeks,</v>

420
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:23.883
<v Speaker 1>a fucking month of a pig living in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild and all of a sudden their hair </v>

421
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>starts growing thicker and longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their nose extends,</v>

422
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.480
<v Speaker 1>their tusks grow larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become a different thing.</v>

423
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.820
<v Speaker 1>They literally start to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start to adapt to the,</v>

424
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:38.763
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

425
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical shape of wild pig like,</v>

426
00:18:42.311 --> 00:18:44.380
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been around wild pigs </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

427
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 1>So not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

428
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>

429
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are black.</v>

430
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>They're like a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark color.</v>

431
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not even talking about boards </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about,</v>

432
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:53.590
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

433
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.400
<v Speaker 1>we think of bore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a board is actually the term for</v>

434
00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.680
<v Speaker 1>a male pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

435
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.793
<v Speaker 1>So when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people go to a menu and it says </v>

436
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.360
<v Speaker 1>wild boar sausage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it really?</v>

437
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a wild girl,</v>

438
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be a sow like the word,</v>

439
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an ignorant terminology.</v>

440
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.153
<v Speaker 1>But then there's these Russian bores is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different type of bore that lives in </v>

441
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.660
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what the genius is,</v>

442
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:19.494
<v Speaker 1>what the name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crazy thing is they're all </v>

443
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:21.894
<v Speaker 1>interchangeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other can all breed with each </v>

444
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same thing.</v>

445
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately there's dodgy crossbred all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time to sort of like pull out the,</v>

446
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

447
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

448
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 1>the advantages that we're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're breeding them so you can make</v>

449
00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:36.834
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they were breeding I and I don't </v>

450
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember where now,</v>

451
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:40.104
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were selectively breeding this </v>

452
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:42.024
<v Speaker 1>hunter have a dog and they just made </v>
<v Speaker 1>this mammoth machine but also a </v>

453
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:48.240
<v Speaker 1>domicile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>domicile and trusted creature.</v>

454
00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 1>So I wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I remembered where I,</v>

455
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.510
<v Speaker 1>where I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

456
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

457
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.123
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that dogs are a lot like </v>

458
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 1>people in that way that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different variations of people.</v>

459
00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.933
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've got Shaquille o'neal and </v>

460
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:05.780
<v Speaker 1>then you've got a Natasha Leggiero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

461
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Little Tiny Natasha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a comedian.</v>

462
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.770
<v Speaker 1>She's a 100 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you know,</v>

463
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.670
<v Speaker 1>there's people very almost as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs do in that sense.</v>

464
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

465
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.810
<v Speaker 1>we're all sorts of different shapes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks and.</v>

466
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 1>But my point being wild animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a feral cat.</v>

467
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:23.244
<v Speaker 1>I've had feral cats before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a feral cat and he was fucking </v>

468
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you actually get near him?</v>

469
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I could only me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally only me,</v>

470
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 1>no one else could get near and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiss and fucking run away.</v>

471
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>He would hiss at me half the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I approached them real slow,</v>

472
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 1>but once I picked him up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

473
00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:41.604
<v Speaker 1>he would start preparing like crazy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact alone that you got close enough to </v>

474
00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 1>be able to pick them up as a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare.</v>

475
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did was I tamed him and it was a </v>

476
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 1>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Lanie,</v>

477
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her boyfriend and her,</v>

478
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in this apartment and they had,</v>

479
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:54.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down below I went to high school with </v>

480
00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:57.244
<v Speaker 1>her and down below their apartment they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found a cat that had given birth to a </v>

481
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 1>litter of wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is like Santa Monica.</v>

482
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

483
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.264
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they decided to capture these cats </v>

484
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.740
<v Speaker 1>and try to get them home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So me and like the asshole that I am.</v>

485
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:12.131
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

486
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took one of them.</v>

487
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I brought them home and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

488
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a kitten.</v>

489
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring them home and hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>my cat.</v>

490
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:20.914
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had two cats at the time and he </v>

491
00:21:24.611 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 1>was so fucking different than them.</v>

492
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.600
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd look at you just fucking jump up.</v>

493
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six features mentally different.</v>

494
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so scared of everything.</v>

495
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:36.970
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

496
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Everything was a legitimate life or </v>
<v Speaker 1>death struggle.</v>

497
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

498
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet wasn't around back then,</v>

499
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.440
<v Speaker 1>so I was trying to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

500
00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get to know this little dude.</v>

501
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.820
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I food and what it did was I uh,</v>

502
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Speaker 1>took this room in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a bed in there.</v>

503
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like a guest room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir had bad in there.</v>

504
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided it's going to be my room now.</v>

505
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.020
<v Speaker 1>So a close myself in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a litter box in there.</v>

506
00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I brought some books and hung out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking cat for two days.</v>

507
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 1>You're brave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

508
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This cat,</v>

509
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I think cat attack humans.</v>

510
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's a violent man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a kitten.</v>

511
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.630
<v Speaker 1>It was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a baby,</v>

512
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I would have never done this with full </v>
<v Speaker 1>blown can.</v>

513
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.980
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

514
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Full blown cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't.</v>

515
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't train them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was only,</v>

516
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.750
<v Speaker 1>he was a little tiny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I did was,</v>

517
00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:23.584
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

518
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.723
<v Speaker 1>I would pet him and he per like crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when I put him down he will </v>

519
00:22:27.351 --> 00:22:28.184
<v Speaker 1>hiss at me and run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was so fucked up and I mean he </v>

520
00:22:31.091 --> 00:22:33.190
<v Speaker 1>would jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say he fucked up my curtains,</v>

521
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.263
<v Speaker 1>jumped through the air and grabbed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>curtains and was like trying to climb </v>

522
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.270
<v Speaker 1>them and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like out of control.</v>

523
00:22:39.271 --> 00:22:39.641
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

524
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I was just petting you a few seconds </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

525
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.873
<v Speaker 1>but the life or death struggle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things were involved in even </v>

526
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever he got from his mom and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

527
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.383
<v Speaker 1>like the genes that were passed down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their genes have wild animals that were </v>

528
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 1>really scared of everything and trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive.</v>

529
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.920
<v Speaker 1>So he thought he was about to get eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it became my little buddy.</v>

530
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took a while.</v>

531
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.183
<v Speaker 1>Was there an element of you that's sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of loved the fact that it was bad ass </v>

532
00:23:04.711 --> 00:23:06.580
<v Speaker 1>and scratching your curtains that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're like,</v>

533
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

534
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.780
<v Speaker 1>It was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

535
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.743
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of just the idea of </v>

536
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.020
<v Speaker 1>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

537
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I think we live in cities and living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities and driving cars and sleeping and</v>

538
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 1>nice houses and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a yard,</v>

539
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:28.190
<v Speaker 1>it's probably as close to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get to nature on a daily basis.</v>

540
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.363
<v Speaker 1>They got a tree and some fucking grass </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the yard when you're out in wild and </v>

541
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you see wild nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most fascinating things about</v>

542
00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:41.170
<v Speaker 1>hunting is not just the pursuit of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal that you're going to eat,</v>

543
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's also spending a lot of time out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the real wild.</v>

544
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Like the real while we're fucking elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

545
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:49.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a thousand pound animal lives its </v>

546
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:53.234
<v Speaker 1>life with fucking trees growing out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his head and wanders through the forest </v>

547
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 1>and couple weeks a month out of the year</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to fuck.</v>

548
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of the time it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>running from danger and eating,</v>

549
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's massively interesting.</v>

550
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Not the slightest clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Native of the modern world,</v>

551
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't care less.</v>

552
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 1>All it cares about is doing what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally does to stay alive.</v>

553
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:15.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's really where animals should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

554
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

555
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:17.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the premise of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

556
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.203
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we're sort of dealing with that </v>

557
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just so fascinating when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

558
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I encourage everybody.</v>

559
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zoos are bullshit,</v>

560
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.720
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bullshit.</v>

561
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 1>They give you a stupid idea of what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal is.</v>

562
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there to make your money.</v>

563
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.150
<v Speaker 1>They're not in reintroducing animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the wild there.</v>

564
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

565
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:35.024
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say there's nothing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to hope that there are some </v>

566
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 1>programs where they help animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know what it is.</v>

567
00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:40.544
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some animals that are so far </v>

568
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 1>gone and needs so much help that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

569
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.383
<v Speaker 1>it benefits them to have some of them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>captivity just so they can keep a </v>

570
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.390
<v Speaker 1>breeding population alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately,</v>

571
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:56.270
<v Speaker 1>does that breeding population get </v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduced into wild in any capacity?</v>

572
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases,</v>

573
00:24:58.191 --> 00:24:59.024
<v Speaker 1>they've done it with tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they've done it with some </v>

574
00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

575
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard.</v>

576
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

577
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sliding in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who care about wild animals.</v>

578
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:08.714
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely care about wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's made people think you </v>

579
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:12.350
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a hunter,</v>

580
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:13.760
<v Speaker 1>you eat and I get it.</v>

581
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand where they're coming from,</v>

582
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but this is how I try to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those animals are going to die no matter</v>

583
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:23.690
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every they're all going to die.</v>

584
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:24.524
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about wiping out </v>

585
00:25:26.571 --> 00:25:28.440
<v Speaker 1>populations with hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

586
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that and I don't think any</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters are trying to do that.</v>

587
00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:31.844
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what hunters are trying to do and what </v>

588
00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:36.770
<v Speaker 1>they have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more deer in North America today</v>

589
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 1>than they were when Columbus landed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is a bunch of things,</v>

590
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.760
<v Speaker 1>but a big part of it is wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>

591
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.013
<v Speaker 1>The wildlife agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like department of fish and wildlife in </v>

592
00:25:47.411 --> 00:25:49.220
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>department of fish and game,</v>

593
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very careful about how many deer</v>

594
00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 1>they allow people to take and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences for poaching,</v>

595
00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:56.924
<v Speaker 1>like stiff consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put you in jail and because of </v>

596
00:25:58.371 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>these rules and enforcing these ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've allowed these animals to grow in</v>

597
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:05.900
<v Speaker 1>massive numbers and then of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also agriculture.</v>

598
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.733
<v Speaker 1>Agriculture contributes to them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the most deer population or the </v>

599
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.760
<v Speaker 1>biggest deer population in America is </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually around people.</v>

600
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It's usually in people and farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the biggest deer in the world,</v>

601
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:17.594
<v Speaker 1>like Iowa and Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're known for like the biggest deer </v>

602
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.510
<v Speaker 1>in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada is actually known for the biggest</v>

603
00:26:23.511 --> 00:26:24.344
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that has to do with cold </v>

604
00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:26.054
<v Speaker 1>temperatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating larger body to animals because </v>

605
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 1>they have to generate more heat to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

606
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.443
<v Speaker 1>but my point is I'm not a hater of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals exist just because I kill them </v>

607
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:36.741
<v Speaker 1>and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

608
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

609
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

610
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds contradictory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're.</v>

611
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>When you're eating an</v>

612
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.610
<v Speaker 4>animal is almost like a sacred thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you hunt an animal and you kill and</v>

613
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.453
<v Speaker 4>you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like such a hippie horseshit </v>

614
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 4>or some pseudo spiritual horseshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is kind of sacred.</v>

615
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.533
<v Speaker 4>There is something that happens when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cook a steak of an elk that I ate and I </v>

616
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:02.760
<v Speaker 4>grilled that thing and I eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>

617
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.220
<v Speaker 4>There's a connection that I have to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat that's.</v>

618
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.890
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an environment of different levels.</v>

619
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:13.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the word earned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is the correct word for it.</v>

620
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

621
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm connected to that animal.</v>

622
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm connected to where this meat comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

623
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 4>I know that that animal ate from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grass,</v>

624
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the forest,</v>

625
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 4>and then I killed it and now I'm eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and this was like this weird,</v>

626
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 4>crazy cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I grew up on a moose meat.</v>

627
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 4>My Dad was a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>avid hunter.</v>

628
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:34.860
<v Speaker 4>He went out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a nice stock photo recently.</v>

629
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 4>If a kid up on that microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>

630
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 4>so pull it towards you could pull it </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards the back.</v>

631
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I saw a photo recently have my dad back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be in the eighties and he took</v>

632
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:42.054
<v Speaker 4>down a bull moose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this was a massive animal and </v>

633
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:43.900
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

634
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.980
<v Speaker 4>the best of my recollection was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating that animal.</v>

635
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:50.850
<v Speaker 4>So I mean even the fact alone that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat eater and you know,</v>

636
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.330
<v Speaker 4>people rarely now back in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a different story,</v>

637
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:55.164
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been a largely a paradigm shift </v>

638
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:59.340
<v Speaker 4>in how we view animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially captive animals,</v>

639
00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 4>but that was called out quite a bit for </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a hypocrite.</v>

640
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:02.514
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you eat meat or you got leather shoes </v>

641
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 4>and it says as if my message is worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

642
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

643
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.610
<v Speaker 4>you're not paying attention to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the core of my message,</v>

644
00:28:09.611 --> 00:28:10.444
<v Speaker 4>like stop attacking the Messenger and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the sort of defense I have </v>

645
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:15.090
<v Speaker 4>against people who like to call </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypocrisy in everything.</v>

646
00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.240
<v Speaker 4>Do you eat fast food and like store </v>
<v Speaker 4>bought food?</v>

647
00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:19.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my,</v>

648
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.450
<v Speaker 4>at my weakest moments and admittedly a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>

649
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:22.284
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried,</v>

650
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I tried not to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And last time I was on the show,</v>

651
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.141
<v Speaker 4>I had stressed that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

652
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:25.974
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to get away from pork and still </v>

653
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 4>I tried to make an ethical decision as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>

654
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 4>but not at three in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

655
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.130
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens.</v>

656
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:33.950
<v Speaker 4>It was just like last night we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving around with cruise around,</v>

657
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.913
<v Speaker 4>we needed to eat and we found our food </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we gave them that paper money and I </v>

658
00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 4>slept better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's tricky,</v>

659
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:43.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tricky trying to stay alive.</v>

660
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.390
<v Speaker 4>And the last time I was on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had actually mentioned that I was,</v>

661
00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:48.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a hard time getting off cheese.</v>

662
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 4>And it's recent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting because recently I read</v>

663
00:28:51.571 --> 00:28:53.210
<v Speaker 4>a study that cheese may very well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

664
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.670
<v Speaker 4>react to you or your mind may actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>react to cheese.</v>

665
00:28:55.671 --> 00:29:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Similarly to crack that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could quote it better again,</v>

666
00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:01.284
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did read this article and it said </v>

667
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:04.644
<v Speaker 4>that the more processed that a food is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it creates some type of fat that </v>

668
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 4>your brain itself becomes addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

669
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 4>And they actually referenced an </v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction to crack.</v>

670
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 4>And that it was similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

671
00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Cheese really is cracks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

672
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 4>you're on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a raise change.</v>

673
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.683
<v Speaker 4>She's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crack steady reveals cheese is as </v>

674
00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 4>addictive as drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is fucking insane.</v>

675
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:24.503
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what that makes sense because </v>

676
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:27.160
<v Speaker 4>it tell you what Anthony Bourdain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

677
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 4>that motherfucker loves cheese and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

678
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.780
<v Speaker 4>had notorious substance abuse problems </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the past.</v>

679
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 4>But I've fucking hung out with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

680
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.943
<v Speaker 4>The way he talks about cheese is a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>young 22 year old guys talk about pussy </v>

681
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 4>now you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

682
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:45.020
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stinky cheeses.</v>

683
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Stinkiest the better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull that up so I can understand that.</v>

684
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:48.070
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>

685
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 4>let me pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull it up so the techs could read.</v>

686
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.473
<v Speaker 4>This is fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For years you've been telling your </v>

687
00:29:53.891 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 4>friends family cohort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the title of this?</v>

688
00:29:55.901 --> 00:30:00.901
<v Speaker 4>That it's from the La Times food daily </v>
<v Speaker 4>dish by Jenn Harris.</v>

689
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.853
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it says for years you've been telling </v>

690
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:04.931
<v Speaker 4>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

691
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 4>coworkers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and anyone who will listen to that.</v>

692
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:10.720
<v Speaker 4>You're addicted to cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of every meal or snack.</v>

693

<v Speaker 4>And you think about it constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A few studies suggests that food </v>

<v Speaker 4>foods are more addictive than others.</v>

696
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.903
<v Speaker 4>Researchers identified addictive foods </v>
<v Speaker 4>from about 500 people who completed in </v>

709
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:02.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I've been eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>lately.</v>

710
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.123
<v Speaker 4>I've been eating raw cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning raw cheese from the whole </v>

<v Speaker 4>foods.</v>

713
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.670
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Raw milk is great too.</v>

714
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.320
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing I've gotten away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most.</v>

715
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.810
<v Speaker 4>I growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drank a lot of milk,</v>

716
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 4>a lot of milk.</v>

717
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 4>I would say more than the average </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

718
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Now I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't stomach it.</v>

719
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 4>Burleson milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

720
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 4>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no urge for it whatsoever.</v>

721
00:31:23.561 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 4>Now just so how do you eat cookies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

722
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 4>There's the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hypocrisy comes in,</v>

723
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The largest hypocrite I admitted.</v>

724
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:31.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're right.</v>

725
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:35.500
<v Speaker 4>So I guess I do have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do have a different course.</v>

726
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.580
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

727
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard on the podcast before and I'm</v>

728
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 4>going to accept some of the judgment </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to come from it,</v>

729
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.883
<v Speaker 4>but I've made the switch to almond milk </v>
<v Speaker 4>and feel free to rant about how bad </v>

730
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 4>almond milk is for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

731
00:31:47.711 --> 00:31:48.544
<v Speaker 4>the environment a for all the almonds </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are being wasted and the water use </v>

732
00:31:51.821 --> 00:31:52.654
<v Speaker 4>and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is a perspective that </v>

733
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.341
<v Speaker 4>people like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

734
00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 4>almond milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a healthy alternative.</v>

735
00:31:55.691 --> 00:31:57.540
<v Speaker 4>But if you look at it from the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>

736
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 4>the environmental impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything else,</v>

737
00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.913
<v Speaker 4>almond milk shit.</v>

738
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not bad.</v>

739
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 4>It's just what almond milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's one thing that everybody needs to</v>

740
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:07.360
<v Speaker 4>consider when you buy almond milk and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>tastes good.</v>

741
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.021
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

742
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:10.750
<v Speaker 4>this is so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at the fucking label bitches.</v>

743
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.633
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because guarantee that shit is filled </v>

744
00:32:12.761 --> 00:32:14.380
<v Speaker 4>with sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duncan called me up,</v>

745
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.240
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been drinking almond milk.</v>

746
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so delicious.</v>

747
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:19.350
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

748
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

749
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.703
<v Speaker 4>What kind of drink?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he tells me that I go look at the </v>

750
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 4>label and look how much sugar is in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

751
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like 18 grams.</v>

752
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:28.841
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

753
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:31.800
<v Speaker 4>every class is 18 grams of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

754
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're not supposed to have like</v>

755
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:35.763
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to be healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe you're supposed to have </v>

756
00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 4>more than 25 grams of a day.</v>

757
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.903
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like a limit where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit a limit and if you go over that </v>

758
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:44.061
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

759
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:44.894
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking with your body there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude's getting most of that from a </v>

760
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 1>glass of supposedly healthy almond milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

761
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink a lot of it admittedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tastes the alternative.</v>

762
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it does taste good.</v>

763
00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of nutty flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a nice texture.</v>

764
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.930
<v Speaker 1>What can I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

765
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm really bad when you're in a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>like California,</v>

766
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.410
<v Speaker 1>which is normally how experiencing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drought today.</v>

767
00:33:05.411 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It's porn like fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the middle of the Nina.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I around know if you'll know theses Nino</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a fix.</v>

769
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to warm the water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll think they do.</v>

770
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:20.330
<v Speaker 1>There's no consequences to your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danielle is ia.</v>

771
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.070

<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

772

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

773
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

774
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.503
<v Speaker 1>I like watching all these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dummies who have no idea how to drive </v>

775
00:33:29.631 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 1>when it rains out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

776
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.003
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things I loved about </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in Colorado for the brief </v>

777
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:35.510
<v Speaker 1>time when it would snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

778
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

779
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.263
<v Speaker 1>I love a little consequences for living </v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth and nature is a thing that we </v>

780
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:46.280
<v Speaker 1>avoid in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have avoided it.</v>

781
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It's doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It barely exists.</v>

782
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 1>When we go to the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

783
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

784
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only time you know you can go</v>

785
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:54.590
<v Speaker 1>visit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to the park and visit it,</v>

786
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.950
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

787
00:33:56.951 --> 00:34:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's no consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like water probably in California</v>

788
00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 1>as some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>

789

<v Speaker 1>the glue that's going to keep the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>together because you guys are bad ass </v>

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 1>surely a million dollar idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

809
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it probably costs a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

810
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking of the earnings if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can manage to figure out how to,</v>

811
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.990
<v Speaker 1>how to extract that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually have,</v>

812
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a desalination plant that they are going</v>

813
00:35:05.661 --> 00:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>online with this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in San Diego.</v>

814
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Is that this year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that story?</v>

815
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

816
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.180
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

817
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.113
<v Speaker 1>there apparently they do have emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies to extract salt from water </v>

818
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.243
<v Speaker 1>and they've used them in the Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they just have ungodly amounts of </v>

819
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:23.020
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

820
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.670
<v Speaker 1>they just have so much money over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the oil that some of these,</v>

821
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.890
<v Speaker 1>some of these dudes have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

822
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.203
<v Speaker 1>tried to use that money to create </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines that can suck the salt out of </v>

823
00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:33.680
<v Speaker 1>the water and figure out some way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>filter it.</v>

824
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates can drink water from his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

825
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 1>You'd like to think that someone could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do what he's doing.</v>

826
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.113
<v Speaker 4>What he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd been invented a machine that we </v>

827
00:35:41.461 --> 00:35:43.460
<v Speaker 4>extracted water from human shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he was like,</v>

828
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 4>from actual shit from like think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was shit,</v>

829
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.203
<v Speaker 4>we'll use the word sewage just for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sake of making a little more broader </v>

830
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.503
<v Speaker 4>spectrum of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what you do when you have </v>

831
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:58.191
<v Speaker 4>$90,000,000,000 bold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's getting Fiji and heavy on.</v>

832
00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:01.020
<v Speaker 4>And I heard Fiji's not even really from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Fiji.</v>

833
00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Those fucks I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bullshit.</v>

834
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard Fiji is just some fucking.</v>

835
00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Just some spring water from the middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>of nowhere.</v>

836
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Plant opened up December 14th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

837
00:36:10.861 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 4>did open up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

838
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 4>So went online at the end of 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

839
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:15.750
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge developments.</v>

840
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.040
<v Speaker 4>That's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's gonna.</v>

841
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 4>Fix the whole fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go Jesus Christ.</v>

842
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:21.144
<v Speaker 4>Why we were right next to so much water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to fly over it in a fucking </v>

843
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 4>plane and it takes 16 hours to get to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other side.</v>

844
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.580
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to plead ignorant here,</v>

845
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:31.990
<v Speaker 4>but why are we not just showering with </v>
<v Speaker 4>saltwater,</v>

846
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.940
<v Speaker 4>maybe extinguishing fires with </v>
<v Speaker 4>saltwater.</v>

847
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.853
<v Speaker 4>Why are we not using the salt water in </v>
<v Speaker 4>different capacities that we're not </v>

848
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.800
<v Speaker 4>imposing so much?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good question to,</v>

849
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to process it.</v>

850
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

851
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.603
<v Speaker 4>the thing about saltwater is it does </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrode things like really badly if </v>

852
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:47.340
<v Speaker 4>you're near the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

853
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:48.174
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who has a beach house </v>
<v Speaker 4>and every time we go to hang out with </v>

854
00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:53.640
<v Speaker 4>them and his beach house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everything's like all fucked up and</v>

855
00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:54.474
<v Speaker 4>corroded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're constantly dealing with </v>

856
00:36:55.321 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 4>corrosion because of the salt in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>

857
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.180
<v Speaker 4>It's just a constant moisture and salt </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

858
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:02.250
<v Speaker 4>They corrode the shit out of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm.</v>

859
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.980
<v Speaker 4>Why used to live in Boston?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

860
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:05.903
<v Speaker 4>cars are always fucked up like old cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find like if you want to </v>

861
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 4>find like a 1970 plymouth or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

862
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:12.683
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to find one that's in good </v>
<v Speaker 4>shape because they're all rusted out </v>

863
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:17.150
<v Speaker 4>from the salt that they throw in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground when it,</v>

864
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.110
<v Speaker 4>when it snows out to melt the snow.</v>

865
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.750
<v Speaker 4>So that's why my cars were all fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

866
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the point being almond milk,</v>

867
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:25.710
<v Speaker 4>the problem with almond milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it uses a lot of water,</v>

868
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.310
<v Speaker 4>they use a shitload of almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you're extracting very little of</v>

869
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:30.144
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the nutritional value from the </v>

870
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 4>almonds per capita if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like versus like this mass amount.</v>

871
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.280
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But writing it down or what?</v>

872
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.560
<v Speaker 4>That's what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

873
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:38.790
<v Speaker 4>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

874
00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 4>So I'll eat almost all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Care about their life.</v>

875
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.590
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't really.</v>

876
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.840
<v Speaker 4>We don't really care much about plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

877
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:46.703
<v Speaker 4>We want it to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't think about it the way we </v>

878
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 4>think about animal life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we want animal life to be there,</v>

879
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 4>but we don't want anybody to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like plant life.</v>

880
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:55.044
<v Speaker 4>The only time people get bummed out </v>
<v Speaker 4>about plants and someone chops down </v>

881
00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:58.920
<v Speaker 4>ancient redwood or something like that.</v>

882
00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.820
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

883
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:00.960
<v Speaker 4>how could you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

884
00:38:00.961 --> 00:38:01.794
<v Speaker 4>I've read somewhere where plants can </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually hear when they're being eaten </v>

885
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.753
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen some studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or rather I read something somewhere </v>

886
00:38:08.101 --> 00:38:08.934
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where a plant has a similar hunting </v>

887
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.903
<v Speaker 4>behavior as animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're actually the roots will </v>

888
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 4>physically chase or get fined their </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrients.</v>

889
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.820
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

890
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.240
<v Speaker 4>some would argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

891
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.270
<v Speaker 4>that plants are just as conscious or </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceivably conscious as a,</v>

892
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.480
<v Speaker 4>as animals as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

893
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 4>they're different in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>humans are different than dolphins.</v>

894
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:32.160
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 4>level of an Orca versus the intelligence</v>

895
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:32.994
<v Speaker 4>level of a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we would like to think that we're </v>

896
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 4>smarter</v>

897
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 1>than them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence of that.</v>

898
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:38.434
<v Speaker 1>If we lived in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would look like fucking idiots if we </v>

899
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 1>were swimming around with them trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay alive,</v>

900
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at these dummies with their fingers</v>

901
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:47.810
<v Speaker 1>and they're exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick's,</v>

902
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.020
<v Speaker 1>he's going to eat by crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucks,</v>

903
00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 1>they can't even sleep in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they going to die?</v>

904
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.110
<v Speaker 1>They would think we were retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

905
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.153
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of how you know when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at their life and what they're </v>

906
00:39:01.271 --> 00:39:02.104
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're perfectly adapted to their </v>

907
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

908
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.553
<v Speaker 1>a tree is perfectly adapted to it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and there's been a lot of </v>

909
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:11.554
<v Speaker 1>research done on plant intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of evidence to suggest </v>

910
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 1>that these aren't inanimate objects like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rock.</v>

911
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It just happens to get larger every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

912
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are living things.</v>

913
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.233
<v Speaker 1>They're living things that do </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculations that somehow or another </v>

914
00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other.</v>

915
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.680
<v Speaker 1>They let other plants know when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being preyed upon.</v>

916
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.753
<v Speaker 1>They develop methods in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourage predation and that's where </v>

917
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 1>poisonous plants come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All poisons.</v>

918
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Plants come from discouraging predation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>

919
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.423
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because one of the cruelest </v>

920
00:39:47.231 --> 00:39:48.064
<v Speaker 1>things I've ever watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's because I have a vivid </v>

921
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:50.764
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you've ever seen a venus fly </v>

922
00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:55.840

<v Speaker 1>smell to it apparently,</v>

930
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.683
<v Speaker 1>and these animals go in it looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and they go and just close in on </v>

931
00:40:21.891 --> 00:40:23.350
<v Speaker 1>them and they don't fight and kill them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>smash them,</v>

934
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:30.754
<v Speaker 1>and then absorb their nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break them down to the very molecules </v>

935
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:39.331
<v Speaker 1>and protein and liquids are going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>250 people would sign out of plants.</v>

957
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:40.130
<v Speaker 4>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't want to go with that.</v>

958

<v Speaker 4>like a hamper.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like that's crazy.</v>

965
00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's a lot of that in the animal</v>

971
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:14.050
<v Speaker 4>they open up and the rats are attracted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the smell and they climb in that tube</v>

972
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.610

00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:45.280
<v Speaker 4>think like five or six years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 4>eat frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of things.</v>

987
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.480
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch this because this Venus flytrap.</v>

988
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.600

<v Speaker 4>That is so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Play that again.</v>

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Could God that fucking frog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That is so crazy.</v>

994
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 4>I said it's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me anyways.</v>

995
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.370
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the toughest things to </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch.</v>

996
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.673
<v Speaker 4>I think it's ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That poor animals are going to be just </v>

997
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:11.920
<v Speaker 4>laying there a incapacitated until </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately wow.</v>

998
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.510
<v Speaker 4>If it's suffocated than it is what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

999
00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.230
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Venus flytrap could do that.</v>

1000
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:16.064
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know the Ada frog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a different plant or is that a </v>

1001
00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 4>Venus flytrap?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like the fingers.</v>

1002
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:22.243
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that's what those plants have </v>

1003
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:28.760
<v Speaker 4>figured out is their method to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>ahead.</v>

1004
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.230
<v Speaker 4>That's their hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There.</v>

1005
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Hustle is they trap things and they suck</v>
<v Speaker 4>them into their body and they eat them.</v>

1006
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.980
<v Speaker 4>They survived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They evolve and get bigger.</v>

1007
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Those are predators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1009
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:40.310
<v Speaker 4>These are carnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look at these.</v>

1010
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 4>Look at these fucking hands getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed by this plant.</v>

1011
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many of them,</v>

1012
00:43:45.411 --> 00:43:46.910
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different.</v>

1013
00:43:46.911 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

1014
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.540
<v Speaker 4>They roll up these ants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1015
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:51.374
<v Speaker 4>this is so creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a giant green tongue with </v>

1016
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:55.094
<v Speaker 4>like weird sort of spikes that grow on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and the spikes lift up and wrap </v>

1017
00:44:00.501 --> 00:44:01.334
<v Speaker 4>around the aunt or the fly here in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>case and just trap them and once they </v>

1018
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 4>have them trapped in there and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuck in the stickiness of the.</v>

1019
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.633
<v Speaker 4>Look at this with these ants and then it</v>
<v Speaker 4>wraps up and rolls them up like a </v>

1020
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:14.834
<v Speaker 4>Burrito.</v>

1021
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.290
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1022
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 4>That was a tough place here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't give a fuck,</v>

1023
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 4>but I think nature is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's amazing.</v>

1024
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:26.323
<v Speaker 4>I think if you really want to see nature</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the weight of see it is obviously </v>

1025
00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 4>documentaries and dvds if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stay in home,</v>

1026
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1027
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 1>to actually see the physical animal go </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

1028
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.083
<v Speaker 1>go somewhere and see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go see them in their natural </v>

1029
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:37.884
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're going to get a real </v>

1030
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 1>respect for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1031
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking one of my upcoming trips this</v>

1032
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take my kids with me.</v>

1033
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not when I kill an animal because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to make any noise.</v>

1034
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:52.194
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to quiet them down </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a very patient thing and </v>

1035
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.050
<v Speaker 1>it's something that will be very hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a five year old to do.</v>

1036
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Would you take issue with them seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kill itself?</v>

1037
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've watched it on TV.</v>

1038
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.370
<v Speaker 1>They've seen the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've seen me butcher meat.</v>

1039
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.380
<v Speaker 1>They haven't seen me kill the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

1040
00:45:07.381 --> 00:45:12.381
<v Speaker 1>but they've seen me chop up a giant elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>backstrap and turn it into steaks in the</v>

1041
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:15.190
<v Speaker 1>middle of the kitchen just sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a cutting board,</v>

1042
00:45:15.191 --> 00:45:16.024
<v Speaker 1>slicing it up and they ask questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a disconnect between that meet </v>

1043
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:19.720
<v Speaker 1>having been a live animal.</v>

1044
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:21.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no standing.</v>

1045
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:21.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've seen me on television kill </v>

1046
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:24.700
<v Speaker 1>animals on a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1047
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.553
<v Speaker 1>So they know that I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that I have targets in the </v>

1048
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:33.040
<v Speaker 1>yard and I'm always practicing arrows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and archery.</v>

1049
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.930
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want what I want to do is not,</v>

1050
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:36.803
<v Speaker 1>not even the hunting aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take them so they could see </v>

1051
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:44.361
<v Speaker 1>the elk when elk are running and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming is amazing.</v>

1052
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:45.324
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're in Jurassic Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you run some hobbit movie or </v>

1053
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:50.470
<v Speaker 1>something when you're in the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1054
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want to do is I'm going to,</v>

1055
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:52.903
<v Speaker 1>I want to plan a week of hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I want to pay a guide just to call </v>

1056
00:45:55.981 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 1>in the elk so we could just watch them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just want the kids to see what</v>

1057
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:01.014
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you make this noise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see this fucking thing looks </v>

1058
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:08.970
<v Speaker 1>like a giant forest horse that comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wants to fuck.</v>

1059
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And they're screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this crazy whale.</v>

1060
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:14.853
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to watch outside of </v>

1061
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like separate that,</v>

1062
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.730
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all great and everything,</v>

1063
00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:25.470
<v Speaker 1>but just be just being a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

1064
00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:26.304
<v Speaker 1>like stepping on the ground where these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things live wild and they all they're </v>

1065
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:30.414
<v Speaker 1>worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like mountain lions and bears and </v>

1066
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to stay alive.</v>

1067
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:35.544
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get laid and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're existing in this very bizarre </v>

1068
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:43.020
<v Speaker 1>world that we rarely get to see that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really truly appreciate it because</v>

1069
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.153
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to worry about what their </v>

1070
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:46.930
<v Speaker 1>concerns are anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even like,</v>

1071
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 1>look at Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1072
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:51.300
<v Speaker 1>They have these tourism things they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Africa,</v>

1073
00:46:51.301 --> 00:46:52.134
<v Speaker 1>but a good percentage of them are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these high fence operations where </v>

1074
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:56.334
<v Speaker 1>they've sort of fenced in these animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these giant contained wildlife </v>

1075
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.940
<v Speaker 1>sanctuaries and the animals thrive in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1076
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.043
<v Speaker 1>But how do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean the way you see him as he get </v>

1077
00:47:05.661 --> 00:47:09.350
<v Speaker 1>in a jeep and you drive around and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's something,</v>

1078
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.210
<v Speaker 1>there's something fucked up about </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that they're not,</v>

1079
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.260
<v Speaker 1>they can't leave even if it's like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles in every direction,</v>

1080
00:47:16.261 --> 00:47:19.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a fence and they would never </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rome 10 miles in the wild.</v>

1081
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.633
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there's a fence at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we've gotten are greasy </v>

1082
00:47:23.731 --> 00:47:27.210
<v Speaker 1>little hands or in their world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kinda changes it in a way.</v>

1083
00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because I actually a running</v>

1084
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a male of course,</v>

1085
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:32.843
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to enter the premises of marine </v>

1086
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:38.500
<v Speaker 4>land and there's a large fence around it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this thing was.</v>

1087
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1088
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:40.984
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>running deere is actually a pretty </v>

1089
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:43.450
<v Speaker 4>dangerous animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1090
00:47:43.451 --> 00:47:45.350
<v Speaker 4>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are there.</v>

1091
00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Their sexual urges are far beyond any </v>
<v Speaker 4>type of.</v>

1092
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 4>Like it just trumps any behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would have.</v>

1093
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:51.154
<v Speaker 4>So this thing was smashing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it must've been smelling the females </v>

1094
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:54.454
<v Speaker 4>inside the park,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was repeatedly smashing itself </v>

1095
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:56.404
<v Speaker 4>against the fence trying to get in to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where he'd ripped half its </v>

1096
00:47:58.391 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 4>face off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its antlers were getting fucked up.</v>

1097
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.490
<v Speaker 4>So we actually called a hunter who had </v>
<v Speaker 4>been in the back like,</v>

1098
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.890
<v Speaker 4>who had had the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the permission by the owner of Greenland</v>

1099
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.890
<v Speaker 4>to hunt inside some wild deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we went and got him and he came,</v>

1100
00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 4>put the first boat directly through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>

1101
00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:13.420
<v Speaker 4>didn't kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a second bowl and then uh,</v>

1102
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 4>took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1103
00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 4>put the animal down and won't kill it.</v>

1104
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.720
<v Speaker 4>And then we had to sausage some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some time later.</v>

1105
00:48:17.721 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1106
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 4>they get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moose are super aggressive when they get</v>

1107
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 4>horny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're dangerous.</v>

1108
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.290
<v Speaker 4>I've been in Algonquin Park at the times</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1109
00:48:25.291 --> 00:48:26.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when uh,</v>

1110
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:27.423
<v Speaker 4>the Moose are running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is by far the most dangerous </v>

1111
00:48:29.981 --> 00:48:31.000
<v Speaker 4>animal out there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1112
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.030
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to get anywhere near a </v>
<v Speaker 4>running moocs.</v>

1113
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.500
<v Speaker 4>They're so big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen one in the wild?</v>

1114
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:35.921
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1115
00:48:35.921 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first time I saw one out in the wild</v>

1116
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:44.881
<v Speaker 4>was in the middle of British Columbia in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the forest and it was like the first one</v>

1117
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I saw it was a female and we saw them in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the distance and I was like,</v>

1118
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.113
<v Speaker 4>oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like that scene in Jurassic Park </v>

1119
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 4>where Jeff Goldbloom lifts his head up </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the jeep and it's like,</v>

1120
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1121
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 4>you can't believe how big they are.</v>

1122
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 4>They're like the males get to 1800 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds,</v>

1123
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.713
<v Speaker 4>1800 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the biggest elk that I killed was </v>

1124
00:49:04.001 --> 00:49:04.834
<v Speaker 4>around a thousand pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine something fucking twice the </v>

1125
00:49:07.181 --> 00:49:08.620
<v Speaker 4>size of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drive your car.</v>

1126
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

1127
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:11.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well my friend,</v>

1128
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 4>my friend Mike Hawk Ridge who runs a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>country outfitters up there,</v>

1129
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.140
<v Speaker 4>he got chased by a female Moose on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>horse.</v>

1130
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 4>He was on his horse and the female had </v>
<v Speaker 4>the caps with them,</v>

1131
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:24.094
<v Speaker 4>which is when they get really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous and they get aggressive and </v>

1132
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:27.903
<v Speaker 4>the horse was running in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>moose was gaining on them and he was </v>

1133
00:49:30.401 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1134
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.850
<v Speaker 4>And he realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1135
00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 4>like this is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this could be good to the horse.</v>

1136
00:49:37.121 --> 00:49:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Kept his cool or kept it its footing at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least that have fucked up scene.</v>

1137
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well if the horse slipped and fell or if</v>

1138
00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 4>the horse said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this guy on my back like I'm out.</v>

1139
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:46.543
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he had a saddle and everything </v>

1140
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the horse was that smart</v>

1141
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:55.570
<v Speaker 4>point to what we're saying is a almond </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk is bullshit.</v>

1142
00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the bottom line.</v>

1143
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 4>Almond milks sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all right.</v>

1144
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.823
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1145
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Speaker 4>what has changed since the two years </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've been here?</v>

1146
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:06.484
<v Speaker 4>Other than there's a lot of public </v>
<v Speaker 4>acknowledgement and understanding now </v>

1147
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:10.384
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't available or wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sort of wasn't at the level that it </v>

1148
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:14.314
<v Speaker 4>is now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people are much more outraged </v>

1149
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:16.924
<v Speaker 4>now about seaworld and about a marine </v>
<v Speaker 4>land and just the idea of captive orcas </v>

1150
00:50:23.421 --> 00:50:26.200
<v Speaker 4>and dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in your case walruses well.</v>

1151
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing we did was we managed</v>

1152
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 3>to ban a orchid captivity in Ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1153
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 3>that's done now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So marine land will never.</v>

1154
00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 3>And Mark my word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will never acquire another,</v>

1155
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 3>a killer whale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it be a wild caught or not.</v>

1156
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.510
<v Speaker 3>So that was a big win for animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>activists,</v>

1157
00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:42.344
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anyone for that matter has invested </v>

1158
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:48.401
<v Speaker 3>interest in the wellbeing of animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>just as of January first 2016.</v>

1159
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:49.694
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1160
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.633
<v Speaker 3>there are standards of care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what I actually petitioned the </v>

1161
00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:53.444
<v Speaker 3>government for back in 2012 because when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came out and sort of revealed marine </v>

1162
00:50:58.941 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 3>land for what it actually is behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenes,</v>

1163
00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:02.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during that time,</v>

1164
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:03.164
<v Speaker 3>there were no standards of care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could literally have dug a hole in </v>

1165
00:51:05.181 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 3>your backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill it with whatever you want and then,</v>

1166
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plunk yourself some dolphins in there.</v>

1167
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 3>And that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were no standards of care.</v>

1168
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1169
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 3>oversight in any capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's changed.</v>

1170
00:51:15.741 --> 00:51:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I'll be at the letter of the regulations</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have now.</v>

1171
00:51:18.621 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I would say that few people are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfied.</v>

1172
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.770
<v Speaker 3>There's still lots of work to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1173
00:51:21.771 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 3>but the fact alone that they are now </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislated,</v>

1174
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.320
<v Speaker 3>we'll be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1175
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.770
<v Speaker 3>to change some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1176
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the parameters,</v>

1177
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:29.323
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one of the biggest things that </v>

1178
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 3>there's in fact water quality </v>
<v Speaker 3>parameters.</v>

1179
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.571
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

1180
00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 3>in the last eight months of my tenure at</v>
<v Speaker 3>marine land,</v>

1181
00:51:34.371 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 3>I was witnessed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1182
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 3>some of the more horrific things that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that caustic water can do to animals.</v>

1183
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I witnessed dolphins lose their skin.</v>

1184
00:51:44.661 --> 00:51:45.494
<v Speaker 3>I mean the skin was flaking off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally flaking off their skin and </v>

1185
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:49.640
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a regular slough.</v>

1186
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.073
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some permanent idemage that </v>

1187
00:51:52.161 --> 00:51:52.790
<v Speaker 3>was done.</v>

1188
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:53.623
<v Speaker 3>What happened was there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a breakdown in a disinfection </v>

1189
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:57.260
<v Speaker 3>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a water disinfection unit.</v>

1190
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 3>We used to use ozone in conjunction with</v>
<v Speaker 3>chlorine.</v>

1191
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Ozone mitigated the use of chlorine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he didn't have to use so much of it.</v>

1192
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:03.973
<v Speaker 3>And when that machine broke down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the resolve was just keep pumping more </v>

1193
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:07.930
<v Speaker 3>chlorine and keep pumping more clearance</v>
<v Speaker 3>flirting.</v>

1194
00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.520
<v Speaker 3>And because we were in the off season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the public wasn't seeing this.</v>

1195
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is 2012.</v>

1196
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I had an old shitty blackberry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I knew I was conscious enough of how</v>

1197
00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:17.900
<v Speaker 3>bad things were that I started snapping </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos,</v>

1198
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.153
<v Speaker 3>taking videos and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a major complacency for </v>

1199
00:52:21.811 --> 00:52:22.644
<v Speaker 3>management because hey shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not opening again for another </v>

1200
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 3>eight months or six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it be.</v>

1201
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.653
<v Speaker 3>I think the issue started in October.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They opened in November and so there </v>

1202
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:32.060
<v Speaker 3>were no parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no oversight.</v>

1203
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.430
<v Speaker 3>There was nowhere for me to run to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>

1204
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.373
<v Speaker 3>Now there is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now marina has to adhere to new </v>

1205
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 3>legislation that will require some </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital investment from them,</v>

1206
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:46.730
<v Speaker 3>which of course is something that we'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to hear,</v>

1207
00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:48.143
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's at least some stuff in </v>

1208
00:52:50.031 --> 00:52:50.864
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most importantly is most recently </v>

1209
00:52:52.581 --> 00:52:55.550
<v Speaker 3>there's a senator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a federal Canadian senator,</v>

1210
00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.070
<v Speaker 3>a liberal senator by the name of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>

1211
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Willie Moore is what we're actually the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag.</v>

1212
00:53:00.171 --> 00:53:01.004
<v Speaker 3>We're saying free willy more and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a in the hopes of getting Justin </v>

1213
00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Trudeau's attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's introduced the bill.</v>

1214
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 3>It's called the ending of captivity of </v>
<v Speaker 3>whales and Dolphins Act.</v>

1215
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a two.</v>

1216
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:13.011
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1217
00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1218
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 3>this bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once it passed the Senate and ultimately</v>

1219
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:21.260
<v Speaker 3>passes into law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to ban both the import,</v>

1220
00:53:21.261 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 3>the breeding of all whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>porpoises captivity or rather,</v>

1221
00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 3>and whales in captivity in Canada.</v>

1222
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:32.240
<v Speaker 3>Basically putting a shelf life on marine</v>
<v Speaker 3>land in the capacity that they,</v>

1223
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 3>that they do business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1224
00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.930
<v Speaker 3>this is a bill that I'm urging people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look if you,</v>

1225
00:53:37.931 --> 00:53:40.110
<v Speaker 3>if you give a shit about animals in </v>
<v Speaker 3>captivity,</v>

1226
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tweet,</v>

1227
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Justin Trudeau are our recently elected </v>
<v Speaker 3>prime minister.</v>

1228
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1229
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:48.480
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really trying to,</v>

1230
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 3>we're looking forward to moving this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing forward.</v>

1231
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always a,</v>

1232
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 3>it's always a thing about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the what I call the paradigm shift.</v>

1233
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.233
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to see the only visit </v>

1234
00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:58.254
<v Speaker 3>zoos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more attendance at marina is a </v>

1235
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.243
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this doesn't stop him from exacting </v>

1236
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 3>a gross revenge on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless,</v>

1237
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:05.274
<v Speaker 3>we're still afloat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still here three years later </v>

1238
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:09.030
<v Speaker 3>amidst all these bullshit lawsuits as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressed before,</v>

1239
00:54:09.031 --> 00:54:09.864
<v Speaker 3>these slapp lawsuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strategic lawsuit against public </v>

1240
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:12.624
<v Speaker 3>participation when I got sued,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well had hope to one day we'd be in </v>

1241
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:16.680
<v Speaker 3>court.</v>

1242
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Here we are well over a thousand days </v>
<v Speaker 3>later and not,</v>

1243
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.030
<v Speaker 3>and I've spent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I say I've spent,</v>

1244
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 3>but we've publicly raised a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

1245
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:24.583
<v Speaker 3>We spent collectively over the three </v>
<v Speaker 3>former animals trainers that are turned </v>

1246
00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:29.364
<v Speaker 3>whistleblowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've collectively spent over $100,000 </v>

1247
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.033
<v Speaker 3>and not had a single day in court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's all just trying to drain you </v>

1248
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 3>legally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1249
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:37.344
<v Speaker 3>The fact alone that I'm speaking into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this microphone is exactly what Marine </v>

1250
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:41.063
<v Speaker 3>Lynn doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dangerous to the anti captivity or </v>

1251
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:45.660
<v Speaker 3>rather the captivity industry because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know a lot of things.</v>

1252
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Of course seaworld was if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the term in bed with marine land,</v>

1253
00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:50.973
<v Speaker 3>a seaworld likes to acquire because </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in the states you can't acquire </v>

1254
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.013
<v Speaker 3>a wild caught animals at seaworld would </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is they would get the animals that </v>

1255
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:00.923
<v Speaker 3>marine land would import.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So marina would import wild cod belugas </v>

1256
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:03.923
<v Speaker 3>from Russia breed them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because the calves were bred in </v>

1257
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:10.020
<v Speaker 3>captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could now be moved to the states.</v>

1258
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.033
<v Speaker 3>So this was how seaworld in the states </v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying to continue to acquire these </v>

1259
00:55:15.481 --> 00:55:16.570
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1260
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:19.230
<v Speaker 3>and this is exactly what this bill is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of trying to stop,</v>

1261
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:20.303
<v Speaker 3>so that's one of the things that sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>world was full of shit about because </v>

1262
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:22.974
<v Speaker 3>seaworld was trying to say we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>done like one of one of their </v>

1263
00:55:25.681 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 3>commercials was saying that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't,</v>

1264
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 3>they haven't caught in a whale in 35 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1265
00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:32.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't captured a whale from the </v>

1266
00:55:32.971 --> 00:55:33.804
<v Speaker 3>wild in 35 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a number of examples of that </v>

1267
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:36.144
<v Speaker 3>being bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One being a wild orca or what they </v>

1268
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:39.444
<v Speaker 3>deemed rescued,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orca named Morgan that was captured off </v>

1269
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:44.150
<v Speaker 3>the coast of the Netherlands who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1270
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.180
<v Speaker 3>it was by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had left it's potter,</v>

1271
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had lost contact with his pod.</v>

1272
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:51.960
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1273
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:55.160
<v Speaker 3>a dolphinarium called Darfur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphinarium hi bike.</v>

1274
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.590
<v Speaker 3>They acquired this animal and then what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did or they took it and they called</v>

1275
00:55:58.591 --> 00:56:01.050
<v Speaker 3>it rehabbing and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course demon non releasable.</v>

1276
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 3>They sent it to a place and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlined in a black blackfish.</v>

1277
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 3>In fact because there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a large,</v>

1278
00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the documentary blackfish.</v>

1279
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:09.960
<v Speaker 3>There's a relationship between seaworld </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1280
00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a facility called in tenor reef.</v>

1281
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:14.363
<v Speaker 3>It's called Laurel parking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what seaworld did was they had that </v>

1282
00:56:17.581 --> 00:56:19.780
<v Speaker 3>animal Morgan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild Orca,</v>

1283
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 3>transferred to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1284
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>to Laurel Park and now</v>

1285
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 4>it's actually part enlisted as part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>its collection.</v>

1286
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.953
<v Speaker 4>That's a wild caught animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So seaworld was sit there and tell this </v>

1287
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 4>idea that we haven't done this in years </v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet they're,</v>

1288
00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.573
<v Speaker 4>they're importing wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wild caught animals that have just </v>

1289
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 4>recently bred one the babies from Canada</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they're,</v>

1290
00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 4>they're basically adding to their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their stock of animals.</v>

1291
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:45.873
<v Speaker 4>This other wild caught animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we can talk about the bullshit that </v>

1292
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:49.143
<v Speaker 4>seaworld spews all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the nice thing is most people are </v>

1293
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 4>now conscious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people look at it and say,</v>

1294
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean every time seaworld tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

1295
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:55.834
<v Speaker 4>they get a lot of fucking hate because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people know now they know they're </v>

1296
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.660
<v Speaker 4>essentially a slavery organization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:01.583
<v Speaker 4>I can't disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And saying that we haven't captured a </v>

1298
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:06.610
<v Speaker 4>slave in 35 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still disgusting.</v>

1299
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 4>The idea that that's how that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they can just say,</v>

1300
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:16.140
<v Speaker 4>we haven't participated in slavery </v>
<v Speaker 4>catching slaves in 35 years.</v>

1301
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:19.390
<v Speaker 4>We just keep them here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Locked in a tiny little.</v>

1302
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen the map?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you have.</v>

1303
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.313
<v Speaker 4>The parking lot is in juxtaposition to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual area where the dolphins give </v>

1304
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 4>to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most heartbreaking one is would that</v>

1305
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:31.360
<v Speaker 4>pool is right next to the ocean when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could see it physically right there.</v>

1306
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.210
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of facilities with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dolphins or spy hopping and they can see</v>

1307
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:35.530
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See it's right there.</v>

1308
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.393
<v Speaker 4>The ocean is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a question of picking them up and </v>

1309
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:38.404
<v Speaker 4>throwing them back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't they make it so that they can </v>

1310
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:42.364
<v Speaker 4>go back and forth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't they make it so that they can </v>

1311
00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:50.101
<v Speaker 4>have like set up a facility?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the way you can make it.</v>

1312
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:51.124
<v Speaker 4>Some of these animals can transition </v>
<v Speaker 4>back into the wild and that if they do </v>

1313
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:56.080
<v Speaker 4>decide to come and participate in show </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they could do it on their own.</v>

1314
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:56.913
<v Speaker 4>Free will have like an open area where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's connected to like a dock where the </v>

1315
00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:03.640
<v Speaker 4>pools and the areas where the animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>swim,</v>

1316
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 4>they should be examined by some marine </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologists.</v>

1317
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:11.050
<v Speaker 4>That demon ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an enormous place as long as you</v>

1318
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:11.884
<v Speaker 4>don't keep them in here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can do their stuff in here and </v>

1319
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:18.751
<v Speaker 4>everything will be fine and have it be </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual ocean water and then have an open</v>

1320
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:21.770
<v Speaker 4>portal so you don't have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 4>them starving to death in a wild.</v>

1321
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:22.613
<v Speaker 4>They can always come in and get food </v>
<v Speaker 4>anytime they want and that way you can </v>

1322
00:58:24.761 --> 00:58:25.594
<v Speaker 4>kind of keep both things happening like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they develop a relationship with these </v>

1323
00:58:28.211 --> 00:58:31.780
<v Speaker 4>animals where it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an actual real relationship.</v>

1324
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:32.614
<v Speaker 4>It's not captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They come because they want to get food </v>

1325
00:58:34.761 --> 00:58:36.430
<v Speaker 4>sorta like squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the park or something.</v>

1326
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.610
<v Speaker 4>This is exactly what animal rights </v>
<v Speaker 4>people if you will,</v>

1327
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:42.090
<v Speaker 4>and and scientists these days are </v>
<v Speaker 4>advocating for.</v>

1328
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.210
<v Speaker 4>They want seaside sanctuaries where </v>
<v Speaker 4>which these animals remain in human care</v>

1329
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:47.523
<v Speaker 4>and are available for people to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course you're going to have to keep </v>

1330
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:51.280
<v Speaker 4>the stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The breeding,</v>

1331
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 4>the breeding has got to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately,</v>

1332
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:54.340
<v Speaker 4>you want to phrase this this out </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely,</v>

1333
00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:56.140
<v Speaker 4>unless they want to fuck on their own in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of everybody,</v>

1334
00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:59.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to guess that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the scientists going to try to stop</v>

1335
00:58:59.441 --> 00:59:00.274
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what people are advocating </v>

1336
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:05.530
<v Speaker 4>for really is the seaside sanctuaries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But seaworld keeps saying that,</v>

1337
00:59:05.531 --> 00:59:06.364
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many pathogens in the water </v>

1338
00:59:07.601 --> 00:59:09.220
<v Speaker 4>and it's going to make these animals to </v>
<v Speaker 4>central.</v>

1339
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:10.150
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all bullshit.</v>

1340
00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:11.260
<v Speaker 4>You just mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1341
00:59:11.261 --> 00:59:13.570
<v Speaker 4>it means they think that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to become susceptible and say,</v>

1342
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:14.503
<v Speaker 4>or that or that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The transition itself from captivity </v>

1343
00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 4>into this new environment is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much to stomach.</v>

1344
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.113
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where was that logic when they were </v>

1345
00:59:19.751 --> 00:59:20.584
<v Speaker 4>plucking them out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the ocean and putting them in </v>

1346
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:22.460
<v Speaker 4>these concrete tanks?</v>

1347
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:22.941
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1348
00:59:22.941 --> 00:59:23.774
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to adapt if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they changed the laws and they make </v>

1349
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:28.191
<v Speaker 4>it so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1350
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:29.024
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just the only acceptable </v>

1351
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 4>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they'll adapt.</v>

1352
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:34.170
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't any way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a law,</v>

1353
00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:35.213
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>introduce a couple of years ago by his </v>

1354
00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:37.454
<v Speaker 4>name was assemblyman Richard Bloom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was a bill that ultimately was </v>

1355
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 4>going to retire all the orcas in San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Diego to seaside sanctuaries.</v>

1356
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.070
<v Speaker 4>The issue that was raised is that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are no seaside sanctuaries yet.</v>

1357
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.100
<v Speaker 4>And so the bill ultimately died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1358
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 4>fucking seaworld use your money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

1359
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:54.570
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:55.403
<v Speaker 4>You have a giant facility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You obviously made money off of those </v>

1361
00:59:58.281 --> 00:59:59.610
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1362
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.510
<v Speaker 4>how down are they right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1363
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.473
<v Speaker 4>Well their net worth or rather their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their company valuation when they did </v>

1364
01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:09.980
<v Speaker 4>their initial IPO,</v>
<v Speaker 4>initial public offering was uh,</v>

1365
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 4>in and around $2,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And basically that's down to one point.</v>

1366
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.710
<v Speaker 4>It was down to one point five at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>point seven.</v>

1367
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:16.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1368
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.620
<v Speaker 4>animal activism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will,</v>

1369
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:21.440
<v Speaker 4>has really caused them a lot of harm </v>
<v Speaker 4>financially.</v>

1370
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:24.590
<v Speaker 4>They've literally taken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just aware that they're not,</v>

1371
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.750
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well of course they're still worth a lot</v>

1372
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:28.940
<v Speaker 4>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for a slave organization to be worth</v>

1373
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.100
<v Speaker 4>over a billion dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of fucked.</v>

1374
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.970
<v Speaker 4>And then you could buy stock in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>slave organization.</v>

1375
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck man,</v>

1376
01:00:36.651 --> 01:00:38.280
<v Speaker 4>I watched that stock price daily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1377
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:40.390
<v Speaker 4>they're not recovering that man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they?</v>

1378
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:41.263
<v Speaker 4>Have they rebounded?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that wasn't showing depending on </v>

1379
01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:46.240
<v Speaker 4>where they're at today because of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1380
01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:47.450
<v Speaker 4>look it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at yesterday.</v>

1381
01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:49.160
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't like me.</v>

1382
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.033
<v Speaker 4>Fuck a reuben.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get a lot of that to pump </v>

1383
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 4>your money in the seaworld,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the others and investment.</v>

1384
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:56.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not going to be around in 20 </v>

1385
01:00:58.131 --> 01:01:00.020
<v Speaker 4>or 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're right.</v>

1386
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:01.363
<v Speaker 4>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more we do research into the </v>

1387
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.310
<v Speaker 4>language of these things to the more </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists.</v>

1388
01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've been trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1389
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.610
<v Speaker 4>John Lilly was trying to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>speak human.</v>

1390
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.110
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to get them to speak human</v>
<v Speaker 4>languages like way back in,</v>

1391
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was like the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:24.590
<v Speaker 4>And he even set up an experiment where a</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman lived in sort of this bizarre home</v>

1393
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.200
<v Speaker 4>where there was water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She spent most of her time,</v>

1394
01:01:30.201 --> 01:01:31.720
<v Speaker 4>like waist deep in water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1395
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 4>Which wasn't jagging off the dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the problem.</v>

1396
01:01:34.641 --> 01:01:37.520
<v Speaker 4>She checked off the Dolphin Dolphins get</v>
<v Speaker 4>horny.</v>

1397
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:38.121
<v Speaker 4>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1398
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:40.160
<v Speaker 4>this is a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just check them off real quick.</v>

1399
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:41.390
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's like,</v>

1400
01:01:41.391 --> 01:01:41.801
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1401
01:01:41.801 --> 01:01:42.280
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

1402
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1403
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.800
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck did you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really,</v>

1404
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:45.643
<v Speaker 4>we've come a long way since then because</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly that was just a question of the </v>

1405
01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:48.440
<v Speaker 4>animal mimicking.</v>

1406
01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.273
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that this animal's going to </v>

1407
01:01:49.641 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 4>adopt the English language over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>above.</v>

1408
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:52.223
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1409
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.083
<v Speaker 4>but to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mimicry itself was pretty </v>

1410
01:01:54.351 --> 01:01:55.310
<v Speaker 4>impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty impressive.</v>

1411
01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.810
<v Speaker 4>And I've worked with dolphins and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>never,</v>

1412
01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I never actually tried to have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dolphin mimic my own sound,</v>

1413
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:02.900
<v Speaker 4>but with what I was watching that duck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched a documentary recently as well</v>

1414
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:04.700
<v Speaker 4>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty impressive.</v>

1415
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:06.110
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very.</v>

1416
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:07.003
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that that was teaching or </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to bridge the communication was </v>

1417
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 4>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1418
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's out there.</v>

1419
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.243
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was all lily could come up with back </v>

1420
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the time,</v>

1421
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:18.260
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was on acid almost every day.</v>

1422
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lily was a fucking maniac.</v>

1423
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>You take ketamine and he was the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that invented the isolation tank,</v>

1424
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>which is one of my favorite things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1425
01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I have yet to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to though.</v>

1426
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long you here for?</v>

1427
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.380

<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1429
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.043
<v Speaker 1>Will set it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set you up with the end of the float </v>

1430
01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a new place in Pasadena and that</v>

1431
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>just opened up the largest place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1432
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

1433
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll look it up.</v>

1434
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate that.</v>

1435
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>What part of town he's staying in while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're here?</v>

1436
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be in Venice beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1437
01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the float lab is.</v>

1438
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about that dude?</v>

1439
01:02:52.051 --> 01:02:52.884
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we're going to call them right </v>

1440
01:02:54.361 --> 01:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>after this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll set it up.</v>

1441
01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm extending because crash is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1442
01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been on the podcast before.</v>

1443
01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:02.460
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

1444
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And he kept the float business alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>with innovation back when no one did.</v>

1445
01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.213
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy who was fixing my tank and </v>

1446
01:03:11.991 --> 01:03:12.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1447
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:13.523
<v Speaker 1>I had an old tank which is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original tanks and it was starting to </v>

1448
01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate a little bit because I'd had</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for awhile.</v>

1449
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy told me,</v>

1450
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:23.130
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy guy in Venice.</v>

1451
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 1>It's making these tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1452
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.930
<v Speaker 1>they're just so much better than anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else's pods.</v>

1453
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like full square rooms?</v>

1454
01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a small meat locker.</v>

1455
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You open a door and you climb and he has</v>

1456
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have some that you gotta gotta gotTa</v>

1457
01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Kinda Bend over when you get in.</v>

1458
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.130
<v Speaker 1>But mine is like seven feet tall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like nine feet long.</v>

1459
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you say that you find it like</v>

1460
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:48.750
<v Speaker 1>incredibly therapeutic and just clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>

1461
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.340
<v Speaker 1>take you to places where you can think </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

1462
01:03:50.341 --> 01:03:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I could benefit from some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great for that.</v>

1463
01:03:53.011 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's great physically for your body to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like my back,</v>

1464
01:03:55.561 --> 01:03:58.650
<v Speaker 1>like opens up and relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I couldn't like pop.</v>

1465
01:03:58.651 --> 01:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It just felt like stretching my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1466
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>my shoulders up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just goes pop,</v>

1467
01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:02.850
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop.</v>

1468
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Because everything's just relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great source of magnesium because</v>

1469
01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:09.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a thousand pounds of epsom salts</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water.</v>

1470
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 1>My older one was like 800 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bigger one requires more so it's</v>

1471
01:04:13.711 --> 01:04:16.140
<v Speaker 1>a thousand pounds of salt and that epsom</v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

1472
01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:17.930
<v Speaker 1>when you're bodies floating in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1473
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.200
<v Speaker 1>your skin is absorbing the magnesium </v>
<v Speaker 1>super healthy for you.</v>

1474
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He used to feel great.</v>

1475
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.473
<v Speaker 1>You get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel great and be going like I do </v>

1476
01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:31.290
<v Speaker 1>trip your balls off in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on mushrooms on New Year's Eve,</v>

1477
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.513
<v Speaker 1>took mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was cleaning my office and I'm </v>

1478
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what I got here,</v>

1479
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:38.610
<v Speaker 1>do I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I ate the mushrooms and then I didn't</v>

1480
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:39.444
<v Speaker 1>take a big dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I took enough where I started </v>

1481
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:41.423
<v Speaker 1>getting really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waited about an hour until I couldn't </v>

1482
01:04:44.701 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>take it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1483
01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't be around people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get in the tank.</v>

1484
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And then I got in the tank and the tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>was good to you for bracing.</v>

1485
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Just to set me on a voyage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sent me an,</v>

1486
01:04:56.791 --> 01:05:00.290
<v Speaker 1>a voyage through my mind and got me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this very positive groove.</v>

1487
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you really like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a good trip because it was,</v>

1488
01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a new years eve trip.</v>

1489
01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like New Year's Eve bullshit.</v>

1490
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Really the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares,</v>

1491
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just another day,</v>

1492
01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:13.051
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1493
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:13.884
<v Speaker 1>What is in your butt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rituals as I'm getting older and more </v>

1494
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.823
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to reject anything that was </v>

1495
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>established because of my life wasn't so</v>
<v Speaker 1>good when I was growing up and I thought</v>

1496
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:26.400
<v Speaker 1>that everything that was everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wanted and everything there,</v>

1497
01:05:26.401 --> 01:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but he's working for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all bullshit.</v>

1498
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Degrees are bullshit and rituals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and fuck you.</v>

1499
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm a rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I can appreciate that perspective</v>

1500
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>should be told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I get older,</v>

1501
01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I recognized the benefit in like a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning in your mind,</v>

1502
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.753
<v Speaker 1>like this year I am going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This year I'm going to like how many </v>

1503
01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:47.134
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for people to actually re </v>

1504
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>tweeted something today from Neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Strauss who's a really brilliant guy and</v>

1505
01:05:54.101 --> 01:05:54.934
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an article that he wrote about </v>

1506
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 1>strategies and systems that you can set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to,</v>

1507
01:05:59.070 --> 01:05:59.903
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you don't fall into the same </v>

1508
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:02.680
<v Speaker 1>traps and sabotage yourself.</v>

1509
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Which a lot of people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to be the idea.</v>

1511
01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:13.780
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you need a Ulyssa strategy for 2016,</v>

1512
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 1>the eye people have this thing in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that this new,</v>

1513
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:25.690
<v Speaker 1>this new day in this new time is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the start of their new diet.</v>

1514
01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:28.960
<v Speaker 1>They're going to quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna start exercising.</v>

1515
01:06:28.961 --> 01:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get their life in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go at it with this,</v>

1516
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.580
<v Speaker 1>these ernest's intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few continue that process.</v>

1517
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.700
<v Speaker 1>And the problem being we are creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>of habit and we have these comfort zones</v>

1518
01:06:41.771 --> 01:06:44.650
<v Speaker 1>and we've sort of set up and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>set up those comfort zones,</v>

1519
01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you set up these established patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1520
01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to fall right back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1521
01:06:50.111 --> 01:06:50.944
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to be lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But John Lilly that was studying like </v>

1522
01:06:53.261 --> 01:06:54.094
<v Speaker 1>the different levels of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he himself said that there are </v>

1523
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:56.483
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cycles that you have to try to </v>

1524
01:06:57.910 --> 01:07:01.270
<v Speaker 1>make yourself conscious of and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break these cycles and like,</v>

1525
01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:02.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I myself find myself too often </v>

1526
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.090
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a bathtub feeling a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on things and I'm like,</v>

1527
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if I get out of the fucking </v>

1528
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.753
<v Speaker 1>bathtub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for a jog or so I wouldn't feel like </v>

1529
01:07:13.961 --> 01:07:14.230
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1530
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely would help.</v>

1531
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Going for a jog is one of the best piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of advice anybody could ever give you.</v>

1532
01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever have something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with you?</v>

1533
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:21.783
<v Speaker 1>Just go for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get those endorphins flowing and get </v>

1534
01:07:23.441 --> 01:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>that blood pumping and put things into </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

1535
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.553
<v Speaker 1>Your mind starts to change immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually start the language that </v>

1536
01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:30.940
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your mind beats the shit out of you</v>

1537
01:07:30.941 --> 01:07:31.774
<v Speaker 1>with changes and suddenly you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting resolved and answers to your </v>

1538
01:07:34.211 --> 01:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>problems versus like dwelling on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1539
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:36.993
<v Speaker 1>myself personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have gone for runs and I don't run </v>

1540
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.073
<v Speaker 1>that much but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I ride my bike like in in the dark </v>

1541
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>when I'm amidst the darker depths of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

1542
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And every time I come back saying thank </v>
<v Speaker 1>God you've went and did something right.</v>

1543
01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we associate as a human being.</v>

1544
01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:53.763
<v Speaker 1>We associate dilemmas and physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems like issues like bills or </v>

1545
01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:01.780
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits.</v>

1546
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>In your case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these,</v>

1547
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:04.223
<v Speaker 1>we associate those things with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical thing because our bodies are </v>

1548
01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:13.120
<v Speaker 1>used to any fear or danger from the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were monkeys.</v>

1549
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:14.403
<v Speaker 1>It's always been a physical danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been like a social issue </v>

1550
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.013
<v Speaker 1>until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the last few thousand years when </v>

1551
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.670
<v Speaker 1>human beings start talking to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

1552
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>the real problems that we had were all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't fucking bills.</v>

1553
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>It's more instinctual almost looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a physical problem.</v>

1554
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:30.374
<v Speaker 1>So when you develop stress and anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this physical response to that </v>

1555
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>like Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

1556
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't do anything with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical response.</v>

1557
01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That physical response never gets fed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never run.</v>

1558
01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>You never exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never exert.</v>

1559
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.863
<v Speaker 1>And so your body just gets into a deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deeper level of funk and stress and </v>

1560
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:49.933
<v Speaker 1>the physical exertion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that seems like a meathead thing to </v>

1561
01:08:51.531 --> 01:08:51.961
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1562
01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you just got to go to the gym,</v>

1563
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.280
<v Speaker 3>walk it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you really do.</v>

1564
01:08:57.370 --> 01:08:59.170
<v Speaker 3>You really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you do do that,</v>

1565
01:08:59.171 --> 01:09:00.004
<v Speaker 3>you will feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some of my favorite people are </v>

1566
01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:04.260
<v Speaker 3>people that do Jujitsu because judges</v>

1567
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.610
<v Speaker 1>two is such a life and death struggle on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular basis with people you love and</v>

1568
01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre thing,</v>

1569
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.350
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1570
01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:12.203
<v Speaker 1>when you roll with people that you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your friends with you slap hands </v>

1571
01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>and they tried to fucking kill each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and you're going to war.</v>

1572
01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exhausting.</v>

1573
01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>So when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're drained.</v>

1574
01:09:22.411 --> 01:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So other pole shit of regular bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>to seems way less significant.</v>

1575
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.163
<v Speaker 1>You still have to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still a person who still live in </v>

1576
01:09:29.731 --> 01:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still have taxes,</v>

1577
01:09:31.891 --> 01:09:32.724
<v Speaker 1>still a problem,</v>

1578
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.960
<v Speaker 3>still have lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Your situation's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very extreme.</v>

1580
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:38.570
<v Speaker 3>My situation is extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1581
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:39.404
<v Speaker 3>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't mind a sort of offering a </v>

1582
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:42.530
<v Speaker 3>perspective of just how fucked things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1583
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please do.</v>

1584
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.970
<v Speaker 3>So shortly after I was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if you recall,</v>

1585
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:48.890
<v Speaker 3>you probably don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a lot of tweets,</v>

1586
01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 3>but I tweeted you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1587
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:54.800
<v Speaker 3>video of the owner of marine land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is the man that's suing myself and a</v>

1588
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:58.520
<v Speaker 3>number of other people to try to stifle </v>
<v Speaker 3>our advocacy and essentially punish us.</v>

1589
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.900
<v Speaker 3>And the video was of him driving past </v>
<v Speaker 3>our home and uh,</v>

1590
01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I upload it to Youtube and whatnot.</v>

1591
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.013
<v Speaker 3>And then shortly thereafter there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>more videos and then neighbors started </v>

1592
01:10:08.841 --> 01:10:09.674
<v Speaker 3>taking photos when I wasn't home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he drives by and just threatened you </v>

1593
01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.670
<v Speaker 3>may slows down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1594
01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.100
<v Speaker 3>I assume it's to intimidate my </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend and I,</v>

1595
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.963
<v Speaker 3>he has a history of doing this and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to touch a little bit on that in a </v>

1596
01:10:20.631 --> 01:10:21.464
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just want to give my example to </v>

1597
01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:23.444
<v Speaker 3>begin with.</v>

1598
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Give this videos on youtube right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:27.410
<v Speaker 3>we see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1600
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:28.480
<v Speaker 3>What's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your channel?</v>

1601
01:10:28.481 --> 01:10:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't mind showing you a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1602
01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.840
<v Speaker 3>just google John Holder j o h n h o l e </v>
<v Speaker 3>r and you'll get videos.</v>

1603
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.633
<v Speaker 3>Footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a pretty elaborate </v>

1604
01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:38.834
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've unearthed a lot about sort of how </v>

1605
01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:41.240
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he operates.</v>

1606
01:10:41.241 --> 01:10:43.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a little nervous talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this jewelry now because I just,</v>

1607
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.820
<v Speaker 3>I know the consequences of which are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to cost a lot of money and cause a</v>

1608
01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:48.860
<v Speaker 3>lot of anxiety where I'm going with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1609
01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 3>But when is this fucking lawsuit get </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolved here?</v>

1610
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:52.933
<v Speaker 3>Here's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to watch the video real </v>

1611
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:55.710
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is you looking out the curtain.</v>

1612
01:10:56.150 --> 01:11:00.410
<v Speaker 3>So I live at the end of a dead end </v>
<v Speaker 3>street and across from me as the water.</v>

1613
01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:01.244
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it and he's trying to take from </v>

1614
01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:03.290
<v Speaker 3>me my home essentially.</v>

1615
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:05.960
<v Speaker 3>But I saw him come by and he stopped in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of my house.</v>

1616
01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I armed myself with my old blackberry </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>

1617
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 3>He went down the road and you see them </v>
<v Speaker 3>now coming back.</v>

1618
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.083
<v Speaker 3>See speeds up and right here you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 3>slows right down and he just wants </v>

1619
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 3>intimidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course he had no idea that I'm there.</v>

1620
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Of course I present myself and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1621
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 3>what you want bro?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there he goes.</v>

1622
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:24.320
<v Speaker 3>So he drives off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you come there,</v>

1623
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 3>he drives off little pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1624
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.073
<v Speaker 3>well that's the same push.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like to put a lot of bullets in a </v>

1625
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.940
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd shot those dogs if you don't recall</v>

1626
01:11:32.941 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 3>my telling you a couple of dogs wandered</v>
<v Speaker 3>off to his property.</v>

1627
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Filled him with a shotgun pellets.</v>

1628
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he pulled.</v>

1629
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that for sure that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>his truck?</v>

1630
01:11:42.451 --> 01:11:43.284
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact we've got them in this new </v>

1631
01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:45.180
<v Speaker 3>vehicle as well as license plate.</v>

1632
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 3>The whole works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The police in fact set up a surveillance</v>

1633
01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:48.960
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two of them,</v>

1634
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:51.750
<v Speaker 3>they caught him independently and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and don't quote me,</v>

1635
01:11:51.751 --> 01:11:52.584
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to call it 12 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The police refused to lay any charges </v>

1636
01:11:55.801 --> 01:11:56.634
<v Speaker 3>because they said a driving past </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's home isn't technically is </v>

1637
01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.813
<v Speaker 3>criminal harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Despite the fact that we were like </v>

1638
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 3>looked at the man suing us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1639
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.810
<v Speaker 3>he's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1640
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew the man,</v>

1641
01:12:04.861 --> 01:12:07.410
<v Speaker 3>at least historically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had a shotgun in his vehicle.</v>

1642
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:09.083
<v Speaker 3>He's got a lot of reason to not like my </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and my girlfriend who's on any </v>

1643
01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:12.534
<v Speaker 3>given time alone in my home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so nonetheless the police wouldn't do </v>

1644
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.464
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We took that information and went to a </v>

1645
01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:21.000
<v Speaker 3>justice of the peace to try to lay </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called a private,</v>

1646
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.920
<v Speaker 3>a charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a charge,</v>

1647
01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:23.754
<v Speaker 3>but we just want him a summons to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the court and explain this </v>

1648
01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:29.100
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is normally a 30 day process.</v>

1649
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Marine lands lawyers managed to get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>an appeal to the summons,</v>

1650
01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.130
<v Speaker 3>which is largely unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1651
01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:38.773
<v Speaker 3>I guess with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess people with money can skirt the </v>

1652
01:12:40.551 --> 01:12:41.384
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless it took a year and a </v>

1653
01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:46.240
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lawyer,</v>

1654
01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.133
<v Speaker 3>the judge ultimately decided that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue shouldn't be decided in the </v>

1655
01:12:50.981 --> 01:12:51.910
<v Speaker 3>criminal court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1656
01:12:51.911 --> 01:12:53.860
<v Speaker 3>it should be dealt within the civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>matters.</v>

1657
01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.113
<v Speaker 3>So he quashed the summons so the owner </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have to come in and explain </v>

1658
01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:01.840
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm waiting any given day.</v>

1659
01:13:01.841 --> 01:13:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Now because the lawyers in already </v>
<v Speaker 3>informed my other lawyers,</v>

1660
01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:06.063
<v Speaker 3>they're seeking a cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a motion where I'm to pay the legal </v>

1661
01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:10.174
<v Speaker 3>fees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they're claiming upwards of </v>

1662
01:13:11.111 --> 01:13:12.030
<v Speaker 3>$100,000</v>

1663
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:16.170
<v Speaker 3>to have had to try to get this summons </v>
<v Speaker 3>against him.</v>

1664
01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.770
<v Speaker 3>His stocking leads to my trying to lay a</v>
<v Speaker 3>private,</v>

1665
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:21.630
<v Speaker 3>a charge if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

1666
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.793
<v Speaker 3>private summons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets it quashed and now he wants to </v>

1667
01:13:25.171 --> 01:13:26.004
<v Speaker 3>put me on the hook for his legal fees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's just trying to drain you </v>

1668
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:30.773
<v Speaker 3>financial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a war of attrition and it's like </v>

1669
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:35.910
<v Speaker 3>there's just trying to crush anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's showing any type of opposition.</v>

1670
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Now I know the last time you were on you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like a go fund me or something like</v>

1671
01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:41.550
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People contributed to how do we,</v>

1672
01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:43.050
<v Speaker 3>how do we help you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1673
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.943
<v Speaker 3>what is that address?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so recently I had to retain a new </v>

1674
01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 3>lawyer to have my lawyers have left and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these were ultimately the ones that were</v>

1675
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.710
<v Speaker 3>working really at a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Effectively they're gone.</v>

1676
01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 3>So I had to retain a new lawyer.</v>

1677
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't ask for a lot of money from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1678
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.313
<v Speaker 3>but I do ask for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as we've got money in our </v>

1679
01:14:03.871 --> 01:14:04.704
<v Speaker 3>lawyers can work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this lawsuit has to run its course and </v>

1680
01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:07.194
<v Speaker 3>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the judge has already said it's </v>

1681
01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:11.320
<v Speaker 3>already criticized marine land for </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking as long as they have now.</v>

1682
01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Marina wants to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1683
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 3>this is the behavior of the people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1684
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 3>of the defendants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the behavior being that we tried to seek</v>

1685
01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:18.364
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some protection from this man that took </v>

1686
01:14:20.591 --> 01:14:21.940
<v Speaker 3>a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trying.</v>

1687
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:22.893
<v Speaker 3>The lawyers are trying to allege that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's our behavior that delaying this </v>

1688
01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:25.654
<v Speaker 3>process and yet here we are two years </v>
<v Speaker 3>after I was here and not a single day </v>

1689
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:29.620
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1690
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:30.543
<v Speaker 3>a significant legal fees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we recently got a very generous </v>

1691
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.204
<v Speaker 3>contribution from some animal rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations that are running little </v>

1692
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:41.730
<v Speaker 3>fundraisers for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1693
01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.500
<v Speaker 3>we used to have what you would call a </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefactor,</v>

1694
01:14:44.501 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 3>which was sam simon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's cocreator for the simpsons.</v>

1695
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 3>He was giving us a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately recently he passed away.</v>

1696
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:51.840
<v Speaker 3>So that's sorta ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1697
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 3>largely it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

1698
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:53.883
<v Speaker 3>it's the public support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really quite unprecedented to </v>

1699
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:57.570
<v Speaker 3>have a litigation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1700
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.730
<v Speaker 3>funded by crowdfunding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really unheard of.</v>

1701
01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.750
<v Speaker 3>It's an important.</v>

1702
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.520
<v Speaker 1>So what is the address and how do people</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1703
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:06.140
<v Speaker 1>We're going to put the address on </v>

1713
01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1714
01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.110
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not funding just my own lawsuit.</v>

1715
01:15:39.111 --> 01:15:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I stuck my neck out and said I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay for all these lawsuits.</v>

1716
01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because for some years ago,</v>

1717
01:15:43.191 --> 01:15:45.200
<v Speaker 3>and I'd mentioned before that I won wipe</v>
<v Speaker 3>out Canada.</v>

1718
01:15:45.201 --> 01:15:48.080
<v Speaker 3>So there was a period where I actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a good chunk of change in the bank.</v>

1719
01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:50.810
<v Speaker 3>So when these lawsuits started to fly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just started cutting checks,</v>

1720
01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 3>just start cutting checks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blow.</v>

1721
01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:53.460
<v Speaker 3>That didn't last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1722
01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.640
<v Speaker 3>So really it is the support of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1723
01:15:55.641 --> 01:15:57.500
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't mind my touching a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more.</v>

1724
01:15:57.501 --> 01:15:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the page.</v>

1728
01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:06.523
<v Speaker 3>The differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just a website that I had </v>

1729

<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>

1754
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Mexico to cut the shit with your pesos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can just touch on</v>

1755
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 3>a story that I think it's important in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the realm of public opinion to,</v>

1756
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:15.223
<v Speaker 3>or rather consciousness to know of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this isn't the first time that the </v>

1757
01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:20.120
<v Speaker 3>owner Marineland has stocked and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimidated people.</v>

1758
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.100
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1759
01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.540
<v Speaker 3>some years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1760
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.593
<v Speaker 3>a woman named Paula Miller was living in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a trailer park that the owner marina </v>

1761
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 3>actually owned that was across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street from the park and he had promised</v>

1762
01:17:31.431 --> 01:17:33.220
<v Speaker 3>them all that he was not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1763
01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:34.463
<v Speaker 3>to move them or displace them and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to be their home for a long </v>

1764
01:17:36.171 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of retirees there,</v>

1765
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:38.114
<v Speaker 3>people put some permanent investment in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their properties while ultimately he </v>

1766
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:43.570
<v Speaker 3>did elect to kick everyone out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1767
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 3>he had the city support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not,</v>

1768
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're up against a lot of forces,</v>

1769
01:17:48.021 --> 01:17:49.400
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1770
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:52.280
<v Speaker 3>one woman was having none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

1771
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:53.143
<v Speaker 3>she was refusing to move and the owner </v>
<v Speaker 3>would repeatedly drive by an </v>

1772
01:17:56.061 --> 01:17:56.894
<v Speaker 3>intimidator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately what she did was she had </v>

1773
01:17:58.311 --> 01:17:59.144
<v Speaker 3>written on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd written John Holder made you get </v>

1774
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:02.624
<v Speaker 3>exactly what you deserve tenfold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she thereafter committed </v>

1775
01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:07.300
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1776
01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to tell that </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1777
01:18:11.301 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because,</v>

1778
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:16.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it illuminates sort of who he is.</v>

1779
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:18.523
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

1780
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1781
01:18:19.631 --> 01:18:22.930
<v Speaker 1>to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1782
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1783
01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.713
<v Speaker 1>We're to pump this fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said it before and I'll say it </v>

1784
01:18:25.781 --> 01:18:26.171
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1785
01:18:26.171 --> 01:18:27.700
<v Speaker 1>we're really still in this game because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you</v>

1786
01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.960
<v Speaker 3>heartfelt appreciation for having me </v>
<v Speaker 3>back on.</v>

1787
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.823
<v Speaker 3>It's a can't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the timing is right because we have </v>

1788
01:18:34.591 --> 01:18:36.330
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different motion dates coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and.</v>

1789
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But I appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also appreciate what you're doing.</v>

1790
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that guys like you were super </v>
<v Speaker 1>important for this.</v>

1791
01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.790
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in particular,</v>

1792
01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:45.624
<v Speaker 1>you probably one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this whole thing that we're </v>

1793
01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:49.224
<v Speaker 1>experiencing right now is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>our civilization is awakening to the </v>

1794
01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:54.243
<v Speaker 1>horrors of the past and we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's really fucked up and </v>

1795
01:18:57.481 --> 01:18:59.760
<v Speaker 1>not right and we've been doing it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

1796
01:18:59.761 --> 01:19:00.594
<v Speaker 1>so we think it's okay because we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it for a long time and this is </v>

1797
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:06.180
<v Speaker 1>sort of the same thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced with slavery.</v>

1798
01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:07.163
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery had existed for a long fucking </v>

1799
01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.660
<v Speaker 1>time and it took a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1800
01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.790
<v Speaker 1>people feel like you're exaggerating </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1801
01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.880
<v Speaker 1>This is not slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are animals.</v>

1802
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're insanely intelligent animals.</v>

1803
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so much different than a fucking</v>

1804
01:19:20.671 --> 01:19:21.504
<v Speaker 1>puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much different than a </v>

1805
01:19:22.411 --> 01:19:23.244
<v Speaker 1>squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a cerebral cortex that's 40 </v>

1806
01:19:25.771 --> 01:19:28.770
<v Speaker 1>percent larger than human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why.</v>

1807
01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:29.813
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know they have an insanely complex </v>

1808
01:19:32.941 --> 01:19:35.040
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know what it's.</v>

1809
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:38.370
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the meaning behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sounds are.</v>

1810
01:19:38.371 --> 01:19:41.250
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've recognized dialects.</v>

1811
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:43.830
<v Speaker 1>They have different dialects in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different areas.</v>

1812
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:46.860
<v Speaker 1>We know that they speak differently in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the world,</v>

1813
01:19:46.861 --> 01:19:47.590
<v Speaker 1>and I can,</v>

1814
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:48.423
<v Speaker 3>I can personally offer perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 3>having had a really strong relationship </v>

1815
01:19:51.011 --> 01:19:51.844
<v Speaker 3>with an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my anomalous relationship with </v>

1816
01:19:52.841 --> 01:19:53.680
<v Speaker 3>smooshy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Walrus,</v>

1817
01:19:53.681 --> 01:19:54.870
<v Speaker 3>and I'll just do a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1818
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:59.290
<v Speaker 3>summary of it is that she at one point </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that I was her mother.</v>

1819
01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she still does.</v>

1820
01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:02.090
<v Speaker 3>It's an eight now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She thinks that I'm her mother.</v>

1821
01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:03.820
<v Speaker 3>It's tattooed on her brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1822
01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:05.780
<v Speaker 3>I've imprinted on her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1823
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.633
<v Speaker 3>so I got to appreciate what it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to raise this animal in that unique </v>

1824
01:20:10.951 --> 01:20:11.784
<v Speaker 3>opportunity and in that the language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wish Jonsi lily would still be </v>

1825
01:20:14.491 --> 01:20:15.324
<v Speaker 3>around because I think that he himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be calling a lot of bullshit on </v>

1826
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:17.611
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd say,</v>

1827
01:20:17.611 --> 01:20:20.510
<v Speaker 3>this is a fucking catastrophe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>during your,</v>

1828
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 3>your what's being imposed on us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the separation,</v>

1829
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:23.754
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I got to learn what it was like to </v>

1830
01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 3>teach an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a sense of humor.</v>

1831
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.553
<v Speaker 3>For instance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1832
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 3>this Walrus has a sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This walrus knows me intimately.</v>

1833
01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Whether I raise my voice or I lower it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has,</v>

1834
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:36.840
<v Speaker 3>she knows me in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a second dog.</v>

1835
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say for outside,</v>

1836
01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:41.543
<v Speaker 3>this is an animal that could appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 3>when there was real threat against me </v>

1837
01:20:44.921 --> 01:20:45.754
<v Speaker 3>and we used to joke around that and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that we discovered that she was so </v>

1838
01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:48.750
<v Speaker 3>protective of me that people come really</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to me.</v>

1839
01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.130
<v Speaker 3>She would beat the snot out of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1840
01:20:50.131 --> 01:20:52.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean she'd come into like a 200 pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowling ball and displace you,</v>

1841
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:53.933
<v Speaker 3>but she knew when I was messing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone or when someone had grabbed me </v>

1842
01:20:56.401 --> 01:20:57.810
<v Speaker 3>and it appeared to be a little more </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent.</v>

1843
01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.673
<v Speaker 3>It was mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her reaction is someone grabs you in a </v>

1844
01:20:59.971 --> 01:21:02.070
<v Speaker 3>violent way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The owner's son in fact.</v>

1845
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:03.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1846
01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.793
<v Speaker 3>the owner's son came over one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just didn't believe what was going </v>

1847
01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:07.614
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he grabbed me and he didn't grab me </v>

1848
01:21:08.311 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 3>in a smooth and fun way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He grabbed me and shook me.</v>

1849
01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.290
<v Speaker 3>Smooshy never forgot his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A she'd fucking shoes.</v>

1850
01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.433
<v Speaker 3>There was a gap between associate </v>
<v Speaker 3>smashed up against those bars really </v>

1851
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.210
<v Speaker 3>aggressively harping on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the yellow and everything else,</v>

1852
01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 3>and even in the weeks and months to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>

1853
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 3>every time he'd come any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any even remotely close to me are in the</v>

1854
01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:25.980
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was ready to pounce.</v>

1855
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:29.850
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fast is a walrus pounds.</v>

1856
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:30.743
<v Speaker 3>They can you call it pouncing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't call it that kind of waddle </v>

1857
01:21:32.941 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty fast.</v>

1858
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:36.270
<v Speaker 3>There are a heavy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually I can say that I've,</v>

1859
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not just myself,</v>

1860
01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:38.843
<v Speaker 3>another other former trainers have </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually rescued the owner of marine </v>

1861
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:42.430
<v Speaker 3>land from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1862
01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:45.300
<v Speaker 3>from Walter says that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're about to attack them.</v>

1863
01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:47.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a video on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually hilarious,</v>

1864
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:48.773
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1865
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.613
<v Speaker 3>he's out on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously yelling at a trainer to bring </v>

1866
01:21:52.081 --> 01:21:53.340
<v Speaker 3>out more animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything in a Walrus,</v>

1867
01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:56.470
<v Speaker 3>breaks from them and starts going </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the owner and he's turns around,</v>

1868
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:57.333
<v Speaker 3>starts booking and the walrus stops and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he turns around and grabs his water and </v>

1869
01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.120
<v Speaker 3>froze the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the wall was,</v>

1870
01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:04.320
<v Speaker 3>goes and he sort of tucks away behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of safety door.</v>

1871
01:22:04.321 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a con.</v>

1872
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't wait for him to get knocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1873
01:22:07.471 --> 01:22:08.670
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen.</v>

1874
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:09.563
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was a number of examples of </v>

1875
01:22:11.941 --> 01:22:12.451
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

1876
01:22:12.451 --> 01:22:13.800
<v Speaker 3>there's another video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't mind,</v>

1877
01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.673
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look up.</v>

1878
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:16.043
<v Speaker 3>If you Google John Holder again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get to a place where he's </v>

1879
01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:22.140
<v Speaker 3>actually a confronting a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an activist who's just,</v>

1880
01:22:22.141 --> 01:22:22.974
<v Speaker 3>they're offering on public property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has now since been leased to the </v>

1881
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:27.570
<v Speaker 3>two marine land by the city.</v>

1882
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:28.963
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's handing leaflets with information </v>

1883
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.660
<v Speaker 3>while they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a conflict.</v>

1884
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.250
<v Speaker 3>They have sort of a coming together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1885
01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:39.060
<v Speaker 3>John Holder in plain English threatens </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stab him and bury him.</v>

1886
01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:40.590
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the activist,</v>

1887
01:22:40.591 --> 01:22:42.330
<v Speaker 3>who's Mike Garrett,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fantastic guy.</v>

1888
01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was um,</v>

1889
01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.291
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1890
01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:46.510
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming he saw us.</v>

1891
01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.410
<v Speaker 3>He tried to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep some sense and keep things as light</v>

1892
01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 3>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But John just has a conniption.</v>

1893
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:53.520
<v Speaker 3>He's yell and his arms and up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1894
01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.740
<v Speaker 3>John's a little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1895
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:57.030
<v Speaker 3>He's got what I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little big man where he's just.</v>

1896
01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.313
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes all because the guy is </v>

1897
01:22:59.911 --> 01:23:02.490
<v Speaker 3>protesting against what we use the word </v>
<v Speaker 3>protesting,</v>

1898
01:23:02.491 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 3>but more than anything he's handing </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1899
01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:05.364
<v Speaker 3>He's handing a history of marine landed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it happens to be at the end of the </v>

1900
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 3>park on public property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nonetheless,</v>

1901
01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:10.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1902
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.340
<v Speaker 3>the city obliged and leased the land to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1903
01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is what it is.</v>

1904
01:23:16.841 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 3>Greenland's operated for 53 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm above the law.</v>

1905
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.970
<v Speaker 3>There was no loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing.</v>

1906
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.020
<v Speaker 3>Now there are some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thankfully things are,</v>

1907
01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:27.370
<v Speaker 3>are turning slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you could find that video,</v>

1908
01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:28.450
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all right Joe,</v>

1918
01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:53.750

<v Speaker 5>People don't have to take it.</v>

1919

<v Speaker 5>Let's stick with the program.</v>

1921
01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:06.520
<v Speaker 5>I can see John getting a little furious </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

1922
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:09.610
<v Speaker 5>Thankfully.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank God John doesn't have a knife.</v>

<v Speaker 5>said.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You said it earlier in the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1930
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:29.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm lucky you don't have a knife so you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would stab me if you had a knife.</v>

1931
01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:32.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you kill me right here.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't even bother to look into </v>

1933
01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:38.750
<v Speaker 5>mass graves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on up folks.</v>

1935
01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Just information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John doesn't want to stab me and</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's being sued.</v>

1938
01:24:50.501 --> 01:24:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's actually having his wages garnished</v>

1939
01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:55.084
<v Speaker 3>because marine land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they use these lawsuits </v>

1940
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:58.120
<v Speaker 3>and then they propose all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different motions,</v>

1941
01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.390
<v Speaker 3>so it's sort of a function inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit.</v>

1942
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:02.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is during these motions is </v>

1943
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:04.460
<v Speaker 3>it can go either way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1944
01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.270
<v Speaker 3>A lawyer can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can win a motion against another lawyer,</v>

1945
01:25:07.271 --> 01:25:08.104
<v Speaker 3>whether it be a bullshit lawsuit or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what happens is in that process it </v>

1946
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:13.270
<v Speaker 3>becomes a cost award.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So unfortunate for Mike,</v>

1947
01:25:13.271 --> 01:25:16.390
<v Speaker 3>he got a cost order against him and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't afford whatever the price was.</v>

1948
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:17.224
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marineland we'll say an inflated price </v>

1949
01:25:18.371 --> 01:25:19.204
<v Speaker 3>prices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this costs $25,000 to have to bring </v>

1950
01:25:20.711 --> 01:25:23.080
<v Speaker 3>him in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the judge awarded $10,000.</v>

1951
01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:25.210
<v Speaker 3>So Mike's happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wages garnished.</v>

1952
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Now this is not a man who broke the law.</v>

1953
01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:29.300
<v Speaker 3>This is a man who opposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1954
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:31.740
<v Speaker 3>the policies and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the practices of marine land.</v>

1955
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:34.600
<v Speaker 3>This is because of this right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of that,</v>

1956
01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:35.434
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's having his wages garnished to </v>

1957
01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:37.804
<v Speaker 3>the tune of how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he said 30 percent a month for </v>

1958
01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:44.110
<v Speaker 3>how long or how much per paycheck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still knows quite a bit of money.</v>

1959
01:25:44.111 --> 01:25:47.190
<v Speaker 3>How much does he think he owes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrange of six or 7,000 at this point.</v>

1960
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:48.930
<v Speaker 3>And he just lost his lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1961
01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.250
<v Speaker 3>we actually had the similar lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1962
01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.180
<v Speaker 3>he's looking for a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a public plea,</v>

1963
01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.014
<v Speaker 3>if there are any lawyers in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking to make a name for </v>

1964
01:25:54.401 --> 01:25:57.640
<v Speaker 3>themselves and help our ourselves or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Garrett like,</v>

1965
01:25:57.641 --> 01:25:58.660
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please get involved.</v>

1966
01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.490
<v Speaker 3>And if you do help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tweet it out.</v>

1967
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:02.890
<v Speaker 3>If you do help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it up online and I'll.</v>

1968

<v Speaker 3>People know that you're doing</v>

1969

<v Speaker 4>I just want you to take a look at this </v>

1971

<v Speaker 4>This is from a,</v>

1972
01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:10.844
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just an absolute sick graffiti </v>

01:26:12.051 --> 01:26:16.550
<v Speaker 4>artists named Walk Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Save smooshy marine land.</v>

<v Speaker 4>giving to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll hold it up.</v>

1976
01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a courtesy.</v>

1977
01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:23.700
<v Speaker 4>Lofty Towers is a place in Niagara Falls</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1978

1979
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:26.030
<v Speaker 4>generously printed it for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course,</v>

1980
01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.950
<v Speaker 4>each one you've got to see this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

1981
01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:29.990
<v Speaker 4>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's basically,</v>

1982
01:26:29.991 --> 01:26:31.820
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got the wall,</v>

1983
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:32.893
<v Speaker 4>you've got the Walrus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smooshy is basically giving the finger </v>

1984
01:26:34.551 --> 01:26:37.880
<v Speaker 4>to what appears to be an old man who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a shirt that says,</v>

1985
01:26:37.881 --> 01:26:40.550
<v Speaker 4>bury me with my money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's got some shackles around it?</v>

1986
01:26:40.551 --> 01:26:41.384
<v Speaker 4>And it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sort of looks like it says fuck </v>

1987
01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:43.790
<v Speaker 4>marine land on the bottom.</v>

1988
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:45.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it actually does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

1989
01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:47.960
<v Speaker 4>so that's the old dude supposedly.</v>

1999
01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:12.980
<v Speaker 4>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a civilization failure,</v>

2000
01:27:12.981 --> 01:27:15.290
<v Speaker 4>societal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural failure.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this old creepy fuck that's getting away</v>

<v Speaker 4>conceive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet all he wants is the power we </v>

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:38.250
<v Speaker 4>hold to like if I was worth that much </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

2009
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 4>Does he have a wife?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has a wonderful wife,</v>

2010

<v Speaker 4>if I didn't Costa Rica about hookers and</v>

2014

<v Speaker 4>coke until the heart stops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He likes the hunt.</v>

2015
01:27:50.221 --> 01:27:51.680
<v Speaker 4>You'd think he'd just be able to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>steady,</v>

2016
01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:53.210
<v Speaker 4>like just go do the thing that you liked</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most,</v>

2017
01:27:53.211 --> 01:27:55.860
<v Speaker 4>but what he likes the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what appears to be is to be a tire.</v>

2018
01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:56.773
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched that episode of you and Lance </v>

2019
01:27:58.710 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 4>Armstrong and I thought it was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

2020
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.430
<v Speaker 4>It really humanize the situation he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

2021
01:28:01.431 --> 01:28:03.800
<v Speaker 4>But the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that he expressed the most,</v>

2022
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the regret was when he ultimately was a,</v>

2023
01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.280
<v Speaker 4>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget the word he used,</v>

2024
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:13.010
<v Speaker 4>but like get throwing all these lawsuits</v>
<v Speaker 4>against.</v>

2025
01:28:13.011 --> 01:28:13.844
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fucked up.</v>

2026
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:16.400
<v Speaker 4>He fucked up that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a fuck up.</v>

2027
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:19.240
<v Speaker 4>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be 100 percent supportive.</v>

2028
01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.600
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

2029
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:23.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you ever seen the bill burr</v>

2030
01:28:23.011 --> 01:28:25.640
<v Speaker 4>bit where he's on Conan or we talked </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it until it happens.</v>

2031
01:28:25.641 --> 01:28:27.890
<v Speaker 4>But I am learning about bill burr now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

2032
01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.113

<v Speaker 4>It's one of the best ever that do show </v>

2033
01:28:31.731 --> 01:28:35.160

<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on Netflix folks.</v>

2035
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:37.934
<v Speaker 4>If you want to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an animated series called F is for </v>

2036
01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:41.540
<v Speaker 4>family and he's just a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>

2037
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 4>he's the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Burr is the real deal.</v>

2038
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:47.290
<v Speaker 4>He's just one of the best guys ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2039
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.660
<v Speaker 4>he had this amazing bit about Lance </v>
<v Speaker 4>Armstrong being that like,</v>

2040
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:52.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically his,</v>

2041
01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.580
<v Speaker 4>his words are psychopath beat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a psychopath,</v>

2042
01:28:55.581 --> 01:28:57.410
<v Speaker 4>like the whole fucking sports on </v>
<v Speaker 4>steroids.</v>

2043
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:59.180
<v Speaker 4>They're all on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's true.</v>

2044
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:00.103
<v Speaker 4>He became the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately he was pegged being the </v>

2045
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:04.500
<v Speaker 4>guy and I mean he had all the accolades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had the image.</v>

2046
01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 4>So it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And which also means you had the most to</v>

2047
01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:07.770
<v Speaker 4>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that he expressed most was</v>

2048
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:11.040
<v Speaker 4>he regretted on people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2049
01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to keep this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>

2050
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.890
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's doing is just normal.</v>

2051
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:18.540
<v Speaker 4>It's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2052
01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:21.510
<v Speaker 4>when power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people have established power,</v>

2053
01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:24.900
<v Speaker 4>they try to protect it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He recognizes all the benefits that he's</v>

2054
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:28.800
<v Speaker 4>had for that power and he doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to step down and relinquish it.</v>

2055
01:29:28.801 --> 01:29:29.634
<v Speaker 4>And also if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would have to somehow or another </v>

2056
01:29:31.381 --> 01:29:32.214
<v Speaker 4>admit that what he was doing was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I assumed that marine land is still </v>

2057
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:35.980
<v Speaker 4>making money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2058
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.590
<v Speaker 4>it still makes some money out a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

2059
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.340
<v Speaker 4>is it?</v>

2060
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.210
<v Speaker 4>The balance is down significantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because tourism is up in Niagara Falls.</v>

2061
01:29:42.211 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 4>But I think if you guys really want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a,</v>

2062
01:29:45.181 --> 01:29:46.680
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good perspective.</v>

2063
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:50.310
<v Speaker 4>There was a podcast that I was recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>on called Canada land and it's a,</v>

2064
01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:53.700
<v Speaker 4>it's a big podcast hosted by an </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigative journalist,</v>

2065
01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.633
<v Speaker 4>a Jesse Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's very meticulous and very </v>

2066
01:29:55.651 --> 01:29:56.840
<v Speaker 4>thorough in his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2067
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.530
<v Speaker 4>in his work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had,</v>

2068
01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:02.130
<v Speaker 4>and he detailed this exchange between he</v>
<v Speaker 4>and marine marketing.</v>

2069
01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:04.230
<v Speaker 4>No one put a name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be marine lines.</v>

2070
01:30:04.231 --> 01:30:05.130
<v Speaker 4>Lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2071
01:30:05.131 --> 01:30:05.964
<v Speaker 4>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to see how they operate and </v>

2072
01:30:07.771 --> 01:30:08.604
<v Speaker 4>how far they're willing to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppress what I say and the information </v>

2073
01:30:12.061 --> 01:30:12.894
<v Speaker 4>that we provide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do go to the candle and podcasts and </v>

2074
01:30:14.671 --> 01:30:15.900
<v Speaker 4>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2075
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:17.223
<v Speaker 4>they've threatened to sue him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they vowed to suit to what they called </v>

2076
01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:20.520
<v Speaker 4>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a quote.</v>

2077
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.430
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's just the way they operate.</v>

2078
01:30:23.431 --> 01:30:24.270
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2079
01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:25.051
<v Speaker 4>you yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

2080
01:30:25.051 --> 01:30:25.884
<v Speaker 4>and I hate to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would be a dream if they </v>

2081
01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:28.470
<v Speaker 4>threatened to sue you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to happen,</v>

2082
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:31.650
<v Speaker 4>but why would they sue me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2083
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:34.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't sue me.</v>

2084
01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.140
<v Speaker 4>The goofy kangaroo court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a Dick.</v>

2085
01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.033
<v Speaker 4>He's suing Americans right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to threaten them with that </v>

2086
01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:43.200
<v Speaker 4>and I'll drive by his house at Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about that?</v>

2087
01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:46.290
<v Speaker 4>I'll just say nice things to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want him to threaten him.</v>

2088
01:30:47.670 --> 01:30:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That Canada land podcast details at all.</v>

2089
01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.600
<v Speaker 4>It was well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really well done.</v>

2090
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:57.080
<v Speaker 4>I just think the whole thing eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at it historically,</v>

2091
01:30:57.570 --> 01:30:58.403
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2092
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.580
<v Speaker 4>my friend Amber Lyon had a great quote </v>
<v Speaker 4>when she was talking about when she used</v>

2093
01:31:02.581 --> 01:31:04.630
<v Speaker 4>to work for CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2094
01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:06.600
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love this quote.</v>

2095
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:08.850
<v Speaker 4>It's being on the wrong side of history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2096
01:31:08.851 --> 01:31:10.500
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what this guy is.</v>

2097
01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:11.930
<v Speaker 4>He's on the wrong side of history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet,</v>

2098
01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:13.043
<v Speaker 4>when it all boils down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to look like an ugly </v>

2099
01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:16.270
<v Speaker 4>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2100
01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:18.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What type of legacy is trying to protect</v>

2101
01:31:18.571 --> 01:31:19.404
<v Speaker 4>at this point in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The funny thing is all of these make it </v>

2102
01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.750
<v Speaker 4>lawyers rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not making me broke.</v>

2103
01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:22.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2104
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:24.990
<v Speaker 4>to a certain extent that doing old rich </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucks.</v>

2105
01:31:24.991 --> 01:31:27.150
<v Speaker 4>Do they sue you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2106
01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's common practice they have.</v>

2107
01:31:31.201 --> 01:31:33.810
<v Speaker 4>That's their avenue of getting back at </v>
<v Speaker 4>you for talking.</v>

2108
01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:34.913
<v Speaker 4>He exists in a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is an old man and he's born in a </v>

2109
01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:39.414
<v Speaker 4>world where there was no internet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's experiencing the ramifications of </v>

2110
01:31:43.861 --> 01:31:44.694
<v Speaker 4>this time that we're in and also the new</v>
<v Speaker 4>information that exists now where we </v>

2111
01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:48.654
<v Speaker 4>understand that these practices they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been engaging in for decades are cruel </v>

2112
01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 4>and inhumane and disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're disgusting.</v>

2113
01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.290
<v Speaker 4>There's no other way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2114
01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Captivity of</v>

2115
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:01.950
<v Speaker 3>mammals like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking disgust.</v>

2116
01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.400
<v Speaker 3>I indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's it going to go,</v>

2117
01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:06.243
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2118
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:08.770
<v Speaker 3>How long can this guy keep dragging you </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the courts?</v>

2119
01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.413
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately there was some changes to </v>

2120
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>the law societies laws and where it used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>

2121
01:32:16.481 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I believe three years of inactivity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lawsuit you can,</v>

2122
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:20.440
<v Speaker 3>you can file a motion to have it thrown </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2123
01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.700
<v Speaker 3>That's been extended as I think it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>march of last year to five years,</v>

2124
01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 3>so we've got a lot of things going </v>
<v Speaker 3>against us.</v>

2125
01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:30.730
<v Speaker 3>So you have two more years of inactivity</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they could sue you.</v>

2126
01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:31.481
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2127
01:32:31.481 --> 01:32:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a lawyer,</v>

2128
01:32:32.501 --> 01:32:33.334
<v Speaker 3>but this is my understanding of what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>an opportunity before that is no longer </v>

2129
01:32:35.891 --> 01:32:39.230
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is at some point he,</v>

2130
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:41.710
<v Speaker 3>he himself has to play by the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the courts.</v>

2131
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.120
<v Speaker 3>He's going to have to be examined.</v>

2132
01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.770
<v Speaker 3>He's the one that's got the information </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we want.</v>

2133
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:45.604
<v Speaker 3>We want to go get that information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is information that marine land is </v>

2134
01:32:48.221 --> 01:32:51.610
<v Speaker 3>steadfast right now and isolating or </v>
<v Speaker 3>other insulating any type of,</v>

2135
01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:52.450
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2136
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:53.650
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of witnesses.</v>

2137
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:54.663
<v Speaker 3>I mean he himself as a witness to all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that he's alleging against </v>

2138
01:32:56.741 --> 01:32:59.710
<v Speaker 3>that he should be the one that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>responding to the lawsuit instead.</v>

2139
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.060
<v Speaker 3>They give us this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2140
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:01.811
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2141
01:33:01.811 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 3>this glorified janitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2142
01:33:03.461 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck does this janitor have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with our lawsuit?</v>

2143
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:09.160
<v Speaker 3>We want to look at your financial files.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're claiming financial losses,</v>

2144
01:33:09.161 --> 01:33:09.431
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2145
01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:09.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2146
01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:12.340
<v Speaker 3>in the region of what's the janitor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

2147
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 3>So what marine land doesn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This shouldn't surprise anyone is rather</v>

2148
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:16.091
<v Speaker 3>than be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2149
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:16.924
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm suing you so you can take a look at </v>

2150
01:33:18.971 --> 01:33:20.710
<v Speaker 3>my files.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to present to you that the net</v>

2151
01:33:20.711 --> 01:33:23.050
<v Speaker 3>losses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>financial losses of that I'm claiming,</v>

2152
01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.270
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to have to defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>against this information.</v>

2153
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead they,</v>

2154
01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.000
<v Speaker 3>they gave me this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this janitor.</v>

2155
01:33:28.001 --> 01:33:28.834
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell,</v>

2156
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:30.750
<v Speaker 3>what the hell has that got to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything we don't want to,</v>

2157
01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.690
<v Speaker 3>we don't want it gave you a janitor for </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2158
01:33:32.691 --> 01:33:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Like to look through his that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>

01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Give us the files apparently that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at.</v>

2160
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:40.240
<v Speaker 3>That is going to give context to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit.</v>

2161
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:41.133
<v Speaker 3>It's nonsense Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just another means that I have to </v>

2162
01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 3>fight and spend a lot of money to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to the,</v>

2163
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:46.930
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the root of it all,</v>

2164
01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:50.290
<v Speaker 3>which is the legitimacy of the lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which there is none.</v>

2165
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm being sued for plotting to steal a </v>
<v Speaker 3>walrus.</v>

2166
01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:54.873
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My last wanting to steal smooshy my </v>

2167
01:33:57.551 --> 01:34:01.330
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit is plotting to steal smooshy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend's lawsuit is defamation in</v>

2168
01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:05.020
<v Speaker 3>the sense that she expressed concern for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lone remaining killer whale Kiska,</v>

2169
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:09.760
<v Speaker 3>which was bleeding profusely from her </v>
<v Speaker 3>tail and hurt her or talk with the,</v>

2170
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:11.680
<v Speaker 3>with the Toronto Sun or rather the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto Star,</v>

2171
01:34:11.681 --> 01:34:14.380
<v Speaker 3>which is the newspaper that revealed all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2172
01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:16.720
<v Speaker 3>sort of did the investigation of marine </v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

2173
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.330
<v Speaker 3>So she's being sued and they had a video</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the video,</v>

2174
01:34:19.331 --> 01:34:20.980
<v Speaker 3>you see the killer whale bleeding like </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

2175
01:34:20.981 --> 01:34:22.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you can call that </v>
<v Speaker 3>defamation.</v>

2176
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.290
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another lawsuit called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2177
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.160
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going against Jim Hammond.</v>

2178
01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:27.994
<v Speaker 3>He's a former land animal care </v>
<v Speaker 3>supervisor and he's the one that </v>

2179
01:34:29.651 --> 01:34:34.651
<v Speaker 3>witnessed John holders shoot the dogs on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his property for no reason.</v>

2180
01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can't be defended.</v>

2181
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:37.600
<v Speaker 3>It's indefensible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were,</v>

2182
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:38.463
<v Speaker 3>these were golden labs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are puppy dogs and coyotes and </v>

2183
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:41.733
<v Speaker 3>these were his neighbors and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbors were afraid to press charges </v>

2184
01:34:44.561 --> 01:34:46.780
<v Speaker 3>because they thought that John would sue</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2185
01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:47.800
<v Speaker 3>They probably thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2186
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.753
<v Speaker 3>I mean the police themselves said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't lay this charge on him because </v>

2187
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:52.960
<v Speaker 3>he's going to lawyer us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna.</v>

2188
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.450
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna lawyer up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2189
01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really a stone wall.</v>

2190
01:34:56.261 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 3>They're putting up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he just gets is just strategy.</v>

2191
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:00.750
<v Speaker 3>He just sues a war of attrition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a suit.</v>

2192
01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:01.733
<v Speaker 3>Everyone and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how the courts are </v>

2193
01:35:03.741 --> 01:35:06.770
<v Speaker 3>allowing him to sue for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This doesn't make any sense because it.</v>

2194
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Because we've gotten nowhere in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to prove the legitimacy of it.</v>

2195
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just the process itself in and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself is,</v>

2196
01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is punishing to people like me.</v>

2197
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:18.380
<v Speaker 3>So his idea is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go to court.</v>

2198
01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.273
<v Speaker 3>It's let's put him through the ringer so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he goes broke and ultimately the </v>

2199
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 3>only way I can get out of this lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 3>was if I signed something,</v>

2200
01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:26.690
<v Speaker 3>say I'm not going to talk anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fuck that.</v>

2201
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to not talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to continue to talk to talk.</v>

2202
01:35:29.451 --> 01:35:30.284
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to continue to get my ass on </v>
<v Speaker 3>these podcasts and spread my word and I </v>

2203
01:35:32.931 --> 01:35:34.160
<v Speaker 3>get a louder and louder voice.</v>

2204
01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my resolve.</v>

2205
01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.470
<v Speaker 3>So you think ultimately this has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another come to a trial?</v>

2206
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:40.363
<v Speaker 3>It absolutely has to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or he has to drop the charges and then </v>

2207
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:45.230
<v Speaker 3>he would have to get him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am suing him.</v>

2208
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.213
<v Speaker 3>He's yet to respond to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something again that normally </v>

2209
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.823
<v Speaker 3>lawsuits have 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has been three years and they've </v>

2210
01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:51.980
<v Speaker 3>not responded well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's that work?</v>

2211
01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.920
<v Speaker 3>That how come you have to respond?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he doesn't have to respond.</v>

2212
01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:57.290
<v Speaker 3>They've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they've done is essentially,</v>

2213
01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:58.124
<v Speaker 3>or what I believe they've done allegedly</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they've hijacked the process is what </v>

2214
01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:03.314
<v Speaker 3>it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you just inundate the courts with </v>

2215
01:36:05.751 --> 01:36:08.330
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different things and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>time a court date seems to come up,</v>

2216
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:11.360
<v Speaker 3>it gets adjourned or we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2217
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:12.303
<v Speaker 3>I mean recently I lost my lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's moved away so I was having to find </v>

2218
01:36:14.691 --> 01:36:15.140
<v Speaker 3>another one.</v>

2219
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Marina and pounced immediately called </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a motion.</v>

2220
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:18.740
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2221
01:36:18.741 --> 01:36:19.574
<v Speaker 3>so now I'm defending or rather it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to my girlfriend and she got a </v>

2222
01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.313
<v Speaker 3>had to go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my court date ultimately did get a </v>

2223
01:36:25.251 --> 01:36:26.084
<v Speaker 3>journal because my girlfriend was </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and actually having the </v>

2224
01:36:28.530 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 3>motion to adjourn despite the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're continuing with these motions.</v>

2225
01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a lawyer.</v>

2226
01:36:33.441 --> 01:36:35.210
<v Speaker 3>I can't really get down to the nitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>gritty of it all.</v>

2227
01:36:35.211 --> 01:36:36.044
<v Speaker 3>I can only just offer you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of someone who's being </v>

2228
01:36:37.461 --> 01:36:40.010
<v Speaker 3>punished unjustly with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>

2229
01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:45.300
<v Speaker 3>with a process that just in an is </v>
<v Speaker 3>inherently a abusive.</v>

2230
01:36:46.190 --> 01:36:50.300
<v Speaker 3>It's an abuse of process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really discouraging it.</v>

2231
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to my world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2232
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.960
<v Speaker 3>and I'm still trying to put food on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

2233
01:36:53.961 --> 01:36:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean actually got a life to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

2234
01:36:55.371 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean here I was 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>35 when when this thing happened,</v>

2235
01:36:59.060 --> 01:36:59.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm 38 years old.</v>

2236
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.823
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sweat so I get to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward to resetting my life and try to </v>

2237
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:05.210
<v Speaker 3>pursue some personal endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At what 45 is that?</v>

2238
01:37:05.211 --> 01:37:06.044
<v Speaker 3>When is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I finally get to be freed of this </v>

2239
01:37:07.101 --> 01:37:08.270
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm an activist.</v>

2240
01:37:08.271 --> 01:37:08.781
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2241
01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Call me an activist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2242
01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:11.023
<v Speaker 3>when this is all said and done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm also a human being that wants to do </v>

2243
01:37:12.741 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 3>stuff in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing for work these days?</v>

2244
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do some.</v>

2245
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually recently I was a pallbearer for</v>

2246
01:37:19.941 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 3>hire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was interesting.</v>

2247
01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.660
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't have families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'd get a call and say,</v>

2248
01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:28.560
<v Speaker 3>you want to come help carry this casket?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ carrying dead that,</v>

2249
01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.380
<v Speaker 3>that'd be great for the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing.</v>

2250
01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:32.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2251
01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:32.811
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:37:32.811 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2253
01:37:33.831 --> 01:37:36.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a problem because getting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>publisher's tough right now.</v>

2254
01:37:36.021 --> 01:37:38.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to publish my words,</v>

2255
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.980
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2256
01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.210
<v Speaker 3>I assume there was a documentary that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in its initial stages.</v>

2257
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.133
<v Speaker 3>It is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a big story in outside </v>

2258
01:37:47.631 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 3>magazine that was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was,</v>

2259
01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 3>this was the feature piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It got quashed.</v>

2260
01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:53.930
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people show fear when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to lawsuits.</v>

2261
01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Thankfully Ontario passed what's called</v>

2262
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.930
<v Speaker 4>anti slap legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got the thing,</v>

2263
01:37:57.931 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 4>and I'd mentioned this in the earlier </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>

2264
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:03.090
<v Speaker 4>we were getting anti slap legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is,</v>

2265
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:04.530
<v Speaker 4>and there's a major conflict of </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest,</v>

2266
01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:05.543
<v Speaker 4>is that Ontario's premier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she herself had a slap suit against one </v>

2267
01:38:09.601 --> 01:38:10.434
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2268
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:12.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mpps during the elections.</v>

2269
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:13.463
<v Speaker 4>She launched the lawsuit so that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't talk about this controversial </v>

2270
01:38:15.331 --> 01:38:16.164
<v Speaker 4>issue which was this gas plant scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what she did when she </v>

2271
01:38:18.451 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 4>reintroduced the bill is that she took </v>
<v Speaker 4>out the retro clause.</v>

2272
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.910
<v Speaker 4>This was our home run dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were out,</v>

2273
01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:24.773
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marina was going to be up against a </v>

2274
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:28.200
<v Speaker 4>major punitive damages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as per the letter of the law,</v>

2275
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.770
<v Speaker 4>they took out it being retro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no longer retroactive.</v>

2276
01:38:31.771 --> 01:38:35.310
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't apply to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insanity because this one woman,</v>

2277
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.310
<v Speaker 4>while she's the premier of Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck her,</v>

2278
01:38:38.670 --> 01:38:39.420
<v Speaker 4>I can't say that.</v>

2279
01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:42.300
<v Speaker 4>That's not going to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's her name and appreciated Kathleen</v>

<v Speaker 4>How dare you felt if I didn't say it?</v>

2283
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.120
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>

2284
01:38:51.121 --> 01:38:51.954

2285
01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:53.753
<v Speaker 4>involving yourself in any type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>government process and everything else </v>

2286
01:38:55.801 --> 01:38:56.634
<v Speaker 4>is that it's a thankless work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking brutal and it rarely to </v>

2287
01:39:00.361 --> 01:39:02.340
<v Speaker 4>ever actually goes your way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I swear to you,</v>

2288
01:39:02.341 --> 01:39:06.570
<v Speaker 4>I've had an arrow striking the bull's </v>
<v Speaker 4>eye and every time it just glances every</v>

2289
01:39:06.571 --> 01:39:08.430
<v Speaker 4>fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not discouraged.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on this fucking show,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a dream come true.</v>

2292
01:39:10.681 --> 01:39:12.470
<v Speaker 4>It happened again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot fuck a believer,</v>

<v Speaker 4>so a good things to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just gotTa keep focused.</v>

2294
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:16.463
<v Speaker 4>Good things to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so bizarre that no one from </v>

2295
01:39:18.931 --> 01:39:23.931
<v Speaker 4>the government recognizes what a </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible thing this is not just in terms</v>

2296
01:39:24.001 --> 01:39:24.834
<v Speaker 4>of the injustice that is being done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also in terms of the pr for their </v>

2297
01:39:28.201 --> 01:39:29.130
<v Speaker 4>legal system.</v>

2298
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:30.480
<v Speaker 4>It is recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's large.</v>

2299
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:35.070
<v Speaker 4>It's been expressed in a at Queen's Park</v>
<v Speaker 4>and provincial legislation.</v>

2300
01:39:35.110 --> 01:39:37.460
<v Speaker 4>These are abusive lawsuits and like we </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a,</v>

2301
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:39.570
<v Speaker 4>an MPP standup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sherry Denovo and she's just like,</v>

2302
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:40.583
<v Speaker 4>when is this gonna stop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she's pounding her fist and </v>

2303
01:39:42.331 --> 01:39:44.940
<v Speaker 4>everything else and what happens one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately she's.</v>

2304
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.670
<v Speaker 4>It was a political issue and she's not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>member of the Liberal Party.</v>

2305
01:39:47.671 --> 01:39:49.430
<v Speaker 4>She's part of the New Democratic Party </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the.</v>

2306
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys have a liberal party.</v>

2307
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:53.713
<v Speaker 4>We have various.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a liberal party that's in power </v>

2308
01:39:55.530 --> 01:39:56.363
<v Speaker 4>across,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on both the federal and provincial </v>

2309
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:00.630
<v Speaker 4>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your king is a liberal,</v>

2310
01:40:00.631 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>King the King Justin Trudeau.</v>

2311
01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that guy.</v>

2312
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:07.020
<v Speaker 4>He's the one that's going to legalize </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana in Canada.</v>

2313
01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.700
<v Speaker 4>Who seems like a cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard.</v>

2314
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:09.920
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2315
01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:12.570
<v Speaker 4>I wish we had a candidate for the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States president like that.</v>

2316
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.330
<v Speaker 4>He's the one who were trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to see if we can't get support</v>

2317
01:40:15.331 --> 01:40:15.960
<v Speaker 4>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2318
01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.250
<v Speaker 4>for this bill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting the Benne,</v>

2319
01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:18.203
<v Speaker 4>the whales and dolphin captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He definitely should be a part of that </v>

2320
01:40:20.821 --> 01:40:21.654
<v Speaker 4>and he definitely should step in and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something about what's happening with </v>

2321
01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:25.350
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you guys tried to contact him about</v>

2322
01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:26.071
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2323
01:40:26.071 --> 01:40:27.000
<v Speaker 4>I've not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's it.</v>

2324
01:40:27.010 --> 01:40:30.540
<v Speaker 4>This is something that's governed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>by Ontario provincial.</v>

2325
01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:31.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

2327
01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:34.050
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing he could do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's the king.</v>

2328
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:35.130
<v Speaker 4>He's the king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2329
01:40:35.131 --> 01:40:37.200
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heavy is the crown.</v>

2330
01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck.</v>

2331
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:40.830
<v Speaker 4>You can't just step in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd think you'd tap on the shoulder.</v>

2332
01:40:40.831 --> 01:40:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Now granted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2333
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:43.263
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember touring a lot of public </v>

2334
01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:48.230
<v Speaker 4>figures and intern during my time at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marineland,</v>

2335
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:49.223
<v Speaker 4>including John [inaudible] who was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>former prime minister's son who still </v>

2336
01:40:51.871 --> 01:40:52.620
<v Speaker 4>goes there.</v>

2337
01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:55.280
<v Speaker 4>So there's still some government ties to</v>
<v Speaker 4>marina.</v>

2338
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still goes there like he visits.</v>

2339
01:40:57.550 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 4>He brings some people to Scuba dive with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2340
01:41:00.341 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the Beluga whales,</v>

2341
01:41:01.751 --> 01:41:04.210
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people with disadvantages physically and</v>

2342
01:41:04.211 --> 01:41:04.511
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2343
01:41:04.511 --> 01:41:06.720
<v Speaker 4>it's a great program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2344
01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.730
<v Speaker 4>that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was continuing going up until 2012 at</v>

2345
01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:10.870
<v Speaker 4>least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that he still goes,</v>

2346
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:11.763
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been in the park in that long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems like Canada has so many </v>

2347
01:41:15.011 --> 01:41:15.844
<v Speaker 4>great things going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I hear lawsuits like this and </v>

2348
01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.880
<v Speaker 4>that are so insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that lasts for so long.</v>

2349
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 4>And then that your counter lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get any traction at all and that</v>

2350
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:26.794
<v Speaker 4>no one's paying attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand how they can </v>

2351
01:41:28.571 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 4>allow that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing.</v>

2352
01:41:31.451 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people helping us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2353
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it appears that it's going to be</v>

2354
01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:37.750
<v Speaker 4>the will of the people versus the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

2355
01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:39.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man,</v>

2356
01:41:39.531 --> 01:41:41.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't discourage me man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>

2357
01:41:41.311 --> 01:41:42.490
<v Speaker 4>I know how I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hold.</v>

2358
01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:44.020
<v Speaker 4>I might hold deep and Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2359
01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:44.950
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2360
01:41:44.951 --> 01:41:46.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so frustrating.</v>

2361
01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.673
<v Speaker 4>It's so frustrating as an observer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an outsider looking at this and </v>

2362
01:41:50.531 --> 01:41:51.251
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2363
01:41:51.251 --> 01:41:56.020
<v Speaker 4>this is just so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange that in this day and age</v>

2364
01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:58.720
<v Speaker 4>this can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then someone can get away with this.</v>

2365
01:41:59.050 --> 01:42:00.640
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't gotten away with it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ain't done.</v>

2366
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:02.920
<v Speaker 4>But he's getting away with what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing so far.</v>

2367
01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:03.843
<v Speaker 4>So where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally the government should </v>

2368
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 4>shut him the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have stopped this lawsuit.</v>

2369
01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.650
<v Speaker 4>They should have been forced to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawsuit against him.</v>

2370
01:42:11.651 --> 01:42:14.260
<v Speaker 4>They should arrest him for stocking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole deal.</v>

2371
01:42:14.410 --> 01:42:15.480
<v Speaker 4>The whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2372
01:42:15.481 --> 01:42:19.390
<v Speaker 4>it's all disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've become quite jaded and admittedly I</v>

2373
01:42:19.391 --> 01:42:23.110
<v Speaker 4>believed even when we came out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there would be some type of justice.</v>

2374
01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:23.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we seeking.</v>

2375
01:42:23.951 --> 01:42:24.730
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2376
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 4>Isn't doing this for shits and giggles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Money is draining that justice.</v>

2377
01:42:29.141 --> 01:42:29.974
<v Speaker 4>When you speak to power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can expect some serious </v>

2378
01:42:31.481 --> 01:42:32.950
<v Speaker 4>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a simple as that,</v>

2379
01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.040
<v Speaker 4>but it's so insane that the charge is </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempting to kidnap a Walrus.</v>

2380
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Correct and trespassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's the challenge,</v>

2381
01:42:40.391 --> 01:42:43.090
<v Speaker 4>and I offer this to all your millions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>viewers and listeners.</v>

2382
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:46.660
<v Speaker 4>You find a single video of the last day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember.</v>

2383
01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was April,</v>

2384
01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.060
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was a.</v>

2385
01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.810
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do I not know the date of this?</v>

2386
01:42:52.811 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2387
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:55.360
<v Speaker 4>let's call it October 17th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>

2388
01:42:55.361 --> 01:42:56.194
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 12 marina alleges that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>broke into the park with these legions </v>

2389
01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:00.340
<v Speaker 4>of animal rights activists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

2390
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:02.530
<v Speaker 4>which actually did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not I wasn't there.</v>

2391
01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:04.900
<v Speaker 4>I was on public property.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not go into the park,</v>

2392
01:43:05.110 --> 01:43:07.330
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds did actually storm the gates.</v>

2393
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:08.343
<v Speaker 4>And what marine line alleges that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>trespassed in there and there's tons of </v>

2394
01:43:10.631 --> 01:43:11.464
<v Speaker 4>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can get 15 different vantage </v>

2395
01:43:13.210 --> 01:43:14.043
<v Speaker 4>points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If any single person finds me in that </v>

2396
01:43:15.761 --> 01:43:16.594
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will personally cut you a check for </v>

2397
01:43:17.741 --> 01:43:18.574
<v Speaker 4>one point $5 million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't get you to have one point </v>

2398
01:43:20.501 --> 01:43:21.334
<v Speaker 4>$5,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would you offer one point </v>

2399
01:43:22.301 --> 01:43:25.080
<v Speaker 4>$5,000,000?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll blow you auntie.</v>

2400
01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:25.931
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to happen.</v>

2401
01:43:25.931 --> 01:43:27.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was guy about it.</v>

2402
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:28.293
<v Speaker 4>There's no video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to photoshop you and then </v>

2403
01:43:29.150 --> 01:43:29.983
<v Speaker 4>just for a blowjob,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to someone to use that CGI </v>

2404
01:43:31.991 --> 01:43:32.824
<v Speaker 4>shit they did with Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I can negotiate my way out of </v>

2405
01:43:34.721 --> 01:43:35.554
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get one point five my hand job </v>

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:38.670
<v Speaker 4>marilla and thinks they're getting point</v>
<v Speaker 4>five out of me.</v>

2407
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:40.143
<v Speaker 4>That's what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One point $5 million out of the other </v>

2408
01:43:42.431 --> 01:43:44.800
<v Speaker 4>guy who essentially is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but put it this way,</v>

2409
01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:47.050
<v Speaker 4>but they're trying to sue you for one </v>
<v Speaker 4>point $5,000,000.</v>

2410
01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:48.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the damage that they're claiming.</v>

2411
01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 4>What's that in real money in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like outside of Canada,</v>

2412
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.640
<v Speaker 4>like America where accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2413
01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:56.750
<v Speaker 4>let's call it a million bones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a million bones.</v>

2414
01:43:58.190 --> 01:43:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Your money's worth more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

2415
01:43:59.451 --> 01:44:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or significantly less.</v>

2416
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:02.690
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking three beers.</v>

2419
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 4>You send beer across the border.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not.</v>

2420
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:11.100
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a drug is a drug.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've received quite a bit of support </v>

2437
01:44:47.541 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 4>from like what I would call some real </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad ass.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Awesome people.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But beyond that,</v>

2440
01:44:52.011 --> 01:44:52.430
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2441
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:54.110
<v Speaker 4>there's really quite a bit of fear of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2442
01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.660
<v Speaker 4>of my speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there are mostly in Canada,</v>

2443
01:44:56.661 --> 01:44:57.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2444
01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.870
<v Speaker 4>mostly in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in America,</v>

2445
01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 4>outside magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they quashed that story.</v>

2446
01:45:02.091 --> 01:45:03.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be a big feature.</v>

2447
01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.940
<v Speaker 4>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

2448
01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:06.510
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2449
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:07.640
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2450
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.790
<v Speaker 4>the writer was staying at our place and </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time,</v>

2451
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:12.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe we had a,</v>

2452
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:14.150
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2453
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.510
<v Speaker 4>there were people watching us and I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically said because his,</v>

2454
01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:21.560
<v Speaker 4>his rental vehicle was parked across and</v>
<v Speaker 4>here he was sitting on the couch and,</v>

2455
01:45:21.561 --> 01:45:22.394
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking and talking and I looked </v>

2456
01:45:23.431 --> 01:45:24.264
<v Speaker 4>and it was a truck that repeatedly drove</v>
<v Speaker 4>by and stopped and went to the other </v>

2457
01:45:26.391 --> 01:45:27.080
<v Speaker 4>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turned around.</v>

2458
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:27.590
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

2459
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:28.850
<v Speaker 4>you're being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're being watched.</v>

2460
01:45:28.851 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's just like,</v>

2461
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:31.123
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think at this point he didn't truly </v>

2462
01:45:32.211 --> 01:45:35.210
<v Speaker 4>appreciate the depths that we were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and at this point I don't,</v>

2463
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:37.700
<v Speaker 4>we weren't even sued yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2464
01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:38.983
<v Speaker 4>sure shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marina named him by name the author and </v>

2465
01:45:42.021 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was it.</v>

2466
01:45:43.401 --> 01:45:44.234
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2467
01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.820
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2468
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.753
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tried to get the,</v>

2469
01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:47.250
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2470
01:45:47.250 --> 01:45:49.490
<v Speaker 4>the article to run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but outside ultimately said,</v>

2471
01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:52.100
<v Speaker 4>we're not interested in being sued now </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different time.</v>

2472
01:45:52.101 --> 01:45:54.680
<v Speaker 4>There's anti slap legislation now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so outside if you're listening,</v>

2473
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.863
<v Speaker 4>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why didn't they just shut their fucking </v>

2474
01:45:58.761 --> 01:46:02.000
<v Speaker 4>mouth until they published it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A he was.</v>

2475
01:46:02.001 --> 01:46:03.330
<v Speaker 4>How did they find out what he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking?</v>

2476
01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.213
<v Speaker 4>He was asking a current and former </v>
<v Speaker 4>employees to see if anyone would speak </v>

2477
01:46:06.381 --> 01:46:08.000
<v Speaker 4>and then obviously there was someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>that went to,</v>

2478
01:46:08.890 --> 01:46:11.460
<v Speaker 4>you know when you live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you worked in an oppressive sort of</v>

2479
01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:12.710
<v Speaker 4>regime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will,</v>

2480
01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:15.140
<v Speaker 4>you're quick to try to score bonus </v>
<v Speaker 4>points.</v>

2481
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.120
<v Speaker 4>I assume the former trainer or someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably said,</v>

2482
01:46:17.121 --> 01:46:17.954
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's calling around looking for </v>

2483
01:46:18.771 --> 01:46:20.900
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What other businesses that guy have?</v>

2484
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.760
<v Speaker 4>They're all in house businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2485
01:46:22.761 --> 01:46:24.110
<v Speaker 4>he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He owns a lot of property.</v>

2486
01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:25.730
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He owes no one any money.</v>

2487
01:46:25.731 --> 01:46:28.310
<v Speaker 4>There's no outside a financial interest </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever.</v>

2488
01:46:28.311 --> 01:46:29.144
<v Speaker 4>He is the sole controlling mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like God like that needs to </v>

2489
01:46:32.031 --> 01:46:33.810
<v Speaker 4>come to Jesus moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just realized.</v>

2490
01:46:33.811 --> 01:46:34.880
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

2491
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:35.783
<v Speaker 4>My life is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's at the later stages of his </v>

2492
01:46:37.461 --> 01:46:41.450
<v Speaker 4>life and just living like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when people talk anger and evil,</v>

2493
01:46:41.451 --> 01:46:43.700
<v Speaker 4>and I hate to mention it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a couple of years ago,</v>

2494
01:46:43.701 --> 01:46:45.470
<v Speaker 4>a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was my greatest ally,</v>

2495
01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:46.483
<v Speaker 4>his son actually passed away and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the guy who actually allowed into </v>

2496
01:46:49.411 --> 01:46:52.230
<v Speaker 4>the park when I went unbenounced to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was no longer allowed there.</v>

2497
01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.090
<v Speaker 4>He let me in and that's when I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2498
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.093
<v Speaker 4>smooshy in the condition that she was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ultimately inspired me to sort of </v>

2499
01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:01.540
<v Speaker 4>speak out and not be anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2500
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:04.200
<v Speaker 4>he shortly thereafter actually passed </v>
<v Speaker 4>away and he was my age.</v>

2501
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:05.960
<v Speaker 4>How did he die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

2502
01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:08.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm afraid to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll say that it was,</v>

2503
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was avoidable.</v>

2504
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 4>I think that when you live under an </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressive and difficult situation,</v>

2505
01:47:17.851 --> 01:47:20.190
<v Speaker 4>especially with regards to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with your father,</v>

2506
01:47:20.191 --> 01:47:25.191
<v Speaker 4>that maybe you resort to methods to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to ease that pain maybe so to,</v>

2507
01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:28.720
<v Speaker 4>to sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2508
01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:32.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe forget your woes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So something drug related.</v>

2509
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

2510
01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:34.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2511
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.960
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheers.</v>

2512
01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:37.140
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

2513
01:47:37.290 --> 01:47:40.320
<v Speaker 4>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's the next step?</v>

2514
01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Like what happens now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other than the next step,</v>

2515
01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:45.150
<v Speaker 4>tell everybody to go to save </v>
<v Speaker 4>smooshy.com.</v>

2516
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:46.643
<v Speaker 4>Throw some money around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next step would be nice if maybe </v>

2517
01:47:48.361 --> 01:47:51.660
<v Speaker 4>Peta would step up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in terms of hypocrisy.</v>

2518
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:52.703
<v Speaker 4>Peter likes to use our headlines and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>raise money for themselves on their </v>

2519
01:47:56.191 --> 01:47:58.110
<v Speaker 4>websites and they'll donate here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2521
01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 4>We have not received an iota of help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

2522
01:48:01.711 --> 01:48:02.251
<v Speaker 4>I asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2524
01:48:03.691 --> 01:48:04.160

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2525
01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.520
<v Speaker 4>it's a nonprofit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've learned that.</v>

2526
01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:06.900
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>

01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:07.734
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they say donate here to them to help </v>

2528
01:48:10.921 --> 01:48:13.680
<v Speaker 4>you and the money to them to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know they don't.</v>

2529
01:48:13.890 --> 01:48:16.830
<v Speaker 4>They don't ever say to help to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that they use that stories.</v>

2530
01:48:16.831 --> 01:48:17.260
<v Speaker 4>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2531
01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:19.450
<v Speaker 4>mass graves found out marine land and </v>

2537
01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:30.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're too busy killing cats and dogs.</v>

01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:34.110
<v Speaker 4>And tweeting you on Orca Day tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan,</v>

2539
01:48:34.111 --> 01:48:34.944
<v Speaker 4>the guy who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's throwing arrows into every animal </v>

<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're asking you for retweets.</v>

2541
01:48:39.171 --> 01:48:40.470
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually thought that was brilliant.</v>

2542
01:48:40.471 --> 01:48:41.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

2543
01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Pete is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

2544
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:42.860
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2545
01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:44.720
<v Speaker 4>they're showing their true colors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but well,</v>

2546
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:47.430
<v Speaker 4>they know that I do love orcas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2547
01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:49.080
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just love to eat deer,</v>

2548
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:52.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>

2549
01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't throw ours into everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only edible stuff,</v>

2550
01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.980
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2551
01:48:59.010 --> 01:48:59.843
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've retweeted things that I've </v>

2552
01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 4>posted up about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2553
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
<v Speaker 4>about orcas and particularly about my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my low thing of orchid captivity.</v>

2554
01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:12.510
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's new laws had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>passed in California,</v>

2555
01:49:12.511 --> 01:49:14.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So recently seaworld.</v>

2556
01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:15.233
<v Speaker 4>So what happened with seaworld,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to ask permission from the </v>

2557
01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:22.650
<v Speaker 4>California Coastal Commission for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>$100,000,000 expansion of their pools of</v>

2558
01:49:22.651 --> 01:49:23.340
<v Speaker 4>the existing pools.</v>

2559
01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 4>What they've said is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to eliminate the show,</v>

2560
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:28.740
<v Speaker 4>which is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true in any capacity.</v>

2561
01:49:28.741 --> 01:49:30.840
<v Speaker 4>What they're going to do is create a new</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2562
01:49:30.841 --> 01:49:32.130
<v Speaker 4>The larger one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is good,</v>

2563
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:34.970
<v Speaker 4>but they're still going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>presentation of sorts.</v>

2564
01:49:34.971 --> 01:49:36.670
<v Speaker 4>It's going to rely on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2565
01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:39.420
<v Speaker 4>animals performing more natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>behaviors,</v>

2566
01:49:39.421 --> 01:49:40.254
<v Speaker 4>but still is going to be food </v>
<v Speaker 4>deprivation in the train and it's going </v>

2567
01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:42.390
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2568
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:43.530
<v Speaker 4>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2569
01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:46.620
<v Speaker 4>it's presented differently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what the,</v>

2570
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:48.700
<v Speaker 4>what the California coastal commission </v>
<v Speaker 4>said was,</v>

2571
01:49:48.701 --> 01:49:49.250
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

2572
01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:51.580
<v Speaker 4>we'll grant you permission to make this </v>
<v Speaker 4>large expanse,</v>

2573
01:49:51.581 --> 01:49:56.581
<v Speaker 4>but you can't breed a orcas anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what seaworld basically said was,</v>

2574
01:49:57.370 --> 01:49:58.750
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well a,</v>

2575
01:49:58.751 --> 01:49:59.584
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've considered not doing it </v>

2576
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:00.844
<v Speaker 4>altogether be now they're suing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>California coastal commission alleging </v>

2577
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:05.200
<v Speaker 4>that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've overstepped their boundaries,</v>

2578
01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.450
<v Speaker 4>but what's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they want to keep breeding them.</v>

2579
01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't that tell you everything?</v>

2580
01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 4>They're all of a sudden they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna going to create this large habitat</v>

2581
01:50:12.521 --> 01:50:16.390
<v Speaker 4>for the existing animals that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposedly care so much for.</v>

2582
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:19.360
<v Speaker 4>But if there's that clause for breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not they're not going to do it.</v>

2583
01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean that says it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2584
01:50:20.691 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2585
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:22.563
<v Speaker 4>So they're not going to create the new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>larger environment just because they're </v>

2586
01:50:25.361 --> 01:50:27.040
<v Speaker 4>not allowed to breed them because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got this clause.</v>

2587
01:50:27.041 --> 01:50:27.611
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to sue,</v>

2588
01:50:27.611 --> 01:50:29.260
<v Speaker 4>I assume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to try to have that overturned where,</v>

2589
01:50:29.261 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 4>which I hope the California coastal </v>
<v Speaker 4>commission would reconsider their,</v>

2590
01:50:31.661 --> 01:50:32.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their approval of.</v>

2591
01:50:32.490 --> 01:50:35.010
<v Speaker 4>They should step it up and just make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole fucking thing illegal.</v>

2592
01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Jerry Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

2593
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:37.240
<v Speaker 4>Jerry Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a hippie.</v>

2594
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:39.670
<v Speaker 4>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a recently tabled bill,</v>

2595
01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:43.300
<v Speaker 4>which is a federal ban across the states</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a Orca captivity.</v>

2596
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:44.440
<v Speaker 4>They should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should.</v>

2597
01:50:44.650 --> 01:50:46.230
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that.</v>

2598
01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:51.770
<v Speaker 4>I wish there was a way that they could </v>
<v Speaker 4>hook up a fucking machine to a pond or a</v>

2599
01:50:52.031 --> 01:50:52.864
<v Speaker 4>pool or an Orca is and have that orchid </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate and have it broken down to </v>

2600
01:50:55.841 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 4>English.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we have google translate for Russian</v>

2601
01:50:58.991 --> 01:51:01.840
<v Speaker 4>and Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about an orchid translate?</v>

2602
01:51:01.841 --> 01:51:02.674
<v Speaker 4>If they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they figured out a way to </v>

2603
01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.013
<v Speaker 4>scientifically without debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>analyze the sounds and break them down </v>

2604
01:51:10.031 --> 01:51:10.864
<v Speaker 4>into an English language that we could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could read and understand that people </v>

2605
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:15.670
<v Speaker 4>would be mortified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2606
01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:17.800
<v Speaker 4>what if work has just started saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>really racist shit.</v>

2607
01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:22.180
<v Speaker 4>Just hate Chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2608
01:51:22.181 --> 01:51:23.870
<v Speaker 4>they have reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not the Orcas,</v>

2609
01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:25.683
<v Speaker 4>dolphins and whatnot have reason to hate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people of Japan who are just </v>

2610
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:29.974
<v Speaker 4>repeatedly a hacking them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course in the Faroe Islands </v>

2611
01:51:32.951 --> 01:51:33.784
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I watched the video of our </v>

2612
01:51:34.781 --> 01:51:37.090
<v Speaker 4>documentary on what's called the grinned</v>
<v Speaker 4>is when they,</v>

2613
01:51:37.091 --> 01:51:37.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2614
01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do these drive fisheries,</v>

2615
01:51:39.311 --> 01:51:40.450
<v Speaker 4>what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they drive the animals,</v>

2616
01:51:40.610 --> 01:51:42.200
<v Speaker 4>their sonic animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

2617
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:43.143
<v Speaker 4>pound the bottom of the ocean floor or </v>
<v Speaker 4>these metal rods into other steel </v>

2618
01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:45.940
<v Speaker 4>structures.</v>

2619
01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:48.580
<v Speaker 4>And then the herds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the animals onto the land.</v>

2620
01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:49.443
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they do here in the Faroe Islands </v>

2621
01:51:50.481 --> 01:51:51.314
<v Speaker 4>is they grabbed these hooks and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>embed it in the fucking blow hole of </v>

2622
01:51:54.611 --> 01:51:55.270
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2623
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:56.103
<v Speaker 4>of the pilot whales for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a long rope and then the </v>

2624
01:51:58.001 --> 01:52:00.820
<v Speaker 4>people drag these things up and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they go up and then hack their throat,</v>

2625
01:52:00.821 --> 01:52:01.654
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to call it substitute </v>

2626
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:02.913
<v Speaker 4>subsistence hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's hard to call that subsistence </v>

2627
01:52:05.381 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Speaker 4>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe historically it has been,</v>

2628
01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:09.730
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they eat the pilot whales,</v>

2629
01:52:09.731 --> 01:52:11.650
<v Speaker 4>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat the pilot whales.</v>

2630
01:52:11.651 --> 01:52:13.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I,</v>

2631
01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm of the opinion that it's,</v>

2632
01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.400
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a cultural thing and they're on the</v>

2633
01:52:18.401 --> 01:52:19.960
<v Speaker 4>wrong side of history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you've done it.</v>

2634
01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:21.460
<v Speaker 4>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's documented.</v>

2635
01:52:21.461 --> 01:52:22.570
<v Speaker 4>You've got the photos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will.</v>

2636
01:52:22.571 --> 01:52:24.140
<v Speaker 4>The history's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let it be there.</v>

2637
01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:26.050
<v Speaker 4>Keep it in the history books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2638
01:52:26.110 --> 01:52:26.943
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the environments where they eat </v>

2639
01:52:30.131 --> 01:52:31.270
<v Speaker 4>whales,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2640
01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:35.560
<v Speaker 4>there's people starving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's desperation in those places.</v>

2641
01:52:35.561 --> 01:52:39.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to argue in subsistence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eating and hunting is important.</v>

2642
01:52:39.131 --> 01:52:39.964
<v Speaker 4>I don't doubt that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the Faroe Islands across from </v>

2643
01:52:41.441 --> 01:52:43.930
<v Speaker 4>where they're doing the grind is a law </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a vast,</v>

2644
01:52:43.931 --> 01:52:45.790
<v Speaker 4>beautiful cityscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't tell me,</v>

2645
01:52:45.791 --> 01:52:48.440
<v Speaker 4>you can't just go grab a couple eggs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cellphone omelet.</v>

2646
01:52:48.690 --> 01:52:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Dolphin thing in the movie the cove,</v>

2647
01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:56.750
<v Speaker 4>which is what you talked about about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>

2648
01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:57.853
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2649
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:59.780
<v Speaker 4>they tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were killing them because they were</v>

2650
01:52:59.781 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 4>eating the tuner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2651
01:53:00.771 --> 01:53:01.604
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the idea behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will use anything to defend the </v>

2652
01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:04.844
<v Speaker 4>culture of killing these dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But really it's fueled by the captivity </v>

2653
01:53:07.161 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those dolphins are invaluable.</v>

2654
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:10.400
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and places like,</v>

2655
01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.920
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not gonna say seaworld now </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's been a number of years,</v>

2656
01:53:12.921 --> 01:53:13.754
<v Speaker 4>but they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have historically acquired animals </v>

2657
01:53:14.901 --> 01:53:15.734
<v Speaker 4>from these drive fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they buy these animals and these </v>

2658
01:53:18.021 --> 01:53:19.910
<v Speaker 4>hunters are driving around in fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>porsches and shit.</v>

2659
01:53:19.930 --> 01:53:20.763
<v Speaker 4>It's not because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're chopping these dolphins up for </v>

2660
01:53:22.341 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 4>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>

2661
01:53:23.421 --> 01:53:24.980
<v Speaker 4>that's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the thriving industry.</v>

2662
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:25.843
<v Speaker 4>It's the captivity industry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're selling them when they're </v>

2663
01:53:27.261 --> 01:53:28.094
<v Speaker 4>killing all those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would they kill them if they could </v>

2664
01:53:29.511 --> 01:53:30.344
<v Speaker 4>sell them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well?</v>

2665
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:31.223
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're not aesthetically </v>

2666
01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:32.330
<v Speaker 4>pleasing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take,</v>

2667
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:33.223
<v Speaker 4>they take so many of the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they take the more aesthetically </v>

2668
01:53:34.581 --> 01:53:35.630
<v Speaker 4>pleasing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do they sell them for?</v>

2669
01:53:35.631 --> 01:53:36.221
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2670
01:53:36.221 --> 01:53:37.054
<v Speaker 4>the tens of thousands or hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of dollars when they chop up </v>

2671
01:53:39.171 --> 01:53:40.610
<v Speaker 4>the dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they,</v>

2672
01:53:40.611 --> 01:53:41.001
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2673
01:53:41.001 --> 01:53:41.834
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2674
01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:42.673
<v Speaker 4>whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they gave him the supermarkets </v>

2675
01:53:43.971 --> 01:53:46.200
<v Speaker 4>and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to give him the supermarkets are,</v>

2676
01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:47.020
<v Speaker 4>softens.</v>

2677
01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never been,</v>

2678
01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:50.720
<v Speaker 4>I've been in Japan and every dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in Japan,</v>

2679
01:53:50.721 --> 01:53:51.554
<v Speaker 4>the dolphin they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's something that's </v>

2680
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:54.850
<v Speaker 4>going away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

2681
01:53:54.851 --> 01:53:58.190
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new sort of generations of kids.</v>

2682
01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.333
<v Speaker 4>I didn't watch the cove because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to see it because I've seen enough </v>

2683
01:54:01.101 --> 01:54:02.950
<v Speaker 4>youtube videos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2684
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.540
<v Speaker 4>it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't watch burger.</v>

2685
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:08.230
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that they ate them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2686
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:09.103
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what we're coming to learn is that </v>

2687
01:54:10.101 --> 01:54:12.740
<v Speaker 4>there's a high levels of mercury and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this in the dolphin meat,</v>

2688
01:54:12.741 --> 01:54:13.574
<v Speaker 4>so they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually poisoning people so that </v>

2689
01:54:14.710 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 4>people are really getting away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2690
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:19.070
<v Speaker 4>but more than not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's front to keep the captivity</v>

2691
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:19.933
<v Speaker 4>industry going and to keep that money </v>
<v Speaker 4>there because they sell them to places </v>

2692
01:54:23.091 --> 01:54:25.650
<v Speaker 4>in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sell them the places in wherever,</v>

2693
01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:26.533
<v Speaker 4>in in Japan itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of money that's being </v>

2694
01:54:28.251 --> 01:54:31.670
<v Speaker 4>exchanged between the facilities and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the hunters.</v>

2695
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:34.010
<v Speaker 4>So outside of Canada and the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>

2696
01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:34.844
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of places in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>that still have those sort of marine </v>

2697
01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:38.990
<v Speaker 4>type shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

2698
01:54:38.991 --> 01:54:41.150
<v Speaker 4>especially right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>China is really starting to,</v>

2699
01:54:41.190 --> 01:54:43.470
<v Speaker 4>is like a burgeoning environment for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>captivity into.</v>

2700
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:44.950
<v Speaker 4>So they're ramping it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're there.</v>

2701
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:47.420
<v Speaker 4>They're plucking elephants out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2702
01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:49.200
<v Speaker 4>out of Thailand and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2703
01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:52.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean wild caught wild barn baby </v>
<v Speaker 4>elephants.</v>

2704
01:54:52.491 --> 01:54:53.324
<v Speaker 4>They're stripping them from their and </v>
<v Speaker 4>from their mothers and their shipping </v>

2705
01:54:54.531 --> 01:54:56.330
<v Speaker 4>them to these places in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the zoos.</v>

2706
01:54:56.331 --> 01:54:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is another thing that has to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop now.</v>

2707
01:54:59.150 --> 01:55:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying.</v>

2708
01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Damn that dog festivals rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2709
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:09.830
<v Speaker 4>The Yulin dog festival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched that the other day on TV.</v>

2710
01:55:09.831 --> 01:55:10.664
<v Speaker 4>There was some sort of a special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This woman goes over there and it was </v>

2711
01:55:14.511 --> 01:55:17.030
<v Speaker 4>interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way the Chinese people looked at it,</v>

2712
01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's hard to argue,</v>

2713
01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:20.413
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're looking at the same way we look </v>

2714
01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:22.214
<v Speaker 4>at Bacon.</v>

2715
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:24.530
<v Speaker 4>It offers great perspective for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are,</v>

2716
01:55:24.531 --> 01:55:25.364
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

2717
01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I will never fucking eat this dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well guess what,</v>

2718
01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:31.690
<v Speaker 4>it's not any different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no less a conscious being then your</v>

2719
01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.730
<v Speaker 4>pigs who are arguably significantly more</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent than,</v>

2720
01:55:34.731 --> 01:55:35.564
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than dogs or your cows or your whatever </v>

2721
01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.073
<v Speaker 4>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it does offer a glimpse into the </v>

2722
01:55:39.351 --> 01:55:41.870
<v Speaker 4>hypocrisy of loving one animal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating the neck.</v>

2723
01:55:41.871 --> 01:55:44.850
<v Speaker 4>So I appreciate this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Offers that context.</v>

2724
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:45.833
<v Speaker 4>It's bizarre how we have these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these hierarchies of animals were this </v>

2725
01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.320
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's okay to kill an Itam.</v>

2726
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:54.720
<v Speaker 4>This one that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems more novelty based.</v>

2727
01:55:54.721 --> 01:55:55.560
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2728
01:55:55.590 --> 01:55:56.423
<v Speaker 4>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make a hell of a hell of a pet </v>

2729
01:55:57.871 --> 01:55:59.730
<v Speaker 4>out of a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's less cute.</v>

2730
01:55:59.910 --> 01:56:00.743
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a guy who had a pig the other </v>

2731
01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:03.090
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck were we?</v>

2732
01:56:03.710 --> 01:56:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere here in California.</v>

2733
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Guy had a pig on a leash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

2734
01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:09.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the dog is a dog and a pig and he </v>

2735
01:56:10.551 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 4>had the pig on a leash like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2736
01:56:11.641 --> 01:56:13.440
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't quote me,</v>

2737
01:56:13.441 --> 01:56:16.620
<v Speaker 4>but the intelligence of a pig is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from what I believe,</v>

2738
01:56:16.621 --> 01:56:17.454
<v Speaker 4>I remember they're very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten year old or something human like my </v>

2739
01:56:20.491 --> 01:56:25.491
<v Speaker 4>kid because it's so much smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human mind fucking kid.</v>

2740
01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:28.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's supposed to be intelligent.</v>

2741
01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:30.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there were like a 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>year old,</v>

2742
01:56:30.181 --> 01:56:32.160
<v Speaker 4>but they're supposed to be quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent.</v>

2743
01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.530
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to quantify,</v>

2744
01:56:34.610 --> 01:56:35.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like octopus.</v>

2745
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:37.860
<v Speaker 4>They're just starting to realize how </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent octopus.</v>

2746
01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Of course I eat the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was anxious.</v>

2747
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:41.250
<v Speaker 4>Tuna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tuna,</v>

2748
01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.020
<v Speaker 4>tuna or intelligent apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant.</v>

2749
01:56:43.021 --> 01:56:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2750
01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:45.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well to some,</v>

2751
01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:48.120
<v Speaker 4>I guess wasn't smart enough to stay out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the cans.</v>

2752
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Cans of tuna room soon.</v>

2753
01:56:49.730 --> 01:56:50.320
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

2754
01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are fucking.</v>

2755
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:52.523
<v Speaker 4>The ocean's fisheries are decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we've got basically an expiry </v>

2756
01:56:55.471 --> 01:56:58.620
<v Speaker 4>date of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they said 2014.</v>

2757
01:56:58.670 --> 01:56:59.503
<v Speaker 4>I watched a documentary called end of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the line recently and they basically </v>

2758
01:57:02.341 --> 01:57:03.174
<v Speaker 4>said that 90 percent of the ocean's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fisheries are fucking gone in tune </v>

2759
01:57:05.641 --> 01:57:07.590
<v Speaker 4>especially is really susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 4>extinction.</v>

2760
01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:10.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's just because we just overfish</v>
<v Speaker 4>over fish and the,</v>

2761
01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:13.860
<v Speaker 4>it's the methods that we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean you get these trout,</v>

2762
01:57:13.890 --> 01:57:14.723
<v Speaker 4>you've got these trawlers that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are setting up nets to the size of </v>

2763
01:57:17.101 --> 01:57:19.810
<v Speaker 4>football fields and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>grinding the,</v>

2764
01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:22.110
<v Speaker 4>the ocean floor and it's just decimating</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean.</v>

2765
01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:23.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It ruins the bed,</v>

2766
01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.580
<v Speaker 4>the ecology as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It fucks up coral reefs.</v>

2767
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what?</v>

2768
01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:31.320
<v Speaker 4>What can be done about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've got to leave it alone and</v>

2769
01:57:31.321 --> 01:57:32.430
<v Speaker 4>let these things grow back.</v>

2770
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.830
<v Speaker 4>It all comes down to what you can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your wallet if you don't,</v>

2771
01:57:35.130 --> 01:57:38.010
<v Speaker 4>if you're not spending the money to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a,</v>

2772
01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Nobu and get that,</v>

2773
01:57:40.351 --> 01:57:41.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2774
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:43.840
<v Speaker 4>that piece of Tofu or rather that whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2775
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:46.650
<v Speaker 4>that piece of tuna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

2776
01:57:46.651 --> 01:57:49.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you assume that in some way,</v>

2777
01:57:49.081 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 4>shape or form that that's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's gonna curb this behavior.</v>

2778
01:57:51.241 --> 01:57:52.074
<v Speaker 4>But there's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is also that the ocean is </v>

2779
01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:55.374
<v Speaker 4>not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're in a country in the </v>

2780
01:57:57.361 --> 01:58:00.540
<v Speaker 4>country establishes like bag limits on </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>

2781
01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.850
<v Speaker 4>they can keep the populations very </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>

2782
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:07.260
<v Speaker 4>Precisely do that with an ocean is </v>
<v Speaker 4>governing the oceans very aggressively.</v>

2783
01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:08.123
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were this whole thing in China </v>

2784
01:58:09.361 --> 01:58:11.810
<v Speaker 4>or Japan wouldn't be taking place with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dolphins.</v>

2785
01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:16.820
<v Speaker 4>You want people that are doing it is sea</v>
<v Speaker 4>shepherd and unfortunately a Paul Watson</v>

2786
01:58:17.611 --> 01:58:21.090
<v Speaker 4>is considered a terrorist and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries and can actually set foot on,</v>

2787
01:58:21.150 --> 01:58:22.180
<v Speaker 4>on sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2788
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:25.000
<v Speaker 4>on firm land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2789
01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:26.033
<v Speaker 4>Some countries funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the one that's being like a </v>

2790
01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:28.763
<v Speaker 4>demonized for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for really trying to save the fucking </v>

2791
01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:31.300
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2792
01:58:31.301 --> 01:58:32.134
<v Speaker 4>the one of the things they've done in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan where they've sort of skirted </v>

2793
01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:39.030
<v Speaker 4>around this whale killing thing is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>say that they're doing it for scientific</v>

2794
01:58:39.031 --> 01:58:39.864
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they take these animals on </v>

2795
01:58:41.671 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 4>board and</v>

2796
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 1>they butcher them and they sell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>

2797
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:44.973
<v Speaker 1>but it's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they have to do is like pretend to </v>

2798
01:58:47.441 --> 01:58:51.550
<v Speaker 1>run a few tests and they've documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sea Shepherd has done that.</v>

2799
01:58:51.551 --> 01:58:54.820
<v Speaker 1>They've documented these whalers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it in whale sanctuaries.</v>

2800
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:56.590
<v Speaker 1>They're doing the places where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be done,</v>

2801
01:58:56.591 --> 01:58:58.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's not monitored by anyone except </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sea shepherd.</v>

2802
01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:01.780
<v Speaker 1>End of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother fucking.</v>

2803
01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:02.643
<v Speaker 1>It's not though because this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time ever where people are wildly </v>

2804
01:59:06.461 --> 01:59:09.370
<v Speaker 1>aware of this kind of activity and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is where I credit this show.</v>

2805
01:59:09.371 --> 01:59:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting here before you as a fan,</v>

2806
01:59:11.861 --> 01:59:12.694
<v Speaker 1>first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've illuminated so many issues and </v>

2807
01:59:15.701 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 1>like broadened my spectrum of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness so much I am.</v>

2808
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:21.334
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you I am in the seat of that </v>

2809
01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:27.470
<v Speaker 1>of your millions of listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am that person right now.</v>

2810
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:28.600
<v Speaker 1>St Himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2811
01:59:28.601 --> 01:59:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could be on that fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just happen to do something that,</v>

2812
01:59:31.841 --> 01:59:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2813
01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:34.600
<v Speaker 1>my life circumstances just ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>led me here,</v>

2814
01:59:34.630 --> 01:59:37.010
<v Speaker 1>but I am that guy and I have to extend </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

2815
01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:41.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big thank you for ultimately shaping a</v>

2816
01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:44.380
<v Speaker 1>paradigm that is shifting so God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and so many different levels and so</v>

2817
01:59:44.381 --> 01:59:45.214
<v Speaker 1>many different topics out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And largely what you did started what </v>

2818
01:59:47.261 --> 01:59:48.094
<v Speaker 1>six years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was when you started the </v>

2819
01:59:49.331 --> 01:59:51.080
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2820
01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:55.600
<v Speaker 1>you're the guy who did this so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have done it if it wasn't for</v>

2821
01:59:55.601 --> 01:59:56.950
<v Speaker 1>people like you being on the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2822
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Well all I'm doing is having </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with cool people.</v>

2823
02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It's this whole thing has made itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very bizarre.</v>

2824
02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ass is in some way of making physical</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2827
02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>we're sharing an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>

2828
02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him running up against.</v>

2829
02:00:13.861 --> 02:00:16.010

<v Speaker 1>Be able to grasp radon.</v>

2830
02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't in that one that was old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old seats already mentioned.</v>

2831

<v Speaker 1>These are pretty,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're ergonomic chairs well to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they move well,</v>

2837
02:00:35.081 --> 02:00:35.914
<v Speaker 1>but here's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the only chairs I have ever </v>

2838
02:00:37.631 --> 02:00:38.464
<v Speaker 1>sat in that are comfortable that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit for a three hour podcasts and my </v>

02:00:46.811 --> 02:00:47.644
<v Speaker 1>which is how we're supposed to sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I would sit in like a standard </v>

2842

<v Speaker 1>sat down like it doesn't bother me at </v>

2846
02:01:06.131 --> 02:01:06.521
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2847
02:01:06.521 --> 02:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Full disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was moving in my seat because I'm just</v>

2848
02:01:08.651 --> 02:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>fidgety guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comfortable these ergonomic chairs,</v>

2849
02:01:11.741 --> 02:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the future.</v>

2850
02:01:12.821 --> 02:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>They are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the present there,</v>

2851
02:01:14.341 --> 02:01:14.920
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2852
02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>there is so much better than a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>office chair.</v>

2853
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:18.783
<v Speaker 1>Regular office chairs cause you to sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in as sort of a weird way unless you </v>

2854
02:01:21.790 --> 02:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>consciously like I need to get these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking things to the UFC because when I</v>

2855
02:01:26.261 --> 02:01:31.261
<v Speaker 1>sit and watch the UFC for six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit like a hot chick on instagram.</v>

2856
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Like when they stick their ass out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I sit.</v>

2857
02:01:34.451 --> 02:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I've purposely forced myself to sit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this unnatural way.</v>

2858
02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I had chairs like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just uh,</v>

2859
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ergo depot Holler at me,</v>

2860
02:01:43.461 --> 02:01:48.461
<v Speaker 1>we'll send these bitches over to the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the UFC has um,</v>

2861
02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:49.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use the chairs that are there at </v>

2862
02:01:50.501 --> 02:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the Mandalay bay or mgm or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point is these are the shit.</v>

2863
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:55.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great.</v>

2864
02:01:55.670 --> 02:01:56.503
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything else before we wrap this thing </v>

2865
02:01:57.441 --> 02:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else I could talk for hours,</v>

2866
02:01:59.301 --> 02:02:00.134
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrap it up and let him do anything else </v>

2867
02:02:00.711 --> 02:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>important that we left off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit can.</v>

2868
02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I know you got a whole notebook there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2869
02:02:06.411 --> 02:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>You're like a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have like notes.</v>

2870
02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>It's my process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2871
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:10.063
<v Speaker 1>AG gag laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're familiar with ag gag laws is </v>

2872
02:02:12.110 --> 02:02:12.943
<v Speaker 1>agriculture laws that a factory farming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the perfect example of what we're </v>

2873
02:02:16.461 --> 02:02:17.294
<v Speaker 1>going through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a microcosm of what we're </v>

2874
02:02:17.991 --> 02:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>dealing with.</v>

2875
02:02:18.650 --> 02:02:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Greenland sort of gets creative and sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of creating their own little law,</v>

2876
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>the Ag gag sort of procedures with </v>
<v Speaker 1>existing laws,</v>

2877
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:26.360
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ag gag laws are just a.</v>

2878
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>just an absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fucking horrible thing.</v>

2879
02:02:30.490 --> 02:02:31.323
<v Speaker 1>I mean to to to be able to prosecute and</v>
<v Speaker 1>punish people that are trying to expose </v>

2880
02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>the truth of farming and agriculture </v>
<v Speaker 1>practices.</v>

2881
02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 1>This is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking crazy,</v>

2882
02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2883
02:02:42.710 --> 02:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Well what they're doing is if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a video,</v>

2884
02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>like a cell phone video or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2885
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:50.623
<v Speaker 1>and you film pigs in captivity or </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens or anything in agriculture </v>

2886
02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:59.510
<v Speaker 1>where they have factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get sued and you can go to jail.</v>

2887
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.823
<v Speaker 1>Like you can go to jail for exposing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that makes people sick and a </v>

2888
02:03:03.801 --> 02:03:06.170
<v Speaker 1>reality of business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're buying something.</v>

2889
02:03:06.171 --> 02:03:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I'm buying a chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I find out,</v>

2890
02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.473
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can no longer be detached from this </v>

2891
02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:14.594
<v Speaker 1>process because now I know exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>this chicken left and I feel horrible </v>

2892
02:03:17.241 --> 02:03:17.900
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2893
02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:18.733
<v Speaker 1>I've been educated and so that company </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to change its practices because I </v>

2894
02:03:22.221 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>don't want to buy chickens from them </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and if some people do,</v>

2895
02:03:24.591 --> 02:03:28.850
<v Speaker 1>that's fine with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to stop people from filming that and</v>

2896
02:03:28.851 --> 02:03:32.390
<v Speaker 1>showing you what you're trying to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the dark or misleading people,</v>

2897
02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:33.290
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2898
02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 1>you're hiding facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hiding truth.</v>

2899
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:41.390
<v Speaker 1>That's not cool and this is exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with in reality.</v>

2900
02:03:41.391 --> 02:03:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same fucking thing.</v>

2901
02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2902
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:45.260
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is exactly the same thing.</v>

2903
02:03:45.710 --> 02:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Hiding truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding reality and,</v>

2904
02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:48.793
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to keep people from being </v>

2905
02:03:50.690 --> 02:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>aware of what's essentially torture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2906
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I buy as little meat as possible and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>

2907
02:03:59.750 --> 02:04:00.583
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy any eggs from anyway unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a restaurant or something like </v>

2908
02:04:02.511 --> 02:04:03.261
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For your own chickens.</v>

2909
02:04:03.261 --> 02:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I have my own chickens and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like,</v>

2910
02:04:06.410 --> 02:04:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good feeling.</v>

2911
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I my chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>

2912
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:11.263
<v Speaker 1>they come to me like I come out to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I bring food and like what's up </v>

2913
02:04:13.971 --> 02:04:14.804
<v Speaker 1>kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey girls and I put the plate down </v>

2914
02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:17.390
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not scared of me.</v>

2915
02:04:17.391 --> 02:04:20.240
<v Speaker 1>They run over and they lay eggs and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the eggs.</v>

2916
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they pick on me when I tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to steal their eggs but like reach under</v>

2917
02:04:23.811 --> 02:04:27.560
<v Speaker 1>them to take him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they barely know me.</v>

2918
02:04:27.561 --> 02:04:28.580
<v Speaker 1>That could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take them,</v>

2919
02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:29.653
<v Speaker 1>but my point is it's like I enjoy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and I know that not </v>

2920
02:04:32.661 --> 02:04:34.490
<v Speaker 1>everybody can have that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

2921
02:04:34.491 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>but that is what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want eggs,</v>

2922
02:04:38.191 --> 02:04:39.024
<v Speaker 1>like Peta has these really ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns against chickens and against </v>

2923
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:43.703
<v Speaker 1>eggs where they call it a chicken period</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a frying pan on their </v>

2924
02:04:47.971 --> 02:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>website with a pair of panties that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2925
02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>a fucking bloody spot on the panties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're frying the period.</v>

2926
02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen any Jamie?</v>

2927
02:04:57.810 --> 02:05:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Periods tasted as good as eggs.</v>

2928
02:05:00.061 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there'd be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is.</v>

2929
02:05:01.831 --> 02:05:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't do something with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2930
02:05:05.190 --> 02:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>How dare you take a penny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>

2931
02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.630
<v Speaker 1>How dare you keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2932
02:05:11.490 --> 02:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>the problem is captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not eggs.</v>

2933
02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Joel Salitan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a really fascinating guy.</v>

2934
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I had him on my podcast and he's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate of,</v>

2935
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:21.200
<v Speaker 1>of what you would call natural farming </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

2936
02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:22.613
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2937
02:05:22.710 --> 02:05:25.560
<v Speaker 1>has pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he does is he puts this enormous,</v>

2938
02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical fence up and the pigs,</v>

2939
02:05:28.741 --> 02:05:30.200
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to go near the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of,</v>

2940
02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zaps them so they don't pass it.</v>

2941
02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And then they moved the fence so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to graze and new property.</v>

2942
02:05:37.861 --> 02:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>So they're eating acorns and roots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all natural things that pigs eat.</v>

2943
02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:44.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's what he does with these pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with chickens.</v>

2944
02:05:44.041 --> 02:05:47.220
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has these enormous chicken houses and</v>

2945
02:05:47.221 --> 02:05:50.340
<v Speaker 1>they roll them to new environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on his farm,</v>

2946
02:05:50.341 --> 02:05:51.840
<v Speaker 1>this chicken house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2947
02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2948
02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:56.730
<v Speaker 1>the Hen House has rollers on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll move it to a new area.</v>

2949
02:05:56.731 --> 02:05:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And the chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my chickens,</v>

2950
02:05:58.351 --> 02:05:59.184
<v Speaker 1>I opened the gates and my chickens run </v>
<v Speaker 1>around my yard and then they go back in </v>

2951
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:04.140
<v Speaker 1>the hen house at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what they do,</v>

2952
02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 1>they so stimulating for them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a new environment all the time.</v>

2953
02:06:06.690 --> 02:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're free.</v>

2954
02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:08.693
<v Speaker 1>They're literally free and when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs from those kinds of chickens or a </v>

2955
02:06:11.131 --> 02:06:13.440
<v Speaker 1>dark orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really dark,</v>

2956
02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:14.753
<v Speaker 1>deep orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because it's much healthier </v>

2957
02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:21.090
<v Speaker 1>than when you see something that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>like vegetarian fed chickens.</v>

2958
02:06:21.450 --> 02:06:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chickens aren't vegetarians.</v>

2959
02:06:23.850 --> 02:06:24.683
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fed my chickens a mouse once and </v>

2960
02:06:27.601 --> 02:06:30.180
<v Speaker 1>here's another example of like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of animals.</v>

2961
02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:31.013
<v Speaker 1>We love animals we don't love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting how this </v>

2962
02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:37.170
<v Speaker 1>happened in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids found a hawk.</v>

2963
02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:41.640
<v Speaker 1>The Hawk slammed into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a window or something.</v>

2964
02:06:41.690 --> 02:06:42.523
<v Speaker 1>Not sure we weren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we found this wounded Hawk so my </v>

2965
02:06:45.181 --> 02:06:50.181
<v Speaker 1>kids decided that we were going to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take this hawk and get it</v>

2966
02:06:50.671 --> 02:06:51.504
<v Speaker 1>to a wildlife rescue organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had to feed it because it was </v>

2967
02:06:54.481 --> 02:06:57.510
<v Speaker 1>over the weekend and the rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization wasn't open,</v>

2968
02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:00.720
<v Speaker 1>so they went to the pet store and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the called Pinkies,</v>

2969
02:07:00.721 --> 02:07:02.470
<v Speaker 1>which are these little tiny mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2970
02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:03.473
<v Speaker 1>For the people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mice that haven't their baby mice </v>

2971
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:08.670
<v Speaker 1>and they use them to feed snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>

2972
02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.653
<v Speaker 1>and so they fed the hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pinkies and there was one pinky </v>

2973
02:07:12.961 --> 02:07:16.800
<v Speaker 1>left and they got the hock to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife rescue organization.</v>

2974
02:07:16.801 --> 02:07:17.634
<v Speaker 1>The Hawk was taken care of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and hopefully was released </v>

2975
02:07:19.801 --> 02:07:22.470
<v Speaker 1>into the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had one pinky leftover.</v>

2976
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:24.240
<v Speaker 1>My daughter wanted to raise it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2977
02:07:24.241 --> 02:07:26.100
<v Speaker 1>sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to die.</v>

2978
02:07:26.190 --> 02:07:28.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to eat milk.</v>

2979
02:07:28.081 --> 02:07:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's only been alive for a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to last.</v>

2980
02:07:30.721 --> 02:07:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed it's still alive and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying and I said,</v>

2981
02:07:33.721 --> 02:07:36.640
<v Speaker 1>but we just fed them to the hawks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand this?</v>

2982
02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one of two things we should do.</v>

2983
02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:40.053
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should either bring it back to the </v>

2984
02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 1>pet store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2985
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2986
02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:46.350
<v Speaker 1>if we don't bring it back to the pet </v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

2987
02:07:46.351 --> 02:07:48.310
<v Speaker 1>it's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We bring them back to the pet store,</v>

2988
02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:49.173
<v Speaker 1>the pets pet store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the mouse will accept </v>

2989
02:07:52.691 --> 02:07:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that we've got our scent on it.</v>

2990
02:07:54.311 --> 02:07:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to feed it to a snake.</v>

2991
02:07:57.550 --> 02:07:58.830
<v Speaker 1>There's going to resell that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's gonna,</v>

2992
02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:02.680
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna buy it or it might die </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it hasn't eaten in 24 hours.</v>

2993
02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:03.573
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our other option is we give it to </v>

2994
02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:09.670
<v Speaker 1>the chickens and they're crying and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at this point had you known that the</v>

2995
02:08:09.671 --> 02:08:13.110
<v Speaker 1>chicken was likely to eat this thing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them eat a mouse before.</v>

2996
02:08:13.130 --> 02:08:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking ruthless,</v>

2997
02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:20.050
<v Speaker 1>ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I put that mouse down.</v>

2998
02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:20.913
<v Speaker 1>It was not down on the ground for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking half a second when one chicken </v>

2999
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:26.134
<v Speaker 1>slammed it grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it in his beak and the other </v>

3000
02:08:28.271 --> 02:08:30.210
<v Speaker 1>chickens were chasing this chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the cit.</v>

3001
02:08:30.250 --> 02:08:34.570
<v Speaker 1>The Hen house like this chicken couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause to try to eat this because all the</v>

3002
02:08:34.571 --> 02:08:37.180
<v Speaker 1>other chickens knew what had had and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were running around.</v>

3003
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:38.620
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't stop.</v>

3004
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:39.483
<v Speaker 1>It was running and it's trying to eat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other chickens are running with </v>

3005
02:08:42.071 --> 02:08:43.720
<v Speaker 1>it and it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've filmed it.</v>

3006
02:08:43.721 --> 02:08:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea to.</v>

3007
02:08:45.010 --> 02:08:45.843
<v Speaker 1>They're monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are with each other and they like </v>

3008
02:08:48.281 --> 02:08:50.520
<v Speaker 1>to pick the shit out of each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they pack everything.</v>

3009
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:51.403
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They picked my daughter a couple of </v>

3010
02:08:52.801 --> 02:08:55.900
<v Speaker 1>times and one time I almost killed one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them because it packed her face.</v>

3011
02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife is like,</v>

3012
02:08:58.091 --> 02:08:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3013
02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:00.220
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3014
02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:02.980
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to eat her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just can't.</v>

3015
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to get this in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he doesn't know.</v>

3016
02:09:06.070 --> 02:09:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It knows she's alive and it's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking eat eater.</v>

3017
02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And if we held her down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those chickens would eat her.</v>

3018
02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:12.130
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

3019
02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get crazy with this.</v>

3020
02:09:13.691 --> 02:09:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now.</v>

3021
02:09:15.311 --> 02:09:17.680
<v Speaker 1>They are fucking dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are cold blooded.</v>

3022
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:18.643
<v Speaker 1>There they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the fucking brain of a pencil </v>

3023
02:09:20.531 --> 02:09:21.460
<v Speaker 1>eraser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3024
02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Little tiny on the tip of your pencil.</v>

3025
02:09:23.650 --> 02:09:25.680
<v Speaker 1>That's how big their fucking brain is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk.</v>

3026
02:09:25.681 --> 02:09:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

3027
02:09:26.410 --> 02:09:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll eat everything.</v>

3028
02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:28.983
<v Speaker 1>They follow my wife around like she'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>like lift up rocks and they dive under </v>

3029
02:09:31.571 --> 02:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>the rock to try to get worms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's there,</v>

3030
02:09:33.810 --> 02:09:35.050
<v Speaker 1>the little predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3031
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:36.103
<v Speaker 1>are straight up predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see you like vegetarian fed </v>

3032
02:09:39.670 --> 02:09:40.503
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are good eggs and not doing any </v>

3033
02:09:41.621 --> 02:09:43.240
<v Speaker 1>service to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're omnivores,</v>

3034
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:44.103
<v Speaker 1>they're omnivores and they would eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat all day long above grass if you </v>

3035
02:09:47.861 --> 02:09:48.694
<v Speaker 1>gave it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like that more like my lawn is </v>

3036
02:09:50.741 --> 02:09:51.574
<v Speaker 1>filled with grass and they pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grass and they eat all kinds of other </v>

3037
02:09:53.411 --> 02:09:54.244
<v Speaker 1>stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they eat the chicken food that we </v>

3038
02:09:55.601 --> 02:09:56.434
<v Speaker 1>bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tried to buy the most nutritious </v>

3039
02:09:57.581 --> 02:09:58.414
<v Speaker 1>chicken food available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some brands that are like more </v>

3040
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:02.410
<v Speaker 1>more diverse and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3041
02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:04.450
<v Speaker 1>the food and the nutrients that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3042
02:10:04.690 --> 02:10:07.360
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is they abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

3043
02:10:07.361 --> 02:10:10.000
<v Speaker 1>When they see something live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd try to eat living things.</v>

3044
02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:10.923
<v Speaker 1>That's what they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing we got to be scared of </v>

3045
02:10:11.771 --> 02:10:13.630
<v Speaker 1>most is chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get big,</v>

3046
02:10:13.690 --> 02:10:14.630
<v Speaker 1>which is lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little.</v>

3047
02:10:14.770 --> 02:10:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you ever heard of terror?</v>

3048
02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Birds like to tell people that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3049
02:10:17.381 --> 02:10:18.214
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't think that that cat </v>

3050
02:10:18.881 --> 02:10:19.714
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't fucking eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was just a significantly larger </v>

3051
02:10:21.101 --> 02:10:22.600
<v Speaker 1>believe you'd have a different respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3052
02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:23.503
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a the ammo and the idea that eating </v>

3053
02:10:25.331 --> 02:10:26.200
<v Speaker 1>meat is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3054
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:27.410
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

3055
02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:28.533
<v Speaker 1>Like a large mouth bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your swimming pool big enough for large </v>

3056
02:10:29.911 --> 02:10:30.744
<v Speaker 1>mouth bass teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're done like a group or have you </v>

3057
02:10:32.171 --> 02:10:35.120
<v Speaker 1>ever seen those groupers and Florida?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would eat a baby.</v>

3058
02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:38.360
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent gay babies floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around group would come up.</v>

3059
02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:40.970
<v Speaker 1>There was a nutty video of a group or </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating a shark.</v>

3060
02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

3061
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shark was like Three v swallowed it.</v>

3062
02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Just put her into jumper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mammoth fucking animal.</v>

3063
02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like a giant large mouth bass from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit movie.</v>

3064
02:10:52.551 --> 02:10:54.080
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even seem real.</v>

3065
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.333
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's hundreds and hundreds </v>

3066
02:10:56.931 --> 02:10:58.310
<v Speaker 1>of pounds that massively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

3067
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

3068
02:11:00.230 --> 02:11:01.063
<v Speaker 1>they caught a shark and they put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera in the water to film this group </v>

3069
02:11:04.521 --> 02:11:05.354
<v Speaker 1>or that's coming up to the shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have a small shark on the hook </v>

3070
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:09.763
<v Speaker 1>and as they're reeling it in and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing it in and they see this video </v>

3071
02:11:13.401 --> 02:11:15.740
<v Speaker 1>could use some editing and as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>reeling it in,</v>

3072
02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:18.070
<v Speaker 1>they've got this shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a small shark,</v>

3073
02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:20.660
<v Speaker 1>it's about three feet long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more.</v>

3074
02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:21.493
<v Speaker 1>I might even be four feet and this group</v>
<v Speaker 1>or comes along and some mashes it as </v>

3075
02:11:25.521 --> 02:11:26.990
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

3076
02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom says great.</v>

3077
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean that group has got to be two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 pounds.</v>

3078
02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.613
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would assume they get to be like </v>

3079
02:11:36.651 --> 02:11:38.750
<v Speaker 1>three or 400 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big your group is,</v>

3080
02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now let's.</v>

3081
02:11:40.171 --> 02:11:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's end this with groupers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those they taste good though.</v>

3082
02:11:44.050 --> 02:11:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever have a grouper sandwich?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3083
02:11:45.561 --> 02:11:46.394

<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

3088
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I know it's definitely the case with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

3103
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Eight feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine Shaquille o'neal.</v>

3104

<v Speaker 1>A foot bigger than him is a grouper.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's hoping that the group or like </v>

3110
02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:55.160
<v Speaker 1>taking chunks out of that guy and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves a little for him.</v>

3111
02:12:56.150 --> 02:12:57.810
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean is awesome.</v>

3112
02:12:58.190 --> 02:12:59.950
<v Speaker 1>The ocean is so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deep Ocean.</v>

3113
02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:02.510
<v Speaker 1>The more you learn about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see in Japan that massive.</v>

3114
02:13:02.511 --> 02:13:04.270
<v Speaker 1>A massive squid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3115
02:13:04.271 --> 02:13:05.510
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The swimming.</v>

3116
02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to swim anywhere near that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

3117
02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:09.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an evil Predator right there.</v>

3118
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:11.030
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know when it gets stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those tentacles.</v>

3119
02:13:11.150 --> 02:13:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are really evil and they're so big.</v>

3120
02:13:13.670 --> 02:13:14.503
<v Speaker 1>They're the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really nuts is that giant squid </v>

3121
02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:16.934
<v Speaker 1>were just a myth and a couple of decades</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago they had no idea if they were real </v>

3122
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:21.583
<v Speaker 1>like they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had never caught one of these </v>

3123
02:13:22.731 --> 02:13:24.380
<v Speaker 1>things on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they have one.</v>

3124
02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It looked like it was in a base </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere because it was really close to</v>

3125
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:28.183
<v Speaker 1>boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy to look to allowing people </v>

3126
02:13:29.871 --> 02:13:32.400
<v Speaker 1>to swim in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they never caught one before.</v>

3127
02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't know if they were real </v>
<v Speaker 1>then catching them.</v>

3128
02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:36.503
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't swim with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to have a catching them so </v>

3129
02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:41.100
<v Speaker 1>because they're catching them much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently now.</v>

3130
02:13:41.190 --> 02:13:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Like look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the video of it.</v>

3131
02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.610
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an amazing,</v>

3132
02:13:44.611 --> 02:13:47.730
<v Speaker 1>amazing creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire body flexible.</v>

3133
02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but a beak like as far as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing that's hard.</v>

3134
02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found evidence really recently of a</v>

3135
02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:58.260
<v Speaker 1>gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

3136
02:13:58.290 --> 02:13:59.123
<v Speaker 1>some sort of octopus type species that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like a cracking their thinking </v>

3137
02:14:02.971 --> 02:14:03.804
<v Speaker 1>by the size of the tentacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing would be 100 feet long and </v>

3138
02:14:06.751 --> 02:14:08.840
<v Speaker 1>they found these enormous tentacles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

3139
02:14:08.841 --> 02:14:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner plates and they're,</v>

3140
02:14:10.551 --> 02:14:11.430
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3141
02:14:11.431 --> 02:14:14.610
<v Speaker 1>well this is what the myths of the crack</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've always been.</v>

3142
02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:15.713
<v Speaker 1>The crack was always this gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>tentacled monster that would eat </v>

3143
02:14:18.511 --> 02:14:20.750
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that fucking well,</v>

3144
02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:22.860
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to perspective when you see it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a person,</v>

3145
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you get a real good idea of how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how enormous it is.</v>

3146
02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:28.470
<v Speaker 1>But I think that thing is like 18 feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>long or something crazy.</v>

3147
02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:29.903
<v Speaker 1>But these crackings the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing left of them when they </v>

3148
02:14:32.761 --> 02:14:33.594
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they found is a fossilized </v>

3149
02:14:35.161 --> 02:14:39.560
<v Speaker 1>remains of the tentacles had dot when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they went into died,</v>

3150
02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:41.940
<v Speaker 1>the tentacles had left an imprint on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

3151
02:14:41.941 --> 02:14:42.774
<v Speaker 1>on the bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the got the fossilized </v>

3152
02:14:45.241 --> 02:14:46.620
<v Speaker 1>remains of these tentacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3153
02:14:46.621 --> 02:14:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they realized,</v>

3154
02:14:49.281 --> 02:14:49.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3155
02:14:49.711 --> 02:14:51.780
<v Speaker 1>well this is where these myths come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

3156
02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:53.400
<v Speaker 1>This was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real creature.</v>

3157
02:14:53.401 --> 02:14:58.401
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how little we know in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what the deep ocean and has available</v>

3158
02:14:58.411 --> 02:14:59.470
<v Speaker 1>to it in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3159
02:14:59.850 --> 02:15:00.683
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3160
02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:01.410
<v Speaker 1>animal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3161
02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're discovering stuff every day.</v>

3162
02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:03.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say we know more about the moon </v>

3163
02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:06.150
<v Speaker 1>than we know about the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3164
02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:07.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3165
02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:08.453
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent of the earth or </v>

3166
02:15:09.331 --> 02:15:10.164
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3167
02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:11.393
<v Speaker 1>Something percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some giant percentage of the earth is </v>

3168
02:15:12.991 --> 02:15:13.824
<v Speaker 1>water and the ocean floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've only examined like five </v>

3169
02:15:16.771 --> 02:15:18.760
<v Speaker 1>percent of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing.</v>

3170
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So 95 percent of this incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially wild world.</v>

3171
02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Meaning it is a wild world and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately comes from the ocean.</v>

3172
02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:31.740
<v Speaker 1>The ocean is what gives us life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we have to respect.</v>

3173
02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly it all came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3174
02:15:33.271 --> 02:15:36.480
<v Speaker 1>We all started off somehow or another as</v>
<v Speaker 1>some little fucking fish thing.</v>

3175
02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch more cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

3176
02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't get enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3177
02:15:39.991 --> 02:15:42.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad they brought that back with.</v>
