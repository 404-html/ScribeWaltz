00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Joshua,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for being here,</v>

4
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

5
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>you're huff post show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it many,</v>

8
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:26.861
<v Speaker 1>many times and we were just discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the excellent recent one that you did </v>

9
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>with Mark Marin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really loved,</v>

10
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>but I had him on Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to know you because of the,</v>

11
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>how should we say this canceled core </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baer report thing.</v>

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.270
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ill advised a jump at racism or the</v>

14
00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>idea of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Someone that's comedy central tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that Kobe had said out of </v>

16
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of context.</v>

17
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And it was taken up as being a racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>quip by an Internet activist.</v>

18
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>And I had not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really familiar with her.</v>

19
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:05.081
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard of or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had her on huff post live briefly </v>

20
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't like the fact that I was a </v>

21
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.781
<v Speaker 1>white man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I got myself into all kinds of </v>

22
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:10.781
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

23
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll just explain exploded into one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those twitter storms.</v>

24
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:15.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was partly the </v>

25
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:15.911
<v Speaker 1>precipitating event that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually forced cold beer to address it.</v>

26
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>He did a whole segment on his show about</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and about the whole twitter storm on</v>

27
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:25.301
<v Speaker 1>Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really kind of got traction when </v>

28
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:27.881
<v Speaker 1>I had her on huff post live on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the Friday morning and </v>

29
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:27.881
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

30
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say what the joke was so that </v>

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>people know because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really unbelievably ridiculous.</v>

32
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>It was unfortunate because if she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen the actual joke in context,</v>

33
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>it would not have been offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

34
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:47.741
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she just takes umbrage at </v>

35
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:47.741
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but figure biggest she likes to.</v>

36
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:52.031
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a type of twitter reaction </v>

37
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:52.031
<v Speaker 1>that is just a project predictable knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerk.</v>

38
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a choice to take things out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

39
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it would've been almost</v>

40
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>impossible if she'd actually seen the </v>
<v Speaker 1>full clip.</v>

41
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Like she would have had to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting line wanting to launch,</v>

42
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

43
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't go after them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>

44
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>what the context was that he's willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show the Asian community how much I </v>

45
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:17.771
<v Speaker 1>care by introducing the Ching Chong Ding</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dong Foundation for sensitivity to </v>

46
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>orientals or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was meant to be a,</v>

47
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>it was a satire of the Washington </v>
<v Speaker 1>redskins original Americans Foundation.</v>

48
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>So they come up with this original </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans Foundation.</v>

49
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>So Dan Snyder was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was trying to say,</v>

50
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:33.490
<v Speaker 1>instead of changing the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>redskins a,</v>

51
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give money to like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>African American charity.</v>

52
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

53
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 1>native American charity and call bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>satirized the redskins by saying because</v>

54
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 1>he had been accused of doing some anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian things in the past like bits where</v>

55
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>he just kind of impersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an Asian or something.</v>

56
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>So he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

58
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make that right by setting up this Chin </v>

59
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Chung Ding Dong charity for orientals or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

60
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the gag rose.</v>

61
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>The Gag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

63
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>his thing is character.</v>

64
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>core Cole bear is a,</v>

65
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 3>it's like an archie bunker of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

66
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a real guy.</v>

67
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 3>This is a role that he plays a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>

68
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.230
<v Speaker 3>ignorant Republican and that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

69
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the satire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to miss that and to do this cancel </v>

70
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 3>core bear thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colbert,</v>

71
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 3>same as name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong every time,</v>

72
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 3>but I never say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch it.</v>

73
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to do that it just,</v>

74
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:31.111
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it highlights in the support that he </v>

75
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.211
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the social justice warriors or the </v>

76
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 3>support that she got rather than this by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social justice warriors on this was.</v>

77
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 3>It was so maddening.</v>

78
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.520
<v Speaker 4>People who should know better joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shouldn't fight.</v>

79
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.950
<v Speaker 4>I had people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had twitter hate campaigns coming at </v>

80
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.461
<v Speaker 4>me from left right and center from like </v>
<v Speaker 4>from black comics who I had known like </v>

81
00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:51.411
<v Speaker 4>who should know better because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>comics that it's baffling to me when </v>

82
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:57.141
<v Speaker 4>people engage with one another purely on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the basis of their identity and not on </v>

83
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.150
<v Speaker 4>the basis of the actual intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>point at hand,</v>

84
00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:02.460
<v Speaker 4>like weird does set high go too far or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

85
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Like I was just roundly prevented from </v>
<v Speaker 4>having any opinion about what satire is </v>

86
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:09.900
<v Speaker 4>on the basis of the fact that I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 4>white man.</v>

87
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to check your privilege son.</v>

88
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Speaker 4>Check your privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you check it?</v>

89
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 4>I didn't check it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Check it happen.</v>

90
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I need to check my privilege APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never know what I would sell that is </v>

91
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.630
<v Speaker 4>to create an app where you can just </v>
<v Speaker 4>click on it and gives you a score from </v>

92
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 4>one to 10 about what your privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

93
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.660
<v Speaker 4>it's an interesting thing</v>

94
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.660
<v Speaker 3>because it it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It immediately allow someone to </v>

95
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.611
<v Speaker 3>marginalize your opinion by virtue of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you are European or in </v>

96
00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:39.171
<v Speaker 3>your case Australian or whatever your </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever your roots are like you can </v>

97
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:40.260
<v Speaker 3>instantly discount</v>

98
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 4>any credible point that you might have </v>
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>

99
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Just to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people who haven't seen the way that</v>

100
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.110
<v Speaker 4>the interview with this Hashtag activist</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter person went,</v>

101
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.160
<v Speaker 4>I was basically she was buying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She basically literally said that I.</v>

102
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 4>my opinion is completely worthless </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I as a white man,</v>

103
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I would not be expected to understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lived experience of women of color.</v>

104
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Now she's a 23 year old Korean American </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle class.</v>

105
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:08.490
<v Speaker 4>It was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know what,</v>

106
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.480
<v Speaker 4>but what's incredible to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the struggle is real.</v>

107
00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 4>Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's incredible to me is that,</v>

108
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you meet somebody and you just get </v>

109
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 4>a real sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

110
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.940
<v Speaker 4>this person is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're original or authentic,</v>

111
00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 4>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person is a,</v>

112
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 4>is a snowflake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>

113
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a fingerprint.</v>

114
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:31.610
<v Speaker 4>They're like something unique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we should all be hoping for.</v>

115
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:36.611
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we should all be hoping to engage </v>

116
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:38.351
<v Speaker 4>with one another on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on levels that enable us to bring that </v>

117
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:40.340
<v Speaker 4>out in each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was the exact opposite of that.</v>

118
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Like it was basically an identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to another identity.</v>

119
00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:46.370
<v Speaker 4>It was a generic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a label talking to a label.</v>

120
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an issue with this.</v>

121
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 3>This need to correct people that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>define yourself by correcting people </v>

122
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.140
<v Speaker 3>that I think people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking for people to step out </v>

123
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.861
<v Speaker 3>of line so they can check them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of looking at this subtle </v>

124
00:06:05.861 --> 00:06:09.510
<v Speaker 3>nuanced life that we live where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

125
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different variables when</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes to human interaction and </v>

126
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.590
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much when you.</v>

127
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 3>You're throwing in satire as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a satire television show.</v>

128
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.110
<v Speaker 3>The fact that this is an all put through</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a observational filter </v>

129
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.460
<v Speaker 3>before you immediately knee jerk react </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and,</v>

130
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.470
<v Speaker 3>and attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just shows that there's a real issue </v>

131
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 3>with the ability to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ability to communicate is a </v>

132
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 3>wonderful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that we all have it,</v>

133
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do your show.</v>

134
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I can do my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can all tweet,</v>

135
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:41.231
<v Speaker 3>anybody can tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody can go crazy and just write </v>

136
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:41.231
<v Speaker 3>whatever they want on their blog.</v>

137
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It a lot of ways,</v>

138
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's also ridiculous because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who have not considered that they do </v>

139
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 3>possess the English language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the ability to communicate,</v>

140
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 3>but what they're essentially doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just piecing together what they think is</v>

141
00:06:55.671 --> 00:07:00.671
<v Speaker 3>like an argument based on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>predetermined patterns that they've </v>

142
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:01.200
<v Speaker 3>picked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

143
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you as a white male wouldn't </v>

144
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 3>understand a woman of color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What fucking color you.</v>

145
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

146
00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how your white.</v>

147
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're Asian,</v>

148
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 3>but I mean when you're talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>color of your skin,</v>

149
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 3>you can't say color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't.</v>

150
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 3>You might want to say ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might want to say,</v>

151
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:17.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

152
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

153
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>

154
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 4>let me clarify that there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I completely concede that there is a </v>

155
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 4>lived experience of being a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a minority ethnicity,</v>

156
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.710
<v Speaker 4>especially in America or in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new countries that is different from </v>

157
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 4>being a white man and I'm rushed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely concede that.</v>

158
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Speaker 4>The thing is why can't we talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual details of the experience without</v>

159
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 4>assuming that there's a homogeneity </v>
<v Speaker 4>between that experience as well.</v>

160
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 4>Like not every Asian experience in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America is the same.</v>

161
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.250
<v Speaker 4>They have certain commonalities in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're subject to racism in a way that </v>

162
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 4>you and I aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they are so wildly different.</v>

163
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about the details of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and what's acceptable and how</v>

164
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.881
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we want to converse with one </v>

165
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:08.531
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's not assume that because a person </v>

166
00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 4>has a particular set bunch of labels </v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to them,</v>

167
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 4>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight,</v>

168
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>white man,</v>

169
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

170
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:17.141
<v Speaker 4>that that immediately disqualifies them </v>
<v Speaker 4>from having a conversation about these </v>

171
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:17.141
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

172
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:17.710
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also</v>

173
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.810
<v Speaker 3>this idea of check your privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is just discounting </v>

174
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.770
<v Speaker 3>someone's opinion immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

175
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 3>you're using it as a tool and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lazy tool.</v>

176
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a lazy tool to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that you want to </v>

177
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Speaker 3>just be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check your privilege.</v>

178
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.951
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You basically want to say shut the fuck </v>

179
00:08:35.951 --> 00:08:37.361
<v Speaker 3>up because you don't have the time to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through all the things that are wrong </v>

180
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:40.451
<v Speaker 3>with their arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are other people like </v>

181
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:40.451
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a very complex dude.</v>

182
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 3>You talk very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're very well spoken,</v>

183
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 3>you're very measured and the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

184
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 3>I've watched your show many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

185
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 3>You're not a knee jerk reactionary guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not an asshole.</v>

186
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.850
<v Speaker 3>So for someone to say that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just shows that this is something </v>

187
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 3>that just gets used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just gets thrown out there like,</v>

188
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 3>here's a weapon that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in the middle of a conversation.</v>

189
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Instead of having this dialogue where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're considering each other's points of</v>

190
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.950
<v Speaker 3>view and different lives that we've led,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just boom,</v>

191
00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 3>throw the snow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke bomb on the ground,</v>

192
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 3>check your privilege.</v>

193
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also,</v>

194
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.730
<v Speaker 4>it's the easiest way to lose</v>

195
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.880
<v Speaker 3>good friends too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like privileged checker APP.</v>

196
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.590
<v Speaker 4>It exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It exists.</v>

197
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.230
<v Speaker 4>That's the need to check it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

198
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to download it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll download it and check my privilege.</v>

199
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.520
<v Speaker 4>It's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the clearest way to,</v>

200
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.570
<v Speaker 4>to lose allies in the fight against </v>
<v Speaker 4>racism as well for these self appointed </v>

201
00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:35.450
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

202
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.900
<v Speaker 4>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who do these kinds of twitter campaigns </v>

203
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.901
<v Speaker 4>and online stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the WHO's who the check your </v>

204
00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:43.901
<v Speaker 4>privilege brigade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

205
00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I am the most obvious ally for </v>
<v Speaker 4>antiracist.</v>

206
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.940
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like the least racist guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be.</v>

207
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
<v Speaker 4>I should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be a no brainer for me to </v>

208
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.000
<v Speaker 4>release racist non,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the less racist guy,</v>

209
00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.260
<v Speaker 4>the second least racist guy won the race</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's made me what I have to keep </v>

210
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:06.191
<v Speaker 4>reminding myself is this the self </v>
<v Speaker 4>appointed spokespeople who uh,</v>

211
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:12.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for race like this person then not the </v>

212
00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:14.420
<v Speaker 4>people who I need to be defending when </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

213
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.310
<v Speaker 4>when I'm trying to defend minorities.</v>

214
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.570
<v Speaker 4>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are,</v>

215
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.810
<v Speaker 4>they are doing active harm to the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the poor black working mom doesn't </v>

216
00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 4>have time to get angry on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I should be defending her.</v>

217
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.170
<v Speaker 4>Not a 23 year old Korean American Middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>Classico who's making me,</v>

218
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.800
<v Speaker 4>who's basically alienating me and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the likeminded people from the </v>

219
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 4>legitimate worthwhile pursuit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting racism because it makes me feel</v>

220
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:43.070
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

221
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:45.740
<v Speaker 4>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to be rejected out of hand,</v>

222
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.810
<v Speaker 4>regardless of what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simply on the basis of the fact that I'm</v>

223
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:48.740
<v Speaker 4>a white man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

224
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.670
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

225
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.540
<v Speaker 4>You've just lost an ally.</v>

226
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is true.</v>

227
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

228
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 3>and another good point is when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>23,</v>

229
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 3>fuck look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's probably smarter than me.</v>

230
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.100
<v Speaker 3>When I was 23,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was retarded when I was 23.</v>

231
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I was really fucking dumb and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just something I'm willing to concede.</v>

232
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had a video of me explaining my </v>

233
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 3>position on anything at 23,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 47,</v>

234
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I would have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

235
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

236
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't know anything</v>

237
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.500
<v Speaker 4>and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have some.</v>

238
00:11:20.501 --> 00:11:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I have a certain level of empathy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

239
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that girl.</v>

240
00:11:24.191 --> 00:11:25.420
<v Speaker 4>So this really isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

241
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:30.421
<v Speaker 4>that whole affair was much less about </v>
<v Speaker 4>her than about the easy way in which </v>

242
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.470
<v Speaker 4>people jump onto jingoistic bandwagons </v>
<v Speaker 4>about things</v>

243
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 3>and also that they demand cancellation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They demand people getting fired</v>

244
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 4>censorious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's so dictatorial.</v>

245
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:46.611
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so antithetical to everything that </v>

246
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 4>we should value about the kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>great rumbling dialogue of debate.</v>

247
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

248
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:49.590
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first amendment.</v>

249
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.250
<v Speaker 4>One of the great things about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country is a whole bunch of crazy people</v>

250
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 4>shouting at each other</v>

251
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the best idea wins in the end.</v>

252
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't shut people down without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>

253
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they respond.</v>

254
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic to someone who's been </v>

255
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>bullied and they look at marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

256
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a certain races or genders </v>
<v Speaker 1>or sexual orientation,</v>

257
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:18.631
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately stand up for those </v>

258
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:18.631
<v Speaker 1>people because they think those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been bullied and marginalized.</v>

259
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:23.370
<v Speaker 1>But in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they often resort to the very same </v>

260
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>tactics that are often used against </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that are marginalized.</v>

261
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:30.451
<v Speaker 1>They become bullies and they rally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops and that's why this term social </v>

262
00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior is so apt because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking.</v>

263
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.400
<v Speaker 1>This is like this aggressive campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a campaign of psychedelic love </v>

264
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>where they say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

265
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your perspective is wrong man.</v>

266
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 1>We have to look at this from a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

267
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no sympathy.</v>

269
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 1>This is like a very aggressive sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and you know,</v>

270
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.970
<v Speaker 1>you could say that I think it's possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the argument that there's a </v>

271
00:12:55.091 --> 00:13:00.091
<v Speaker 1>necessity to some of that because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that the aggression against people</v>

272
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.230
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been marginalized,</v>

273
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 1>the aggression against certain races and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual orientations and certain genders,</v>

274
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 1>and you could say that it's necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something equally aggressive in the</v>

275
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>opposite direction to sort of achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>some type of balance.</v>

276
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I could see that but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make sure that what you're targeting</v>

277
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 1>is the actual offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't just.</v>

278
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

279
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:27.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we want to have an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about the boundaries of </v>

280
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:27.410
<v Speaker 1>satire and let's have that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

281
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not canceled core bear and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

282
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>that I can't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

283
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you're really having trouble with that.</v>

284
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And I met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>

285
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.730
<v Speaker 1>You next time you want to say Kobe just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in of um,</v>

286
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

287
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>it's so stupid and complicated and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what also frustrates me is the fact that</v>

288
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>if someone transgressed as a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary,</v>

289
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain words that you can say</v>

290
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.450
<v Speaker 1>that immediately give the other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to disqualify everything </v>

291
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

292
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are ways.</v>

293
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

294
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

295
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly dealing with the </v>

296
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.551
<v Speaker 1>immigration department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you can probably tell by my </v>

297
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:08.551
<v Speaker 1>accent that I wasn't born here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

298
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 1>and as far as bureaucracy is go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

299
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>it's as if the DMV had control of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire existence.</v>

300
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 1>It is just nightmarish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like pulling fingernails just to </v>

301
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 1>get to do the most basic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of stuff like,</v>

302
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really renewing your visa </v>

303
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.140
<v Speaker 1>visa.</v>

304
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

305
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you are not American and you're </v>

306
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:28.711
<v Speaker 1>here and you have to have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work here,</v>

307
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:32.160
<v Speaker 1>there are certain hoops that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump through and that the regulations </v>

308
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.040
<v Speaker 1>are so arcane and so it's so difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to comply with and you know,</v>

309
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:41.041
<v Speaker 1>you fill in a form in triplicate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it goes through a bazillion </v>

310
00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:41.041
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it comes back as a different,</v>

311
00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:45.840
<v Speaker 1>one line was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to go in and you have </v>

312
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.601
<v Speaker 1>to wait for ages to get a ticket to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and then you wait for another </v>

313
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 1>three hours and then they tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at the wrong booth.</v>

314
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>So you have to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's just,</v>

315
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with bureaucracy is like,</v>

316
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.160
<v Speaker 4>it's just a horrible thing to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

317
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.800
<v Speaker 4>but I have no recourse against any of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because that's just the power of </v>

318
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.810
<v Speaker 4>the state and if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I want,</v>

319
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.980
<v Speaker 4>want to be able to be here than I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have to cop that.</v>

320
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.500
<v Speaker 4>But last time I came into the country I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was at wit's end.</v>

321
00:15:07.501 --> 00:15:12.501
<v Speaker 4>The battle with stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the immigration officer at the </v>

322
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:12.501
<v Speaker 4>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

323
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 4>made a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

324
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 4>I live on A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

325
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 4>I can't really tell the story without </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving away my address,</v>

326
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.540
<v Speaker 4>but that's where I just don't come and </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't hunt me down on people.</v>

327
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I live on a strong do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That won't give you the.</v>

328
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I look at the fucking show listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>St Huff Post live man.</v>

329
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

330
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll beat around the bush,</v>

331
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>please do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

332
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I live on it</v>

333
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.200
<v Speaker 4>on a street that has the name of a fruit</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is named after a fruit.</v>

334
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

335
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 4>and he and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>

336
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 4>these immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

337
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:47.250
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I guess you got a lot of fruits </v>

338
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:47.250
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

339
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:47.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

340
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.630
<v Speaker 4>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid like kind of anti gay quip or </v>

341
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.421
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I don't come across as Super </v>

342
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.670
<v Speaker 4>Gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he obviously didn't know that I was </v>

343
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.670
<v Speaker 4>gay and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

344
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.871
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't find that particularly </v>

345
00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:02.161
<v Speaker 4>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came out and as I was standing at the </v>

346
00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:02.161
<v Speaker 4>baggage claim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

347
00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:02.830
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the indignities that the immigration</v>

348
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:05.710
<v Speaker 4>department has put me through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is so much worse than that.</v>

349
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.430
<v Speaker 4>If I wanted to like get this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanctioned,</v>

350
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.640
<v Speaker 4>I could complain about that and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>little thing which was completely </v>

351
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.990
<v Speaker 4>harmless and stupid would be the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that they would,</v>

352
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.450
<v Speaker 4>that he would actually get censored for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas all the other bullshit that I've</v>

353
00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:24.451
<v Speaker 4>been put through because it doesn't fit </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the box of having been </v>

354
00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:25.510
<v Speaker 4>discriminatory like people can get away </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

355
00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:26.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you,</v>

356
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.430
<v Speaker 4>if you make a joke that can be perceived</v>
<v Speaker 4>as being racist,</v>

357
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.700
<v Speaker 4>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like that,</v>

358
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.430
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden it's the worst fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing in the world.</v>

359
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.550
<v Speaker 4>But you can do anything else and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't kind of trip the trip wire.</v>

360
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to make any jokes </v>

361
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.260
<v Speaker 1>when you're in those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially not job.</v>

362
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can kenny though if you </v>

363
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 1>complained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he can,</v>

364
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.610
<v Speaker 4>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

365
00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:53.010
<v Speaker 4>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it frustrates me that that is such a bad</v>

366
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.330
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

367
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Like when did we all get together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>decide that some stupid guy,</v>

368
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.470
<v Speaker 4>he's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

369
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:01.730
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

370
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.560
<v Speaker 4>he grew up in a neighborhood where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a joke about fruits.</v>

371
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:05.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

372
00:17:05.341 --> 00:17:06.900
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a stupid thing to do,</v>

373
00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.600
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why is that the worst thing that has</v>

374
00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:12.990
<v Speaker 4>been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that has been for foisted upon me by the</v>

375
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Immigration Department in the past three</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

376
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what if you were both gay and you </v>

377
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.460
<v Speaker 1>were making jokes about straight people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like breeders,</v>

378
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he thought you were gay and it turned</v>

379
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:28.591
<v Speaker 1>out you were straight and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he assumed that he could make a joke </v>

380
00:17:28.591 --> 00:17:29.410
<v Speaker 1>about heterosexual people and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

381
00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:32.290
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought I was heterosexual.</v>

382
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone just has to take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chill pill as saying Australia.</v>

383
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Just say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we have,</v>

384
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.610
<v Speaker 1>we invented it and we sent it over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

385
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.460
<v Speaker 1>You recycled it back here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty new for you.</v>

386
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of abandoned that in the </v>

387
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:47.490
<v Speaker 1>eighties and we abandoned that once </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've invented cars.</v>

388
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I was saying you invented cars in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did 18.</v>

389
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

390
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was pretty funny.</v>

391
00:17:56.191 --> 00:18:01.191
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know minute which </v>
<v Speaker 1>vernacular is Australia in which been </v>

392
00:18:01.191 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 1>accurate roads of American and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like,</v>

393
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll often say things and people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have no idea.</v>

394
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>What did I say that a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

395
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:05.810
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we will be able to leave work early.</v>

397
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

398
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>we get an early mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was like,</v>

399
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 1>what an early mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

400
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like,</v>

401
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've basically been in the states for </v>

402
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years and I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't notice what you're not</v>

403
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:19.840
<v Speaker 1>hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

404
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't notice that people aren't </v>

405
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:24.910
<v Speaker 1>saying early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark.</v>

406
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:24.910
<v Speaker 1>My English friends always say taking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>piss.</v>

407
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

408
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You're taking the piss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.950

<v Speaker 1>I think we just have to take a chill </v>

413
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.451
<v Speaker 1>pill and just let ourselves joke about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when Greg Fitz was on,</v>

414
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.840
<v Speaker 1>he made some joke that was could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been construed as being homophobic or </v>

415
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:44.840
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

416
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:44.840
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

417
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.990
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's saying I'm the first guy who asks </v>

418
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.200
<v Speaker 1>another guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to fuck him,</v>

419
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.620
<v Speaker 1>and then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

420
00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have said that.</v>

421
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was screaming into my podcast.</v>

422
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

423
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a.</v>

424
00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:58.940
<v Speaker 1>That is a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

425
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a.</v>

426
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a parody of the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid thing that a straight person who </v>

427
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would say like,</v>

428
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:13.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well people are people worried even </v>

429
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.901
<v Speaker 1>about a joke that is not mean like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke about like a Joe.</v>

430
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.590
<v Speaker 1>You can make a joke about black guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>having big dicks and someone could say </v>

431
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.431
<v Speaker 1>that's racist like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it a good thing to have a big </v>

432
00:19:28.431 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 1>like it's racist in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even racist in a pot and it's what we </v>

433
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.150
<v Speaker 1>were talking about earlier.</v>

434
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Speaker 1>People are just at the starting block </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to get upset,</v>

435
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.700
<v Speaker 1>but Sarah Silverman has a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

436
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:38.870
<v Speaker 1>She was on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

437
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I think she was on Conan years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

438
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it racist to say like,</v>

439
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I love chinks and she had the bitch he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had wanted to do.</v>

440
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 1>She nixed it was she wanted to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the n word.</v>

441
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I love like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she would have actually said it on </v>

442
00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

443
00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

444
00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.030
<v Speaker 1>can't believe you said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

445
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you can get in trouble just for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

446
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Then I hate saying the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so stupid and facile,</v>

447
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's great if you're black and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just call your friends at.</v>

448
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Well I listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

449
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I do have some empathy for minorities </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to reclaim terminology and I </v>

450
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.150
<v Speaker 1>do think that a black person that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to say it,</v>

451
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 1>like we've screwed it for 400 years.</v>

452
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.740
<v Speaker 1>The least we can do is let you say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word that we can't say.</v>

453
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't we,</v>

454
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with you mean you say we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean really,</v>

455
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I had nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had nothing to do with it.</v>

456
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure Jamie's never owned any </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves.</v>

457
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we still have the benefit.</v>

458
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 1>We benefit from an institutional system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had,</v>

459
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 1>that took advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So check your white privilege,</v>

460
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh steps.</v>

461
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Do we have the APP yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I get a check?</v>

462
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.970
<v Speaker 1>They come around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

463
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.340
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

464
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.110

471
00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.120
<v Speaker 4>don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not even aware of how privileged</v>

472
00:20:59.121 --> 00:20:59.260
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

473
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 3>I would love to get Sean Hannity fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on mushrooms.</v>

474
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 3>What would come out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crying tears.</v>

475
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.690
<v Speaker 3>A lot of tears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of sadness.</v>

476
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 3>A lot of reality.</v>

477
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More.</v>

478
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Or would he just dessert?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would he just peel away like an </v>

479
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.730
<v Speaker 4>invisible onion and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath the shell.</v>

480
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

481
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 3>essentially he's cold bear in a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>life for them.</v>

482
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

483
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 3>That's what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said it right.</v>

484
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

485
00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good boy.</v>

486
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

487
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.180
<v Speaker 3>he's a parody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a parody without knowing that he's </v>

488
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:33.970
<v Speaker 3>a parody and it's a lot of the way bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>o'reilly is.</v>

489
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like they play to these people with</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine volt brains.</v>

490
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:43.050
<v Speaker 3>They have these people that live in is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very small box of ideology and this box </v>

491
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 3>only contains a few support our troops </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Falcon the need to keep my guns and </v>

492
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.560
<v Speaker 3>gays are trying to fucking marry and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to ruin the and Obama's a </v>

493
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.800
<v Speaker 3>fucking Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this box these people live in </v>

494
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.960
<v Speaker 3>and if you can fit into that box </v>
<v Speaker 3>project,</v>

495
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 3>that frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a lot of money.</v>

496
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.280
<v Speaker 4>It's the same as what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

497
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.690
<v Speaker 4>about the labels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

498
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:11.810
<v Speaker 4>they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they live in a world of labels and </v>

499
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.810
<v Speaker 4>order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

500
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

501
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.590
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially Sean Hannity,</v>

502
00:22:13.591 --> 00:22:18.591
<v Speaker 4>I think Bill O'reilly is a smarter Guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Than Shawn Hannity and sometimes </v>

503
00:22:18.591 --> 00:22:21.771
<v Speaker 4>diverges from the orthodoxy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Hannity is literally a puppet for a </v>

504
00:22:21.771 --> 00:22:26.150
<v Speaker 4>grab bag of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of pre packaged ideas that come from </v>

505
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:26.940
<v Speaker 4>Roger ailes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's it.</v>

506
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.780
<v Speaker 4>He's a spokes means just a spokesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no independent thinking going on</v>

507
00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:35.781
<v Speaker 4>there and profits from that and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that happens on the other side </v>

508
00:22:35.781 --> 00:22:36.690
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going back to the whole canceled Kobe.</v>

509
00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:41.691
<v Speaker 4>I think the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are doing that are also just </v>

510
00:22:41.691 --> 00:22:43.080
<v Speaker 4>plucking out of a preset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

511
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a jigsaw puzzle box when they've </v>

512
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.780
<v Speaker 4>got all the little pieces of things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe and they're not open to </v>

513
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.510
<v Speaker 4>listening to other people or considering</v>
<v Speaker 4>new ideas.</v>

514
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.500
<v Speaker 4>What is this something that's Suey Park </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweeted during that time</v>

515
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.630
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Racism and whiteness go together.</v>

516
00:22:57.631 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Only white people can be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

517
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.120
<v Speaker 3>that's just a product that is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

518
00:23:06.121 --> 00:23:11.121
<v Speaker 3>What is the question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're assuming that whites are more </v>

519
00:23:11.121 --> 00:23:13.941
<v Speaker 3>racist than others and that racism by </v>
<v Speaker 3>whites is worse than racism by first </v>

520
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.130
<v Speaker 3>versus whites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dumb question.</v>

521
00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Racism and whiteness go together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only white people can be racist.</v>

522
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.840
<v Speaker 3>That is awesome.</v>

523
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just depends on you.</v>

524
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Then she's just not using the term </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>

525
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.120
<v Speaker 3>She's in the bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he is.</v>

526
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's at Cole bear on the other side.</v>

527
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 3>She's Sean Hannity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean?</v>

528
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>

529
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 3>She's a female parody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

530
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Kobe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The character without willing to do </v>

531
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.700
<v Speaker 3>willing fully doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

532
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Without consciously doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's doing that.</v>

533
00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that was saying,</v>

534
00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 3>that only white people can be racist.</v>

535
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

536
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean any.</v>

537
00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that has seen the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The riots in La when they pulled white </v>

538
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 1>people out of cars and hit him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head with bricks,</v>

539
00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's kind of racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what they did to the Korean </v>

540
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 1>community and so fucking Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

541
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No racism.</v>

542
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just a child.</v>

543
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a child with ideas that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really vet out under scrutiny.</v>

544
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.800
<v Speaker 1>What offends me more frankly about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular tweet than the house been how</v>

545
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.810
<v Speaker 1>stupid it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the mangling of the English </v>

546
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 1>language in abusing the word racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much like I'm an English major.</v>

547
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 1>She's just not using the word racism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of the word.</v>

548
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 1>If racism means that you judge people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of their rights rather than on</v>

549
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 1>the basis of their individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes,</v>

550
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 1>then of course just definitionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone can be racist,</v>

551
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 1>have any rights.</v>

552
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

553
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:37.150
<v Speaker 1>there's many people inside of a race </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are racist towards others that vary</v>

554
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.690
<v Speaker 1>in that race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many black people that are </v>

555
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 1>racist against darker black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

556
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 1>That is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

557
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Often discussed in the African American </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and it happens in Asian </v>

558
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:51.280
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens in India a lot.</v>

559
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:51.760
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

560
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.880
<v Speaker 1>there are seven eleven's in India that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have full of face creams that make your </v>

561
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.730
<v Speaker 1>skin water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

562
00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

563
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:01.000
<v Speaker 1>in the Philippines Gludethyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

564
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 1>an amino acid or an antioxidant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

565
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.720
<v Speaker 1>They inject glutathione and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

566
00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:10.160
<v Speaker 1>they use it as a way of bleaching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

567
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like a very common practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre and it's roots are not just</v>

568
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a cosmetic thing.</v>

569
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:21.041
<v Speaker 1>It's a race thing because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of white people that are </v>

570
00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 1>fucking tanning themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they look like orange,</v>

571
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

572
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

573
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.380
<v Speaker 1>That's an aesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

574
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:26.470
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to look different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are there.</v>

575
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.530
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to be wider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

576
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really creepy thing.</v>

577
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to end up with a world,</v>

578
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:38.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I'm passionate about </v>

579
00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 1>working towards and I hope will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually happen is a world in which we</v>

580
00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:44.651
<v Speaker 1>have basically ignored rice to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest possible extent where we are </v>

581
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 1>all just treating each other as </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual human beings.</v>

582
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Trying to find what's special about one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

583
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.940
<v Speaker 1>giving people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving each other the benefit of the </v>

584
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:54.940
<v Speaker 1>doubt and not teaming up against each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

585
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>How do you best foster that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you best bring about that?</v>

586
00:25:57.831 --> 00:26:02.831
<v Speaker 1>You don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think by hunkering down into </v>

587
00:26:02.831 --> 00:26:06.191
<v Speaker 1>your tribe and throwing pot shots at </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people because of their race or </v>

588
00:26:06.191 --> 00:26:06.191
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

589
00:26:06.191 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 1>give me a break.</v>

590
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

591
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually happening now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we're seeing in this </v>

592
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.320
<v Speaker 1>cancel Colbert thing and what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing with these social justice </v>

593
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:17.810
<v Speaker 1>warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think it's ill advised,</v>

594
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I think what it is is the adolescent </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage of this growth,</v>

595
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.030
<v Speaker 1>this social growth that we're undergoing</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

596
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:31.180
<v Speaker 1>and I think that we're in this process </v>
<v Speaker 1>of understanding each other that is </v>

597
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented as process of exchanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that is unprecedented.</v>

598
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the negative aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that,</v>

599
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with some people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do have limited patterns of thinking and</v>

601
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

602
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag cancel Colbert and Suny Park's</v>

603
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 3>my hero and you get all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

604
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 3>But I think this is a long process of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years.</v>

605
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.360
<v Speaker 3>But in this process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

606
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.160
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time that I've been alive,</v>

607
00:26:56.161 --> 00:27:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I was born in 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so between 67 and 2014,</v>

608
00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:05.190
<v Speaker 3>where we're at right now has been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>epic change in culture.</v>

609
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable.</v>

610
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 3>When I was a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

611
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born in New Jersey and I moved to </v>

612
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.491
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco when I was seven and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up around a lot of different </v>

613
00:27:16.491 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't,</v>

614
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that I didn't </v>

615
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 3>understand about like racism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobia.</v>

616
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I moved to Florida,</v>

617
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I was 11 years old when I moved to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida and um,</v>

618
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 3>my um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my neighbor,</v>

619
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 3>this kid that I used to hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

620
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.920
<v Speaker 3>his dad was getting super angry that </v>
<v Speaker 3>black people or that gay people rather </v>

621
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.480
<v Speaker 3>we're allowed to get married and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this fucking newspaper down </v>

622
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:41.480
<v Speaker 3>because you can't fucking believe this </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

623
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to get married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember it was 11,</v>

624
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.660
<v Speaker 3>a fucking silly bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is like,</v>

625
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 3>what do you give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My neighbors were gay in San Francisco.</v>

626
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 3>I grew up next to gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were always there.</v>

627
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.320
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally didn't understand it.</v>

628
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.740
<v Speaker 3>And between that and today it is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>rare that you come across someone who </v>

629
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.870
<v Speaker 3>actually gets angry in any urban </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

630
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gay people were going to get </v>

631
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:05.900
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty much accepted like hook me.</v>

632
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:05.900
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

633
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 3>There was always this economic argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>about fucking insurance and some,</v>

634
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Speaker 3>but I always felt like those were </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit arguments because how is that </v>

635
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.571
<v Speaker 3>affecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't really raising your insurance </v>

636
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:17.571
<v Speaker 3>rates</v>

637
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:18.140
<v Speaker 4>and understand all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when jared did you,</v>

638
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.470
<v Speaker 4>did you notice my interview with Jeremy </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it by any chance last year?</v>

639
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.480
<v Speaker 4>It blew up momentarily when he said that</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a minute.</v>

640
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:32.230
<v Speaker 4>What's his word?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he basically said if you have gay </v>

641
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.621
<v Speaker 4>marriage than a father could marry his </v>
<v Speaker 4>son to avoid death taxes because if you </v>

642
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:41.081
<v Speaker 4>want it to pass on his estate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then then you could marry your son and </v>

643
00:28:41.481 --> 00:28:45.350
<v Speaker 4>then you'd be transferring the property </v>
<v Speaker 4>to your spouse instead of to a kid.</v>

644
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.190
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is Jeremy Irons and actor,</v>

645
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.410
<v Speaker 4>the actor Academy Academy Award winning </v>
<v Speaker 4>actor,</v>

646
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.290
<v Speaker 4>but it was probably just pointing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something out.</v>

647
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

648
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.990
<v Speaker 4>And then the British,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's very,</v>

649
00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:59.960
<v Speaker 4>very famous in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The British press picked this up and you</v>

650
00:28:59.961 --> 00:29:04.961
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how crazy the British tabloids can be </v>

651
00:29:04.961 --> 00:29:04.961
<v Speaker 4>and it was like a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge firestorm over there.</v>

652
00:29:04.961 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I felt bad.</v>

653
00:29:05.151 --> 00:29:10.151
<v Speaker 4>I felt sorry for him because it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what it's like when you do a </v>

654
00:29:10.151 --> 00:29:10.151
<v Speaker 4>long interview and you just say </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

655
00:29:10.151 --> 00:29:10.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a 33 minute interview and he's,</v>

656
00:29:10.821 --> 00:29:13.430
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he mused on that in like the 31st minute</v>

657
00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:18.431
<v Speaker 4>of the interview and if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just chatting on a couch feels </v>

658
00:29:18.431 --> 00:29:21.731
<v Speaker 4>casual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just thinks he's rising a kind of </v>

659
00:29:21.731 --> 00:29:23.471
<v Speaker 4>thought experiment and then the British </v>
<v Speaker 4>press will go crazy about Jeremy Irons </v>

660
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:24.550
<v Speaker 4>speaks out against gay marriage in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>slightly unfair way,</v>

661
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.720
<v Speaker 4>but that's the kind of like stupid us </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought experiment that obviously.</v>

662
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.540
<v Speaker 4>So if that ever happened then you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>just change the law about incest,</v>

663
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

664
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a nonissue.</v>

665
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Is it legal to marry your son?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

666
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 3>not even legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

667
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.060
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so,</v>

668
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

669
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.360
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to imagine whether or not they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would ever actually bothered to write </v>

670
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 3>that law because what if a son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

671
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 3>let's throw this out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's even more offensive would.</v>

672
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:59.281
<v Speaker 3>If a son and a father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both consenting adults and they </v>

673
00:29:59.281 --> 00:29:59.281
<v Speaker 3>decide they love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one have sex all the time.</v>

674
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Who's to say that that's bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they like it,</v>

675
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 3>they both like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the sun's 30 and the father is 50 and</v>

676
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:06.940
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look Dad,</v>

677
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 3>I think you fucking hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

678
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:14.460
<v Speaker 3>If they both agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're not talking about </v>

679
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.161
<v Speaker 3>children you're talking about and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no history of sex between them </v>

680
00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:20.940
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no slow indoctrination by the </v>

681
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:20.960
<v Speaker 3>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

682
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I basically think that we should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the largest amount of freedom.</v>

683
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's consistent with a society that in a</v>

684
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:31.681
<v Speaker 3>culture that function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wouldn't say that that should be </v>

685
00:30:31.681 --> 00:30:33.871
<v Speaker 3>against the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to disentangle that from </v>

686
00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 3>the power differential there is between </v>
<v Speaker 3>a father and a son.</v>

687
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:36.030
<v Speaker 3>It's to imagine dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad.</v>

688
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no fucking power over me when I was 30.</v>

689
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that certain point in time,</v>

690
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean 40 and 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

691
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.250
<v Speaker 3>you're really older men and if it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 120 140,</v>

692
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.790
<v Speaker 3>then now we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's hard to fuck a hundred 20 </v>

693
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 3>year old man they break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

694
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

695
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with two people that consent to do</v>

696
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 3>what they both enjoyed doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know this is a weird example,</v>

697
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 3>but I think that as long as they both </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it,</v>

698
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:12.280
<v Speaker 3>like why do we care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we care because of the confines of </v>

699
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:12.280
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

700
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

701
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Bonobo monkeys will have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody except the mother will not </v>

702
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.510
<v Speaker 3>have sex with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the sun.</v>

703
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The father has sex with the sons,</v>

704
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.480
<v Speaker 3>the father of sex of the daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brothers and sisters have sex.</v>

705
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 3>Brothers have sex with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has sex with everybody.</v>

706
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all bisexual except the mothers.</v>

707
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 3>I get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

708
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 3>No Dick from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

709
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only the only boundary that </v>

710
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.300
<v Speaker 3>they will not cross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fascinating.</v>

711
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I should emphasize that if people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching this and I look horribly </v>

712
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:43.830
<v Speaker 3>claiming it's because I'm sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't look clammy,</v>

713
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.770
<v Speaker 3>you look fine to do by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>

714
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I appreciate you getting in here and</v>

715
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

716
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

717
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm allowed to pollute you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to pollute anyone else in </v>

718
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:57.900
<v Speaker 3>the house was fine.</v>

719
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I take antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be okay.</v>

720
00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.440
<v Speaker 3>And there's only two of you in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to never get sick.</v>

721
00:32:02.441 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 3>The kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking soldier really?</v>

722
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.150
<v Speaker 3>He'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for him.</v>

723
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

724
00:32:08.411 --> 00:32:10.450
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of the same thing that Jeremy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Irons thing.</v>

725
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.040
<v Speaker 3>It's this desire to be offended or this </v>
<v Speaker 3>green light to be offended.</v>

726
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 3>You see the green light go hit the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got one.</v>

727
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.320
<v Speaker 3>We got an opening time to be pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that this is a part of a </v>

728
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.851
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a part of a process of </v>

729
00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:31.300
<v Speaker 3>along with the erosion of privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>along with the,</v>

730
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:36.390
<v Speaker 3>the symbiotic connection that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology which is connecting us and </v>

731
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.250
<v Speaker 3>some sort of very strange way and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>erosion of privacy,</v>

732
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 3>symbiotic nature.</v>

733
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technological world that we live in,</v>

734
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:48.430
<v Speaker 4>and then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these opinions that are coming in </v>

735
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 4>like this distribution method of twitter</v>
<v Speaker 4>and social media and facebook.</v>

736
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:55.150
<v Speaker 4>You could just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could make a facebook post that </v>

737
00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 4>resonates and within a couple days </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking millions of people can see it.</v>

738
00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alex from target.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have.</v>

741
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 4>There's been a viral meme last week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

742
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

745
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.480

<v Speaker 4>of this 15 year old checkout guy at </v>

746
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.861
<v Speaker 4>target who was cute and a girl tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and twitter blew up with just </v>

747
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:23.910
<v Speaker 4>retweets of this picture of this kid who</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly begun.</v>

748
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 4>He went from 144 twitter followers to </v>
<v Speaker 4>600,000</v>

749
00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 4>twitter followers in like 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

750
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:30.950
<v Speaker 4>Just because teenage girls thought he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was adorable.</v>

751
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.860
<v Speaker 4>He ended up on Ellen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

752
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alex from twitter.</v>

753
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 4>Hashtag Alex from twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blew up the world,</v>

754
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:39.370
<v Speaker 4>blew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blew up the incident.</v>

755
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 4>He is a little cutie pie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at Alan.</v>

756
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Good for her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's the best.</v>

757
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.100
<v Speaker 4>She's awesome at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

758
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:51.101
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you're talking about how </v>

759
00:33:51.101 --> 00:33:52.691
<v Speaker 4>things can just spiral out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this connectedness is insane.</v>

760
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:57.731
<v Speaker 4>The spontaneity I'm a little bit worried</v>
<v Speaker 4>about whether it's getting too crazy.</v>

761
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:03.671
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it reminds me like Nuremberg or </v>

762
00:34:03.671 --> 00:34:06.881
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like what happens if you get a </v>

763
00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:07.100
<v Speaker 4>bunch of crazy bigots?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

764
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 4>what happens if you multiply the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened with,</v>

765
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.500
<v Speaker 4>to me with cancel callback by a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

766
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Like he could just overwhelm your </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>

767
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.690
<v Speaker 4>can overwhelm your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

768
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:24.170
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your life is going to be different.</v>

769
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's changed Alex's life,</v>

770
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

771
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn sure.</v>

772
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what that kid's father must </v>
<v Speaker 4>be like all day,</v>

773
00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:34.781
<v Speaker 4>but he's had winning propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's probably just the amount </v>

774
00:34:34.961 --> 00:34:39.961
<v Speaker 4>of sheer photos of vaginas sent his way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His iphone going to need one of these </v>

775
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:44.300
<v Speaker 4>big 128 gigs and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Labia.</v>

776
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.320
<v Speaker 4>Although I just is just getting bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or imagine if he becomes like a famous </v>

777
00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he gets a reality show or something</v>

778
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:54.620
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why not?</v>

779
00:34:54.621 --> 00:34:56.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean if honey booboo can get one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about,</v>

780
00:34:56.721 --> 00:35:01.010
<v Speaker 4>you know Alex from target when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the Bonobos as well,</v>

781
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:06.011
<v Speaker 4>like that's a whole other element of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human sexuality that you can open up in </v>

782
00:35:06.011 --> 00:35:10.481
<v Speaker 4>terms of terms of overcoming labels and </v>
<v Speaker 4>overcoming the way that we think about </v>

783
00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 4>each other and the boxes that society </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to sort of fill us in.</v>

784
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:17.110
<v Speaker 4>There been a lot of societies where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were a lot more bisexual than </v>

785
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 4>they are in this society right now.</v>

786
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:22.870
<v Speaker 4>Almost all of them in ancient Rome and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Paris in the 19th century and a lot of </v>

787
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.660
<v Speaker 4>Polynesian islands and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the great kind of sweep of trying </v>

788
00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:35.261
<v Speaker 4>to become a culture that's more </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepting of individuals and </v>

789
00:35:35.261 --> 00:35:39.521
<v Speaker 4>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something that I hope happens </v>

790
00:35:39.521 --> 00:35:43.371
<v Speaker 4>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we do where we are less sort of </v>

791
00:35:43.371 --> 00:35:45.261
<v Speaker 4>judgmental about the way that we think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about each other's sexuality.</v>

792
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:50.361
<v Speaker 4>And I think that sometimes the gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of going off on a bit of a </v>

793
00:35:50.361 --> 00:35:50.490
<v Speaker 4>tangent here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just while it occurs to me sometimes</v>

794
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:52.920
<v Speaker 4>the gay community or the gay lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the extremely,</v>

795
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pro gay lobby can do a disservice to the</v>

796
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 4>sort of mission of sexual fulfillment by</v>
<v Speaker 4>requiring you to pick a team by </v>

797
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 4>requiring you to buy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but making it seem like gayness has a </v>

798
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.321
<v Speaker 4>certain politics and has a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>fashion style and has a certain way of </v>

799
00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:13.670
<v Speaker 4>speaking and way of behaving and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to defend that and,</v>

800
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 4>and fight for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't you just Shag who you want and</v>

801
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:17.200
<v Speaker 4>love anymore,</v>

802
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by picking a team.</v>

803
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Is that an issue in the gay community?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone is gay,</v>

804
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.880
<v Speaker 3>then they decided to be straight for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little while.</v>

805
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 3>They get criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

806
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

807
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:31.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean imagine if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

808
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.260
<v Speaker 3>that's like the opposite of what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be promoting.</v>

809
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:39.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea about the ability to be </v>

810
00:36:39.261 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 3>gay was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave me alone.</v>

811
00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Let me do what I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm not,</v>

812
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not hurting anybody,</v>

813
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 3>if it's consensual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is what we both enjoy doing,</v>

814
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:49.470
<v Speaker 3>why do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you care?</v>

815
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Because you have to care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this is,</v>

816
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.790
<v Speaker 3>this is a fight that we have to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

817
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can a person also like this.</v>

818
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 3>If you're a meat eater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you have a salad?</v>

819
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a vegetarian,</v>

820
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't eat meat.</v>

821
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a person who eats meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you have a fucking salad?</v>

822
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:08.070
<v Speaker 3>If I see you eating a salad like we do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that salad,</v>

823
00:37:08.071 --> 00:37:08.430
<v Speaker 3>pussy</v>

824
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.750
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's great.</v>

825
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 4>But it's also not like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If something,</v>

826
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:20.811
<v Speaker 4>if like a tiny flick of animal blood has</v>
<v Speaker 4>like been on one of the pieces that one </v>

827
00:37:21.841 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 4>of the billions of pieces of lettuce </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you ate,</v>

828
00:37:23.821 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 4>like that's not a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

829
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Like their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

830
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.160
<v Speaker 4>their uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

831
00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now at some whole foods different,</v>

832
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

833
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:37.310
<v Speaker 4>what do you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bread cutting machines for the organic </v>

834
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.681
<v Speaker 4>bread and the nonorganic bread because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are so crazy about their organic </v>

835
00:37:39.681 --> 00:37:42.921
<v Speaker 4>bread that they don't want to crumb of </v>
<v Speaker 4>non organic bread to touch the organic </v>

836
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:44.310
<v Speaker 4>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a religion.</v>

837
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Just cry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cry.</v>

838
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.740
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand what organic even </v>
<v Speaker 3>means and then when you're having bread,</v>

839
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:51.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the reality of food.</v>

840
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:56.870
<v Speaker 3>If you are having bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is changed from the wheat that used </v>

841
00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.210
<v Speaker 3>to exist in the early 19 hundreds from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the early 19 hundreds to today.</v>

842
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:05.211
<v Speaker 3>The wheat that you have has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>modified and genetically modified.</v>

843
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not genetically modified in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory where they're splicing genes,</v>

844
00:38:08.671 --> 00:38:10.890
<v Speaker 3>but it is the sense of natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>selection.</v>

845
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.920
<v Speaker 3>They've they've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've selected on natural manmade </v>

846
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.910
<v Speaker 3>splicing plants together with scalpels </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

847
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 3>What they've done is creating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've created a heartier plant that </v>

848
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 3>can survive better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has better yields,</v>

849
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.810
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

850
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.820
<v Speaker 3>what is organic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means it doesn't have </v>

851
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:31.820
<v Speaker 3>pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

852
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the main thing they care </v>
<v Speaker 3>about when you're slicing and you're not</v>

853
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 3>getting in front on pesticide stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it becomes a kind of a spiritual</v>

854
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.180
<v Speaker 1>thing almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

855
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have to pray to the gods </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the organic.</v>

856
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 1>God's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Well the vegetarian option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole thing.</v>

858
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:48.560
<v Speaker 1>My favorite is the vegans who have cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

859
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 1>because guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck face.</v>

860
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.830
<v Speaker 1>You're not a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're fucking buyin murdered animals</v>

861
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 1>that are stuffed into cans for little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tabby and you see all these people,</v>

862
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:00.370
<v Speaker 1>they have their cats and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in animal cruelty,</v>

863
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 1>but yet the fucking cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those cats are cool as shit.</v>

864
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two cats,</v>

865
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but I have one cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's this big fluff ball.</v>

866
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 1>She's 18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had it forever.</v>

867
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.850
<v Speaker 1>She's a sweetheart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She Meat Company come near me.</v>

868
00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I was at Yale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pick her up.</v>

869
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 1>She starts purring immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the best cat.</v>

870
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.400
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I leave her outside in the courtyard </v>

871
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.360
<v Speaker 1>and a bird is stupid enough to come near</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

872
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.600
<v Speaker 1>she will snatch that fucker.</v>

873
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I have a sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snap it's neck and bring it in and drop </v>

874
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 1>it at my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

875
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and she thinks it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

876
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.490
<v Speaker 1>she's not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not starving to death.</v>

877
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:34.000
<v Speaker 1>She does that shift for a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking bowl of food.</v>

878
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 1>They're full all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wants.</v>

879
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:40.330
<v Speaker 1>She can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking murderer and that's what</v>

880
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are a Vegan with a cat,</v>

881
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you are harboring murderers and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

882
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:50.490
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those crazy fucks that </v>

883
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 1>tries to feed your cat some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetable based food,</v>

884
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 1>you're killing your fucking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

885
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:58.201
<v Speaker 1>That cat's going to have organ failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go blind is also too </v>

886
00:39:58.201 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit that happens to cats when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to feed them vegetables.</v>

887
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.280
<v Speaker 1>There's this weird sense in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of Vegan movement,</v>

888
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:08.281
<v Speaker 1>and I have to say I have a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for them because I do think </v>

889
00:40:08.281 --> 00:40:08.281
<v Speaker 1>that the way that we.</v>

890
00:40:08.281 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 1>What we've done to industrialize </v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture is a travesty.</v>

891
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we will look back in 100 years that </v>

892
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 1>the way that we simply treat animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely on the basis of,</v>

893
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 1>of minimizing the cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of pennies that we have to </v>

894
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 1>say Scott's down of their flesh and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

895
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I think we will regard that as almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like a slight,</v>

896
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.020
<v Speaker 1>a form of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it will be so morally abhorrent,</v>

897
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but the response to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my response to that is similar to your </v>

898
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.691
<v Speaker 1>response to that which is alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try to feel more like we're part </v>

899
00:40:36.691 --> 00:40:40.171
<v Speaker 1>of an ecosystem in which we actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more related to the food that we're </v>

900
00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:44.251
<v Speaker 1>eating into the animals whose lives were</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking and let's have some comic </v>

901
00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for that rather than just</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying,</v>

902
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken breast in Styrofoam and trying </v>

903
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:49.990
<v Speaker 1>not to think about the chicken that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually came from.</v>

904
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the correct response is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vegan response,</v>

905
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:57.031
<v Speaker 1>which is to sort of imagine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>humankind is distinct and disjointed and</v>

906
00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:00.250
<v Speaker 1>detached from the rest of the ecosystem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the like.</v>

907
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:04.240
<v Speaker 1>The what the cat does to the bird is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine because that's natural.</v>

908
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.630
<v Speaker 1>But for us to eat meat is not natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what we're morally conscious </v>

909
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:11.800
<v Speaker 1>creatures who aren't part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>

910
00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 1>We are out of the ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can have a problem with the way</v>

911
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:19.711
<v Speaker 1>that certain types of food are raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's kind of morally </v>

912
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:24.400
<v Speaker 1>consistent to think that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

913
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 1>that it's wrong for us to partake in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of cycle of life,</v>

914
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.120
<v Speaker 1>that the rest of that all other species </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

915
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that we are</v>

916
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 3>the highest form of animal on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet because unlike dolphins,</v>

917
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 3>we can actually alter our environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think dolphins are probably in the</v>

918
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 3>same range as far as intelligence goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If human beings,</v>

919
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.710
<v Speaker 3>they have incredible minds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have dialects,</v>

920
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 3>they have the ability to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they formed bonds and packs.</v>

921
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:56.531
<v Speaker 3>They play with people and also they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't show any violence whatsoever </v>

922
00:41:56.531 --> 00:41:59.981
<v Speaker 3>towards human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but human being show violence towards </v>

923
00:41:59.981 --> 00:42:02.111
<v Speaker 3>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of like really super </v>

924
00:42:02.111 --> 00:42:03.430
<v Speaker 3>positive characteristics about wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins that quite quite fascinating.</v>

925
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 3>More so than even monkeys or chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps don't eat babies.</v>

926
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Chimps will steal human babies and eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

927
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.430
<v Speaker 3>They'll rip your face off their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible monsters.</v>

928
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 3>That's our closest relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it could be argued that in some way,</v>

929
00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 3>even though dolphins can alter their </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

930
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:22.060
<v Speaker 3>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very commensurate level of </v>

931
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.641
<v Speaker 3>intelligence that human beings have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we consider ourselves the highest </v>

932
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:26.090
<v Speaker 3>because we can alter our environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we have opposable thumbs and the</v>

933
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 3>whole deal.</v>

934
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

935
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:34.490
<v Speaker 3>if you are the highest form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should set the highest standards.</v>

936
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Our understanding and our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate these ideas lead us to this </v>

937
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.220
<v Speaker 3>thing where we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

938
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.480
<v Speaker 3>we are causing animal suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cruelty that is unnecessary and I want </v>

939
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 3>to leave the smallest footprint </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

940
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 3>I want to grow my own vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating them.</v>

941
00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:50.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

942
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.550
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they also won't even eat eggs,</v>

943
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.230
<v Speaker 3>which is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have chickens,</v>

944
00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:59.231
<v Speaker 3>I have 24 chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lay eggs every day and they don't </v>

945
00:42:59.231 --> 00:43:01.991
<v Speaker 3>care if you take them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chickens never become a chicken because </v>

946
00:43:01.991 --> 00:43:05.171
<v Speaker 3>there's no rooster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they just lay an egg and you can eat </v>

947
00:43:05.171 --> 00:43:07.211
<v Speaker 3>that egg and it's super healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would they have a problem with eating </v>

948
00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:07.211
<v Speaker 3>human eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

949
00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:11.860
<v Speaker 3>I have a joke about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about if your wife was in the period </v>

950
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:11.860
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every month,</v>

951
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.590
<v Speaker 3>once a year or once a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>

952
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.030
<v Speaker 3>they had an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped an egg,</v>

953
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:20.710
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you do if it can't become a </v>

954
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.710
<v Speaker 3>person?</v>

955
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.710
<v Speaker 3>We just let it go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ate it,</v>

956
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:22.590
<v Speaker 3>throw it in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let it fucking go.</v>

957
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Finalize your food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>

958
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:29.111
<v Speaker 3>Like why do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we so speciesist about what </v>

959
00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:29.111
<v Speaker 3>species where we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've,</v>

960
00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've eaten dog in Vietnam.</v>

961
00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:32.130
<v Speaker 3>And did you eat dog?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

962
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that like?</v>

963
00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Not Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That weird you out?</v>

964
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of felt like,</v>

965
00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:42.731
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost felt like it was a moral </v>

966
00:43:42.731 --> 00:43:44.621
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to do so because I eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>pigs which are at least as intelligent </v>

967
00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:45.110
<v Speaker 3>as jugs and show as much empathy as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug's.</v>

968
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.540
<v Speaker 3>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is it morally consistent for me to</v>

969
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:49.970
<v Speaker 3>be okayed and bacon and not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

970
00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Eating dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just bias.</v>

971
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 3>My friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ada Coyote.</v>

972
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

973
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 3>It was for a mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Steve Rinella,</v>

974
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 3>because he was tired of people asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

975
00:43:58.371 --> 00:44:03.371
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hunting show and he's very </v>

976
00:44:03.371 --> 00:44:03.920
<v Speaker 3>unusual for hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very educated,</v>

977
00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:05.750
<v Speaker 3>very well read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very articulate,</v>

978
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 3>and he was tired of people asking him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever eaten a coyote?</v>

979
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.810
<v Speaker 3>So fucking shot a coyote and ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It cooked,</v>

980
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Speaker 3>cooked it on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

981
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know it wasn't bad.</v>

982
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I guess mates mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

983
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:23.030
<v Speaker 3>It varies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean certainly varies.</v>

984
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference between some </v>
<v Speaker 3>forms of meat.</v>

985
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to say that all that.</v>

986
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:29.900
<v Speaker 3>However you rise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mate,</v>

987
00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>it's all the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think a wild</v>

988
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 1>species of wild species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have flesh that is edible.</v>

989
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Most likely edible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of anybody eating a </v>

990
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:41.800
<v Speaker 1>wolf except for that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gray thing on that,</v>

991
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.820
<v Speaker 1>but it tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's certain animals to </v>

992
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.081
<v Speaker 1>just tastes really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a friend just got back from Africa </v>

993
00:44:51.081 --> 00:44:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and he said the one thing that the local</v>
<v Speaker 1>villagers will not eat.</v>

994
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:54.000
<v Speaker 1>His hyena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

995
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.760
<v Speaker 1>they'll even eat lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine that they'll eat lion.</v>

996
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Mountain Lion is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

997
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:05.511
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to all these hunters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that mountain lion and there's all </v>

998
00:45:05.511 --> 00:45:05.511
<v Speaker 1>these mountain lion rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I googled it.</v>

999
00:45:05.511 --> 00:45:07.050
<v Speaker 1>There's mountain lion recipes online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 1>They say it tastes like pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1001
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why you say kangaroo a lot.</v>

1002
00:45:11.821 --> 00:45:16.821
<v Speaker 1>Back in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an increasingly popular </v>

1003
00:45:16.821 --> 00:45:16.821
<v Speaker 1>maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is a real great.</v>

1004
00:45:16.821 --> 00:45:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Like Venice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very gamey and lean.</v>

1005
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Really delicious.</v>

1006
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:23.750
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how fucking muscular </v>

1007
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1008
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen the video of the kangaroo </v>
<v Speaker 1>choking the other kangaroo unconscious?</v>

1009
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.550
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1010
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I probably opposed to see this as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an Australian.</v>

1011
00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly recent.</v>

1012
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.540
<v Speaker 1>These two kangaroos are involved in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and this one kangaroo gets this </v>

1013
00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.261
<v Speaker 1>other kangaroo and a fucking choke hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his arms and clamps down on the </v>

1014
00:45:42.261 --> 00:45:46.311
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos neck and literally gets into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu position and puts this fucking </v>

1015
00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo and the kangaroo just </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses.</v>

1016
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Meet good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chokes the blood out of it has to have </v>

1017
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a thought process behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

1018
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1019
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an interesting.</v>

1020
00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It's such an interesting species in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and flowing.</v>

1021
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:05.810
<v Speaker 1>The reason why Australia has all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird animals is because it broke off </v>

1022
00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:06.960
<v Speaker 1>from the rest of the continents in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company before,</v>

1023
00:46:06.961 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 1>only the other students.</v>

1024
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:10.320
<v Speaker 1>That was our logo one hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years,</v>

1025
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.200
<v Speaker 1>so there's a parallel evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

1026
00:46:13.201 --> 00:46:18.201
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at the face of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo and you look at the face of a </v>

1027
00:46:18.201 --> 00:46:18.201
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar,</v>

1028
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.480
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They occupy basically the same </v>

1029
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.730
<v Speaker 1>ecological niche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because Australia was a here at his </v>

1030
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.730
<v Speaker 1>video will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1031
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 1>check the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Australia broke off so early.</v>

1032
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:31.000
<v Speaker 1>They would just get these random like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1033
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 1>The beauty of I love evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just so interesting because</v>

1034
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:39.441
<v Speaker 1>I guess they've got longer distances to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross in Australia and they did </v>

1035
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:39.441
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere and it's dry and arid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some reason.</v>

1036
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:40.580
<v Speaker 1>They just stopped bouncing it basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>bouncing,</v>

1037
00:46:40.581 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 1>dear wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on two legs.</v>

1038
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.180
<v Speaker 1>The other weird that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a.</v>

1039
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.300
<v Speaker 1>there's an animal called the diker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a type of antelope that lives </v>

1040
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:54.801
<v Speaker 1>in the Congo that can actually swim </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater as much as a hundred yards </v>

1041
00:46:54.801 --> 00:46:57.890
<v Speaker 1>and eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking carnivorous antelope.</v>

1042
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 1>They've all evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently with the Congo used to be was</v>

1043
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.320
<v Speaker 1>grasslands and as the climate changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became a rain forest and as it became</v>

1044
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:12.321
<v Speaker 1>a rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these animals that are </v>

1045
00:47:12.321 --> 00:47:13.380
<v Speaker 1>traditionally grassland animals became </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped like rhinos.</v>

1046
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:18.410
<v Speaker 1>There's rhinos that are trapped in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rain forest of the Congo and all these </v>

1047
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:22.050
<v Speaker 1>antelope and deer that are running </v>
<v Speaker 1>through these swamps and the swampy like</v>

1048
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.090
<v Speaker 1>forest thick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

1049
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:29.091
<v Speaker 1>thick wooded areas and this one animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to get smaller</v>

1050
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.280
<v Speaker 3>and actually swim under one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are these short little legs good for </v>

1051
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:35.280
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy though,</v>

1052
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 3>and this all happened over a period of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 2000 years.</v>

1053
00:47:37.451 --> 00:47:39.360
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1054
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 3>The very short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is true.</v>

1055
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating thing about the </v>

1056
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1057
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This area where these natural selection,</v>

1058
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be some other force at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No natural selection</v>

1059
00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:53.730
<v Speaker 4>full of jeans that quickly and just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of thousand years,</v>

1060
00:47:53.731 --> 00:47:54.480
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you.</v>

1061
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously I'm not a geneticist,</v>

1062
00:47:56.641 --> 00:48:01.641
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's been some evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>of extreme changes in evolution over a </v>

1063
00:48:01.641 --> 00:48:03.360
<v Speaker 3>very short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for instance,</v>

1064
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:07.800
<v Speaker 3>people that live in Hewitt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that live in the extreme northern</v>

1065
00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:12.801
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've developed this ability to not </v>

1066
00:48:12.801 --> 00:48:15.621
<v Speaker 3>get frostbite and to also keep their </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands warm and extreme cold conditions </v>

1067
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.980
<v Speaker 3>and they believe that this has happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>between a 10,000</v>

1068
00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:23.160
<v Speaker 3>plus years ago when the ice bridge </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the,</v>

1069
00:48:23.161 --> 00:48:28.161
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bering strait between the Asian </v>

1070
00:48:28.161 --> 00:48:28.800
<v Speaker 3>continent and the North American </v>
<v Speaker 3>continent existed,</v>

1071
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.130
<v Speaker 3>but they could travel back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people that still live there,</v>

1072
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.390
<v Speaker 3>they have literally changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've changed to absorb.</v>

1073
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.670
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess if someone,</v>

1074
00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:39.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can imagine that if someone,</v>

1075
00:48:39.171 --> 00:48:42.800
<v Speaker 4>if a kid is born with a propensity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>not get frostbite in his fingers,</v>

1076
00:48:42.801 --> 00:48:47.330
<v Speaker 4>then he's more likely to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to procreate than someone who doesn't.</v>

1077
00:48:47.331 --> 00:48:49.610
<v Speaker 4>And that can shake itself out over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>course of general.</v>

1078
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.860
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly that,</v>

1079
00:48:51.861 --> 00:48:55.010
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something I believe,</v>

1080
00:48:55.011 --> 00:49:00.011
<v Speaker 3>and this is just me talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something that I believe about </v>

1081
00:49:00.011 --> 00:49:01.160
<v Speaker 3>life where it finds a way life finds a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way just like these,</v>

1082
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 3>when they first discovered that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>life at the bottom of the ocean and </v>

1083
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:06.680
<v Speaker 3>these crazy volcanic dream of files and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1084
00:49:06.681 --> 00:49:11.681
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of these tiny little animals that </v>

1085
00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:14.300
<v Speaker 3>just aren't incredibly hot volcanic </v>
<v Speaker 3>vents in temperature.</v>

1086
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.590
<v Speaker 3>So that's why when they look at like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moon Europa,</v>

1088
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.260
<v Speaker 3>one of Jupiter's moons and it's covered </v>
<v Speaker 3>in ice,</v>

1089
00:49:21.261 --> 00:49:23.960
<v Speaker 3>but there's water underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is going on in her?</v>

1090
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.190
<v Speaker 3>That's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:49:25.191 --> 00:49:30.191
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be some lifeforms that </v>

1092
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:30.191
<v Speaker 3>reminds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reminds</v>

1093
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 4>me when you said something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said something a moment ago about </v>

1094
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 4>the moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1095
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.830
<v Speaker 4>about morality and dod.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1096
00:49:33.831 --> 00:49:38.831
<v Speaker 4>Dolphins and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was interviewing Neil degrasse Tyson </v>

1097
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:40.580
<v Speaker 4>about extraterrestrial life and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying like one,</v>

1098
00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.820
<v Speaker 4>there is a fear that maybe as </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilizations become as intelligent as </v>

1099
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:49.721
<v Speaker 4>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they kind of extinguish themselves </v>

1100
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:52.811
<v Speaker 4>once they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they get the capacity to destroy </v>

1101
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:52.811
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that within a few centuries or millennia</v>

1102
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:55.640
<v Speaker 4>they sort of do and that that's why the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe doesn't seem to be teeming with</v>

1103
00:49:55.641 --> 00:49:58.160
<v Speaker 4>life and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1104
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:02.600
<v Speaker 4>I think that if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you evolve to a position where you're</v>

1105
00:50:02.601 --> 00:50:07.601
<v Speaker 4>able to destroy yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's another type and those </v>

1106
00:50:07.601 --> 00:50:10.120
<v Speaker 4>basically saying like if what if </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraterrestrial civilizations did come </v>

1107
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:10.970
<v Speaker 4>and visit us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1108
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:16.150
<v Speaker 4>Stephen Hawking says that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>worst possible scenario there where </v>

1109
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 4>there are no instances of advanced </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilizations meeting less civilized </v>

1110
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.330
<v Speaker 4>civilizations and it going well for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>less developed civilization.</v>

1111
00:50:23.331 --> 00:50:23.750
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1112
00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:28.751
<v Speaker 4>just look at what happens on our planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would that if an extraterrestrial </v>

1113
00:50:28.751 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 4>civilization came and visited us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would they just exterminate us or use us</v>

1114
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:35.741
<v Speaker 4>as their slaves and Neil degrasse Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 4>and saying if they had gotten so </v>

1115
00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:40.060
<v Speaker 4>advanced that they were capable of </v>
<v Speaker 4>traveling across the cosmos then and </v>

1116
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:43.150
<v Speaker 4>they hadn't destroyed themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you would like to think that they'd</v>

1117
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.070
<v Speaker 4>been a moral evolution as well as just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>natural physical,</v>

1118
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:50.690
<v Speaker 4>biological evolution and that they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>not do that because otherwise they would</v>

1119
00:50:50.691 --> 00:50:51.920
<v Speaker 4>have killed themselves before they got </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1120
00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the counter that would be obviously </v>

1121
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.601
<v Speaker 3>that if they did develop this and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>came over here and they realize how </v>

1122
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 3>fucking scary we are with nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons and sucking every fish out of </v>

1123
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:07.350
<v Speaker 3>the ocean and polluting every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>place we get a chance to set up shop.</v>

1124
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't they see us as a threat to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire ecosystem of the planet if we </v>

1125
00:51:12.901 --> 00:51:17.901
<v Speaker 3>were just leaving nuclear waste as we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>done in holes in the ground in Nevada </v>

1126
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 3>and polluting Fukushima to the point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're trying to figure out how </v>

1127
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:25.701
<v Speaker 3>to dig a hole and freeze the outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hole so they could fill the hole up </v>

1128
00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:29.541
<v Speaker 3>with nuclear waste that will be toxic </v>
<v Speaker 3>for longer than there have been humans </v>

1129
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.280
<v Speaker 3>in this particular shape that we find </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves in now.</v>

1130
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back to 200,000</v>

1131
00:51:35.011 --> 00:51:40.011
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with essentially a </v>

1132
00:51:40.011 --> 00:51:40.011
<v Speaker 3>different kind of human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1133
00:51:40.011 --> 00:51:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you go to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1134
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 3>what does that like a million years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then whatever the lower hominids </v>

1135
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.460
<v Speaker 3>were before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to take 200,000</v>

1136
00:51:47.461 --> 00:51:49.440
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of like a monkey person.</v>

1137
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're talking about with</v>

1139
00:51:53.341 --> 00:51:54.900
<v Speaker 3>this fucking toxic waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.710
<v Speaker 3>We're talking like hundreds of thousands</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years of toxicity.</v>

1141
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.870
<v Speaker 3>It's horrifyingly are responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot believe.</v>

1142
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1143
00:52:01.591 --> 00:52:03.300
<v Speaker 3>And if you were an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1144
00:52:03.301 --> 00:52:08.301
<v Speaker 3>you would look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at these crazy pink monkeys with </v>

1145
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:08.460
<v Speaker 3>their fucking bang sticks and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear waste.</v>

1146
00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:12.450
<v Speaker 3>You guys are assholes that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at the history of how we treat</v>

1147
00:52:12.451 --> 00:52:14.520
<v Speaker 3>other species on this planet and how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>treat each other.</v>

1148
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.480
<v Speaker 3>This is a very undeveloped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is the.</v>

1149
00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:23.400
<v Speaker 3>This is as undeveloped as you can be and</v>
<v Speaker 3>still be civilized.</v>

1150
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:25.590
<v Speaker 3>I use that term is sort of in quotation </v>
<v Speaker 3>marks,</v>

1151
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.740
<v Speaker 3>civilizing comparison to chimps that eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>your face off.</v>

1152
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I just made civilized in that you </v>

1153
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.430
<v Speaker 3>can build spacecraft and conk up </v>
<v Speaker 3>arithmetic and stuff.</v>

1154
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and send video through the sky and into </v>

1155
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 3>someone else's phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all.</v>

1156
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:45.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're obviously super fucking advanced </v>

1157
00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:45.220
<v Speaker 3>for what we know of in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1158
00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.881
<v Speaker 3>we're good toolmakers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're about as undeveloped like </v>

1159
00:52:49.881 --> 00:52:51.210
<v Speaker 3>morally and intellectually as you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be and still be a toolmaker this good,</v>

1160
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 3>but is it possible that that is a part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of why we develop things in the first </v>

1161
00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:01.071
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're trying to do battle with our </v>

1162
00:53:01.071 --> 00:53:01.071
<v Speaker 3>instincts and that we're trying to in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

1163
00:53:01.071 --> 00:53:05.840
<v Speaker 3>in our desire to innovate and our desire</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create new technology and expand our </v>

1164
00:53:08.011 --> 00:53:13.011
<v Speaker 3>capabilities that we're also doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of combat what we really are </v>

1165
00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:17.991
<v Speaker 3>primarily this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this deep urge that we have to fuck and </v>

1166
00:53:17.991 --> 00:53:22.350
<v Speaker 3>to kill and to feed ourselves and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep and all these biological urges.</v>

1167
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:24.150
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to fight against that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to.</v>

1168
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:29.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at every space movie that </v>

1169
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 3>talks about like the future and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

1170
00:53:30.181 --> 00:53:35.181
<v Speaker 3>everyone is super calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all like reading minds or </v>

1171
00:53:35.181 --> 00:53:38.391
<v Speaker 3>they're doing things with their hands </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one's physical because no one </v>

1172
00:53:38.391 --> 00:53:39.570
<v Speaker 3>doing crossfit in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1173
00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:44.190
<v Speaker 3>If you look at this fucking movies about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future,</v>

1174
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:49.191
<v Speaker 3>no one said yoked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no dudes that are fuck who's </v>

1175
00:53:49.191 --> 00:53:49.191
<v Speaker 3>pushing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

1176
00:53:49.191 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 3>10 more pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's none of that in the future.</v>

1177
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.820
<v Speaker 3>The future is not a physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The future is we've evolved past the </v>

1178
00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:59.451
<v Speaker 3>physical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're communicating with our minds were </v>

1179
00:53:59.451 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 3>levitating things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not using kinetic energy,</v>

1180
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 3>we're not using muscle and</v>

1181
00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.550
<v Speaker 4>bone and blood and maybe that will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

1182
00:54:04.551 --> 00:54:09.551
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing that fascinates me is </v>

1183
00:54:09.551 --> 00:54:09.551
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen with artificial </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence and you know,</v>

1184
00:54:09.551 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 4>there are guys like Ray Kurzweil who </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks that within the lifetimes we're </v>

1185
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:14.860
<v Speaker 4>gonna be able to upload our intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 4>into computers.</v>

1186
00:54:14.861 --> 00:54:17.450
<v Speaker 4>And I was actually speaking to an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was interviewing,</v>

1187
00:54:17.451 --> 00:54:19.630
<v Speaker 4>I do another podcast called point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>inquiry,</v>

1188
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:24.631
<v Speaker 4>which is for the center for inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that it's a nonprofit that spreads </v>

1189
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:24.790
<v Speaker 4>science and reason and secularism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Atheism.</v>

1190
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 4>And I was speaking to one of these guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>who works in the field of </v>

1191
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.580
<v Speaker 4>extraterrestrial life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what he,</v>

1192
00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:36.610
<v Speaker 4>he literally gets paid to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to plan for what we will have to do if </v>

1193
00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:40.420
<v Speaker 4>we discover civilizations in other parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the galaxy.</v>

1194
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just lost my train of thought about </v>

1195
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 4>how I got onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1196
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eh.</v>

1197
00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:49.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1198
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:52.990
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why haven't we found an extraterrestrial</v>

1199
00:54:52.991 --> 00:54:53.800
<v Speaker 4>civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet?</v>

1200
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:54.550
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1201
00:54:54.551 --> 00:54:59.551
<v Speaker 4>maybe the reality is that biological </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence as biological civilizations</v>

1202
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 4>quickly find a way to turn themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial and we're looking for the </v>

1203
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.311
<v Speaker 4>wrong thing we're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're looking for biological </v>

1204
00:55:08.311 --> 00:55:10.591
<v Speaker 4>civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it may well be the case that within </v>

1205
00:55:10.591 --> 00:55:12.421
<v Speaker 4>a few centuries we will all be in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will all be intelligences living </v>

1206
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:16.141
<v Speaker 4>inside of kind of computers and the the </v>
<v Speaker 4>need for biological human beings will </v>

1207
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:16.270
<v Speaker 4>have passed.</v>

1208
00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I think that's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1209
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:24.130
<v Speaker 3>if we do develop something that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial that is far better than what </v>

1210
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:28.421
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the argument of why we keep the </v>

1211
00:55:28.421 --> 00:55:30.330
<v Speaker 3>biological life alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a road map.</v>

1212
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.480
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we need to shit and piss and eat </v>

1213
00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:35.480
<v Speaker 3>and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we need to do that?</v>

1214
00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we only need to do that because that's </v>

1215
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.041
<v Speaker 3>the best option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we come up with something in a </v>

1216
00:55:42.041 --> 00:55:45.371
<v Speaker 3>laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they slowly they've combined spider </v>

1217
00:55:45.371 --> 00:55:49.631
<v Speaker 3>silk and human cells and created an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial skin that is bulletproof.</v>

1218
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all proof of concept right now,</v>

1219
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:56.840
<v Speaker 3>but they believe they will be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>develop artificial human skin.</v>

1220
00:55:56.841 --> 00:55:57.190
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking,</v>

1221
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 4>I want to be bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make it happen.</v>

1222
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then people would be shooting </v>

1223
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Speaker 4>everybody and fuck you worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're already a sort of,</v>

1224
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm agnostic as to whether or not,</v>

1225
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:10.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big philosophical question rather</v>

1226
00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:15.111
<v Speaker 4>than a scientific question as to whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>or not a computer could feel the way </v>

1227
00:56:15.111 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 4>that I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether I like this.</v>

1228
00:56:16.951 --> 00:56:18.670
<v Speaker 4>This is taking for granted this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1229
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:22.340
<v Speaker 4>this assumption that Ray Kurzweil style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>singularity assumption takes,</v>

1230
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 4>takes for granted a fundamental premise </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have trouble taking for granted,</v>

1231
00:56:27.881 --> 00:56:32.800
<v Speaker 4>which is that if you added up all of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>data that's in my head right now and you</v>

1232
00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:37.801
<v Speaker 4>put that into a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have to be obviously a much </v>

1233
00:56:37.801 --> 00:56:37.801
<v Speaker 4>more sophisticated computer than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything we have right now,</v>

1234
00:56:37.801 --> 00:56:42.391
<v Speaker 4>but assuming that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that computer essentially would be </v>

1235
00:56:42.391 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would feel like me.</v>

1236
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 4>I would be in the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's a.</v>

1237
00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 4>that's a question for philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

1238
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:53.280
<v Speaker 4>That's not a question for science </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what we really don't know is </v>

1239
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What under under goods.</v>

1240
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.770
<v Speaker 4>My experience of being myself.</v>

1241
00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I also think there's an issue with why's</v>
<v Speaker 3>it so important to be you?</v>

1242
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so important to be a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do like you but you like you </v>

1243
00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:10.571
<v Speaker 3>because it's the only thing you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever known and this is the highest form </v>

1244
00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:13.721
<v Speaker 3>of life that we know currently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you think about how many people </v>

1245
00:57:13.721 --> 00:57:15.590
<v Speaker 3>are fucking depressed and saddled down </v>
<v Speaker 3>with emotions and relationships and just</v>

1246
00:57:15.591 --> 00:57:20.591
<v Speaker 3>the stuff we're talking about today </v>
<v Speaker 3>involving racism and homophobia and all </v>

1247
00:57:20.591 --> 00:57:24.551
<v Speaker 3>these issues and social justice warriors</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking Uber Conservative shitheads </v>

1248
00:57:24.551 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 3>and if you look at all of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have to deal with just because </v>

1249
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:29.480
<v Speaker 3>of the fact that we're biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifeforms,</v>

1250
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:34.780
<v Speaker 3>existing and cultures and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different emotions that we have to </v>

1251
00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.230
<v Speaker 3>struggle with on daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we could figure out a way to just </v>

1252
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:40.250
<v Speaker 3>shut that off with a switch and be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightened robot.</v>

1253
00:57:40.251 --> 00:57:45.251
<v Speaker 3>Things who are far better don't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease and figure out a way to </v>

1254
00:57:45.351 --> 00:57:50.351
<v Speaker 3>experience pleasure and it's in a level </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is just unprecedented body.</v>

1255
00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Last week I have</v>

1256
00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:54.360
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me the part of the messiness of being</v>

1257
00:57:54.361 --> 00:57:58.710
<v Speaker 4>human being is the complexity part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the beauty of creativity,</v>

1258
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:03.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me is being fucked up a bit like </v>

1259
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:03.810
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1260
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:04.620
<v Speaker 4>perfection would be a boring state</v>

1261
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:10.400
<v Speaker 3>if you could create wormholes and travel</v>
<v Speaker 3>to distant galaxies and all sorts of </v>

1262
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:15.600
<v Speaker 3>forms with zero emotion and just pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>love because it's been created and </v>

1263
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:20.130
<v Speaker 3>silicone fucking plates and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly through the galaxy with no worry </v>

1264
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:21.450
<v Speaker 3>about not being able to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1265
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in my personal experience that</v>

1266
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:25.930
<v Speaker 4>without the troughs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the peaks and meaningless,</v>

1267
00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I believe that we should have stayed </v>
<v Speaker 3>single celled organisms because all this</v>

1268
00:58:29.201 --> 00:58:31.600
<v Speaker 3>fucking splitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just been super complicated.</v>

1269
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.270
<v Speaker 3>If we were single celled organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no racism,</v>

1270
00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:39.271
<v Speaker 3>we'd have no murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Single celled organisms don't have gun </v>

1271
00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:39.271
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1272
00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:39.271
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't fucking,</v>

1273
00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:42.040
<v Speaker 3>they don't eat anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fucking boring job that boy,</v>

1274
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:47.041
<v Speaker 3>are we in comparison to these artificial</v>
<v Speaker 3>life forms that can travel to different </v>

1275
00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:47.041
<v Speaker 3>galaxies.</v>

1276
00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the beauty of Shakespeare and </v>

1277
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.890
<v Speaker 4>colleridge and shelly and like the great</v>
<v Speaker 4>art that we've ever produced is the,</v>

1278
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.240
<v Speaker 4>is the fact that it touches something </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of us that is,</v>

1279
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:02.230
<v Speaker 4>that can be contrasted against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up nurse of the rest of our,</v>

1280
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:07.440
<v Speaker 4>of the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the human condition is an </v>

1281
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.991
<v Speaker 4>interesting thing with preserving maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I like the West speaking as if we </v>

1282
00:59:09.991 --> 00:59:14.791
<v Speaker 4>have the option not to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we will just kind of figuring out </v>

1283
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:14.791
<v Speaker 4>whether or not we should flip the switch</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this.</v>

1284
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're still a long way from that switch.</v>

1285
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:16.290
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

1286
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.090
<v Speaker 3>think go back to when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1287
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200,000</v>

1288
00:59:19.111 --> 00:59:20.640
<v Speaker 3>years ago when we were the weird monkey </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1289
00:59:20.641 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>if someone along and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1290
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 3>I know we haven't figured out language </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

1291
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 3>but I'm gonna I'm just explained to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of twitter,</v>

1292
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking a monkey.</v>

1293
00:59:29.531 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1294
00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:30.310
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1295
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to find food in my area.</v>

1296
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:37.361
<v Speaker 3>There's a beauty to starving is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a meter running from leopards </v>

1297
00:59:37.361 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 3>and climbing up trees to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>

1298
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:44.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a beautiful thing to have a </v>

1299
00:59:44.561 --> 00:59:44.561
<v Speaker 3>seven year lifespan if you're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky.</v>

1300
00:59:44.561 --> 00:59:49.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it depends what we're talking </v>

1301
00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.001
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the fucked up most of the human </v>

1302
00:59:51.001 --> 00:59:51.001
<v Speaker 4>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would agree with you that if you could</v>

1303
00:59:51.001 --> 00:59:53.080
<v Speaker 4>get rid of mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could get rid of unnecessary,</v>

1304
00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:58.530
<v Speaker 4>a self doubt and self criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that would probably be a positive </v>

1305
00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:02.191
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that wouldn't be left with purely </v>

1306
01:00:02.191 --> 01:00:02.191
<v Speaker 4>positive emotions that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd want to be.</v>

1307
01:00:02.191 --> 01:00:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Who wants to be on an ecstasy trip their</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire life?</v>

1308
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take it.</v>

1309
01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it would be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>

1310
01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1311
01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:15.300
<v Speaker 3>we live as if this idea of emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle is a necessity to happiness and</v>

1312
01:00:15.971 --> 01:00:20.971
<v Speaker 3>that happiness isn't a necessity to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful life and what is a meaningful</v>

1313
01:00:21.221 --> 01:00:22.810
<v Speaker 3>life if it is all just temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1314
01:00:22.811 --> 01:00:27.811
<v Speaker 3>life is finite and there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no arguing that right now at </v>

1315
01:00:27.811 --> 01:00:27.811
<v Speaker 3>least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1316
01:00:27.811 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 3>what is meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are all these things other than </v>

1317
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.310
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these quantities that we attach to our </v>

1318
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:35.560
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1319
01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm more happy now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm less happy when I do this.</v>

1320
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm more fulfilled when I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all these things are a part of </v>

1321
01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.691
<v Speaker 3>the biological reality that we live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we equate the significance of our </v>

1322
01:00:50.231 --> 01:00:53.950
<v Speaker 3>existence to these biological reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day,</v>

1323
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:57.400
<v Speaker 3>we're just fucking and breeding and </v>
<v Speaker 3>continuing to make new TV sets.</v>

1324
01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>

1325
01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:01.000
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the human race as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole,</v>

1326
01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:06.001
<v Speaker 3>this gigantic super organism that </v>
<v Speaker 3>continues to make smaller cell phones </v>

1327
01:01:06.001 --> 01:01:06.640
<v Speaker 3>and fucking faster cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1328
01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:10.900
<v Speaker 3>What exactly is the significance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What exactly is the meaning?</v>

1329
01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.140
<v Speaker 3>If ultimately what we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>polluting the ocean and pulling out all </v>

1330
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.610
<v Speaker 3>the fish and damaging the atmosphere and</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing the fucking the Gulf stream and</v>

1331
01:01:18.611 --> 01:01:23.611
<v Speaker 3>all those nutty shit that we're a part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of as a byproduct of all these emotions </v>

1332
01:01:23.611 --> 01:01:25.270
<v Speaker 3>and desire from materialism and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different things.</v>

1333
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:30.810
<v Speaker 3>If we can avoid all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we could live as solar powered </v>

1334
01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:32.560
<v Speaker 3>creatures that are made a carbon fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

1335
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.380
<v Speaker 3>sure it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1336
01:01:35.381 --> 01:01:39.370
<v Speaker 3>we say no because we are this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can't stay this.</v>

1337
01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.590
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to have 10 million years</v>
<v Speaker 3>go by and we come back to 2014.</v>

1338
01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:46.330
<v Speaker 3>We look how fucking goofy this argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1339
01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.390
<v Speaker 3>These dumb motherfuckers wanted to stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1340
01:01:49.391 --> 01:01:49.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1341
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.190
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1342
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I take your point and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that,</v>

1343
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:57.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the kernel of insight there </v>

1344
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.530
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's precious is the,</v>

1345
01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:03.250
<v Speaker 4>is the fact that we've essentially got </v>
<v Speaker 4>it ass backwards about how you find </v>

1346
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:03.250
<v Speaker 4>meaning and happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1347
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think even as biological human beings,</v>

1348
01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:10.601
<v Speaker 4>we can still do a hell of a lot better </v>
<v Speaker 4>job than we currently do about </v>

1349
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:13.901
<v Speaker 4>contextualizing what happiness is like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It always frustrates me when people </v>

1350
01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:18.521
<v Speaker 4>whine about not being happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happiness for me is a byproduct have </v>

1351
01:02:19.201 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 4>made doing things that I'm good at and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that contribute in some way.</v>

1352
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1353
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 4>don't sit around like chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more you chase happiness,</v>

1354
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:31.641
<v Speaker 4>it's like squeezing the soap in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand too hard and it just slips right </v>

1355
01:02:31.641 --> 01:02:34.221
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more you specifically try to focus </v>

1356
01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:34.221
<v Speaker 4>on chasing happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the less happy you are.</v>

1357
01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:37.740
<v Speaker 4>Just get on with your life and do stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's good and happiness will just be a</v>

1358
01:02:37.741 --> 01:02:38.580
<v Speaker 4>byproduct of that.</v>

1359
01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point as a person and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think another thing that makes you </v>

1360
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:46.501
<v Speaker 3>happy is to be around happy people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to give each other things like as far as</v>

1361
01:02:47.111 --> 01:02:52.111
<v Speaker 3>like friendship and love and </v>
<v Speaker 3>companionship and and laughter and like </v>

1362
01:02:52.451 --> 01:02:57.451
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give and you know you experienced </v>

1363
01:02:57.451 --> 01:02:59.210
<v Speaker 3>from each other and you know you bond </v>
<v Speaker 3>together by yourself sucks.</v>

1364
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.900
<v Speaker 3>You know by yourself is okay in small </v>
<v Speaker 3>doses,</v>

1365
01:03:01.901 --> 01:03:05.950
<v Speaker 3>but find some of the most miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry people and you find a lot of times</v>

1366
01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:07.250
<v Speaker 3>those people have no love in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

1367
01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big issue.</v>

1368
01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Sean Hannity fucking shot love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all from retards.</v>

1369
01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.400
<v Speaker 3>He's got those nine volt batteries out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1370
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:19.330
<v Speaker 3>We're going to close up our borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean,</v>

1371
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:25.250
<v Speaker 3>once they invent jetpacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those borders are going to be </v>

1372
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:27.421
<v Speaker 3>fucking meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just gonna be flying through the </v>

1373
01:03:27.421 --> 01:03:27.421
<v Speaker 3>air and you're gonna have to scoop </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans out of the sky with nets.</v>

1374
01:03:27.421 --> 01:03:31.921
<v Speaker 3>Is nobody going to be able to stop them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we're going to have to just </v>

1375
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:31.921
<v Speaker 3>assimilate and deal with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1376
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:36.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all sharing this planet together </v>

1377
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:36.691
<v Speaker 3>and this idea of borders is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>

1378
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:41.400
<v Speaker 3>This idea that you were born in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>patch of dirt so you don't have </v>

1379
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.500
<v Speaker 3>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm born on this patch of dirt so I </v>

1380
01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.490
<v Speaker 3>got fucking gun rights flow can freedom </v>
<v Speaker 3>and American Eagle tattooed on my back.</v>

1381
01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's going to get a shit ton more </v>
<v Speaker 4>rich though before we can get rid of </v>

1382
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 4>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think so?</v>

1383
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:51.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because otherwise,</v>

1384
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that that's a good thing.</v>

1385
01:03:53.491 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fact on the ground.</v>

1386
01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if every Indian and Chinese person who </v>

1387
01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 4>was able to move to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then a large proportion of them would.</v>

1388
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:07.881
<v Speaker 4>And then you kind of get you free </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare because you afraid you can </v>

1389
01:04:07.881 --> 01:04:07.881
<v Speaker 4>afford you a free healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that America has free healthcare,</v>

1390
01:04:07.881 --> 01:04:09.540
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't,</v>

1391
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:14.541
<v Speaker 4>you can't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an old saying that you can </v>

1392
01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:14.541
<v Speaker 4>either have a welfare state or you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>have open borders,</v>

1393
01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 4>be kind of both,</v>

1394
01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:20.080
<v Speaker 3>or you can have utopia when we all </v>
<v Speaker 3>become carbon based life forms that are </v>

1395
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:20.080
<v Speaker 3>made out of</v>

1396
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.850
<v Speaker 4>lot of libertarians would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just get rid of the welfare state and </v>

1397
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:24.850
<v Speaker 4>get rid of the borders and let every man</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of fend for himself.</v>

1398
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.180
<v Speaker 4>But I'm a big believer that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the great humanizing,</v>

1399
01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:33.450
<v Speaker 4>socializing forces of the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the development of the welfare </v>

1400
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:37.051
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the new deal and the idea that we </v>

1401
01:04:37.051 --> 01:04:37.360
<v Speaker 4>have a sort of societal obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of one another.</v>

1402
01:04:37.361 --> 01:04:39.130
<v Speaker 4>I think it works well in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries,</v>

1403
01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:44.131
<v Speaker 4>especially in Scandinavian countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>with willow and Denmark and works well </v>

1404
01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:44.131
<v Speaker 4>in Australia and New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1405
01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.840
<v Speaker 4>and open borders will put an end to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1406
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a good thing that the </v>

1407
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.951
<v Speaker 3>welfare state does if it's attached to </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong ideas and a strong philosophy of </v>

1408
01:04:56.671 --> 01:05:01.671
<v Speaker 3>self improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the welfare state is </v>

1409
01:05:01.671 --> 01:05:04.491
<v Speaker 3>that Unsung folks with given some </v>
<v Speaker 3>backgrounds and given some behavior </v>

1410
01:05:04.491 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 3>patterns that people have fallen into </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it can lead to complacency.</v>

1411
01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just clarify what I mean by </v>

1412
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:12.220
<v Speaker 4>welfare state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be a slightly American term.</v>

1413
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1414
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.180
<v Speaker 4>I just mean providing unified universal </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare for everyone,</v>

1415
01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>providing free tertiary education or </v>
<v Speaker 4>discounted education and not burning</v>

1416
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.670
<v Speaker 1>people with student loans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1417
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>taking care of old people to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>globally.</v>

1418
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly healthcare is expensive.</v>

1419
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Expensive in this country already spends</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 14 or 17 percent of.</v>

1420
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:37.021
<v Speaker 1>It's an entire GDP on healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we would only need to double that </v>

1421
01:05:37.021 --> 01:05:40.980
<v Speaker 1>or triple that to bankrupt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you would certainly do more than </v>

1422
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:40.980
<v Speaker 1>triple that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing 100 fold if you will.</v>

1423
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.641
<v Speaker 1>You can do it 20 fold if you expanded it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world because the United States </v>

1424
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>is wildly one 20th of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

1425
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you take out the amount of money </v>

1426
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>that we spend on military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money we sent it.</v>

1427
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the whole world was assimilated and </v>

1428
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>that sort of sense would still not still</v>
<v Speaker 1>not close.</v>

1429
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1430
01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:57.150
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1431
01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.410
<v Speaker 1>we spend like a sixth of the GDP on </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>

1432
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so insane.</v>

1433
01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1434
01:06:01.811 --> 01:06:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and we get outcomes in this country that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are inferior to,</v>

1435
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 1>to other countries that have socialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we spend on military.</v>

1436
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we should look that up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if we could spend.</v>

1437
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1438
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1439
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the argument.</v>

1440
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 1>We don't need war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need doctors and gun food.</v>

1441
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

1442
01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 1>we spend way too much on the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>way more than we need to.</v>

1443
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America spends more than the next.</v>

1444
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.710
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine or 10 nations combined.</v>

1445
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Those nations are friendly nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who are you?</v>

1446
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from depending on pay to find </v>

1447
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:35.100
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

1448
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:35.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this for?</v>

1449
01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:38.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a jobs if fucking jobs programs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep everybody down.</v>

1450
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Flex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flex on motherfuckers,</v>

1451
01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 1>make sure nobody gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

1452
01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>that's why we have military bases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a hundred different countries.</v>

1453
01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real expense though is when I say </v>

1454
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:52.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a job program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally every the lowliest have made </v>

1455
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:55.351
<v Speaker 1>sure that every state of America </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially has a vested interest in </v>

1456
01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:59.611
<v Speaker 1>keeping their Faq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their munitions factory going like one </v>

1457
01:06:59.611 --> 01:07:03.481
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be they build nuclear submarines </v>

1458
01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:03.481
<v Speaker 1>and another state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be this instead of.</v>

1459
01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Instead of having it concentrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they very explicitly made a political </v>

1460
01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.190
<v Speaker 1>case to make sure that all political </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituencies across the country have a</v>

1461
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.930
<v Speaker 1>local vested interest in maintaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mill,</v>

1462
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>their little piece of the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex,</v>

1463
01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:21.061
<v Speaker 1>which means we're producing know fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>jets that the Pentagon says they don't </v>

1464
01:07:21.061 --> 01:07:22.480
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need simply because the local</v>

1465
01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:23.590
<v Speaker 1>representative will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1466
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:24.660
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to cancel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1467
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose certain jobs in my district.</v>

1468
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1469
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:31.621
<v Speaker 1>if it's a jobs program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let's admit that it's a jobs </v>

1470
01:07:31.621 --> 01:07:31.621
<v Speaker 1>program and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1471
01:07:31.621 --> 01:07:31.621
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1472
01:07:31.621 --> 01:07:35.970
<v Speaker 1>That is the way that we've chosen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver welfare in this country by </v>

1473
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:35.970
<v Speaker 1>giving people jobs in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the military that,</v>

1474
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.150
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't need them to do.</v>

1475
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we really need to do is declare war</v>

1476
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:42.130
<v Speaker 1>on poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we declare war on poverty,</v>

1477
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>then we'll make money out of eliminating</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>

1478
01:07:44.501 --> 01:07:49.501
<v Speaker 1>The same way we have the war on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war on drugs is essentially a war </v>

1479
01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1480
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a job factory the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>

1481
01:07:53.021 --> 01:07:58.021
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a job hustle the same way military </v>

1482
01:07:58.021 --> 01:07:58.021
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the military.</v>

1483
01:07:58.021 --> 01:08:02.371
<v Speaker 1>There's certain places where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military is a viable option for people </v>

1484
01:08:02.371 --> 01:08:04.000
<v Speaker 1>that are in poor neighborhoods that need</v>
<v Speaker 1>some form of income.</v>

1485
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1486
01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.660
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant and oftentimes,</v>

1487
01:08:07.661 --> 01:08:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're poor,</v>

1488
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:10.510
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a minority then.</v>

1489
01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And so you kind of have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that other people do.</v>

1490
01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military is a great option.</v>

1491
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And another option would be to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug dealer.</v>

1492
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>So the military is a good option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

1494
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to fix this josh steps.</v>

1495
01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1496
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're doing a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:28.860
<v Speaker 1>You and I think we're on.</v>

1498
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've got it.</v>

1499
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I think we've fixed about 30 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's problems so far today.</v>

1500
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think that this pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll,</v>

1501
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll get it done a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of this conversation.</v>

1502

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1527
01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would realize that'd be.</v>

1528
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:41.171
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be facing as long as you had a </v>

1529
01:09:41.171 --> 01:09:43.721
<v Speaker 1>lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really get deep with them and break it </v>

1530
01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:47.441
<v Speaker 1>down because a guy like that can keep up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking hustle and shuffle for like </v>

1531
01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:47.441
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes.</v>

1532
01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 1>It would either be interesting or it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be interesting at all.</v>

1533
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.680
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I was talking to mark Marin </v>

1534
01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 1>in that interview on Friday about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he'd want to interview a </v>

1535
01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.180
<v Speaker 1>rush limbaugh on his show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1536
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.800
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1537
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I'd ever get through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the charade.</v>

1538
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I've never really had a nice little bug </v>
<v Speaker 1>or oxycontins on murder for you.</v>

1539
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Come on son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's shake it.</v>

1540
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Shake it.</v>

1541
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Shake it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this.</v>

1542
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be amazing if you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys on drugs and just take</v>

1543
01:10:17.181 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 1>them down the rabbit hole and really get</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you do Iowaska.</v>

1544
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't rush limbal see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1545
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:25.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of screaming.</v>

1546
01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Fucking being pulled apart by a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vomiting,</v>

1547
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:32.861
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shooting just to load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be a lot of lot of bodily </v>

1548
01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:32.861
<v Speaker 1>fluids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be pretty.</v>

1549
01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:36.761
<v Speaker 1>I take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that thought experiment </v>

1550
01:10:36.761 --> 01:10:36.761
<v Speaker 1>would be willing to be around him </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting his.</v>

1551
01:10:36.761 --> 01:10:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I could see all the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just think of a lot of these </v>

1552
01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:44.711
<v Speaker 1>people that have been incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive of war and the military </v>

1553
01:10:44.711 --> 01:10:45.410
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seeing the repercussions,</v>

1554
01:10:45.411 --> 01:10:47.810
<v Speaker 1>the possible repercussions of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>support in,</v>

1555
01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:52.370
<v Speaker 1>in some sort of manifested in some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a spiritual form that would be very,</v>

1556
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 1>very terrifying.</v>

1557
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Advocate presence to the impact of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of what their part of.</v>

1558
01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the drugs that that guy is into </v>

1559
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 1>the disassociative drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1560
01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.360
<v Speaker 1>someone who's into like the oxys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's into like something just </v>

1561
01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.400
<v Speaker 1>like the narcotics that Zonk you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even not even a hannity like,</v>

1562
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:10.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I saw one thing that I'm pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate is,</v>

1564
01:11:13.611 --> 01:11:18.611
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the push to get rid of nuclear </v>

1565
01:11:18.611 --> 01:11:18.611
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1566
01:11:18.611 --> 01:11:21.740
<v Speaker 1>This is a perfectly achievable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that Ronald Reagan was </v>

1567
01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.411
<v Speaker 1>passionate about as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a right wing or left wing </v>

1568
01:11:24.411 --> 01:11:26.901
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a recognition that if we have </v>

1569
01:11:26.901 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nukes in the world at some point,</v>

1570
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:31.380
<v Speaker 1>eventually we're gonna use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to get them.</v>

1571
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1572
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:37.990
<v Speaker 1>we can't as they say in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the nuclear security guy and you can </v>

1573
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:37.990
<v Speaker 1>be right.</v>

1574
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>90 nine point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1575
01:11:40.021 --> 01:11:40.500
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1576
01:11:40.501 --> 01:11:41.010
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1577
01:11:41.011 --> 01:11:46.011
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that instilled destroy the world </v>

1578
01:11:46.011 --> 01:11:49.270
<v Speaker 1>when you've got thousands of nukes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>social on Hannity saying like railing </v>

1579
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:53.750
<v Speaker 1>against this and saying you the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop nuclear weapons is to have more </v>

1580
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons in the United States so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bad guys won't use them.</v>

1581
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:58.200
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you even like?</v>

1582
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Are you even close to being present to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact of what you're saying,</v>

1583
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>like it's so fucking wildly out of touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any grand,</v>

1584
01:12:06.611 --> 01:12:11.611
<v Speaker 1>a big attempt to to think beyond just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the momentary immediate talking point in</v>

1585
01:12:13.171 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 1>the most obvious reflexive knee jerk </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

1586
01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:19.650
<v Speaker 1>like step back for a second and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are in the world.</v>

1587
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also not supported by the history </v>

1588
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.830
<v Speaker 1>of suicide bombings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1589
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:27.630
<v Speaker 1>The history of suicide bombings in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is pretty fucking extensive.</v>

1590
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:32.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that have taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own life and a bunch of other </v>

1591
01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 1>people's lives with them because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they were doing it for some holy</v>

1592
01:12:34.321 --> 01:12:39.321
<v Speaker 1>purpose or some martyrdom or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone can do that with a nuclear </v>

1593
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:41.820
<v Speaker 1>weapon and that is a reality of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

1594
01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real question though is,</v>

1595
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:48.650
<v Speaker 1>is it too late?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is can you take the salt out of the </v>

1596
01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:51.411
<v Speaker 1>ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to extract all the </v>

1597
01:12:51.411 --> 01:12:51.480
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons and figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make some sort of a deal?</v>

1598
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.220
<v Speaker 1>At the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem to be.</v>

1599
01:12:53.221 --> 01:12:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well with the exception of North Korea,</v>

1600
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do a deal,</v>

1601
01:12:57.931 --> 01:12:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1602
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone could get on board and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look if you want to have one,</v>

1603
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.260
<v Speaker 1>if you want to keep one nuclear weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then then do it.</v>

1604
01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:06.110
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this going up?</v>

1605
01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Defense Budgets from 2012 of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries and then the US.</v>

1606
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a bit.</v>

1607
01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:12.960
<v Speaker 1>You've got one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1608
01:13:12.961 --> 01:13:13.650
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

1609
01:13:13.651 --> 01:13:14.310
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

1610
01:13:14.311 --> 01:13:14.910
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

1611
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 1>nine at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the next 10 countries and it's</v>

1612
01:13:18.181 --> 01:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>less than the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six hundred and 82 billion.</v>

1613
01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And so looking at those countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only country there that say that's a</v>

1614
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>of a rival really is Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is a,</v>

1615
01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about China and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll uh,</v>

1616
01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll have a peaceful </v>

1617
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 1>coexistence with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the UK,</v>

1618
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

1619
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this shit holes,</v>

1620
01:13:39.151 --> 01:13:44.151
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to use a tiny amount </v>

1621
01:13:44.151 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 1>so small in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious ball.</v>

1622
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:49.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a shit textile with go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1623
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1624
01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:56.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird situation when you think </v>

1625
01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.690
<v Speaker 1>about a thousand years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will we still have this whole,</v>

1626
01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:03.350
<v Speaker 1>this whole mutually assured destruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing hanging over our heads a thousand </v>

1627
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:04.190
<v Speaker 1>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see it.</v>

1628
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Will we have figured out a way past </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1629
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1630
01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>isn't it all about the emotions and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greed and all the stuff that comes along</v>

1631
01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>being a biological life</v>

1632
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:17.100
<v Speaker 3>form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it all about all the stuff that </v>

1633
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.621
<v Speaker 3>comes from being this troubled monkey </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's trying to assimilate with cell </v>

1634
01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 3>phones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she asked him</v>

1635
01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.270
<v Speaker 4>ability to triumph over that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1636
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.280
<v Speaker 4>one of the most touching things this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this past weekend was the 25th </v>

1637
01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:28.280
<v Speaker 4>anniversary of the fall of the Berlin </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wall.</v>

1638
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:33.590
<v Speaker 4>You don't want the great triumphs of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of human civilization is the fact that </v>

1639
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:35.190
<v Speaker 4>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as nasty as it was,</v>

1640
01:14:35.191 --> 01:14:40.191
<v Speaker 4>as brutal as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't end in mutually assured </v>

1641
01:14:40.191 --> 01:14:40.191
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>

1642
01:14:40.191 --> 01:14:41.240
<v Speaker 4>these monkeys managed to rise above </v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

1643
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.370
<v Speaker 4>their worst selves and come to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>better nature.</v>

1644
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:49.430
<v Speaker 4>And on several occasions came really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really close to destroying themselves </v>

1645
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:51.540
<v Speaker 4>like the Cuban missile crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And didn't good for us.</v>

1646
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Good for its pilot complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pat Yourself on your back.</v>

1647
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1648
01:14:55.801 --> 01:15:00.801
<v Speaker 4>Well we figured out when we watched </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hiroshima and Nagasaki that this could </v>

1649
01:15:00.801 --> 01:15:04.791
<v Speaker 4>be a fucking mess globally and somehow </v>
<v Speaker 4>or another we managed to stumble to 2014</v>

1650
01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:09.150
<v Speaker 4>and kill a lot of fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not with nuclear weapons.</v>

1651
01:15:09.151 --> 01:15:09.900
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1652
01:15:09.901 --> 01:15:14.901
<v Speaker 4>there was a single nuclear weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the tightened to which we </v>

1653
01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:16.230
<v Speaker 4>have loads of either hundreds or </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands,</v>

1654
01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:20.100
<v Speaker 4>which has the explosive power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more explosive power,</v>

1655
01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.520
<v Speaker 4>much more explosive power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then every single bomb dropped in World </v>

1656
01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.750
<v Speaker 4>War II by all parties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</v>

1657
01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's on renamed my deck.</v>

1658
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Tightened to</v>

1659
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 4>rename.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know that they had all these other names</v>

1660
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:43.450
<v Speaker 4>called Titan one a column.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is it?</v>

1661
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Enola Gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The plane.</v>

1662
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:48.280
<v Speaker 4>I think that</v>

1663
01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:52.080
<v Speaker 3>it's nice to see that we haven't done </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1664
01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:57.170
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to see that we haven't blowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other up since 1945 or whatever it </v>

1665
01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:57.170
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>

1666
01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:59.160
<v Speaker 3>40th five when we dropped the bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to see that.</v>

1667
01:15:59.161 --> 01:16:04.161
<v Speaker 3>We have not done that since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's such a small amount of time in </v>

1668
01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:04.500
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

1669
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:06.120
<v Speaker 4>That's why we have to get rid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1670
01:16:06.121 --> 01:16:11.121
<v Speaker 4>I think we've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've stumbled onto something that is </v>

1671
01:16:11.121 --> 01:16:14.690
<v Speaker 4>far more advanced technologically than </v>
<v Speaker 4>our emotional capability has to handle.</v>

1672
01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's like you've been given.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've given a monkey the,</v>

1673
01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:21.480
<v Speaker 4>you know the keys to a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just gotTa.</v>

1674
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:22.770
<v Speaker 4>You just gotTa take the keys back.</v>

1675
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also the people that have this are </v>

1676
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:30.371
<v Speaker 3>not the people that built it and created</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and engineered it and understand it,</v>

1677
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:35.830
<v Speaker 3>and so the discipline involved in doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things in the accomplishment </v>

1678
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:39.371
<v Speaker 3>of creating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that did create it were </v>

1679
01:16:39.371 --> 01:16:40.280
<v Speaker 3>absolutely horrified at it being used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The oppenheimer quote,</v>

1680
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fucking terrifying.</v>

1681
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.360
<v Speaker 3>We can end on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We like Oppenheimer quoting the Bhagavad</v>

1682
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:49.610
<v Speaker 3>Gita and seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it.</v>

1683
01:16:49.611 --> 01:16:53.180
<v Speaker 3>I've read the quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking amazing because you see the</v>

1684
01:16:53.181 --> 01:16:57.220
<v Speaker 3>pain in this guys face like the als is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the face of death or whatever that is.</v>

1685

<v Speaker 3>of worlds and he,</v>

1717
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Just cut the fucking oppenheimer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1718
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:41.660
<v Speaker 3>You know this drama bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

1719
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

1720
01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:46.290
<v Speaker 6>The world would not be the same.</v>

1721
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Look at his face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1722
01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:53.880
<v Speaker 6>Kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shoot.</v>

1723
01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.340
<v Speaker 6>People cried.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Both people were silent.</v>

1724
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:04.690
<v Speaker 6>I remembered the line from the Hindu </v>
<v Speaker 6>scripture,</v>

1725
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:09.700
<v Speaker 6>the Bhagavad Gita.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1726
01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.720
<v Speaker 6>trying to persuade the prince that he </v>
<v Speaker 6>should do his duty to impress him.</v>

1727
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:26.440
<v Speaker 6>Takes on multi armed form,</v>
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>

1728
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.060
<v Speaker 6>now I am become death.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The destroyer of worlds.</v>

1729
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:36.430
<v Speaker 6>I suppose we all put that on way or </v>
<v Speaker 6>another.</v>

1730
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chills up my fucking.</v>

1731
01:19:40.501 --> 01:19:40.600
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

1732
01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:45.690
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see his face and you realize </v>

1733
01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:48.381
<v Speaker 3>that this is a scientist that </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially was given the task of </v>

1734
01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:52.260
<v Speaker 3>creating this incredibly destructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>device and if he didn't,</v>

1735
01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:57.290
<v Speaker 3>if they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the enemy would have and they saw </v>

1736
01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:00.471
<v Speaker 3>what was going on with Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Third Reich was taking over Europe </v>

1737
01:20:00.471 --> 01:20:02.880
<v Speaker 3>and killing everybody and what was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in the Holocaust,</v>

1738
01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:06.670
<v Speaker 3>and they just realized that we're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this unwinnable situation,</v>

1739
01:20:06.671 --> 01:20:07.930
<v Speaker 3>someone to do something.</v>

1740
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.990
<v Speaker 4>It's completely bombed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely understandable.</v>

1741
01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:13.990
<v Speaker 4>The scientists like to blame the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists for doing it,</v>

1742
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:15.820
<v Speaker 4>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you can see,</v>

1743
01:20:15.821 --> 01:20:17.740
<v Speaker 4>morally conflicted about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Fineman,</v>

1744
01:20:17.741 --> 01:20:19.720
<v Speaker 4>one of the greatest physicists of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>20th century,</v>

1745
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 4>worked on it and then campaign for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of his life for denuclearization </v>

1746
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.860
<v Speaker 4>and he died of cancer because he kept </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to these nuclear testing zones and</v>

1747
01:20:26.861 --> 01:20:29.170
<v Speaker 4>dumb and protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how firemen died.</v>

1748
01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:29.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hang on.</v>

1749
01:20:29.861 --> 01:20:34.861
<v Speaker 4>That was Carl Sagan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sagan died from cancer because of his </v>

1750
01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:39.080
<v Speaker 4>anti nuclear protests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fireman was also very conflicted </v>

1751
01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:39.080
<v Speaker 4>about his role in in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in all of that.</v>

1752
01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.570
<v Speaker 4>It's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1753
01:20:40.571 --> 01:20:43.030
<v Speaker 4>you had to do it at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in hindsight,</v>

1754
01:20:43.031 --> 01:20:43.730
<v Speaker 4>just imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1755
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:47.590
<v Speaker 4>think of a world where there is no nukes</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just another like the idea of a</v>

1756
01:20:47.591 --> 01:20:52.591
<v Speaker 4>single bomb wiping out an entire city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You used to have to fly sorties over </v>

1757
01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Dresden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>24 slash seven,</v>

1758
01:20:56.111 --> 01:20:58.680
<v Speaker 4>just raining bombs on something just to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1759
01:20:58.690 --> 01:20:59.200
<v Speaker 4>to destroy.</v>

1760
01:20:59.210 --> 01:21:04.210
<v Speaker 4>So you may one bomb killing thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of people </v>

1761
01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:09.240
<v Speaker 4>potentially nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Millions of people from one bomb one </v>

1762
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:09.340
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one instant,</v>

1763
01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:10.690
<v Speaker 4>and we got up to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1764
01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.220
<v Speaker 4>when we're in the height of the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>War,</v>

1765
01:21:12.221 --> 01:21:17.221
<v Speaker 4>we were producing hundreds of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think was hundreds a day at the peak.</v>

1766
01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:18.250
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1767
01:21:18.251 --> 01:21:20.230
<v Speaker 4>it was no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were producing more than one an hour.</v>

1768
01:21:20.231 --> 01:21:21.540
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1769
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 4>we will produce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will produce what we ended up with over </v>

1770
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 4>10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1771
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:30.560
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember it's like in the tens of </v>

1772
01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:30.730
<v Speaker 4>thousands of nukes that we had </v>
<v Speaker 4>stockpiled.</v>

1773
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:32.710
<v Speaker 4>We've now brought that considerably </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

1774
01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:37.120
<v Speaker 4>but we still have thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of nukes for everyone.</v>

1775
01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Many times over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could kill everyone on earth many </v>

1776
01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:42.210
<v Speaker 3>times over.</v>

1777
01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could kill not only every one,</v>

1778
01:21:42.651 --> 01:21:46.070
<v Speaker 4>but like everything we could blanket the</v>
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>

1779
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look back at history and the </v>

1780
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 3>horrible things that human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 3>done to each other without bombs,</v>

1781
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at the amount of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mongols regularly killed.</v>

1782
01:21:57.031 --> 01:22:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean the estimation is between 20 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>$50.</v>

1783
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Million people during Genghis Khan's </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and they did that with horses,</v>

1784
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.690
<v Speaker 3>horseback and arrows and catapults and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1785
01:22:06.691 --> 01:22:09.420
<v Speaker 3>And they killed cities with a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1786
01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 3>They wiped the entire city out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that with no weapons other than</v>

1787
01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:14.960
<v Speaker 3>standard shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:17.160
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot more work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not more work,</v>

1789
01:22:17.161 --> 01:22:21.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's the idea behind it that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying that people can be so fucking</v>

1790
01:22:21.991 --> 01:22:26.991
<v Speaker 3>brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that you give the same </v>

1791
01:22:26.991 --> 01:22:28.320
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ability to do the same thing with a</v>

1792
01:22:28.321 --> 01:22:29.160
<v Speaker 3>press of a button.</v>

1793
01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:34.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the ease of it that is so kind of </v>

1794
01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:35.090
<v Speaker 4>bone chilling about nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's similar to people who,</v>

1795
01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:36.740
<v Speaker 4>who are big guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns,</v>

1796
01:22:36.741 --> 01:22:37.700
<v Speaker 4>rights defenders will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1797
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:42.710
<v Speaker 4>we're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Hutus and Tutsis had each other to </v>

1798
01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:42.710
<v Speaker 4>death with machetes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't need guns.</v>

1799
01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.030
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true,</v>

1800
01:22:44.031 --> 01:22:49.031
<v Speaker 4>but it's just you have to really care </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it more to kill someone with a </v>

1801
01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:49.031
<v Speaker 4>machete than we've been by pulling a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger.</v>

1802
01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:50.570
<v Speaker 4>It's just a lot easier and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1803
01:22:50.571 --> 01:22:55.571
<v Speaker 4>If nukes you have really you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are able to achieve spontaneously </v>

1804
01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:59.861
<v Speaker 4>with almost no effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that would otherwise take a </v>

1805
01:22:59.861 --> 01:22:59.861
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of effort and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forethought.</v>

1806
01:22:59.861 --> 01:23:04.140
<v Speaker 3>What scares me the most about the gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate is not the concept of whether or </v>

1807
01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:08.851
<v Speaker 3>not people should have checks whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not people should have access to </v>

1808
01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:13.801
<v Speaker 3>automatic weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the ignoring of the psychotropic </v>

1809
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:18.390
<v Speaker 3>drugs that people are on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the ignoring of human,</v>

1810
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One's legal.</v>

1811
01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:24.271
<v Speaker 3>One's the ignoring of all the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>instances of people either being on </v>

1812
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>withdrawing from antidepressants,</v>

1813
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:32.311
<v Speaker 3>getting off their medication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and having unbelievably erratic </v>

1814
01:23:32.311 --> 01:23:32.311
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1815
01:23:32.311 --> 01:23:36.720
<v Speaker 3>if you ever looked at like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistics for massive mass shootings </v>

1816
01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:41.640
<v Speaker 3>and how many of those people were on </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotropic drugs are coming off of </v>

1817
01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 3>them or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or withdrawing from them.</v>

1818
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.090
<v Speaker 3>It's almost all of them.</v>

1819
01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a,</v>

1820
01:23:44.161 --> 01:23:44.890
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1821
01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.610
<v Speaker 4>there's an ambiguous causation chain </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1822
01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1823
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:51.510
<v Speaker 4>Is it the drugs or is it because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy and that's why they are taking the</v>

1824
01:23:51.511 --> 01:23:51.870
<v Speaker 4>drugs?</v>

1825
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:54.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a very good question and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1826
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:59.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I deviate from a lot of guns rights </v>

1827
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:02.221
<v Speaker 3>advocates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that we should have some </v>

1828
01:24:02.221 --> 01:24:04.171
<v Speaker 3>sort of background checks or don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should have stability checks or the </v>

1829
01:24:04.171 --> 01:24:08.551
<v Speaker 3>very least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come you don't have to have a </v>

1830
01:24:08.551 --> 01:24:10.771
<v Speaker 3>license?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come you have to take a test to </v>

1831
01:24:10.771 --> 01:24:13.720
<v Speaker 3>drive a fucking car?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone stands over you and looks at you</v>

1832
01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:18.721
<v Speaker 3>and everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that weird feeling of being in the </v>

1833
01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:22.080
<v Speaker 3>nervousness of being in the car with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving instructor that's asking her a </v>

1834
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.821
<v Speaker 3>tester that's asking you a few questions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and seeing if you stop perfectly at a </v>

1835
01:24:27.371 --> 01:24:30.820
<v Speaker 3>stop sign and whether or not you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>both ways before you make a turn,</v>

1836
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:34.690
<v Speaker 3>but you could just go buy a gun and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one has to look at you.</v>

1837
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 3>No one has to ask you if you know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking load that.</v>

1838
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Honestly done understanding the gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate in this,</v>

1839
01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:41.360
<v Speaker 4>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1840
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:45.460
<v Speaker 4>It does not even compute for me because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1841
01:24:45.461 --> 01:24:49.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand why the gun lobbies </v>
<v Speaker 4>against all of that sort of stuff.</v>

1842
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1843
01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:53.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a huge issue with people </v>
<v Speaker 4>having firearms.</v>

1844
01:24:53.231 --> 01:24:57.550
<v Speaker 4>I do basically think that that in dense </v>
<v Speaker 4>urban areas,</v>

1845
01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.760
<v Speaker 4>you should not be packing a gun unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like a unique one because you're </v>

1846
01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:03.050
<v Speaker 4>a celebrity or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1847
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:08.430
<v Speaker 4>but I don't understand why the NRA </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks that background checks and </v>

1848
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.430
<v Speaker 4>licensing and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>

1849
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:13.410
<v Speaker 4>is a paranoid and they think that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a slippery slope and that that's going </v>

1850
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:15.190
<v Speaker 4>to lead to guns being taken away in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

1851
01:25:15.191 --> 01:25:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Or is it actually those simple </v>
<v Speaker 4>precautions that they,</v>

1852
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:20.950
<v Speaker 4>that they on principle objective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't figure it out because it doesn't</v>

1853
01:25:20.951 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 4>make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could massively reduce the number</v>

1854
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:28.201
<v Speaker 4>of people who are being slaughtered in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this country constantly every day,</v>

1855
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:30.610
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you?</v>

1856
01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the slope thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

1857
01:25:32.791 --> 01:25:35.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a slippery slope argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1858
01:25:35.221 --> 01:25:40.221
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like we were talking about with a </v>

1859
01:25:40.221 --> 01:25:40.221
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1860
01:25:40.221 --> 01:25:43.980
<v Speaker 3>that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the extreme reaction towards </v>

1861
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:48.050
<v Speaker 3>doing something that I believe is </v>
<v Speaker 3>morally correct and,</v>

1862
01:25:48.170 --> 01:25:52.440
<v Speaker 3>and fighting for objectified people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for marginalized people.</v>

1863
01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:57.650
<v Speaker 3>That this is in reaction to the racism </v>
<v Speaker 3>or sexual exploitation and all the </v>

1864
01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:59.010
<v Speaker 3>different things that have occurred on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side of the spectrum.</v>

1865
01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:01.490
<v Speaker 3>And this is what in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1866
01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:06.491
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in sort of an analogous way they're to </v>

1867
01:26:06.491 --> 01:26:08.381
<v Speaker 3>do with gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're trying to do is fight off </v>

1868
01:26:08.381 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 3>any form of possible gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight off any background checks,</v>

1869
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 3>fight off any waiting periods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding periods,</v>

1870
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.360
<v Speaker 3>fight off magazine size restrictions or,</v>

1871
01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.110
<v Speaker 4>and yet like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was saying about,</v>

1872
01:26:19.170 --> 01:26:20.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the,</v>

1873
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:24.870
<v Speaker 4>the Sui pox of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cancel Kobe is of the world.</v>

1874
01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm losing potential allies in people </v>
<v Speaker 4>like me.</v>

1875
01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:31.740
<v Speaker 4>That just completely alienates me from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gun rights movement,</v>

1876
01:26:31.741 --> 01:26:32.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if,</v>

1877
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.050
<v Speaker 4>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the conversation was around,</v>

1878
01:26:34.410 --> 01:26:39.410
<v Speaker 4>should it be legal or illegal for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who is saying who is provably </v>

1879
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:42.210
<v Speaker 4>sane and who undergoes a test to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that they know how to,</v>

1880
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:47.270
<v Speaker 4>how to safely use a firearm and is </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible and can keep it locked up </v>

1881
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.270
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at home,</v>

1882
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:49.590
<v Speaker 4>should they be able to have a basic </v>
<v Speaker 4>firearm,</v>

1883
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:54.830
<v Speaker 4>then you're not going to get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispute from almost anyone apart from </v>

1884
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:56.280
<v Speaker 4>the most extreme people on the anti gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>sight and there are very few people like</v>

1885
01:26:56.281 --> 01:26:58.020
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you alienate,</v>

1886
01:26:58.021 --> 01:27:03.021
<v Speaker 4>you lose an ally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you lose a potential ally and someone </v>

1887
01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:05.451
<v Speaker 4>like me by being so rabidly against what</v>
<v Speaker 4>I regard as being simple precautions for</v>

1888
01:27:07.231 --> 01:27:09.270
<v Speaker 4>the responsible use of something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>could kill people.</v>

1889
01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you,</v>

1890
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:12.500
<v Speaker 3>but I think that this is what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with.</v>

1891
01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:13.720
<v Speaker 3>We're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

1892
01:27:13.721 --> 01:27:18.721
<v Speaker 3>there are many groups that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a famous obama quote </v>

1893
01:27:18.721 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 3>where he was talking about how people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are just resistant.</v>

1894
01:27:20.451 --> 01:27:21.580
<v Speaker 3>They don't just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1895
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:22.820
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>

1896
01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:26.990
<v Speaker 3>they don't want us to come and take </v>
<v Speaker 3>their guns and these people were furious</v>

1897
01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 3>that Obama would think that he has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to come and take their guns.</v>

1898
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:35.891
<v Speaker 3>Like who are you as a person to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>another person they cannot have this gun</v>

1899
01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:39.770
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of people that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>love guns in this country.</v>

1900
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:44.950
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that are gun nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Justin is a fucking gun nut </v>

1901
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:49.690
<v Speaker 3>everyday that dudes at the range </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting targets like a 900 yard </v>

1902
01:27:49.690 --> 01:27:51.170
<v Speaker 3>distance and fucking pinging metal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1903
01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:56.240
<v Speaker 3>it's like bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think because you shooting that fucking </v>

1904
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:56.240
<v Speaker 3>far away.</v>

1905
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Like you can actually hear it after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gunshot goes off.</v>

1906
01:27:57.930 --> 01:28:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good fat.</v>

1907
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.580
<v Speaker 3>He's got a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1908
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.170
<v Speaker 3>No one's known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taken his guns.</v>

1909
01:28:03.171 --> 01:28:06.690
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's there in the constitution amendment</v>

1910
01:28:06.691 --> 01:28:07.790
<v Speaker 3>to the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

1911
01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:12.791
<v Speaker 3>Whereas about things changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll think about the privacy </v>

1912
01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:12.791
<v Speaker 3>amendments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about what's,</v>

1913
01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 3>what's happening right now with the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is unconstitutional.</v>

1914
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:16.250
<v Speaker 3>What's happening that didn't do any good</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

1915
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:19.280
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing as far as like spying</v>
<v Speaker 3>on everyone cell phone,</v>

1916
01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:24.281
<v Speaker 3>being able to record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's messaged as data center that </v>

1917
01:28:24.281 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 3>did developing in Utah is going because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the supreme court is stacked with a very</v>

1918
01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:28.160
<v Speaker 3>tough types of people who gun nuts vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1919
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.940
<v Speaker 3>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're worried that the Thai could </v>

1920
01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:33.940
<v Speaker 3>shift with a president like Obama was </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat.</v>

1921
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.820
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had a rabidly left wings,</v>

1922
01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.860
<v Speaker 4>if you had a supreme court that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually as rapidly lift wing as the </v>

1923
01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.420
<v Speaker 4>current supreme court is right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's conceivable of course that you</v>

1924
01:28:44.421 --> 01:28:49.421
<v Speaker 4>could just rip up a portion of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitution and ignore it and </v>

1925
01:28:49.421 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 4>reinterpret it some way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Worried</v>

1926
01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.420
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you see this far fetched,</v>

1927
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:57.490
<v Speaker 3>it's so far down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think it's so far fetched that </v>

1928
01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:57.490
<v Speaker 3>they'll be able to record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Alex Jones,</v>

1929
01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:58.850
<v Speaker 3>who's a friend of mine who's arguably </v>
<v Speaker 3>very crazy,</v>

1930
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 3>but he used to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan,</v>

1931
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:06.741
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take every single phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>call that everyone makes cross the </v>

1932
01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to record it in a database</v>

1933
01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to have everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've ever said.</v>

1934
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.910
<v Speaker 3>If you ever get in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pull you over for some reason.</v>

1935
01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Some guy wants to fuck your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to put you in jail.</v>

1936
01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:19.670
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go to your [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>database and pull something out and </v>

1937
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:20.430
<v Speaker 3>taken out of context and lock you up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a cage and I would go to.</v>

1938
01:29:20.431 --> 01:29:25.431
<v Speaker 3>This guy's so fucking out of his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you look at what's going on </v>

1939
01:29:25.431 --> 01:29:28.791
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When this Edward snowden revelations </v>

1940
01:29:28.791 --> 01:29:30.900
<v Speaker 3>came out that literally they can go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your email,</v>

1941
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.210
<v Speaker 3>the employees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just metadata,</v>

1942
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.850
<v Speaker 3>all this horseshit that Obama said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not true.</v>

1943
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.120
<v Speaker 3>The employees can go to your email and </v>
<v Speaker 3>record and take anything they would </v>

1944
01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:43.110
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is unbelievable.</v>

1945
01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.420
<v Speaker 4>It's an absolute outrage that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1946
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:50.470
<v Speaker 4>This is the show in which I'm most </v>
<v Speaker 4>furious at Obama along with like </v>

1947
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:53.420
<v Speaker 4>hounding whistleblowers and leakers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecuting these,</v>

1948
01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.870
<v Speaker 4>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean in terms of,</v>

1949
01:29:55.930 --> 01:29:57.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alex Jones being right on that.</v>

1950
01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Y'All a stopped clock is right twice a </v>
<v Speaker 4>day as well.</v>

1951
01:30:00.671 --> 01:30:05.671
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because someone gets something </v>

1952
01:30:05.671 --> 01:30:08.510
<v Speaker 4>coming from Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that you can get to </v>

1953
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:11.110
<v Speaker 4>the rest of charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good.</v>

1954
01:30:11.111 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>

1955
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:13.280
<v Speaker 4>He's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1956
01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:15.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1957
01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:17.530
<v Speaker 4>I think there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we have to,</v>

1958
01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:23.730
<v Speaker 4>it's useful to sort of allocate our </v>
<v Speaker 4>concern to the fields that most deserve </v>

1959
01:30:23.730 --> 01:30:28.561
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at the moment the big concern for </v>

1960
01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:30.270
<v Speaker 4>people who like freedom is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1961
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:32.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think that's a big concern.</v>

1962
01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.710
<v Speaker 3>That's not my concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not going to happen.</v>

1963
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Take umbrage and issue with something </v>
<v Speaker 3>you said earlier about someone living in</v>

1964
01:30:40.581 --> 01:30:42.230
<v Speaker 3>a city not being able to have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1965
01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1966
01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:46.610
<v Speaker 3>isn't that like one of the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you live in densely populated area,</v>

1967
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.280
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of you being robbed is </v>
<v Speaker 3>much higher.</v>

1968
01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:54.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live in certain areas like </v>

1969
01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.321
<v Speaker 3>Detroit or Chicago where I think guns </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be a way of resolving disputes </v>

1970
01:30:56.321 --> 01:30:57.410
<v Speaker 3>between individuals even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1971
01:30:57.610 --> 01:30:59.420
<v Speaker 3>What about defending yourself?</v>

1972
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.950
<v Speaker 4>It'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1973
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Be able to use someone breaks into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and they have a gun and they're </v>

1974
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.081
<v Speaker 3>looking to kill your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think you should be able to </v>

1975
01:31:09.081 --> 01:31:09.081
<v Speaker 3>defend yourself.</v>

1976
01:31:09.081 --> 01:31:09.081
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to defend yourself.</v>

1977
01:31:09.081 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flip side of that is that if </v>

1978
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 4>everyone is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1979
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 4>you end up with,</v>

1980
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:15.380
<v Speaker 3>with far more violent cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then if everyone.</v>

1981
01:31:15.381 --> 01:31:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it so true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir?</v>

1982
01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Look at the statistics of the society is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a polite society.</v>

1983
01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I have this assistant in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in defense against this concept.</v>

1984
01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Chicago has one of the strictest gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>control laws in the country.</v>

1985
01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has the highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good example.</v>

1986
01:31:32.511 --> 01:31:37.511
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it also has an extremely high </v>

1987
01:31:37.511 --> 01:31:39.971
<v Speaker 3>level of gun violence because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to ever get the criminals to stop </v>

1988
01:31:39.971 --> 01:31:42.380
<v Speaker 3>using guns because they're illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're doing illegal shit.</v>

1989
01:31:42.381 --> 01:31:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

1990
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:47.830
<v Speaker 4>One of the things which were I agree </v>
<v Speaker 4>with with you on that is that there are </v>

1991
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:49.210
<v Speaker 4>so many guns in the states already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

1992
01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:52.340
<v Speaker 4>we're so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're so far the horse has bolted so far</v>

1993
01:31:52.341 --> 01:31:54.320
<v Speaker 4>that that closing the gate now is kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of pointless.</v>

1994
01:31:54.321 --> 01:31:55.820
<v Speaker 4>There are more guns in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are People out there?</v>

1995
01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my house are.</v>

1996
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:05.190
<v Speaker 4>I do think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the explanation for why places </v>

1997
01:32:05.190 --> 01:32:05.190
<v Speaker 4>like Chicago is so violent because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

1998
01:32:05.190 --> 01:32:06.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the point in putting in a gum,</v>

1999
01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.330
<v Speaker 4>a strict gun law now everyone's already </v>
<v Speaker 4>got guns.</v>

2000
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Well actually in defense of the reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Chicago situation is it has to do</v>

2001
01:32:13.251 --> 01:32:15.200
<v Speaker 3>with organized crime Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2002
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:19.850
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with the war on drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with gangs being control of</v>

2003
01:32:19.851 --> 01:32:22.100
<v Speaker 3>drug dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened in Chicago,</v>

2004
01:32:22.101 --> 01:32:24.740
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of destabilize the environment</v>

2005
01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:29.920
<v Speaker 3>by locking up key gang members.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend in Chicago cop and he </v>

2006
01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.361
<v Speaker 3>explained the whole situation to me what</v>
<v Speaker 3>an unbelievable clusterfuck it became </v>

2007
01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:35.120
<v Speaker 3>when they locked up certain they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2008
01:32:35.210 --> 01:32:40.210
<v Speaker 3>they went on these rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked up certain gang members and drug </v>

2009
01:32:40.210 --> 01:32:42.170
<v Speaker 3>leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug drug gang leaders.</v>

2010
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:44.960
<v Speaker 3>And when they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a power struggle ensued.</v>

2011
01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:47.060
<v Speaker 3>And then it's sort of like what's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in Mexico.</v>

2012
01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like once you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you have this power,</v>

2013
01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.090
<v Speaker 3>this power struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have this vacuum.</v>

2014
01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.290
<v Speaker 3>People try to fill the position and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just unbelievable violence.</v>

2015
01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was describing to me things that they</v>

2016
01:32:59.871 --> 01:33:03.050
<v Speaker 3>find on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of murder that they,</v>

2017
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.290
<v Speaker 3>that they encounter in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

2018
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:09.200
<v Speaker 3>it's not just disheartening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

2019
01:33:09.201 --> 01:33:11.000
<v Speaker 3>why do you stay last days?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2020
01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my job,</v>

2021
01:33:11.861 --> 01:33:12.860
<v Speaker 3>is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2022
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not happy about it,</v>

2023
01:33:14.031 --> 01:33:14.880
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2024
01:33:14.881 --> 01:33:16.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2025
01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I hope we can get a handle on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually.</v>

2026
01:33:17.781 --> 01:33:22.781
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was outlining all the different </v>

2027
01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:22.781
<v Speaker 3>issues with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2028
01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:23.000
<v Speaker 3>this has nothing to do with gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2029
01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.130
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you change the laws,</v>

2030
01:33:25.131 --> 01:33:27.410
<v Speaker 3>you would have the exact same results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has to do with profit,</v>

2031
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:29.510
<v Speaker 3>nasty with drugs and that's due at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>war on drugs.</v>

2032
01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with the fact that these </v>

2033
01:33:34.530 --> 01:33:36.011
<v Speaker 3>people can make insane amounts of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they have this insane </v>

2034
01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:36.011
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

2035
01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:36.890
<v Speaker 3>exactly what we're seeing in Mexico.</v>

2036
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexico is one of the great tragedies of </v>

2037
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:42.540
<v Speaker 4>the world at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

2038
01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:45.210
<v Speaker 4>it also provides a good counter if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be more original next time,</v>

2039
01:33:45.211 --> 01:33:50.211
<v Speaker 4>then use Mexico as the gun them because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually have really strict gun </v>

2040
01:33:50.211 --> 01:33:50.760
<v Speaker 4>laws to look at how a wash with gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence there.</v>

2041
01:33:50.761 --> 01:33:52.710
<v Speaker 4>So I take that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take that point.</v>

2042
01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.050
<v Speaker 4>I take that critique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in.</v>

2043
01:33:54.150 --> 01:33:59.150
<v Speaker 4>I think in other societies I was a big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a big fan of the fact that </v>

2044
01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:00.780
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after it had its last mass massacre mass</v>

2045
01:34:00.781 --> 01:34:05.781
<v Speaker 4>shooting in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a conservative prime minister took on </v>

2046
01:34:05.781 --> 01:34:05.940
<v Speaker 4>the gun lobby and basically outlawed </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns,</v>

2047
01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:10.941
<v Speaker 4>did a gun buy back with the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paid to collect guns and there's a huge </v>

2048
01:34:10.941 --> 01:34:11.580
<v Speaker 4>amount of misinformation on the web </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the consequences of that.</v>

2049
01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.140
<v Speaker 4>Buy a gun rights folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 people and the whole continent.</v>

2050
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of my point is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

2051
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:21.450
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of my point a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you didn't have this preexisting gun</v>

2052
01:34:21.451 --> 01:34:23.550
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real movies.</v>

2053
01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.270
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2054
01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Americans who don't,</v>

2055
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:31.430
<v Speaker 4>who haven't been to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of assume that Australia is real </v>

2056
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:33.801
<v Speaker 4>rugged outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He kind of a wild outback Steva when </v>

2057
01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Crocodile Hunter Crocodile Dundee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In reality,</v>

2058
01:34:36.391 --> 01:34:38.800
<v Speaker 4>we're a bunch of pussies where we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>live on the coasts in,</v>

2059
01:34:38.801 --> 01:34:40.400
<v Speaker 4>in several big cities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2060
01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.090
<v Speaker 4>like three cities have almost half of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire population of the country and</v>

2061
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:50.130
<v Speaker 4>we all sit around going sailing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking chardonnay and drinking and </v>

2062
01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:50.130
<v Speaker 4>sipping lattes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we didn't really need it.</v>

2063
01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Guns I fucking love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sydney is one of the time.</v>

2064
01:34:52.630 --> 01:34:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I've only been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the only place I've ever been in</v>

2065
01:34:54.911 --> 01:34:59.911
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd fucking move there in a </v>

2066
01:34:59.911 --> 01:34:59.911
<v Speaker 3>heartbeat is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit the fan.</v>

2067
01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:03.041
<v Speaker 3>If somebody decided to blow up America </v>
<v Speaker 3>or if yellowstone exploded and needed a </v>

2068
01:35:03.041 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 3>place to live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking moved to Sydney and a God damn</v>

2069
01:35:04.581 --> 01:35:05.030
<v Speaker 3>heartbeat.</v>

2070
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:10.090
<v Speaker 4>Hard to think of another city that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>just just in terms of the sheer day to </v>

2071
01:35:10.090 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 4>day standard of living as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as nice as pleasant place to be.</v>

2072
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sunshine,</v>

2073
01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.700
<v Speaker 4>the hub of the food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the friendly people,</v>

2074
01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.600
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Asian communities,</v>

2075
01:35:17.601 --> 01:35:18.920
<v Speaker 4>the Middle Eastern communities.</v>

2076
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:21.870
<v Speaker 3>The problem is you guys drive on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong side of the road to switch over.</v>

2077
01:35:21.871 --> 01:35:22.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2078
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Americans are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2079
01:35:26.071 --> 01:35:31.071
<v Speaker 3>we invented the fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you guys driving on the wrong </v>

2080
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:31.071
<v Speaker 3>side of the Goddamn Road?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what that is?</v>

2081
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell me,</v>

2082
01:35:31.981 --> 01:35:36.981
<v Speaker 3>remind me swords.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an ancient ancient thing from </v>

2083
01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:40.080
<v Speaker 3>England and that when you would pass on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horses were passing the road.</v>

2084
01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:43.350
<v Speaker 3>If you were fighting in combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would fight with your right hand.</v>

2085
01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:48.680
<v Speaker 3>So most people are right handed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the hand you would carry your </v>

2086
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.081
<v Speaker 3>sword,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you really want to be on the left </v>

2087
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:51.081
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that way if someone was on your right</v>

2088
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:51.081
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hack at them.</v>

2089
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:53.730
<v Speaker 3>If you are on the right side and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's over on your left side and you</v>

2090
01:35:53.731 --> 01:35:58.731
<v Speaker 3>have a sword,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking very difficult to reach </v>

2091
01:35:58.731 --> 01:35:58.731
<v Speaker 3>across the horse or you'd have to hack </v>
<v Speaker 3>on</v>

2092
01:35:58.731 --> 01:36:02.670
<v Speaker 4>do with there being two horses on put to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling coaches.</v>

2093
01:36:02.671 --> 01:36:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right,</v>

2094
01:36:03.601 --> 01:36:08.601
<v Speaker 4>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't explain why it was </v>

2095
01:36:08.601 --> 01:36:10.251
<v Speaker 4>different here in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why will people already using wholesome </v>

2096
01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:12.150
<v Speaker 4>cots on the righthand side here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They also use a right handed</v>

2097
01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.870
<v Speaker 3>because when we were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time we got to America,</v>

2098
01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.180
<v Speaker 3>by the time European travelers came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

2099
01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:19.340
<v Speaker 3>we were already like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck England,</v>

2100
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:24.550
<v Speaker 3>fuck your up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do shit our way over </v>

2101
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:27.161
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just go on the other side of the </v>

2102
01:36:27.161 --> 01:36:27.161
<v Speaker 3>road and then we invented cars and so we</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2103
01:36:27.161 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 3>we don't have guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2104
01:36:28.461 --> 01:36:33.461
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be further away from the </v>

2105
01:36:33.461 --> 01:36:33.461
<v Speaker 3>fucking guy shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking go on the right side.</v>

2106
01:36:33.461 --> 01:36:33.990
<v Speaker 3>I read</v>

2107
01:36:34.630 --> 01:36:35.800
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In addition to that,</v>

2108
01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:40.980
<v Speaker 4>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will wider roads here so you would </v>

2109
01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:42.460
<v Speaker 4>have two horses side by side or like for</v>
<v Speaker 4>horses or something.</v>

2110
01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Pulling Lodge at cots than you than they</v>
<v Speaker 4>had back in England and that it had </v>

2111
01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:49.450
<v Speaker 4>something to do with being in the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>position to whip the horses.</v>

2112
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:51.880
<v Speaker 4>So you didn't have to cross over your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body to with the whip.</v>

2113
01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:54.180
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2114
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking out of my ass clearly.</v>

2115
01:36:55.981 --> 01:36:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>

2116
01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.410
<v Speaker 3>But I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to my friends in England.</v>

2117
01:36:58.411 --> 01:37:01.260
<v Speaker 3>They were explaining to me that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually literally went back to the time</v>

2118
01:37:01.261 --> 01:37:06.261
<v Speaker 3>of sword fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would be on the lefthand side </v>

2119
01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:06.261
<v Speaker 3>that I just don't buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why Americans would have changed because</v>

2120
01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:08.490
<v Speaker 3>we're better when you're smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have guns,</v>

2121
01:37:08.491 --> 01:37:10.410
<v Speaker 3>we have jets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go to the moon.</v>

2122
01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.850
<v Speaker 3>This is a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot better here.</v>

2123
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why people don't love me or </v>

2124
01:37:19.670 --> 01:37:20.900
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both.</v>

2125
01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean it folks.</v>

2126
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody please.</v>

2127
01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:30.410
<v Speaker 3>There was a thing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is interesting though,</v>

2128
01:37:31.171 --> 01:37:31.700
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2129
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:36.990
<v Speaker 4>How different different cultures kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>conceive of or different nationalities </v>

2130
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:36.990
<v Speaker 4>conceive of themselves.</v>

2131
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:41.430
<v Speaker 3>More Koreans are very proud and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the North Koreans particularly </v>

2132
01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:44.470
<v Speaker 3>nationalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much so that you know,</v>

2133
01:37:44.471 --> 01:37:49.471
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy basket case of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictatorship and it's the best example </v>

2134
01:37:49.471 --> 01:37:53.610
<v Speaker 3>of the bullshit that America tries to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shove down everyone's throats about </v>

2135
01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 3>protecting people from bad people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2136
01:37:56.131 --> 01:37:58.440
<v Speaker 3>If we're really worried about protecting</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2137
01:37:58.441 --> 01:38:03.441
<v Speaker 3>is that what really why we're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan because we want to protect </v>

2138
01:38:03.441 --> 01:38:05.841
<v Speaker 3>those folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck have we not invaded North </v>

2139
01:38:05.841 --> 01:38:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Korea chartwells to logistics about </v>
<v Speaker 3>China nuclear weapons and the proximity </v>

2140
01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:11.140
<v Speaker 3>to South Korea who are allies and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this blah,</v>

2141
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:16.270
<v Speaker 3>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not even a discussion about </v>

2142
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:18.360
<v Speaker 3>mitigating the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's zero discussion.</v>

2143
01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2144
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 3>No natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking poor.</v>

2145
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:22.260
<v Speaker 3>They have to keep the lights off it.</v>

2146
01:38:22.570 --> 01:38:25.160
<v Speaker 4>They're not even strategically important</v>
<v Speaker 4>in any way.</v>

2147
01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:30.220
<v Speaker 4>Like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're basically a vessel of China and </v>

2148
01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:30.590
<v Speaker 4>that didn't matter to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just it</v>

2149
01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:32.310
<v Speaker 3>back from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was gone for a week.</v>

2150
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I was offline essentially for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much.</v>

2151
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Did fucking Dennis Rodman get Kenneth </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bay released?</v>

2152
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:43.990
<v Speaker 4>He thinks he said he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a letter right after you got </v>

2153
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:46.841
<v Speaker 4>back from one trip there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's claiming that I have not seen </v>

2154
01:38:46.841 --> 01:38:48.740
<v Speaker 4>that reported.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the uh.</v>

2155
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:54.350
<v Speaker 4>So he's reporting well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does have a relationship with Kim </v>

2156
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.350
<v Speaker 4>Jong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

2157
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:56.330
<v Speaker 4>What's that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude loves basketball.</v>

2158
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:57.670
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2159
01:38:57.710 --> 01:38:59.870
<v Speaker 4>I understand why he wants to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2160
01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:00.920
<v Speaker 4>hub.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with Dennis,</v>

2161
01:39:00.921 --> 01:39:01.820
<v Speaker 4>what's enough?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dentists?</v>

2162
01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Dennis is broke as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2163
01:39:04.551 --> 01:39:06.620
<v Speaker 3>you think about what is not in it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>dentists.</v>

2164
01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:08.270
<v Speaker 3>What does Dennis have going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>

2165
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:10.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not baffled by like,</v>

2166
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why he does it.</v>

2167
01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:14.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm baffled that he's so bought into </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2168
01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:17.400
<v Speaker 4>He seemingly so bought into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda of that regime.</v>

2169
01:39:17.401 --> 01:39:18.210
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he keeps,</v>

2170
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:23.470
<v Speaker 4>he has this stupid moral equivalency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is something that also frustrates </v>

2171
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.700
<v Speaker 4>me when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2172
01:39:23.701 --> 01:39:25.290
<v Speaker 4>because of the U.</v>
<v Speaker 4>S does bad stuff.</v>

2173
01:39:25.291 --> 01:39:30.291
<v Speaker 4>That basically means that we're not in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>position to criticize anybody else </v>

2174
01:39:30.291 --> 01:39:30.291
<v Speaker 4>because you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:39:30.291 --> 01:39:30.291
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2176
01:39:30.291 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 4>robin says he helped secure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kenneth pays really well.</v>

2177
01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:34.350
<v Speaker 4>It's nice and Kenneth Bay got released.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2178
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I've heard him say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2179
01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:36.840
<v Speaker 4>Kim Jong Kim gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2180
01:39:36.841 --> 01:39:39.660
<v Speaker 4>we here we're hear all this propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what a bad guy he is.</v>

2181
01:39:39.661 --> 01:39:40.320
<v Speaker 4>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2182
01:39:40.321 --> 01:39:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Clinton Clinton screwed Lewinsky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2183
01:39:44.490 --> 01:39:46.590
<v Speaker 4>stuff happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad stuff happens here as well.</v>

2184
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:50.070
<v Speaker 4>That's like the dumbest fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not exactly parallel dude.</v>

2185
01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:51.300
<v Speaker 4>I think that</v>

2186
01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 3>what he's probably doing is trying in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some way to.</v>

2187
01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.370
<v Speaker 3>If he goes over there on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis,</v>

2188
01:39:58.610 --> 01:40:00.800
<v Speaker 3>he has to play politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to,</v>

2189
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:02.540
<v Speaker 3>he has to say something positive about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2190
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:07.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean he has to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says negative things is going to get </v>

2191
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.750
<v Speaker 3>back to that.</v>

2192
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:10.440
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't strike me as a very smart </v>

2193
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:10.440
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

2194
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:10.440
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2195
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.000
<v Speaker 3>do you ever see him on celebrity rehab </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Dr.</v>

2196
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:14.150
<v Speaker 3>drew knew he was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awful.</v>

2197
01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a bright guy and it's,</v>

2198
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:17.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2199
01:40:17.630 --> 01:40:21.350
<v Speaker 3>he's also in a weird situation where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a whole lot of job options.</v>

2200
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I was at the k one k one is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the biggest kickboxing </v>

2201
01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.200
<v Speaker 3>organizations in the world and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a big mixed martial arts event in Los </v>

2202
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Angeles many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years ago was the,</v>

2203
01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:33.440
<v Speaker 3>not many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2204
01:40:33.441 --> 01:40:38.441
<v Speaker 3>but it was the debut of Brock Lesnar in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mixed martial arts and Dennis Rodman for</v>

2205
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:43.990
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got hired by k one to be there and like </v>

2206
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.360
<v Speaker 3>pump it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like it was very strange.</v>

2207
01:40:44.361 --> 01:40:46.510
<v Speaker 3>It was very Japanese because Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

2208
01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:49.280
<v Speaker 3>They have their big fans of pageantry at</v>
<v Speaker 3>these events.</v>

2209
01:40:49.281 --> 01:40:51.920
<v Speaker 3>And the events are often filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like huge,</v>

2210
01:40:52.090 --> 01:40:57.090
<v Speaker 3>like gigantic crowds and big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big walkthroughs and big productions and</v>

2211
01:40:57.461 --> 01:41:01.360
<v Speaker 3>explosions and fire and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Dennis Rodman is like standing at the</v>

2212
01:41:01.361 --> 01:41:02.610
<v Speaker 3>top of this things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2213
01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:07.650
<v Speaker 3>and he gave the speech and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>so dumb and awkward and he was saying </v>

2214
01:41:07.650 --> 01:41:10.060
<v Speaker 3>fuck the UFC k one is here and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different crazy shit.</v>

2215
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:12.670
<v Speaker 3>But my point is like he doesn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of money.</v>

2216
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Like he has to do things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have a lot of options.</v>

2217
01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:18.230
<v Speaker 4>So then just don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will stop or something.</v>

2218
01:41:18.231 --> 01:41:23.231
<v Speaker 4>It just frustrates me when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when stupid people talk about shit that </v>

2219
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:23.390
<v Speaker 4>unless that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's usually,</v>

2220
01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:28.720
<v Speaker 4>it's so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy and fashionable also to be </v>

2221
01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:28.720
<v Speaker 4>like anti American and to be anti.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2222
01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.740
<v Speaker 4>America's foreign policy is a basket </v>
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>

2223
01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.170
<v Speaker 4>America has done a lot of shitty stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2224
01:41:33.171 --> 01:41:36.230
<v Speaker 4>you get this also with conversations </v>
<v Speaker 4>around Islam and you know,</v>

2225
01:41:36.231 --> 01:41:38.120
<v Speaker 4>I know you've spoken to Sam Harris and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff about this,</v>

2226
01:41:38.121 --> 01:41:41.780
<v Speaker 4>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oldest old things are not equal.</v>

2227
01:41:41.781 --> 01:41:46.410
<v Speaker 4>I just interviewed an Iraqi human rights</v>
<v Speaker 4>campaigner who,</v>

2228
01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:49.760
<v Speaker 4>who has come to the US as refugee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in his early twenties.</v>

2229
01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:52.460
<v Speaker 4>He grew up under Saddam Hussein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2230
01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:56.120
<v Speaker 4>he grew up during the American </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupation and he is.</v>

2231
01:41:56.190 --> 01:42:01.190
<v Speaker 4>He'll basically frustratedly saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop saying that there isn't a problem </v>

2232
01:42:01.190 --> 01:42:05.830
<v Speaker 4>in Islam and stop saying that the US is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to blame for everything that's going </v>

2233
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:09.200
<v Speaker 4>on in the region.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have our own problems and by and when</v>

2234
01:42:09.201 --> 01:42:12.010
<v Speaker 4>leftwing people think that they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right thing by being old fashioned,</v>

2235
01:42:12.011 --> 01:42:17.011
<v Speaker 4>oblique kind of anti American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not siding with the people who </v>

2236
01:42:17.011 --> 01:42:20.051
<v Speaker 4>actually need help over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not siding with the secularists </v>

2237
01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:20.450
<v Speaker 4>over there and the and the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>care about human rights.</v>

2238
01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.700
<v Speaker 3>There's also this weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this goes back to the social justice</v>

2239
01:42:23.701 --> 01:42:28.701
<v Speaker 3>warrior thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people are allowed to criticize </v>

2240
01:42:28.701 --> 01:42:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Christianity openly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you criticize Islam,</v>

2241
01:42:31.651 --> 01:42:33.120
<v Speaker 3>you become Islamophobic.</v>

2242
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's such an overused term.</v>

2243
01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:41.850
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is not to say that there aren't </v>

2244
01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:41.850
<v Speaker 4>Islamophobes like the preacher who </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to burn the Koran.</v>

2245
01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2246
01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.080
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people are phobic in many,</v>

2247
01:42:45.081 --> 01:42:46.130
<v Speaker 3>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2248
01:42:46.131 --> 01:42:47.840
<v Speaker 3>there's Christian have hopes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2249
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:51.680
<v Speaker 3>you want to look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had Christians on my podcast that I</v>

2250
01:42:51.681 --> 01:42:56.681
<v Speaker 3>deeply enjoy rupert sheldrake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a scientist who's also a </v>

2251
01:42:56.681 --> 01:43:00.101
<v Speaker 3>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his version of Christianity is more </v>

2252
01:43:00.101 --> 01:43:02.060
<v Speaker 3>of a philosophy and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelically based.</v>

2253
01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Then I mean it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting guy and openly </v>

2254
01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.991
<v Speaker 3>Christian and he derives or he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets a lot of comfort from that and I</v>

2255
01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:17.600
<v Speaker 3>know he does it in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intelligent and well thought out </v>

2256
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.551
<v Speaker 3>way and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting point to discuss </v>

2257
01:43:21.551 --> 01:43:25.451
<v Speaker 3>with a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this Islamophobic thing like this </v>

2258
01:43:25.451 --> 01:43:29.861
<v Speaker 3>idea that if you criticize like Sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris has been accused of it on a </v>

2259
01:43:29.861 --> 01:43:30.730
<v Speaker 3>multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just Islamophobia.</v>

2260
01:43:30.731 --> 01:43:33.080
<v Speaker 3>His Islamophobic stance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2261
01:43:33.170 --> 01:43:36.110
<v Speaker 3>all religions are fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>

2262
01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:38.350
<v Speaker 3>They're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're terrible for I.</v>

2263
01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.600
<v Speaker 3>ideologies are bad for thinking they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad because they lock you into a </v>

2264
01:43:44.421 --> 01:43:46.910
<v Speaker 3>strategy or they lock you into a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>

2265
01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:52.060
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you aspire to be divine inside that </v>

2266
01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.050
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in ancient one,</v>

2267
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:57.530
<v Speaker 3>it's extremely difficult to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside the box.</v>

2268
01:43:57.770 --> 01:44:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are the oldest and most original </v>

2269
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:02.770
<v Speaker 4>incarnation of what I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning of the,</v>

2270
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:05.510
<v Speaker 4>of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is thinking in terms of labels and</v>

2271
01:44:05.511 --> 01:44:07.010
<v Speaker 4>preset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2272
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that you can just pull out of a </v>

2273
01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.871
<v Speaker 4>box and take with you rather than </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually communicating or thinking </v>

2274
01:44:13.871 --> 01:44:14.300
<v Speaker 4>originally or being authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2275
01:44:14.301 --> 01:44:15.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2276
01:44:15.210 --> 01:44:20.210
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tribes that we belong to an hour be </v>

2277
01:44:20.210 --> 01:44:22.750
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pro gay tribe or the suit or the </v>

2278
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:25.440
<v Speaker 4>cancel Kobe tribe or any of those things</v>
<v Speaker 4>are really just new small cultural </v>

2279
01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.980
<v Speaker 4>versions of the old biggest tribes which</v>
<v Speaker 4>are religion.</v>

2280
01:44:27.981 --> 01:44:32.981
<v Speaker 4>It's religion is just the easy preset </v>
<v Speaker 4>way for people to inherit assumptions </v>

2281
01:44:33.411 --> 01:44:38.411
<v Speaker 4>about the meaning of life and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of the world without having to </v>

2282
01:44:38.411 --> 01:44:38.420
<v Speaker 4>do any intellectual lifting of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>own.</v>

2283
01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.470
<v Speaker 3>I also think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at religions,</v>

2284
01:44:41.471 --> 01:44:46.471
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely fascinated by religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I find them amazing and one of the </v>

2285
01:44:46.471 --> 01:44:50.161
<v Speaker 3>things that I find amazing about them </v>
<v Speaker 3>just from a historical historical </v>

2286
01:44:50.161 --> 01:44:53.281
<v Speaker 3>perspective of thinking about people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lived in a time where there were no</v>

2287
01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:55.030
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2288
01:44:55.031 --> 01:45:00.031
<v Speaker 3>it is really truly amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started coming up with mouth noises </v>

2289
01:45:00.031 --> 01:45:03.931
<v Speaker 3>to indicate where to go and what to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what foods to eat and what's known </v>

2290
01:45:03.931 --> 01:45:07.780
<v Speaker 3>and what's yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then slowly but surely after fucking</v>

2291
01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:12.220
<v Speaker 3>eons of staring at the stars and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>people die and experiencing loss,</v>

2292
01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.720
<v Speaker 3>they tried to find meaning to it all and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they slowly but surely created these,</v>

2293
01:45:17.050 --> 01:45:22.050
<v Speaker 3>these fables and these parables and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things that eventually were </v>

2294
01:45:22.050 --> 01:45:24.310
<v Speaker 3>written down and translated from </v>
<v Speaker 3>language to language.</v>

2295
01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I find it absolutely fascinating when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at it from a historical </v>

2296
01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:34.201
<v Speaker 3>perspective of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this being this organism trying to </v>

2297
01:45:34.201 --> 01:45:38.011
<v Speaker 3>understand its place in the cosmos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I think is beautiful about </v>

2298
01:45:38.011 --> 01:45:38.770
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think from a historical perspective,</v>

2299
01:45:38.771 --> 01:45:43.771
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problematic aspects of it when you </v>

2300
01:45:43.771 --> 01:45:46.420
<v Speaker 3>try to apply it in 2014 with all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn information that we know,</v>

2301
01:45:46.421 --> 01:45:51.421
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't mean to say God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I said it because it's appropriate </v>

2302
01:45:51.421 --> 01:45:54.330
<v Speaker 3>accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The information that we have now that </v>

2303
01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:55.370
<v Speaker 3>refutes virtually everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2304
01:45:55.510 --> 01:46:00.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look what you say is very nice and </v>

2305
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.510
<v Speaker 4>poetic about the historical origins of </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>

2306
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:02.140
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as the enlightenment came </v>
<v Speaker 4>along,</v>

2307
01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.000
<v Speaker 4>as soon as the scientific method was </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed,</v>

2308
01:46:04.001 --> 01:46:09.001
<v Speaker 4>as soon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly by the time Charles Darwin </v>

2309
01:46:09.001 --> 01:46:12.090
<v Speaker 4>provided an explanation with how </v>
<v Speaker 4>naturalistic processes could give rise </v>

2310
01:46:12.090 --> 01:46:15.931
<v Speaker 4>to intelligent life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need those original myths </v>

2311
01:46:15.931 --> 01:46:16.750
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we should long ago have been able</v>

2312
01:46:16.751 --> 01:46:18.280
<v Speaker 4>to dispense with them and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2313
01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:23.340
<v Speaker 4>we're unable to talk openly and frankly </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how concerned we are to be about </v>

2314
01:46:24.431 --> 01:46:27.550
<v Speaker 4>people who take their religions </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally is a problem.</v>

2315
01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also.</v>

2316
01:46:29.651 --> 01:46:34.651
<v Speaker 4>I also have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with Sam Harris also in the </v>

2317
01:46:34.651 --> 01:46:34.651
<v Speaker 4>point that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moderate.</v>

2318
01:46:34.651 --> 01:46:34.651
<v Speaker 4>You say you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2319
01:46:34.651 --> 01:46:39.070
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you enjoy talking about Christianity </v>

2320
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:40.180
<v Speaker 4>with this Christian who you had on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do have a problem with people who give</v>

2321
01:46:40.181 --> 01:46:45.181
<v Speaker 4>cover essentially to religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremists by presenting religion as if </v>

2322
01:46:45.181 --> 01:46:49.121
<v Speaker 4>it can be my reasonable thing because to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the extent that moderate or moderate </v>

2323
01:46:49.801 --> 01:46:54.801
<v Speaker 4>Muslims are moderate is the extent to </v>
<v Speaker 4>which they don't really follow the </v>

2324
01:46:54.801 --> 01:46:54.801
<v Speaker 4>letter of their faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2325
01:46:54.801 --> 01:46:59.501
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to reinterpret and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of squint and peer at your holy </v>

2326
01:46:59.501 --> 01:47:03.381
<v Speaker 4>book through a particular prism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then do a lot of juggling and </v>

2327
01:47:03.381 --> 01:47:06.891
<v Speaker 4>reinterpreting in order to come out with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a conclusion that is kind of morally </v>

2328
01:47:06.891 --> 01:47:09.530
<v Speaker 4>tenable in 2014 to secular people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2329
01:47:09.630 --> 01:47:13.020
<v Speaker 3>That is extremely important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2330
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:18.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big issue when it comes to the </v>

2331
01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.850
<v Speaker 3>leaving of the Islamic tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you leave,</v>

2332
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:22.980
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be killed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fastest.</v>

2333
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apostasy in Islam is punishable by </v>

2334
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.620
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Homosexuality is punishable by death.</v>

2335
01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched a fucking horrible video last </v>

2336
01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:36.640
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely horrible of a woman who was </v>

2337
01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:36.640
<v Speaker 3>accused of adultery and she was stoned </v>
<v Speaker 3>to death.</v>

2338
01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.510
<v Speaker 3>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2339
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:40.560
<v Speaker 3>this was all carried out by these isis </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys apparently.</v>

2340
01:47:40.561 --> 01:47:41.360
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2341
01:47:41.361 --> 01:47:42.510
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2342
01:47:42.511 --> 01:47:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I just watched this video and it's being</v>
<v Speaker 3>translated.</v>

2343
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:49.110
<v Speaker 3>But this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she tried to apologize to her father.</v>

2344
01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Her father wouldn't even touch his hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Touch her hand.</v>

2345
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:53.070
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't shake her hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2346
01:47:53.071 --> 01:47:55.110
<v Speaker 3>you're not my daughter anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he threw the first rock.</v>

2347
01:47:55.111 --> 01:48:00.111
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is all done under the guise of </v>

2348
01:48:00.111 --> 01:48:00.111
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

2349
01:48:00.111 --> 01:48:04.340
<v Speaker 4>And you constantly hear apologists like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Reza Aslan is an obvious example saying,</v>

2350
01:48:04.610 --> 01:48:09.610
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a gross or Ben Affleck on Bill </v>

2351
01:48:09.610 --> 01:48:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Maher's show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a gross Caribbean.</v>

2352
01:48:09.610 --> 01:48:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Ben Affleck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna fuck up Batman.</v>

2353
01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I know that son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need a jihad.</v>

2354
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

2355
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:18.170
<v Speaker 3>you're a good guy.</v>

2356
01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the refrain is always,</v>

2357
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:24.560
<v Speaker 4>this is a generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most Muslims are good people and that is</v>

2358
01:48:24.561 --> 01:48:26.450
<v Speaker 4>absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The vast,</v>

2359
01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.780
<v Speaker 4>vast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vast majority of Muslims are good people</v>

2360
01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:32.030
<v Speaker 4>and just like you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

2361
01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.720
<v Speaker 4>the kind of the software that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>running on is problematic.</v>

2362
01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.720
<v Speaker 4>And this rocky and human rights activist</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to was saying,</v>

2363
01:48:41.721 --> 01:48:46.721
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that raises Aslan will always </v>

2364
01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:46.721
<v Speaker 4>say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about Indonesia?</v>

2365
01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:49.361
<v Speaker 4>For example?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Indonesia is the most populous Muslim </v>

2366
01:48:49.361 --> 01:48:49.361
<v Speaker 4>country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apologists for Islam,</v>

2367
01:48:49.361 --> 01:48:54.011
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly pointing at it and saying </v>

2368
01:48:54.011 --> 01:48:54.011
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fairly progressive.</v>

2369
01:48:54.011 --> 01:48:54.340
<v Speaker 4>It's had a female leader,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2370
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:55.700
<v Speaker 4>it's democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

2371
01:48:55.701 --> 01:48:57.170
<v Speaker 4>This is not Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2372
01:48:57.190 --> 01:48:59.630
<v Speaker 4>to to think that all of Islam is about </v>
<v Speaker 4>not letting,</v>

2373
01:48:59.631 --> 01:49:04.631
<v Speaker 4>not letting women drive is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>misrepresentation of the way that most </v>

2374
01:49:04.631 --> 01:49:08.231
<v Speaker 4>Muslims live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you would hardly say that a country </v>

2375
01:49:08.231 --> 01:49:11.831
<v Speaker 4>like Indonesia or even Jordan or any one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the other sort of good Muslim </v>

2376
01:49:12.261 --> 01:49:17.261
<v Speaker 4>countries is particularly progressive by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the standards that we should expect as </v>

2377
01:49:17.631 --> 01:49:22.631
<v Speaker 4>liberals as smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean in the political sense </v>

2378
01:49:22.631 --> 01:49:25.040
<v Speaker 4>within the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as people who believe in freedom,</v>

2379
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:27.820
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know he.</v>

2380
01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:29.300
<v Speaker 4>This is rocky was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the.</v>

2381
01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.360
<v Speaker 4>This is the bigotry of low expectations </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if someone in the United States </v>

2382
01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.670
<v Speaker 4>were to say the things about women and </v>
<v Speaker 4>gays that are routinely said,</v>

2383
01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:40.790
<v Speaker 4>even in Indonesia and the most moderate </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslim countries,</v>

2384
01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:46.060
<v Speaker 4>liberals would be absolutely outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are we holding them to such a </v>

2385
01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:46.100
<v Speaker 4>different standard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very good.</v>

2386
01:49:46.101 --> 01:49:46.120
<v Speaker 4>Very</v>

2387
01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:51.120
<v Speaker 3>good point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I that one of the resist the </v>

2388
01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.000
<v Speaker 3>resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the big points of resistance when</v>

2389
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:57.030
<v Speaker 3>people in these countries get upset at </v>
<v Speaker 3>people criticizing religion is you're </v>

2390
01:49:57.030 --> 01:50:01.440
<v Speaker 3>essentially criticizing their way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and their culture and it's tied in </v>

2391
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:02.950
<v Speaker 3>together and that this is almost an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra bowl from their,</v>

2392
01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:04.870
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their daily existence that Islam,</v>

2393
01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:10.140
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they believe in death for</v>
<v Speaker 3>adultery or homosexual or any of the </v>

2394
01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:11.770
<v Speaker 3>things that we find completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive.</v>

2395
01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.160
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying by criticizing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion is you're criticizing their </v>

2396
01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:17.920
<v Speaker 3>very way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>

2397
01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:22.300
<v Speaker 3>and that's what you're dealing with when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with these fundamental,</v>

2398
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:24.730
<v Speaker 3>these fundamentalist societies</v>

2399
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:29.320
<v Speaker 4>and not even fundamental societies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can understand that if,</v>

2400
01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:34.710
<v Speaker 4>if all of your being and your culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your family and your community are </v>

2401
01:50:34.710 --> 01:50:36.490
<v Speaker 4>woven up in a certain set of traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if that's just,</v>

2402
01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:37.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2403
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:42.910
<v Speaker 4>a Catholic Catholicism because you grew </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in a suburb of Boston and you know </v>

2404
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:45.010
<v Speaker 4>that's the way you do things and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone confronts you and says that that</v>

2405
01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:50.011
<v Speaker 4>is just a tissue of fabrications and </v>
<v Speaker 4>lies that have been handed down for </v>

2406
01:50:50.011 --> 01:50:53.430
<v Speaker 4>generations and it's wholly worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be an affront to to,</v>

2407
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not because it's not an,</v>

2408
01:50:55.070 --> 01:51:00.070
<v Speaker 4>we're not intellectual beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't like unpack and disentangle the</v>

2409
01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:05.191
<v Speaker 4>sort of factual claims of our faith from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lived experience of being a human </v>

2410
01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:08.210
<v Speaker 4>being who lives in a community and goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to church and has a nice posture and all</v>

2411
01:51:08.211 --> 01:51:11.710
<v Speaker 4>of that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to find a way to do that though.</v>

2412
01:51:11.770 --> 01:51:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Like we have to find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>disentangle when people do identity from</v>

2413
01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:21.100
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the intellectual claims of </v>

2414
01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:21.100
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>

2415
01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of people do it very slowly.</v>

2416
01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:22.140
<v Speaker 3>They do it over the course of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

2417
01:51:22.141 --> 01:51:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I have some friends that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2418
01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:29.340
<v Speaker 3>when I met them probably a decade ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were pretty hardcore Mormons.</v>

2419
01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.180
<v Speaker 3>They're really nice folks and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with my wife first and then we'd</v>

2420
01:51:33.190 --> 01:51:38.190
<v Speaker 3>go to dinner with them and then we'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>have these bizarre fucking </v>

2421
01:51:38.190 --> 01:51:38.470
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't believe in a higher power</v>

2422
01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:40.150
<v Speaker 3>I go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I don't believe,</v>

2423
01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:45.151
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see any evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like show me some evidence of a higher </v>

2424
01:51:45.151 --> 01:51:45.151
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll say,</v>

2425
01:51:45.151 --> 01:51:45.151
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes a lot of sense,</v>

2426
01:51:45.151 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 3>but it she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2427
01:51:46.121 --> 01:51:51.121
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be able to live with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be able to get up every day </v>

2428
01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:51.121
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't think that something's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen after I die.</v>

2429
01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you enjoy going out to dinner?</v>

2430
01:51:53.831 --> 01:51:54.460
<v Speaker 3>We're out at dinner.</v>

2431
01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:56.350
<v Speaker 3>We had a nice dinner at a nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

2432
01:51:56.351 --> 01:51:59.500
<v Speaker 3>We're having fun having a glass of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are enjoying this.</v>

2433
01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Like why does this have to lead to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>magic fairy land where people have </v>

2434
01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:06.160
<v Speaker 3>wings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that have to,</v>

2435
01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.380
<v Speaker 3>why can't you just enjoy this life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2436
01:52:08.381 --> 01:52:10.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happens when I die.</v>

2437
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:15.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't know what happens when I </v>

2438
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.870
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be able to go on.</v>

2439
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2440
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:16.660
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty ridiculous.</v>

2441
01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.850
<v Speaker 3>But for a lot of people it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2442
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:24.820
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding for your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding for your emotions.</v>

2443
01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Like you have this structure that allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to get by.</v>

2444
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:33.490
<v Speaker 3>It allows you to get through every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if someone pulls that structure and </v>

2445
01:52:33.490 --> 01:52:34.600
<v Speaker 3>you're forced to sort of create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure on your own,</v>

2446
01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.320
<v Speaker 3>it's extremely problematic and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that I'm friends with,</v>

2447
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:43.530
<v Speaker 3>they abandoned their church and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned their church and now they're </v>

2448
01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:48.100
<v Speaker 3>in this very weird limbo place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fairly interesting because they're </v>

2449
01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:48.100
<v Speaker 3>very insightful.</v>

2450
01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 3>And the woman we had this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation which she was talking about</v>

2451
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:56.051
<v Speaker 3>how she feels like she's very open to </v>
<v Speaker 3>being scammed because she's so trusting </v>

2452
01:52:56.051 --> 01:52:59.630
<v Speaker 3>because she grew up in a fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>mormon background and that she's just so</v>

2453
01:52:59.631 --> 01:53:04.250
<v Speaker 3>open to suggestion because she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>buying into horseshit her whole life and</v>

2454
01:53:04.251 --> 01:53:09.251
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just didn't question and this </v>

2455
01:53:09.251 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 3>becomes sort of a pattern of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2456
01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:14.560
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for people to just all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden reestablish their,</v>

2457
01:53:14.561 --> 01:53:19.561
<v Speaker 3>their ideology would establish their </v>
<v Speaker 3>position and religion is an excellent </v>

2458
01:53:19.561 --> 01:53:21.310
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding for sort of establishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2459
01:53:21.311 --> 01:53:22.210
<v Speaker 3>your place in the world.</v>

2460
01:53:22.290 --> 01:53:25.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very comforting to have a sense</v>

2461
01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:26.970
<v Speaker 4>of authority of as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2462
01:53:26.971 --> 01:53:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's something like being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having,</v>

2463
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:30.330
<v Speaker 4>having a loving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2464
01:53:30.331 --> 01:53:35.331
<v Speaker 4>Having the creator of the universe like </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally taken interest in your </v>

2465
01:53:35.331 --> 01:53:39.831
<v Speaker 4>wellbeing must be an incredible sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ego boost and Monday incredible security</v>

2466
01:53:39.961 --> 01:53:40.590
<v Speaker 4>blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2467
01:53:40.591 --> 01:53:45.591
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why religions strokes </v>
<v Speaker 4>us in certain ways that 98 percent of </v>

2468
01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:45.591
<v Speaker 4>the world is religious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2469
01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.160
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2470
01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:51.190
<v Speaker 4>it provides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it must provide some kind of sanctuary </v>

2471
01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:51.190
<v Speaker 4>that's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2472
01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:51.450
<v Speaker 4>to shake off.</v>

2473
01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:53.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an enlightenment bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>

2474
01:53:53.850 --> 01:53:58.850
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a construct that we've created to sort </v>

2475
01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:01.501
<v Speaker 3>of get our way out of the monkey body to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get our way through to some next stage </v>

2476
01:54:01.501 --> 01:54:05.761
<v Speaker 3>and as we're rejecting it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much for the first time in human </v>

2477
01:54:05.761 --> 01:54:09.241
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's culturally acceptable to reject it </v>

2478
01:54:09.241 --> 01:54:12.270
<v Speaker 3>and it's almost more prevalent amongst </v>
<v Speaker 3>youth than it is to accept it.</v>

2479
01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 3>If you talk to people in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2480
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:19.690
<v Speaker 3>the early 19 hundreds about rejecting </v>
<v Speaker 3>God and atheism,</v>

2481
01:54:19.691 --> 01:54:24.160
<v Speaker 3>but you would get a small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly educated people that would accept</v>

2482
01:54:24.161 --> 01:54:29.161
<v Speaker 3>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you go to universities today </v>

2483
01:54:29.161 --> 01:54:29.161
<v Speaker 3>and you promote atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna get a massive following.</v>

2484
01:54:29.161 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a massive amount of people that </v>

2485
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 3>are with you on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2486
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even following Shinsei following</v>
<v Speaker 3>a massive amount of people in agreement </v>

2487
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:36.660
<v Speaker 3>with you on these concepts that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2488
01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:41.670
<v Speaker 3>we are dealing with a new era when new </v>
<v Speaker 3>era of understanding and for a lot of </v>

2489
01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:42.880
<v Speaker 3>people that's absolutely terrifying.</v>

2490
01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's less terrifying to me than the </v>

2491
01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.550
<v Speaker 4>possibility of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people with religious delusions </v>

2492
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.550
<v Speaker 4>getting access to weapons of mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction,</v>

2493
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:52.780
<v Speaker 4>which is why I keep fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting the atheist fight.</v>

2494
01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:58.200
<v Speaker 4>I think this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This has the potential to be absolutely </v>

2495
01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:02.101
<v Speaker 4>calamitous and whatever we can do to to </v>
<v Speaker 4>minimize religious thinking and </v>

2496
01:55:02.101 --> 01:55:05.050
<v Speaker 4>basically just hold people to account </v>
<v Speaker 4>for what they claim to believe.</v>

2497
01:55:05.051 --> 01:55:05.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2498
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:10.960
<v Speaker 4>if you were interviewing someone for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>job and you were considering hiring them</v>

2499
01:55:11.050 --> 01:55:16.050
<v Speaker 4>and they started talking about how Elvis</v>
<v Speaker 4>is still alive and he communicates with </v>

2500
01:55:16.050 --> 01:55:19.210
<v Speaker 4>them through by leaving messages in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their toast or something,</v>

2501
01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.780
<v Speaker 4>I when you would just immediately </v>
<v Speaker 4>disqualify that person from you,</v>

2502
01:55:21.810 --> 01:55:23.230
<v Speaker 4>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a crazy person.</v>

2503
01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:28.260
<v Speaker 4>It would be nice to me if you similarly </v>
<v Speaker 4>judged people who claim that the creator</v>

2504
01:55:29.711 --> 01:55:34.711
<v Speaker 4>of the universe speaks to them on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>daily basis and listening to what they </v>

2505
01:55:34.711 --> 01:55:37.651
<v Speaker 4>say and listen to their prayers and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and intervenes in worldly affairs to </v>

2506
01:55:37.651 --> 01:55:42.120
<v Speaker 4>cause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make natural disasters like destroy </v>

2507
01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:42.120
<v Speaker 4>their neighbor's house but not their </v>
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

2508
01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean like for so many things on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mental arrogance.</v>

2509
01:55:45.631 --> 01:55:47.250
<v Speaker 4>Like I saw her on the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was like a,</v>

2510
01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:52.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wildfire that went through an </v>

2511
01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:52.490
<v Speaker 4>Australian suburb and the lady standing </v>
<v Speaker 4>there in front of her house,</v>

2512
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:53.620
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2513
01:55:53.621 --> 01:55:55.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God saved my house.</v>

2514
01:55:55.891 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>God hated good neighbors so much.</v>

2515
01:55:58.141 --> 01:56:03.141
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to burn down their house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty fucked up thing for God </v>

2516
01:56:03.141 --> 01:56:05.901
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just to judge people on these </v>

2517
01:56:05.901 --> 01:56:06.270
<v Speaker 4>beliefs the same way we would judge them</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2518
01:56:06.271 --> 01:56:10.020
<v Speaker 4>if they weren't religious beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were equally silly but,</v>

2519
01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:13.810
<v Speaker 4>but not protected by the fact that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2520
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.150
<v Speaker 4>they fold into a formal role.</v>

2521
01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:20.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the legacy thought patterns or thought </v>

2522
01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:20.640
<v Speaker 3>patterns that existed before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

2523
01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:24.440
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the Internet is the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion in the sense that it's not a </v>

2524
01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:24.440
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

2525
01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:26.910
<v Speaker 3>it's a way to establish cultures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>

2526
01:56:26.911 --> 01:56:31.911
<v Speaker 3>It's a way to exchange information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a way to to live and think that </v>

2527
01:56:31.911 --> 01:56:33.000
<v Speaker 3>never existed before when you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>alone,</v>

2528
01:56:33.001 --> 01:56:38.001
<v Speaker 3>when you were by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were in these small tribes and </v>

2529
01:56:38.001 --> 01:56:38.790
<v Speaker 3>all you had with this stupid old book of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense stories about,</v>

2530
01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:44.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the original two people that existed in </v>

2531
01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.761
<v Speaker 3>fucking earth being created in seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>days by an old man who lives in the </v>

2532
01:56:46.761 --> 01:56:48.840
<v Speaker 3>clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all you had saw your hat and we</v>

2533
01:56:48.841 --> 01:56:50.300
<v Speaker 3>have so much more now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

2534
01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the landscape that you're surveying is </v>

2535
01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:57.540
<v Speaker 3>so much larger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The landscape of information is just not</v>

2536
01:56:57.541 --> 01:57:02.541
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost inconceivably larger and </v>

2537
01:57:02.541 --> 01:57:03.780
<v Speaker 3>inconceivably larger than when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>

2538
01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2539
01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I went to Catholic school for only one </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and I was very fortunate that I </v>

2540
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:14.331
<v Speaker 3>didn't have very religious parents and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just sent me to Catholic school </v>

2541
01:57:14.331 --> 01:57:14.940
<v Speaker 3>because it was a good option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone was sort of religion,</v>

2542
01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.530
<v Speaker 3>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only casually,</v>

2543
01:57:17.010 --> 01:57:22.010
<v Speaker 3>but it was so bad that I abandoned all </v>
<v Speaker 3>my ideas of religion and I can really </v>

2544
01:57:22.501 --> 01:57:27.501
<v Speaker 3>clearly remember this because it was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>important part of my life because my </v>

2545
01:57:27.501 --> 01:57:31.461
<v Speaker 3>parents had broken up when I was five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old and I was really insecure and </v>

2546
01:57:31.461 --> 01:57:33.600
<v Speaker 3>scared and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad wasn't around anymore.</v>

2547
01:57:33.601 --> 01:57:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I was with my mom and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

2548
01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:41.070
<v Speaker 3>I was seeking some sort of comfort in </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

2549
01:57:41.250 --> 01:57:43.290
<v Speaker 3>what God says you should do this and God</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

2550
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:44.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know who the fuck I heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>it from,</v>

2551
01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:50.370
<v Speaker 3>but I went to one year of Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and these people were so horrible</v>

2552
01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:53.700
<v Speaker 3>that I abandoned everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had given it all up by the time.</v>

2553
01:57:53.701 --> 01:57:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2554
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:55.130
<v Speaker 4>They're the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the cancel,</v>

2555
01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Colbert religion they could have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had you had.</v>

2556
01:57:57.791 --> 01:57:59.440
<v Speaker 4>You just been a little sweeter.</v>

2557
01:57:59.590 --> 01:58:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I so I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though I was only five years old,</v>

2558
01:58:02.411 --> 01:58:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I can remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2559
01:58:03.691 --> 01:58:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I remember in vague sort of snapshots </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some weird,</v>

2560
01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:13.500
<v Speaker 3>weird images in our mind and we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>concepts that I've sort of like held </v>

2561
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:13.500
<v Speaker 3>onto.</v>

2562
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.610
<v Speaker 4>I've never experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>

2563
01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:16.130
<v Speaker 4>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2564
01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:18.420
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an aspect of human,</v>

2565
01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:23.570
<v Speaker 4>human kind and human civilization and </v>
<v Speaker 4>human psychology that is totally opaque </v>

2566
01:58:23.570 --> 01:58:24.620
<v Speaker 4>and ineffable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd done,</v>

2567
01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:28.350
<v Speaker 4>I'd done it under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't quite understand how.</v>

2568
01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:32.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm almost one of the very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few people in the world who doesn't</v>

2569
01:58:32.821 --> 01:58:37.821
<v Speaker 4>have that Jane Breed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I've me to a computer.</v>

2570
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Well you're one of the very few people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>

2571
01:58:39.411 --> 01:58:41.320
<v Speaker 3>but I think the children that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up today,</v>

2572
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>kids that are born</v>

2573
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:47.280
<v Speaker 1>in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a less and less of </v>

2574
01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:47.920
<v Speaker 1>that it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I should carve out here.</v>

2575
01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:50.800
<v Speaker 1>There are certain civilized societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2576
01:58:50.801 --> 01:58:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I use the word civilized advisedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to,</v>

2577
01:58:53.110 --> 01:58:54.520
<v Speaker 1>not to shit on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2578
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:59.790
<v Speaker 1>developing countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are educated rich countries </v>

2579
01:58:59.790 --> 01:59:02.110
<v Speaker 1>where the populations have basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten rid of religion altogether.</v>

2580
01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultures in Denmark.</v>

2581
01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Australia and New Zealand,</v>

2582
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:11.251
<v Speaker 1>a pretty secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like paypal will normal nominally tick </v>

2583
01:59:11.251 --> 01:59:11.251
<v Speaker 1>Catholic on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a box,</v>

2584
01:59:11.251 --> 01:59:16.081
<v Speaker 1>but when you actually stopped to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>them whether or not they believe any of </v>

2585
01:59:16.081 --> 01:59:18.660
<v Speaker 1>the tenants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got 60 or 70 percent of the </v>

2586
01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:19.150
<v Speaker 1>population who never go to church and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think of themselves as being,</v>

2587
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.760
<v Speaker 1>as being religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look about gluggy Canada,</v>

2588
01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:26.890
<v Speaker 1>less religious than America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is less religious than Mexico,</v>

2589
01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:32.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is the most religious rich </v>

2590
01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:34.351
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all by the Reagan </v>

2591
01:59:34.351 --> 01:59:34.351
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

2592
01:59:34.351 --> 01:59:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Those cocksuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2593
01:59:34.810 --> 01:59:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Because they courted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They courted the,</v>

2594
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:37.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2595
01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:43.020
<v Speaker 1>the rat model of Christian religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from the 19 eighties were courted</v>

2596
01:59:43.271 --> 01:59:48.271
<v Speaker 1>by the Reagan administration because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they recognize them as being a source </v>

2597
01:59:48.271 --> 01:59:52.050
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could get those people on your </v>

2598
01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:52.050
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a guaranteed base.</v>

2599
01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That's where they get their political </v>
<v Speaker 1>clout from.</v>

2600
01:59:53.261 --> 01:59:55.030
<v Speaker 1>But it goes back a long way in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

2601
01:59:55.031 --> 01:59:58.210
<v Speaker 1>the strain of puritanical evangelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

2602
01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:00.640
<v Speaker 1>evangelical protestantism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2603
02:00:00.670 --> 02:00:03.220
<v Speaker 1>in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a saying that whenever there's a</v>

2604
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>moral outrage and America and America </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets it's tits in a tangle about,</v>

2605
02:00:06.881 --> 02:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Janet Jackson's Boob or something,</v>

2606
02:00:08.930 --> 02:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God we were founded by criminals </v>

2607
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2608
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's true though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Australia has legalized </v>

2609
02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2610
02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Australia has a lot of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>America doesn't have in that sense.</v>

2611
02:00:18.851 --> 02:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2612
02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>the foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original echoes of ignorance that </v>

2613
02:00:25.290 --> 02:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>started this whole thing off.</v>

2614
02:00:25.290 --> 02:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>They still reverberate in 2014 and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really ridiculous ideas about sex in </v>

2615
02:00:30.210 --> 02:00:31.150
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

2616
02:00:31.151 --> 02:00:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Don't even get me started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2617
02:00:33.311 --> 02:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get you started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2618
02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dysfunction that religion puts into </v>

2619
02:00:39.810 --> 02:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>people's sex lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is just.</v>

2620
02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Well for a start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's criminal because it leads to so </v>

2621
02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>much suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the gay community.</v>

2622
02:00:47.741 --> 02:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2623
02:00:48.370 --> 02:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of teens,</v>

2624
02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>teenage suicide among Quia kids in </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious areas is shocking.</v>

2625
02:00:55.151 --> 02:01:00.151
<v Speaker 1>Is a national disgrace that we should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot more about and we should be </v>

2626
02:01:00.151 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>much more vocal about not tolerating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2627
02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>preachers preaching of hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preaching of hate and also this idea</v>

2628
02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>that it's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's maddening to me.</v>

2629
02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>What always makes me feel like I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a,</v>

2630
02:01:12.210 --> 02:01:17.210
<v Speaker 1>an opinion by Scalia about this and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost sounded like these people are </v>

2631
02:01:17.210 --> 02:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>bisexual because if he believes it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

2632
02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>he's implying that he could choose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow a guy.</v>

2633
02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't choose to blow a guy.</v>

2634
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2635
02:01:27.070 --> 02:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>He could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2636
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:30.130
<v Speaker 1>if he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man.</v>

2637
02:01:31.590 --> 02:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Bowie apparently slept together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to believe.</v>

2638
02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking shocked at ex wife.</v>

2639
02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Lot of crazy stuff was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the seventies.</v>

2640
02:01:37.691 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I get they got nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it is a</v>

2641
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's my point.</v>

2642
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:45.860
<v Speaker 3>So what if you're a straight person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you choose to do gay shit?</v>

2643
02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:46.970
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

2644
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Why does anyone care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you will,</v>

2645
02:01:48.911 --> 02:01:51.320
<v Speaker 3>why would anyone say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be a choice.</v>

2646
02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:55.910
<v Speaker 3>How could you possibly know what someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to or doesn't want to do,</v>

2647
02:01:55.911 --> 02:01:56.870
<v Speaker 3>what they feel inside,</v>

2648
02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:02.100
<v Speaker 4>and even if it were a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's assume for the sake of argument </v>

2649
02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:02.880
<v Speaker 4>that everyone is like perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 4>bisexual.</v>

2650
02:02:02.881 --> 02:02:04.770
<v Speaker 4>It's an absurd argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is kind of what they're saying,</v>

2651
02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:10.160
<v Speaker 4>what they're implying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're saying that it's totally a </v>

2652
02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.100
<v Speaker 4>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you don't give up your civil rights</v>

2653
02:02:11.101 --> 02:02:14.130
<v Speaker 4>just because you belong to the community</v>
<v Speaker 4>you belong to as a choice.</v>

2654
02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Religion is a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still protected.</v>

2655
02:02:16.231 --> 02:02:19.110
<v Speaker 4>You still have the right to worship in </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever faith you want.</v>

2656
02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:24.320
<v Speaker 4>The fact that I can choose to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>question or choose to be a Muslim </v>

2657
02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:26.811
<v Speaker 4>doesn't deprive me of my right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise the to the free exercise of </v>

2658
02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:27.270
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Similarly,</v>

2659
02:02:27.330 --> 02:02:32.330
<v Speaker 4>the my choice to be married to a man </v>
<v Speaker 4>should not even if even if it is </v>

2660
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:36.411
<v Speaker 4>completely a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that I'm hardwired sexually and </v>

2661
02:02:36.411 --> 02:02:36.930
<v Speaker 4>emotionally should not deprive me of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>civil rights.</v>

2662
02:02:37.050 --> 02:02:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the most offensive </v>

2663
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:44.001
<v Speaker 3>ideas in when it comes to this country </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's an argument against same </v>

2664
02:02:44.001 --> 02:02:48.531
<v Speaker 3>sex marriages and it's still a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot point topic of debate in 2014.</v>

2665
02:02:48.690 --> 02:02:51.590
<v Speaker 3>How many states are where our same sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage too?</v>

2666
02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

2667
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Vatican propose a dramatic shift in </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude towards gays.</v>

2668
02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Same sex couple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This new pope.</v>

2669
02:02:58.651 --> 02:03:03.651
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into the pope man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this new new pope is a fucking and </v>

2670
02:03:03.651 --> 02:03:06.030
<v Speaker 3>interesting is a goodie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sits on a regular chair.</v>

2671
02:03:06.210 --> 02:03:08.400
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't ride around the pope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tmobile.</v>

2672
02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean they got rid of that evil fucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they went a 180 degrees.</v>

2673
02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:12.830
<v Speaker 3>The other director.</v>

2674
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's causing.</v>

2675
02:03:14.061 --> 02:03:19.061
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's ruffling a lot of feathers in the </v>

2676
02:03:19.061 --> 02:03:21.731
<v Speaker 4>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know there are a lot of people </v>

2677
02:03:21.731 --> 02:03:23.051
<v Speaker 4>behind the pope who are conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>cardinals who are not happy campers at </v>

2678
02:03:23.051 --> 02:03:24.260
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He represents a much more frankly,</v>

2679
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:27.290
<v Speaker 4>Latin American strain of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a much,</v>

2680
02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.260
<v Speaker 4>much less crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more loving,</v>

2681
02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.470
<v Speaker 4>kind of communal interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Catholicism.</v>

2682
02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:36.140
<v Speaker 3>So there's 18 different states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said 35.</v>

2683
02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.780
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we google it?</v>

2684
02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that um,</v>

2685
02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:47.060
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible that there's still </v>

2686
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:51.350
<v Speaker 3>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might actually be the other way </v>

2687
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.350
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be 32.</v>

2688
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360
<v Speaker 3>You can't get ready and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll find out soon enough,</v>

2689
02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:56.390
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that there's that many </v>
<v Speaker 3>states where it's 32 states have legal </v>

2690
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:57.720
<v Speaker 3>same sex marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>

2691
02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:01.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean frankly I'm given like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you were saying about the,</v>

2692
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:04.670
<v Speaker 4>the moral evolution of racism though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like from when you were growing up,</v>

2693
02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:10.200
<v Speaker 4>born in 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that half century there has just </v>

2694
02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:11.870
<v Speaker 4>been a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive period of advance.</v>

2695
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:15.020
<v Speaker 4>And it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you've got to give people time.</v>

2696
02:04:15.021 --> 02:04:20.021
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am impressed that 32 states now you </v>

2697
02:04:20.021 --> 02:04:23.291
<v Speaker 4>can get married,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same sex couples can get married and </v>

2698
02:04:23.291 --> 02:04:24.941
<v Speaker 4>because just 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let alone 20 years ago it was kind of </v>

2699
02:04:24.941 --> 02:04:24.941
<v Speaker 4>inconceivable.</v>

2700
02:04:24.941 --> 02:04:29.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I'm not impressed because </v>

2701
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.430
<v Speaker 3>there's no logical reason other than</v>

2702
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:30.430
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there never is.</v>

2703
02:04:30.431 --> 02:04:32.580
<v Speaker 4>It's never logical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a logical reason for racism.</v>

2704
02:04:32.581 --> 02:04:34.080
<v Speaker 4>There's not a logical reason for </v>
<v Speaker 4>homophobia.</v>

2705
02:04:34.081 --> 02:04:36.420
<v Speaker 4>There's no logical reason to cancel a </v>
<v Speaker 4>call back.</v>

2706
02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:37.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean people</v>

2707
02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:42.390
<v Speaker 3>in a completely free society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be no reason to restrict </v>

2708
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:45.541
<v Speaker 3>people because you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be no reason why anyone </v>

2709
02:04:45.541 --> 02:04:49.441
<v Speaker 3>should be able to say you can't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married to a man because I don't like </v>

2710
02:04:49.441 --> 02:04:49.441
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2711
02:04:49.441 --> 02:04:52.250
<v Speaker 4>I hope that that sentiment is becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think it is becoming more and more</v>

2712
02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:55.940
<v Speaker 4>prevalent across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent that the libertarian wing of</v>

2713
02:04:55.941 --> 02:04:59.540
<v Speaker 4>the Republican Party and the progressive</v>
<v Speaker 4>wing of the Democratic Party,</v>

2714
02:04:59.810 --> 02:05:02.930
<v Speaker 4>a kind of whole showing together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're kind of opposite extremes,</v>

2715
02:05:02.931 --> 02:05:04.580
<v Speaker 4>but they're actually quite close on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2716
02:05:04.610 --> 02:05:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Also on NSA stuff and civil liberties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I really wish we could galvanize a </v>

2717
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:14.830
<v Speaker 4>community of likeminded people who have </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically broadly socially libertarian </v>

2718
02:05:15.590 --> 02:05:20.590
<v Speaker 4>and kind of culturally sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to enact policies like this.</v>

2719
02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:23.780
<v Speaker 4>And I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that group,</v>

2720
02:05:23.781 --> 02:05:24.770
<v Speaker 4>that core is growing.</v>

2721
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:29.950
<v Speaker 3>The trend is definitely moving in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction and I think the only thing </v>

2722
02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:32.411
<v Speaker 3>that would stop it as some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic disaster sends us back to </v>

2723
02:05:32.411 --> 02:05:35.030
<v Speaker 3>this really difficult struggle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>removes our access to information.</v>

2724
02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Well actually I think what he always </v>
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>

2725
02:05:38.141 --> 02:05:40.870
<v Speaker 4>it is like an attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we get hit again in,</v>

2726
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

2727
02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:45.220
<v Speaker 4>on a scale of nine slash 11 or heaven </v>
<v Speaker 4>forbid worse,</v>

2728
02:05:45.221 --> 02:05:50.221
<v Speaker 4>which probably would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it were another example of mega </v>

2729
02:05:50.221 --> 02:05:50.221
<v Speaker 4>terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2730
02:05:50.221 --> 02:05:53.380
<v Speaker 4>then you will get people clinging to </v>
<v Speaker 4>their religion more and gun,</v>

2731
02:05:53.381 --> 02:05:55.840
<v Speaker 4>going back and being less tolerant and </v>
<v Speaker 4>being much,</v>

2732
02:05:55.870 --> 02:06:00.870
<v Speaker 4>much more okay with their civil </v>
<v Speaker 4>liberties being infringed that we more </v>

2733
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:02.410
<v Speaker 4>antagonistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the really corrosive effective.</v>

2734
02:06:02.890 --> 02:06:04.750
<v Speaker 3>But don't you think things come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>waves.</v>

2735
02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are like a heightened </v>

2736
02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:11.380
<v Speaker 3>civilizations that fall apart and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they come back and go and forth and it's</v>

2737
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:16.390
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we like to think of history as being </v>

2738
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:18.780
<v Speaker 3>some straight linear path to 2014 with </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress from day one to day.</v>

2739
02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:19.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

2740
02:06:19.841 --> 02:06:24.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's ages of enlightenment and </v>

2741
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:25.660
<v Speaker 3>there's is decreases and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic disasters,</v>

2742
02:06:25.661 --> 02:06:29.200
<v Speaker 3>natural disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific things that happened that throw</v>

2743
02:06:29.201 --> 02:06:30.190
<v Speaker 3>people back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2744
02:06:30.590 --> 02:06:35.350
<v Speaker 3>there's people that argue that Iraq and </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially Baghdad,</v>

2745
02:06:35.590 --> 02:06:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I've never recovered from the Mongol </v>
<v Speaker 3>invasion of the 12 hundreds.</v>

2746
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:43.810
<v Speaker 3>They killed everyone in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned the river red with blood and </v>

2747
02:06:43.810 --> 02:06:44.290
<v Speaker 3>black with ink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally slaughtered all the scholars,</v>

2748
02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.920
<v Speaker 3>threw away all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2749
02:06:46.190 --> 02:06:51.190
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that people in this day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and age don't realize is that Islam used</v>

2750
02:06:51.791 --> 02:06:54.720
<v Speaker 3>to be the center of Science of </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy.</v>

2751
02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the original advanced course.</v>

2752
02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2753
02:06:58.630 --> 02:06:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were onto,</v>

2754
02:06:59.561 --> 02:07:01.600
<v Speaker 4>onto the enlightenment along time before</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were.</v>

2755
02:07:01.630 --> 02:07:06.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the odd thing about the way that </v>

2756
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:06.630
<v Speaker 4>the tables have turned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2757
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:06.630
<v Speaker 4>look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2758
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:10.590
<v Speaker 4>the library of Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alexandria burned down and we lost </v>

2759
02:07:10.590 --> 02:07:13.480
<v Speaker 4>massive resources of human civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet as we say in Australia,</v>

2760
02:07:13.481 --> 02:07:15.400
<v Speaker 4>it's swings and roundabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning,</v>

2761
02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:16.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes and goes.</v>

2762
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're looking at things on an </v>

2763
02:07:21.850 --> 02:07:24.010
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably large scale and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at these little blips and these </v>

2764
02:07:24.010 --> 02:07:27.200
<v Speaker 3>blips are very important to us because </v>
<v Speaker 3>our lives are so short in perspective.</v>

2765
02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:28.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

2766
02:07:28.401 --> 02:07:33.401
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the concept of a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>life being only 100 years at the very </v>

2767
02:07:33.401 --> 02:07:36.340
<v Speaker 3>best and look at a 100 years in to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

2768
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:38.770
<v Speaker 3>years of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking blink of an eye</v>

2769
02:07:38.850 --> 02:07:43.850
<v Speaker 4>and the 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years of human history is a blink is a </v>

2770
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:45.360
<v Speaker 4>blip in comparison to the age of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the earth and the age of the earth is</v>

2771
02:07:45.361 --> 02:07:47.580
<v Speaker 4>a blip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And on the age of the universe and</v>

2772
02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:52.760
<v Speaker 3>talk to folks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named Randall Carlson who </v>

2773
02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:55.341
<v Speaker 3>have had on the podcast who's an expert </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Astro asteroidal impacts and he </v>

2774
02:07:55.341 --> 02:07:57.270
<v Speaker 3>believes that the whole reason for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

2775
02:07:57.271 --> 02:08:00.840
<v Speaker 3>year like our idea of human civilization</v>
<v Speaker 3>being 10,000</v>

2776
02:08:00.841 --> 02:08:05.841
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that goes back way further </v>

2777
02:08:05.841 --> 02:08:07.881
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he points to all these meteor </v>

2778
02:08:07.881 --> 02:08:07.881
<v Speaker 3>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially in Asia and in Europe.</v>

2779
02:08:07.881 --> 02:08:12.801
<v Speaker 3>In a $12,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they go to these core samples of </v>

2780
02:08:12.801 --> 02:08:12.801
<v Speaker 3>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go back to about 12,000</v>

2781
02:08:12.801 --> 02:08:17.781
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all this evidence of what's </v>

2782
02:08:17.781 --> 02:08:18.060
<v Speaker 3>called nuclear glass try thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Triton night.</v>

2783
02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:21.570
<v Speaker 3>That means that the earth was pelted by </v>
<v Speaker 3>meteors,</v>

2784
02:08:22.290 --> 02:08:25.260
<v Speaker 3>human civilizations prior to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly he's.</v>

2785
02:08:25.290 --> 02:08:27.210
<v Speaker 3>He's absolutely there any fossil </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>

2786
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:32.270
<v Speaker 3>There's evidence in far as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction that we're starting to </v>

2787
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.270
<v Speaker 3>uncover now let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beckley,</v>

2788
02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tapi is this massive stone structure </v>

2789
02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:39.561
<v Speaker 3>that existed back when they thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were just hunters and gatherers </v>

2790
02:08:39.561 --> 02:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>and it's a recently on earth and to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>day they've only gotten about five </v>

2791
02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:44.220
<v Speaker 3>percent of it on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's these massive stone columns,</v>

2792
02:08:44.221 --> 02:08:46.880
<v Speaker 3>19 feet high that are between 12 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>14,000</v>

2793
02:08:46.890 --> 02:08:49.110
<v Speaker 3>years old at a time where they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think anyone was</v>

2794
02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:54.090
<v Speaker 4>building as scientifically minded guy on</v>
<v Speaker 4>on issues where I don't really know what</v>

2795
02:08:54.091 --> 02:08:59.091
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I usually just get gail to the majority </v>

2796
02:08:59.091 --> 02:09:01.241
<v Speaker 4>of expert opinion and that's so far </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of what we most archeologists </v>

2797
02:09:01.241 --> 02:09:01.770
<v Speaker 4>claim more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just go with them.</v>

2798
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not anymore,</v>

2799
02:09:02.850 --> 02:09:02.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2800
02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to the tap,</v>

2801
02:09:04.301 --> 02:09:05.730
<v Speaker 3>but you need to look at this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2802
02:09:05.850 --> 02:09:08.530
<v Speaker 3>well 100 percent established science </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

2803
02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:10.530
<v Speaker 3>The reason why it's established is go </v>
<v Speaker 3>beckley.</v>

2804
02:09:10.531 --> 02:09:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Tappy was somehow or another covered up </v>
<v Speaker 3>on purpose,</v>

2805
02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:19.700
<v Speaker 3>so they were most likely conquered by </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else and these structures were </v>

2806
02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:21.360
<v Speaker 3>covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they do these,</v>

2807
02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:23.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these carbon samples of the soil,</v>

2808
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:28.290
<v Speaker 3>it's uniform from the top to the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that somewhere around 12,000</v>

2809
02:09:28.291 --> 02:09:33.291
<v Speaker 3>years ago these things were covered up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means it could be far older than </v>

2810
02:09:33.291 --> 02:09:37.941
<v Speaker 3>that because you're dealing with stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures and meaning it could be </v>

2811
02:09:37.941 --> 02:09:37.941
<v Speaker 3>13,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how old it could be,</v>

2812
02:09:37.941 --> 02:09:38.010
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2813
02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:40.140
<v Speaker 4>these are huge structures that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>created.</v>

2814
02:09:40.141 --> 02:09:41.370
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull it up if you get a chance.</v>

2815
02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on how you define </v>

2816
02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:46.580
<v Speaker 4>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2817
02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:46.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is really advanced stuff.</v>

2818
02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:49.770
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to be old pc about this,</v>

2819
02:09:49.771 --> 02:09:54.771
<v Speaker 4>but the Australian aborigines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are 80 to 120,000</v>

2820
02:09:54.811 --> 02:09:58.320
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The oldest surviving civilization now,</v>

2821
02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:00.070
<v Speaker 4>they don't build big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2822
02:10:00.090 --> 02:10:02.880
<v Speaker 4>big structures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to survive for 100,000</v>

2823
02:10:02.881 --> 02:10:07.710
<v Speaker 4>years in a stable form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have language,</v>

2824
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:10.140
<v Speaker 4>to have a certain culture to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2825
02:10:10.141 --> 02:10:15.141
<v Speaker 4>to know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to use the land and to know how to </v>

2826
02:10:15.141 --> 02:10:15.930
<v Speaker 4>hunt and to build tools and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff.</v>

2827
02:10:16.290 --> 02:10:21.290
<v Speaker 4>Like that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a long time that makes our sort </v>

2828
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.290
<v Speaker 4>of 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years of,</v>

2829
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:25.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>modern civilization look like just </v>

2830
02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:27.420
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like sue was about 6,000</v>

2831
02:10:27.421 --> 02:10:32.421
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was what we considered to be the </v>

2832
02:10:32.421 --> 02:10:32.421
<v Speaker 4>first written language and cuny </v>
<v Speaker 4>cuneiform.</v>

2833
02:10:32.421 --> 02:10:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sort of just counting it from the of</v>

2834
02:10:33.381 --> 02:10:38.381
<v Speaker 4>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose in the Iliad and the Odyssey </v>

2835
02:10:38.381 --> 02:10:38.381
<v Speaker 4>and the Talmud.</v>

2836
02:10:38.381 --> 02:10:38.381
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2837
02:10:38.381 --> 02:10:42.360
<v Speaker 3>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tappy discovery is just one of many </v>

2838
02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:45.121
<v Speaker 3>that they're slowly starting to uncover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you look at these </v>

2839
02:10:45.121 --> 02:10:45.890
<v Speaker 3>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are there,</v>

2840
02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:48.040
<v Speaker 3>they're covered up with dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Amazon,</v>

2841
02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.650
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly finding these ancient</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilizations.</v>

2842
02:10:50.651 --> 02:10:55.651
<v Speaker 3>They have no explanation for the Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient structures that have actually </v>

2843
02:10:55.651 --> 02:10:56.220
<v Speaker 3>become like hills and they find these </v>
<v Speaker 3>hills and they go,</v>

2844
02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:00.490
<v Speaker 3>I think this might've been a building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they start hacking through it.</v>

2845
02:11:00.491 --> 02:11:03.150
<v Speaker 3>And then they bring in a radar and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2846
02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:08.200
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pound the earth with radar to try </v>

2847
02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:08.290
<v Speaker 3>to understand what's underneath it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they find these builders</v>

2848
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:13.310
<v Speaker 4>things that amazing how quickly we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>forget our history such that we don't </v>

2849
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:17.351
<v Speaker 4>even know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I would have thought that there'd </v>

2850
02:11:17.351 --> 02:11:18.140
<v Speaker 4>be a continuity of human experience and </v>
<v Speaker 4>human record keeping in some way that we</v>

2851
02:11:18.141 --> 02:11:23.141
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would know that we wouldn't have to </v>

2852
02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:23.141
<v Speaker 4>be making this stuff up.</v>

2853
02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what Randall Carlson comes in </v>

2854
02:11:26.210 --> 02:11:27.741
<v Speaker 3>because Randall Carlson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's an expert in these asteroidal </v>

2855
02:11:27.741 --> 02:11:29.100
<v Speaker 3>impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>says that human beings have had to reset</v>

2856
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:34.430
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been several resets over the </v>

2857
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.430
<v Speaker 3>course of many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many millions of years,</v>

2858
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:36.690
<v Speaker 3>or in many hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of life.</v>

2859
02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:42.060
<v Speaker 3>There's also a super volcano in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia that they've attributed to be </v>

2860
02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:46.220
<v Speaker 3>one of the main reasons why all human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings come from one individual genetic </v>

2861
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:48.180
<v Speaker 3>source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that 75,000</v>

2862
02:11:48.181 --> 02:11:49.440
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Super Volcano,</v>

2863
02:11:49.441 --> 02:11:54.441
<v Speaker 3>that glue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much larger than yellowstone and </v>

2864
02:11:54.441 --> 02:11:54.780
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone blows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are all fucked.</v>

2865
02:11:55.110 --> 02:12:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Like it's going to kill almost everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this continent eventually and </v>

2866
02:12:00.110 --> 02:12:04.850
<v Speaker 3>globally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to have a massive effect to </v>

2867
02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:04.850
<v Speaker 3>nuclear winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a massive climate change,</v>

2868
02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:05.280
<v Speaker 3>and every six to 800,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2869
02:12:05.490 --> 02:12:08.370
<v Speaker 3>this fucking goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a called volcano.</v>

2870
02:12:08.371 --> 02:12:11.940
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's 600 kilometers wide,</v>

2871
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.720
<v Speaker 3>which is 300 miles and they only </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered this,</v>

2872
02:12:15.721 --> 02:12:20.721
<v Speaker 3>that this used to be a volcano in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the 20th century when they </v>

2873
02:12:20.721 --> 02:12:24.321
<v Speaker 3>started using satellite imagery when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they started looking at yellow stone </v>

2874
02:12:24.321 --> 02:12:24.500
<v Speaker 3>from space and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2875
02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:29.550
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fucking cap that blew off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and left a crater.</v>

2876
02:12:30.170 --> 02:12:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2877
02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:32.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like we're just going about our </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives,</v>

2878
02:12:32.290 --> 02:12:34.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best laid plans of mice and men.</v>

2879
02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll all go to hell at some point.</v>

2880
02:12:36.610 --> 02:12:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is at yellowstone,</v>

2881
02:12:39.330 --> 02:12:44.330
<v Speaker 3>that's the Caldera fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they figured that out from space </v>

2882
02:12:44.330 --> 02:12:48.240
<v Speaker 3>where they looked at it and so that used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a mountain and that mountain </v>

2883
02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:50.910
<v Speaker 3>exploded and left behind this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crater looking.</v>

2884
02:12:51.070 --> 02:12:55.150
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing in terms of the continuity </v>
<v Speaker 4>of civilizations and how we.</v>

2885
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:57.300
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that reset that.</v>

2886
02:12:57.310 --> 02:13:02.310
<v Speaker 4>I was reading a fascinating pace about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a a commission to figure out </v>

2887
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:07.260
<v Speaker 4>how to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about radioactive waste </v>

2888
02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:07.260
<v Speaker 4>earlier on how long this lasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2889
02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:08.950
<v Speaker 4>The radioactive waste from nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 4>stockpiles.</v>

2890
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:14.320
<v Speaker 4>How do you build signs for future </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization?</v>

2891
02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:17.810
<v Speaker 4>To tell them not to touch the weights </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't go.</v>

2892
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:20.110
<v Speaker 4>There is an act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a fascinating.</v>

2893
02:13:20.111 --> 02:13:25.111
<v Speaker 4>I think it's in slate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fascinating article about the </v>

2894
02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:28.500
<v Speaker 4>commission which was which had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>commission which has been commissioned </v>

2895
02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:31.860
<v Speaker 4>to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's assume that there's a </v>

2896
02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:34.470
<v Speaker 4>civilizational reset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which there probably will be right at </v>

2897
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.470
<v Speaker 4>some point while this stuff is still </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>

2898
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:36.000
<v Speaker 4>so these people aren't going to know our</v>
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>

2899
02:13:36.150 --> 02:13:39.420
<v Speaker 4>They're not gonna understand that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>skull and crossbones means this is bad.</v>

2900
02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:40.260
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to.</v>

2901
02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.320
<v Speaker 4>They may not even understand the concept</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we may lose the technology to </v>

2902
02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:48.470
<v Speaker 4>nuclear and understand what nuclear is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They May.</v>

2903
02:13:49.050 --> 02:13:51.120
<v Speaker 4>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surprisingly often.</v>

2904
02:13:51.121 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 4>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know it's already already.</v>

2905
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:56.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm losing where my photos are from hard</v>
<v Speaker 4>drives that are just three.</v>

2906
02:13:56.071 --> 02:13:57.030
<v Speaker 4>How drives it go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2907
02:13:57.270 --> 02:14:02.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>multiply that by a million and suddenly </v>

2908
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:05.300
<v Speaker 4>they're designing like these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these huge landscapes of like </v>

2909
02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:07.200
<v Speaker 4>interlocking sticks that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2910
02:14:07.201 --> 02:14:10.470
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of feet high to try to imply </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this is a bad,</v>

2911
02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:12.900
<v Speaker 4>this is a bad thing and that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't dig it up.</v>

2912
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:15.210
<v Speaker 4>But I mean at the end of the day what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the conclusion was,</v>

2913
02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:20.420
<v Speaker 4>you probably just shouldn't put anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>there because people were always going </v>

2914
02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:20.420
<v Speaker 4>to be curious and you never going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>convince them like,</v>

2915
02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we go into the,</v>

2916
02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.630
<v Speaker 4>we go into the tombs of the Pharaoh in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2917
02:14:24.670 --> 02:14:27.360
<v Speaker 4>in Egypt because we just think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>their beliefs about,</v>

2918
02:14:27.450 --> 02:14:28.050
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2919
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:29.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2920
02:14:29.101 --> 02:14:30.690
<v Speaker 4>the bad that will come to us from going </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

2921
02:14:30.691 --> 02:14:35.691
<v Speaker 4>There are silly fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a future civilizations think that </v>

2922
02:14:35.691 --> 02:14:39.240
<v Speaker 4>we're full of silly fantasies when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell them not to go into nuclear waste.</v>

2923
02:14:39.490 --> 02:14:41.780
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we would need something like</v>

2924
02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Georgia guidestones or like some giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rosetta stone in several different </v>

2925
02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:50.841
<v Speaker 3>languages to sort of let them decode it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we do have a civilizational </v>

2926
02:14:50.841 --> 02:14:53.550
<v Speaker 3>reset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a barbaric type civilization is all</v>

2927
02:14:53.551 --> 02:14:56.160
<v Speaker 3>that's left and we literally like </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking dead,</v>

2928
02:14:56.161 --> 02:14:58.800
<v Speaker 3>running around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scavenging for food and everyone forgets</v>

2929
02:14:58.801 --> 02:15:00.810
<v Speaker 3>how to count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean fuck man,</v>

2930
02:15:00.811 --> 02:15:05.811
<v Speaker 3>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are going to die of </v>

2931
02:15:05.811 --> 02:15:07.041
<v Speaker 3>cancer and if it's the only people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are left on earth are people that live </v>

2932
02:15:07.041 --> 02:15:07.041
<v Speaker 3>in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might all die.</v>

2933
02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking about 75,000</v>

2934
02:15:11.611 --> 02:15:14.730
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is low or 75,000</v>

2935
02:15:14.731 --> 02:15:19.731
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they think a few thousand people </v>

2936
02:15:19.731 --> 02:15:19.731
<v Speaker 3>were leftover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2937
02:15:19.731 --> 02:15:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2938
02:15:20.150 --> 02:15:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2939
02:15:21.181 --> 02:15:21.930
<v Speaker 3>This Indonesia.</v>

2940
02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:27.420
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when we are all much more closely </v>

2941
02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:27.970
<v Speaker 4>related than you would ever assume from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bottle necking period,</v>

2942
02:15:27.971 --> 02:15:32.971
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where humanity dwindled down to just a </v>

2943
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:32.971
<v Speaker 4>few a few pipes.</v>

2944
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:34.150
<v Speaker 3>So where their thinking is 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

2945
02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:37.450
<v Speaker 3>giant sums of people were wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then 10 to 12,000</v>

2946
02:15:37.451 --> 02:15:40.060
<v Speaker 3>years ago again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant amounts of people were wiped out.</v>

2947
02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:42.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's where civilization had it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reset.</v>

2948
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:47.550
<v Speaker 3>That's also the end of the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also the almost instantaneous </v>

2949
02:15:47.550 --> 02:15:48.040
<v Speaker 3>death of woolly mammoths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saber Tooth Tigers,</v>

2950
02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 3>and it's this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this event that they're showing in </v>

2951
02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:54.160
<v Speaker 3>geological evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's indisputable.</v>

2952
02:15:54.190 --> 02:15:58.240
<v Speaker 3>There was absolutely some sort of huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>meteorological event,</v>

2953
02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:03.360
<v Speaker 3>some sort or media event asteroidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>event where we were pelted were pelted </v>

2954
02:16:03.521 --> 02:16:07.870
<v Speaker 3>with and it's not like it's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like something like 900,000</v>

2955
02:16:07.871 --> 02:16:09.850
<v Speaker 3>near Earth objects had been mapped out.</v>

2956
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2957
02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:13.260
<v Speaker 4>this is actually a really easy thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>solve,</v>

2958
02:16:13.261 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 4>but we don't put the money into solving </v>
<v Speaker 4>it yet.</v>

2959
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:21.750
<v Speaker 4>If you identify it far enough out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a simple calculation to be able to </v>

2960
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:22.170
<v Speaker 4>do the math and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well that one's going to hit us.</v>

2961
02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:27.380
<v Speaker 4>And then you just got to send up a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 4>of nukes to nudge it off course if you </v>

2962
02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:30.651
<v Speaker 4>catch it early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't catch it until it's </v>

2963
02:16:30.651 --> 02:16:30.651
<v Speaker 4>almost here rude,</v>

2964
02:16:30.651 --> 02:16:30.651
<v Speaker 1>they don't think they think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2965
02:16:30.651 --> 02:16:35.251
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they think nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea's to nudge it out of </v>

2966
02:16:35.251 --> 02:16:35.800
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with changing the,</v>

2967
02:16:35.801 --> 02:16:37.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2968
02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:38.140
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it called?</v>

2969
02:16:38.141 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 1>The aerodynamics of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2970
02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:41.470
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the asteroids idea.</v>

2971
02:16:41.490 --> 02:16:45.600
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting putting a web on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another will affect how a.</v>

2972
02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are a bunch of things,</v>

2973
02:16:48.071 --> 02:16:53.071
<v Speaker 1>but it's difficult engineering thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with a figure to figure out a </v>

2974
02:16:53.071 --> 02:16:56.851
<v Speaker 1>way to nudge an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true and I also </v>

2975
02:16:56.851 --> 02:16:58.480
<v Speaker 1>think there's also an issue with space </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the gravity of the sun.</v>

2976
02:16:58.481 --> 02:17:03.481
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the sun that we don't even see </v>

2977
02:17:03.481 --> 02:17:04.180
<v Speaker 1>coming because the gravity of the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>altar space,</v>

2978
02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 1>it alters the way we view things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kind you factor that in.</v>

2979
02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean we spent around the sun so we get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see all four corners of the of the </v>

2980
02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:16.351
<v Speaker 1>universe as we go around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to this day constantly there's </v>

2981
02:17:16.351 --> 02:17:18.090
<v Speaker 1>things that come very close to us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't see coming because we.</v>

2982
02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Because Republicans cut funding to NASA </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

2983
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to think that that's the </v>

2984
02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:27.181
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it might be slightly beyond </v>

2985
02:17:27.181 --> 02:17:28.380
<v Speaker 1>our grasp right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To see all of them coming.</v>

2986
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Things that are coming from the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pole and the South Pole.</v>

2987
02:17:31.841 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 1>They're coming from places where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not really observing the sky,</v>

2988
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:40.110
<v Speaker 1>very vigilantly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what we find is actually </v>

2989
02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:43.051
<v Speaker 1>discovered by amateur astronomers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find asteroids and they named them </v>

2990
02:17:43.051 --> 02:17:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and measure them and then they send in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their data and how many of those fuckers</v>

2991
02:17:46.001 --> 02:17:46.780
<v Speaker 1>are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2992
02:17:46.781 --> 02:17:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people are out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there actively searching for asteroids.</v>

2993
02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's very many and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shocking.</v>

2994
02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:54.820
<v Speaker 1>But you're talking about the policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern,</v>

2995
02:17:54.821 --> 02:17:59.821
<v Speaker 1>which I agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about there are two </v>

2996
02:17:59.821 --> 02:17:59.821
<v Speaker 1>concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2997
02:17:59.821 --> 02:17:59.821
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be,</v>

2998
02:17:59.821 --> 02:18:01.840
<v Speaker 1>do we have the scientific and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering know how to be able to nudge</v>

2999
02:18:01.841 --> 02:18:06.841
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an asteroid out of the way if we catch </v>

3000
02:18:06.841 --> 02:18:06.841
<v Speaker 1>it early enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other question is,</v>

3001
02:18:06.841 --> 02:18:08.720
<v Speaker 1>are we bothering to look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the question that I'm,</v>

3002
02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:10.540
<v Speaker 1>that I'm more concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're getting close,</v>

3003
02:18:10.541 --> 02:18:15.541
<v Speaker 1>but I also think there's the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collisions when asteroids collide with </v>

3004
02:18:15.541 --> 02:18:19.561
<v Speaker 1>each other and then send one hurling </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards us that we didn't expect that </v>

3005
02:18:19.561 --> 02:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>can happen too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucked.</v>

3006
02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all fucked.</v>

3007
02:18:22.390 --> 02:18:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3008
02:18:22.991 --> 02:18:24.310
<v Speaker 1>we did another hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

3009
02:18:24.370 --> 02:18:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna go take a chill pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a chill pill.</v>

3010
02:18:27.250 --> 02:18:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Tell everybody one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we get to your show Josh steps on</v>

3011
02:18:30.371 --> 02:18:30.700

3021
02:18:52.801 --> 02:18:56.881
<v Speaker 1>the people pod because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people are going to be the night of </v>

3022
02:18:56.881 --> 02:18:56.881
<v Speaker 1>the live show info.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way the people pod.com.</v>

3023
02:18:56.881 --> 02:18:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And tell us what part of this </v>
