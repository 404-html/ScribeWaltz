<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

2
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I should've known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't hear myself.</v>

3
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I should've known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:36.140
<v Speaker 1>But nobody wants to watch the replays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

7
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's recap what I talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious clusterfuck,</v>

8
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>haircut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause.</v>

9
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need that one might be in the audio </v>

10
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>because you hear them well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's recap what we're talking about.</v>

11
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're upset here.</v>

12
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I said some genius shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the most profound shit I've </v>

13
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>

14
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I said in the beginning,</v>

15
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 2>the very beginning was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

16
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited to do these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 2>ustream broadcast and I'm excited that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to do it because I liked doing </v>

18
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.010
<v Speaker 2>radio interviews and I'm like doing tv </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews and that's all fun magazine </v>

19
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.871
<v Speaker 2>stuff was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's way cooler to just be able to </v>

20
00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:16.871
<v Speaker 2>talk to people and answer people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions directly,</v>

21
00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

22
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to get a weird impression of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

23
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing someone on television.</v>

24
00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 2>The television represent too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a certain extent.</v>

25
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a lot of these guys in the </v>

26
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.550
<v Speaker 2>reality shows to get upset like </v>
<v Speaker 2>television doesn't,</v>

27
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it represents you in little snippets and</v>

28
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 2>cuts you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
<v Speaker 2>but the best way to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for sure is the Internet and </v>

30
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 2>twitter and Ustream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So combining the two of them together,</v>

31
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.530
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna I'm going to do this every </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

33
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.380
<v Speaker 2>The thing behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this bullshit behind me that's all </v>

34
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.621
<v Speaker 2>going to get cleared out and we're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up a green screen so we could have </v>

35
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.511
<v Speaker 2>like space behind us and shit and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have this thing set up at a </v>

36
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 2>little bit more natural angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll be looking right at us,</v>

37
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 1>which makes more sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put it anywhere you want.</v>

39
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>You can put it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

40

<v Speaker 2>to be able to communicate with people </v>

00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:31.991
<v Speaker 2>directly like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to get the answers to any </v>

75
00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 2>question at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it's the greatest fucking thing in</v>

76
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:37.631
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent most of my day staring at a </v>

77
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:40.030
<v Speaker 2>screen reading stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching fucking youtube videos and </v>

78
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.910
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear I've learned more from the </v>

79
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Internet more from just being on message</v>
<v Speaker 2>boards than I ever have from,</v>

80
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from other shit.</v>

81
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten into all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects because of message boards,</v>

82
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

83
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:57.251
<v Speaker 2>and wound up being fans of musicians and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and people I would have never </v>

84
00:08:57.251 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 2>heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't from message boards.</v>

85
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole online part.</v>

86
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I meet more people online than I do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>real life now and I don't just live in </v>

87
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.690
<v Speaker 1>my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go out a lot more people interested in</v>

88
00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:13.691
<v Speaker 1>the same things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to get to know him better on the </v>

89
00:09:13.691 --> 00:09:13.691
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

90
00:09:13.691 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the Internet allows you when </v>

91
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.080
<v Speaker 2>someone posts for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a message board community,</v>

92
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.420
<v Speaker 2>you get to see how they interact with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

93
00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:21.370
<v Speaker 2>You get to see what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know they're.</v>

94
00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:23.320
<v Speaker 2>They're challenged on their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to see.</v>

95
00:09:23.321 --> 00:09:24.640
<v Speaker 2>You get to see what they're made of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

96
00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:25.930
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

97
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 2>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way people write is different than </v>

98
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.811
<v Speaker 2>the way they talk because people can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they're slick and they could try </v>

99
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:35.170
<v Speaker 2>to bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You buy really patiently scribing out.</v>

100
00:09:35.171 --> 00:09:37.480

<v Speaker 2>but they're not tricking you.</v>

101
00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Eventually eventually that shit just </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out because they don't realize how</v>

102
00:09:41.321 --> 00:09:46.321
<v Speaker 2>douchey they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize they think they're </v>

103
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:46.321
<v Speaker 2>not Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in your writing,</v>

104
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:47.650
<v Speaker 2>the Douchey always comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't.</v>

150
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that guy puts out a lot of negative </v>

155
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:56.480
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

160
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.200

<v Speaker 1>But what I was saying is the dudes that </v>

<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>

236
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:07.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were like really smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that went to college.</v>

237
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>They're not idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

238
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.640

<v Speaker 1>It's only been a second.</v>

242
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I was going to talk about it.</v>

243
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why do you have it in front of my </v>

244
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like looking at myself.</v>

245
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows what the fuck you're doing.</v>

246
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

247
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking webcasts do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is serious thing.</v>

248
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I totally forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was even talking about now what was </v>

249
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:41.070
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

250
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.900
<v Speaker 1>actually I was doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker.</v>

251
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Stupid Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me ladies and gentlemen,</v>

252
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:49.000
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was I just talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

253
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Pretty crazy about that dog though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I heard that that video.</v>

254
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 1>The dog in the video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

255
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.700
<v Speaker 1>that was a dog that knew about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake before the people do.</v>

256
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 1>That's because people hear shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't pay attention.</v>

257
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 1>The dog heard something is probably what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck.</v>

258
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And the person was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that shit?</v>

259
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>He didn't react and then it happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was only like a second before</v>

260
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's that video right here.</v>

261
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Watch the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just freaked out and ran.</v>

262
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a while before even anything </v>

263
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.010
<v Speaker 1>shook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see it again.</v>

264
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Rewind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the dog dogs chilling though.</v>

265
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that noise?</v>

266
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know that.</v>

267
00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:28.120
<v Speaker 1>That dude didn't react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a stupid video,</v>

268
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but this is the problem the dog took off</v>
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

269
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but the guy you don't see his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy might've went,</v>

270
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.560
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

271
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And everybody is making it like the dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard this before anybody else.</v>

272
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:44.060
<v Speaker 1>But he felt some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look at it but nothing's </v>

273
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.060
<v Speaker 1>moving at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

274
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.700
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you hear things before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake.</v>

275
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Well you know that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

276
00:16:47.411 --> 00:16:49.810
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really start moving until.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see it again.</v>

277
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

278
00:16:54.271 --> 00:16:55.410
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit moving.</v>

279
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it made a sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

280
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you're right on the ground to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird.</v>

281
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:03.470
<v Speaker 1>If there was a sound right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real rumble can still see some fingers</v>

282
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.430
<v Speaker 1>monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

283
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So the dogs like two second smarter than</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person.</v>

284
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.150
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got thumbs.</v>

285
00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

289
00:17:22.321 --> 00:17:22.321

<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

290
00:17:22.321 --> 00:17:22.570
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot of twitter messages coming </v>

291
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.580

294
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:37.770
<v Speaker 1>hooked on pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

295
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a when when dudes get hooked on </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain pills,</v>

296
00:17:38.051 --> 00:17:40.330
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who's a very smart guy.</v>

297
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:42.900
<v Speaker 1>He was an it guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to uh,</v>

298
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to college.</v>

299
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Really avid reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a,</v>

300
00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:48.790
<v Speaker 1>not a fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has a real.</v>

301
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

302
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 2>that's just what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

303
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudes get injured,</v>

304
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 2>something happens to you and then adjust</v>
<v Speaker 2>it chemically bonds with your body.</v>

305
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really incredible with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction is,</v>

306
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conviction is your,</v>

307
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:07.311
<v Speaker 2>your body is somehow or another linked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to something that's really terrible for </v>

308
00:18:07.311 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 2>it and it needs that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like it becomes.</v>

309
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like like heroin and crystal</v>
<v Speaker 2>meth and stuff like that that really </v>

310
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 2>locks a hold of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like they're parasites.</v>

311
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:21.470
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the drug itself has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and the drug itself is </v>

312
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:26.160
<v Speaker 2>gonna make you do it as much as you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all and rob you of life.</v>

313
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one way to look at like </v>

314
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>horrible substances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when people talk about drugs,</v>

315
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they like to lump all drugs in </v>

316
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.470
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

317
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.290
<v Speaker 2>That's so stupid because marijuana and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and psychedelic drugs,</v>

318
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.750
<v Speaker 2>if done correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be very beneficial and when they're </v>

319
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 2>over you don't feel any repercussions.</v>

320
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.110
<v Speaker 2>You're okay if they don't hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and mushrooms and things like </v>

321
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The natural things that people have been</v>

322
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 2>doing for tens of thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things aren't hurting anybody,</v>

323
00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can't get into your system,</v>

324
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you lump them in with oxycodones </v>

325
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 2>and fucking heroin and crystal Meth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

326
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's becoming a more introspective,</v>

327
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 2>fascinating person on crystal meth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll become and fucking crazy.</v>

328
00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:16.431
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have to look at drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what they do to the people </v>

329
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 2>that take them and do the things that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive things.</v>

330
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You can't ignore that just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a drug.</v>

331
00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

332
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 2>because it's an illegal drug than all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits that people talk about it.</v>

333
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:32.841
<v Speaker 2>Those don't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're invalid just because it's not </v>

334
00:19:32.841 --> 00:19:32.841
<v Speaker 2>sanctioned by a group of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals.</v>

335
00:19:32.841 --> 00:19:35.010
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense at all.</v>

336
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lived my whole life like this.</v>

337
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have thought by now we would </v>

338
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 2>have come to some sort of irrational </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding as human beings,</v>

339
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.710
<v Speaker 2>as we got to be adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we would come to a point where</v>

340
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.600
<v Speaker 2>we would sit back and we would look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and go,</v>

341
00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

342
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 2>What right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I have to tell another person what to</v>

343
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:55.620
<v Speaker 2>do or not to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as he's not trying to give it to</v>

344
00:19:55.621 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 2>minors or people that don't know any </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

345
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.050
<v Speaker 2>As long as people are educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's spend money on programs and make </v>

346
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.441
<v Speaker 2>sure that people don't get involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything fucked up like this and let's </v>

347
00:20:06.441 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to fucking children in </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>

348
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:11.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest problem this country isn't </v>

<v Speaker 2>laws and and crime.</v>

350
00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 2>The biggest problem is why are people </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating crime?</v>

351
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:18.021
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

<v Speaker 2>spend all this fucking time flying over </v>

363
00:20:54.391 --> 00:20:59.371
<v Speaker 2>to Afghanistan trying to chase down 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Taliban fighters in the mountains and </v>

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 2>young people are dying over there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that help out.</v>

365
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 2>We spend that money attacking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking enemy at home.</v>

366
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:11.250
<v Speaker 2>The enemy at home is a horrible fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhoods that some of our fellow human</v>

367
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 2>beings in this country have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

368
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we really need to do is focus on </v>

369
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Focus on children that are growing up in</v>

370
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:25.441
<v Speaker 2>terrible neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Focus on fucking schools and community </v>

371
00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:27.280
<v Speaker 2>centers and give these kids somewhere to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to when their parents suck.</v>

372
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on a bunch of people that want to </v>

373
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.501
<v Speaker 2>help raise kids that come from terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations or help the parents </v>

374
00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:36.120
<v Speaker 2>understand what the fuck they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising children and,</v>

375
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.980
<v Speaker 2>and making these kids fucking psychos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and giving them horrible childhoods,</v>

376
00:21:39.981 --> 00:21:44.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then and literally setting loose a </v>

377
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.701
<v Speaker 2>bomb setting loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's eventually going to turn </v>

378
00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:51.050
<v Speaker 2>all their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their inward anger outward and other </v>

379
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:51.550
<v Speaker 2>people or other their pain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment and all that.</v>

380
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 2>The negative input coming into them as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>

381
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.690
<v Speaker 2>you know that shit is fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You deal with a child,</v>

382
00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 2>the customer positive loving </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

383
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:04.681
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to deal with a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being that human beings going to come </v>

384
00:22:04.681 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 2>out of that and going to appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

385
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.810
<v Speaker 2>That's our number one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As human beings,</v>

386
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.840
<v Speaker 2>our number one problem as human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the way we don't appreciate each </v>

387
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.471
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we look at each other as </v>

388
00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:18.061
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we look at each other as just </v>

389
00:22:18.061 --> 00:22:18.061
<v Speaker 2>people that are on the highway and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking way.</v>

390
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Human beings have to learn to appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and we need to learn how to </v>

391
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.871
<v Speaker 2>deal with the fucking very obvious shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we ignore instead of pretending </v>

392
00:22:27.871 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 2>there's some incredible assault on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human race here in America.</v>

393
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should look on what.</v>

394
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Where does the real crime coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are the real murders coming from where's</v>

395
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 2>the real anger and violence and the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that affects day to day people everyday.</v>

396
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not the fucking desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

397
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not the fucking mountains of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>

398
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 2>It's in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all over the place.</v>

399
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's children growing up and becoming </v>

400
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.011
<v Speaker 2>fucking criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's way scarier to me than some </v>

401
00:22:56.011 --> 00:22:56.011
<v Speaker 2>Douche bag in Afghanistan.</v>

402
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.580
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nonsense.</v>

403
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone said Carl and pills.</v>

404
00:23:04.141 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something Carl's training partner</v>

405
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:06.990
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>

406
00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

407
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:12.090
<v Speaker 2>all I know is that he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's always been a cool dude to me.</v>

408
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Carl is a great fighter and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>some unfortunate situations and I hope </v>

409
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.150
<v Speaker 2>it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that too.</v>

410
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's good people and he's a bad </v>

411
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.541
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the best judo guys to ever enter </v>

412
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:26.541
<v Speaker 2>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

413
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:28.020
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he opened people's eyes to a lot of shit</v>

414
00:23:28.021 --> 00:23:33.021
<v Speaker 2>that was possible because before caro </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody was hitting like those beautiful </v>

415
00:23:33.021 --> 00:23:37.161
<v Speaker 2>fucking throws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hits his beautiful shoulder throws </v>

416
00:23:37.161 --> 00:23:37.770
<v Speaker 2>and hip throws and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his judo,</v>

417
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.690
<v Speaker 2>like back when he fought like Dave </v>
<v Speaker 2>Strasser,</v>

418
00:23:39.691 --> 00:23:42.870
<v Speaker 2>like when it was first a UFC bounce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible judo,</v>

419
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

420
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:48.810
<v Speaker 2>that's an whenever get a guy who steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>into mma and has some totally something </v>

421
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:53.981
<v Speaker 2>that he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at that most people aren't </v>

422
00:23:53.981 --> 00:23:53.981
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Machita with karate,</v>

423
00:23:53.981 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>like people will crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that good?</v>

424
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Credit isn't really work until Machida </v>
<v Speaker 2>came along and were treated.</v>

425
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Machida is so good at karate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he makes karate work in MMA,</v>

426
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously he knows wrestling and </v>

427
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:06.940
<v Speaker 2>obviously he knows all the other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes with MMA,</v>

428
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's such a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the bottom line is his karate,</v>

429
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 2>his ability to move backward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

430
00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:14.650
<v Speaker 2>he fights like a fucking John Claude van</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damme movie and it's,</v>

431
00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty bad ass to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

432
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 2>because until the shogun fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really didn't take hardly any damage.</v>

433
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.450
<v Speaker 2>What do I think about the United Arab </v>
<v Speaker 2>Emirates buying to Suva?</v>

434
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the guy who is behind it all</v>

435
00:24:30.911 --> 00:24:33.300
<v Speaker 2>is a chic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked noon of uh,</v>

436
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:38.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abu Dhabi and that guy is a huge fan of </v>

437
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.230
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts and he's incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly wealthy.</v>

438
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:43.390
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy can,</v>

439
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.850
<v Speaker 2>he can do a lot of good things for mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

440
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.630
<v Speaker 2>he is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt </v>
<v Speaker 2>under Henzel Gracie,</v>

441
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.510
<v Speaker 2>and by all accounts he's legit by all </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts.</v>

442
00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:57.280
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good black belt and Hanzo </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the most respected instructors</v>

443
00:24:57.281 --> 00:24:59.740
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Henzel gracie gives you a black belt,</v>

444
00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge honor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that she talked noon.</v>

445
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.600
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he's a Henzel gracie black</v>
<v Speaker 2>belt.</v>

446
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I know he's been having people travel to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abu Dhabi for years,</v>

447
00:25:08.471 --> 00:25:13.471
<v Speaker 2>for over a decade since the late </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties and he had like some of the </v>

448
00:25:13.471 --> 00:25:15.890
<v Speaker 2>best instructors in the world that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>come and stay with him and uh,</v>

449
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.850
<v Speaker 2>he had a whole camp there and you bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and you have guys to train with.</v>

450
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

451
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.370
<v Speaker 2>it's just the Jujitsu fiend just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like more than way more than me,</v>

452
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

453
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about how much I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and this guy is like,</v>

454
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just like,</v>

455
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:30.940
<v Speaker 2>he loves it and he has unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

456
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:36.210
<v Speaker 2>So having a guy like that as a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner in the UFC I think is gonna be </v>

457
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.820
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal for the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any question that </v>

458
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.401
<v Speaker 2>guy is going to without a doubt that God</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to help out and it's going to </v>

459
00:25:44.401 --> 00:25:48.541
<v Speaker 2>be interesting to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That lives in a castle like a fucking </v>

461
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Ali Baba Type Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

462
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's even one without the paintings now.</v>

463
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Who is the guy that I don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheik has like,</v>

464
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that the royal family is worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>like some insane amount of money,</v>

465
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:02.660
<v Speaker 2>like the one of the most richest people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

466
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.930
<v Speaker 2>How about that one of the richest people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

467
00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 2>That dude is a fucking train killer.</v>

468
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

469
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.450
<v Speaker 2>do I think is going to take an active </v>
<v Speaker 2>role like Dana White?</v>

470
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I do for the UFC is the commentary.</v>

471
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:25.601
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to those guys and they're my </v>

472
00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:25.601
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

473
00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:28.340
<v Speaker 2>no influence whatsoever on the business </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of things.</v>

474
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:33.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just my job to call the action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really pretty fucking crazy gig.</v>

475
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:39.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it's like a perfect job because </v>

476
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for real,</v>

477
00:26:41.571 --> 00:26:46.571
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch like when I watched the </v>

<v Speaker 2>or a strike force or anything like that.</v>

480
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.960
<v Speaker 2>When I watch those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch those shows for work.</v>

481
00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

482

485

<v Speaker 2>it just for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fun.</v>

486
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I would have done it even if I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have done it,</v>

487
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 2>even if it wasn't my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a huge fan,</v>

488
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:12.140
<v Speaker 2>like professionally and I'm very lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty crazy gig man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of fun.</v>

490
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.190
<v Speaker 2>It's cool too because we get to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fights and you know,</v>

491
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 2>be there live and be right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cage.</v>

492
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

493
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.870
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of the last year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some good fights,</v>

494
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:29.090
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it?</v>

495
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Evan Dunham,</v>

496
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:31.860
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad asses that guy.</v>

497
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.160
<v Speaker 2>And he got tagged in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first round,</v>

498
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort and was all over them.</v>

499
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 2>And then Evan Dunham survived and pulled</v>
<v Speaker 2>off that.</v>

500
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 2>That fucking Armbar was so bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way did,</v>

501
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:46.770
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so wicked.</v>

502
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Did he break his arm at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

503
00:27:48.331 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did not break his arm.</v>

504
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:53.280
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up his tendons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lucky for him.</v>

505
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is man,</v>

506
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:56.710
<v Speaker 2>if it breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that.</v>

507
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.160
<v Speaker 2>The way that armbar happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how his arm,</v>

508
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 2>like he was bending it completely at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>joint is scary.</v>

509
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Kindness the way Frank Mir broke tim his</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm because he actually broke the middle</v>

510
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:08.490
<v Speaker 2>of the forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He broke the forum and half.</v>

511
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the scary shit that takes forever</v>
<v Speaker 2>to heal and it's usually not the same.</v>

512
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.670
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you know.</v>

513
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I think you break your arm like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

514
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a serious fucking fracture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the middle.</v>

515
00:28:20.071 --> 00:28:25.071
<v Speaker 2>I think if you bust up a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get put that together a little bit </v>

516
00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:28.521
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take arms and now by now you like metal </v>

517
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 2>arms or bones or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they can.</v>

518
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do hips and they do knees,</v>

519
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 2>but once you get a knee that's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ain't doing no Jujitsu.</v>

520
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude named connor,</v>

521
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 2>connor human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a one of Eddie's top students,</v>

522
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:47.451
<v Speaker 2>a real high level wrestler and his dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a wrestler and his dad got a hip </v>

523
00:28:47.451 --> 00:28:52.401
<v Speaker 2>replacement and his dad still does do </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and fighting tournament and the </v>

524
00:28:52.401 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 2>dude's like 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible,</v>

525
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has a hip replacement,</v>

526
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 2>but he's a fucking psycho and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stud.</v>

527
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.130
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average person,</v>

528
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 2>you get a hip replacement and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap.</v>

529
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that dude from the Sopranos,</v>

530
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.910
<v Speaker 2>he used to walk fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Fat Guy who turned out,</v>

531
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.770
<v Speaker 2>you know he's gay and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sopranos.</v>

532
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 2>And he had that weird walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that guy?</v>

533
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.860
<v Speaker 2>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that Kai's character.</v>

534
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something killed him.</v>

535
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was gay.</v>

536
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:24.950
<v Speaker 2>They murdered him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they jumped like a fucking a </v>

537
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.550
<v Speaker 2>broomstick up his ass or a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>member pool.</v>

538
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Cue up his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

539
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Because he was selling a line of pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>cues.</v>

540
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.480
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dude tried to sell a,</v>

541
00:29:32.481 --> 00:29:36.840
<v Speaker 2>a pool cues acute to die for the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

542
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.600
<v Speaker 2>It was like a brake stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous,</v>

543
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 2>but Sopranos told him to knock it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How hilarious is that as a dude?</v>

544
00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Some marketing sense got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A pool cue.</v>

545
00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:50.821
<v Speaker 2>I'll show them those motherfuckers on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the qs sales pool cues because they </v>

546
00:29:50.821 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 2>killed them with one of the Sopranos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greatest show of all time.</v>

547
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like this season I'm still really pumped</v>

555
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:11.260
<v Speaker 2>up to see what the fuck is going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I watched last.</v>

623
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:54.700
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

624
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:54.700
<v Speaker 2>when people come up to you for fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor,</v>

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a.</v>

627
00:32:56.721 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I know what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like they love,</v>

628
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're like an actor or </v>

629
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:04.600
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you're in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy movies,</v>

630
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 2>like that guy is the kind of adulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy must get.</v>

631
00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

632
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And if he was already crazy to begin </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that just when,</v>

633
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 2>when crazy people all of a sudden have </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and people kissing their ass,</v>

634
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy people are supposed to be like </v>

635
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:21.280
<v Speaker 2>suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you split the crazy people.</v>

636
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:21.570
<v Speaker 2>You supposed to see them and go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't work like on the TV </v>

638
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.530
<v Speaker 2>show or a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because once you become crazy,</v>

639
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.320
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if you're a star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let you be crazy.</v>

640
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:35.321
<v Speaker 2>So you're just plucking hog wild and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing blow and punching people and they </v>

641
00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:39.671
<v Speaker 2>try to protect you as much as possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're the goose that lays the </v>

642
00:33:39.671 --> 00:33:42.971
<v Speaker 2>golden egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens to a lot of </v>

643
00:33:42.971 --> 00:33:42.971
<v Speaker 2>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where they get fucking nutty.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>think if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.670
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a ball or character.</v>

741
00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean the way it happens in Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is like all the hookers just go </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

745
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.540

<v Speaker 2>Is there any questions on your message </v>
<v Speaker 2>board?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was upbeat.</v>

768
00:41:05.821 --> 00:41:08.630
<v Speaker 1>US broadcasting of ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

770
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Can we not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't do anything like that can be </v>

771
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 1>automatically banned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

774
00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:22.791
<v Speaker 2>but eventually we're going to move over </v>
<v Speaker 2>to my website so I could show you guys </v>

775
00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:23.610
<v Speaker 2>getting fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Death by horses and people eat shit.</v>

776
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.080
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not able to show those types of </v>

777
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.520
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is not going to last.</v>

778
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.680
<v Speaker 2>They let us say whatever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we want,</v>

779
00:41:31.681 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>but we can't show you whatever we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think is</v>

780
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.160
<v Speaker 1>going to be any of the stream websites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to like,</v>

781
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to either talk to </v>

782
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you stream and see if we can say yes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

783
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one will.</v>

784
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even if you say like if you </v>

785
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:48.330
<v Speaker 1>click on something saying that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>18 and over,</v>

786
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:48.330
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now do we?</v>

787
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Do we have that now where they have to </v>

788
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:52.840
<v Speaker 1>18 and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should have that.</v>

789
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People probably put it on there.</v>

790
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sit down with you and go over the way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

831
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.890
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best thing to do.</v>

832
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that guy is an,</v>

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:53.840
<v Speaker 1>He's an unfortunate looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very unfortunate looking and he's a</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking billionaire.</v>

837
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:02.690
<v Speaker 1>no dollars checks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

838
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>

839
00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:08.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it was a pussy hound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no getting away from </v>

840
00:44:08.381 --> 00:44:11.651
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to be like that guy you know and </v>

<v Speaker 1>have all these tens and they're chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you down and they don't even care if </v>

842
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 1>you're married and they'll fly to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries to hang out with you.</v>

843
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's totally like a rock star and it </v>

845
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.380
<v Speaker 1>will then you shouldn't be married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>

846
00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending him in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more of a rockstar.</v>

847
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Most rock stars don't have own beverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then</v>

848
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.310
<v Speaker 2>they'll have their own clothing line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dude,</v>

849
00:44:34.311 --> 00:44:38.190
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love that stupid ass game.</v>

850
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially business people.</v>

851
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.440
<v Speaker 2>If you want to get down to business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a lot of people say that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be successful in business,</v>

853
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:50.490
<v Speaker 2>that you literally have to learn golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you literally have to learn it.</v>

854
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.160
<v Speaker 2>If you don't learn golf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he hit refresh</v>

855
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you so you can see why it sat.</v>

856
00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:02.110
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gone on inside.</v>

857
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Just a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That picture you're talking about tiger </v>

858
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:07.340
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

859
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.660
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with this then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

860
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you stream,</v>

861
00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you're sucking it dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would close your firearm</v>

862
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:18.320
<v Speaker 1>and open up like in safari or chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe have twins.</v>

863
00:45:18.321 --> 00:45:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Shit Open.</v>

864
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it goes.</v>

865
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It's usually the pictures up filing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

866
00:45:22.811 --> 00:45:25.150
<v Speaker 2>that's much much of a delay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I said,</v>

867
00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:27.340
<v Speaker 2>if you see a werewolf behind me and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear that,</v>

868
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.620
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already dead.</v>

869
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be kind to be on the message </v>

870
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:35.770
<v Speaker 2>boards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are brutal about Artie Lange.</v>

871
00:45:35.771 --> 00:45:40.771
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really sad to see how many </v>

872
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:41.470
<v Speaker 2>people were brutal after already laying </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to commit suicide.</v>

873
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Like calling them people just like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide shit.</v>

874
00:45:44.361 --> 00:45:45.250
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

875
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

876
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:48.620
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

877
00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.770
<v Speaker 2>there were insulting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't matter.</v>

878
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that he's weak and he's a piece</v>

879
00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:58.291
<v Speaker 2>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said about where it talked about </v>

880
00:45:58.291 --> 00:45:59.170
<v Speaker 2>the people that I know that have had </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with pain pills.</v>

881
00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:02.620
<v Speaker 2>the guy likes to jerk off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he jerks off.</v>

883
00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Two months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>

884
00:46:03.521 --> 00:46:04.620
<v Speaker 2>You need to smack him in the head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

885
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:09.621
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lost your job because you jerk off </v>

886
00:46:09.621 --> 00:46:09.621
<v Speaker 2>five times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's dudes like that.</v>

887
00:46:09.621 --> 00:46:10.510
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear ms.jobs.</v>

888
00:46:10.511 --> 00:46:10.830
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

889
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:13.810
<v Speaker 2>they show up late for work just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like chronic masturbator.</v>

890
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.460
<v Speaker 2>They wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to beat off.</v>

891
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:16.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't beat off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to go crazy.</v>

892
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Like they get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dude that's got a problem.</v>

893
00:46:19.661 --> 00:46:21.640
<v Speaker 2>That guy's his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He needs a smack in the head.</v>

894
00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.430
<v Speaker 2>People that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like compulsive gamblers.</v>

895
00:46:24.431 --> 00:46:26.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a compulsion and that's there </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

896
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.690
<v Speaker 2>There's a problem and your pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

897
00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

898
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.310
<v Speaker 2>and I've been compulsive about many </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in my life.</v>

899
00:46:33.311 --> 00:46:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I understand what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand the thinking behind it,</v>

900
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.090
<v Speaker 2>but that could all be corrected.</v>

901
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.740
<v Speaker 2>You just need to learn how to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

902
00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like heroin and Oxycontin and math </v>

903
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.270
<v Speaker 2>and people who get addicted to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's real.</v>

904
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.740
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

905
00:46:47.741 --> 00:46:52.741
<v Speaker 2>So to get to shit all over someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're addicted to a drug man,</v>

906
00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:55.000
<v Speaker 2>it ain't easy to kick that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

907
00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're doing it,</v>

908
00:46:57.161 --> 00:46:58.930
<v Speaker 2>unless you're deep in the throes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

909
00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.420
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have been,</v>

910
00:47:01.421 --> 00:47:03.520
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can say nothing,</v>

911
00:47:03.521 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 2>but I've talked to people who have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who,</v>

912
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:11.410
<v Speaker 2>who died from heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew a couple people that die from </v>

913
00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:11.410
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

914
00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.330
<v Speaker 2>the one that I knew he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a real,</v>

915
00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.500
<v Speaker 2>real smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

916
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.840
<v Speaker 2>he was a cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just couldn't stop it.</v>

917
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

918
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I think some people bond to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous drugs and you're fucked.</v>

919
00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:28.050
<v Speaker 2>So whatever happened with him already </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying was every time I met that guy,</v>

920
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:30.910
<v Speaker 2>he's always been cool to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I judge people.</v>

921
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>He's always fun to be around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly,</v>

922
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.440
<v Speaker 2>jovial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

923
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I think he's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a,</v>

924
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.840
<v Speaker 2>he's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

925
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:43.890
<v Speaker 2>and to me it just made me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made me just the sound of the people </v>

926
00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.180
<v Speaker 2>were willing to shit on this guy because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tried to kill himself,</v>

927
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:50.750
<v Speaker 2>but you are right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get mad when people try to kill </v>

928
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.750
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:51.010
<v Speaker 2>especially when people have a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>better life than them.</v>

930
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.330
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

931
00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:57.331
<v Speaker 2>that was the argument that I heard over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again about already like this </v>

932
00:47:57.331 --> 00:47:57.331
<v Speaker 2>fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

933
00:47:57.331 --> 00:48:01.620
<v Speaker 2>what are his problems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a Mercedes and you know he's </v>

934
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.070
<v Speaker 2>rich and all true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't make you feel better.</v>

935
00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately you'd think it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>

936
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.040
<v Speaker 2>If your life sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life sucks and it really has </v>

937
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.040
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being rich or poor.</v>

938
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Rich can definitely help things because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry about your bills</v>

939
00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:16.450
<v Speaker 2>and you have less problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a little bit less stress,</v>

940
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:21.690
<v Speaker 2>but then you've got problems with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and investments and people </v>

941
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:21.690
<v Speaker 2>stealing from you and bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

942
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

943
00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you have problems all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely better to have it than not,</v>

944
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:30.061
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're successful doesn't mean you're </v>

945
00:48:30.061 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are fucking</v>

946
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 2>horribly hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly depressed,</v>

947
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 2>and they sit around thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

948
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is the purpose of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

949
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the real problem is,</v>

950
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:43.350
<v Speaker 2>that's a good goddamn question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the purpose of this life if </v>

951
00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:44.860
<v Speaker 2>you're not here for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you here for?</v>

952
00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Because realistically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

953
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:52.231
<v Speaker 2>you get to a certain point in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>like already and I are basically the </v>

954
00:48:52.231 --> 00:48:52.960
<v Speaker 2>same age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 42 and I believe he is too.</v>

955
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to a point where you're like,</v>

956
00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 2>you get all this gray like have gray </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair and my beard and on my balls I have</v>

957
00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.630
<v Speaker 2>like 20 gray hairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So gray hairs coming in here.</v>

958
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 2>your body's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at a certain point in time you got to</v>

960
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:10.891
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is the purpose of all </v>

961
00:49:10.891 --> 00:49:10.891
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I here for?</v>

962
00:49:10.891 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't have like a </v>

963
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have someone you love,</v>

964
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't have really good friends that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you love and you love to be around.</v>

965
00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have children,</v>

966
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:21.540
<v Speaker 2>you don't have someone that that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean something to someone that you feed </v>

967
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:26.221
<v Speaker 2>off of each other and you share energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you make them feel good and they </v>

968
00:49:26.221 --> 00:49:26.221
<v Speaker 2>make you feel good.</v>

969
00:49:26.221 --> 00:49:26.710
<v Speaker 2>You know they miss you and you miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

970
00:49:26.711 --> 00:49:27.850
<v Speaker 2>and that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

971
00:49:27.851 --> 00:49:32.851
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important for people and people </v>

972
00:49:32.851 --> 00:49:32.851
<v Speaker 2>just underestimate how huge that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

973
00:49:32.851 --> 00:49:37.771
<v Speaker 2>having friends and having family and </v>
<v Speaker 2>having good quality people in your life </v>

974
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 2>and not douchebags cut the Douche bags </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

975
00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:46.830
<v Speaker 2>That is so important because nothing can</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck your life up more than people who </v>

976
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.440
<v Speaker 2>are not looking out for your best </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest and want you to fail because </v>

977
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:52.440
<v Speaker 2>they're fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

978
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Try to let them aware it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them be aware of it,</v>

979
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Speaker 2>give them an opportunity to change and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't get rid of a condom out of</v>

980
00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:01.120
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So important,</v>

981
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:03.880
<v Speaker 2>just separate yourself from anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative that's going to fuck with you.</v>

982
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>That can make such a huge difference in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the quality of your life.</v>

983
00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:08.920
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>

984
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.330
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck away from drugs.</v>

985
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.640
<v Speaker 2>The bad ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck around with heroin.</v>

986
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't fuck around with math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fuck around with anything </v>

987
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to do something,</v>

988
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.750
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things that people have never died </v>

989
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:23.971
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make sure you know what the fuck </v>

990
00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:23.971
<v Speaker 2>you're doing before you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

991
00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:27.421
<v Speaker 2>don't go crazy and smoke the whole joint</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time you know you shit your </v>

992
00:50:27.421 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>pants and paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You freaked the fuck out,</v>

993
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably never going to get high </v>

994
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time you ever get high and you</v>

995
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:36.281
<v Speaker 2>should just get a little tiny bit high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a little tiny bit of a hit and get </v>

996
00:50:36.281 --> 00:50:37.110
<v Speaker 2>used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

997
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like riding a surfboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just hop on.</v>

998
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:45.881
<v Speaker 2>You'd be awesome at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No know the feeling of being caught up </v>

999
00:50:45.881 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 2>in the wave of thc when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when when you get really high,</v>

1000
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're connecting to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1001
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:55.630
<v Speaker 2>another frequency that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>available to you when you're sober and </v>

1002
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.630
<v Speaker 2>that's where people don't smoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

1003
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an awareness and opening of your</v>

1004
00:50:59.241 --> 00:51:04.241
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had explained to me chemically </v>

1005
00:51:04.241 --> 00:51:05.630
<v Speaker 2>about Gaba and dopamine and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things that go on.</v>

1006
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:10.670
<v Speaker 2>There was a recent threat about it on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>message board where people are talking </v>

1007
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:12.080
<v Speaker 2>about the effect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is it does something</v>

1008
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:17.081
<v Speaker 2>to the way you think and it opens up new</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of awareness and if you get too </v>

1009
00:51:17.301 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 2>much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to freak the fuck out,</v>

1010
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:24.420
<v Speaker 2>and that's called being paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what paranoia comes from is this </v>

1011
00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 2>probably the first time you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing reality.</v>

1012
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 2>You know you're a very vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1013
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:30.860
<v Speaker 2>We all our life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you know,</v>

1014
00:51:30.861 --> 00:51:32.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a transient experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna.</v>

1015
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna pass from this to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1016
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1017
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the first place.</v>

1018
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the ultimate goal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human racist in the first place.</v>

1019
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 2>You just live your life and go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you put your blinders on and when</v>

1020
00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you have a hit of some really good weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those blinders just fall down around you</v>

1021
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 2>and you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1022
00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm this fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fleshy little temporary being that's </v>

1023
00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:02.050
<v Speaker 2>plaguing to the spinning orb has it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying through the galaxy and people are</v>

1024
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:04.520
<v Speaker 2>sitting around talking about John and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kate and,</v>

1025
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:09.200
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking Miley Cyrus and nonsense.</v>

1026
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 2>And while this is all going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were hurling through the galaxy and then</v>

1027
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 2>literally is never discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1028
00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 2>and I have a bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see it on youtube.</v>

1029
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's somebody put it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's yours.</v>

1030
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 2>It's from my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1031
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1032
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:23.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shiny happy Jihad CD.</v>

1033
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.210
<v Speaker 2>It's about flying through space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's where we are.</v>

1034
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1035
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:32.080
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just animals clinging to a sphere </v>

1036
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 2>in eternity in this gigantic sea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>eternity,</v>

1037
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:41.580
<v Speaker 2>sea of space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This never ending thing that we're a </v>

1038
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:42.260
<v Speaker 2>part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we completely ignore and we focus on</v>

1039
00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:45.350
<v Speaker 2>the most mundane bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Tiger Woods,</v>

1040
00:52:45.351 --> 00:52:47.300
<v Speaker 2>fucking all these girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1041
00:52:47.301 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 2>And like what else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the other dumb shit that people</v>

1042
00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:51.950
<v Speaker 2>have been focusing on lately in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>news?</v>

1043
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.740
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think why people focus on so much and </v>

1044
00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.000
<v Speaker 6>it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they need something.</v>

1045
00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:00.430
<v Speaker 6>It's like kind of watching the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie over and over again.</v>

1046
00:53:00.431 --> 00:53:05.431
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you need constant new information and </v>

1047
00:53:05.431 --> 00:53:05.431
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1048
00:53:05.431 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 6>like I understand what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>like about the whole thing.</v>

1049
00:53:07.271 --> 00:53:12.271
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's why so many people </v>

1050
00:53:12.271 --> 00:53:12.820
<v Speaker 6>focused on the dumb shit because the new</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>

1051
00:53:12.821 --> 00:53:13.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that same thing.</v>

1052
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:20.170
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what you're saying is that the </v>

1054
00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 2>reason why people focus on like tiger </v>
<v Speaker 2>woods and stuff like that,</v>

1055
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:23.220
<v Speaker 2>it's just because it's new information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1056
00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>We've been in space for so long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens</v>

1057
00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.710
<v Speaker 6>and you look up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see stars while Blah Blah,</v>

1058
00:53:28.711 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 6>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like same cell phone.</v>

1059
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 6>What would you have the same stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 6>for 10 years?</v>

1060
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:36.210
<v Speaker 6>Or if tiger woods sell new cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 6>came out,</v>

1061
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:37.480
<v Speaker 6>would you get the tiger woods and stuff?</v>

1062
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Brian's onto something.</v>

1063
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I think know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes sense because you know,</v>

1064
00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.380
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>

1065
00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:49.150
<v Speaker 2>we have this push for new things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation and it's literally built into</v>

1066
00:53:49.151 --> 00:53:51.580
<v Speaker 2>our hard wiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why you can take a guy with the</v>

1067
00:53:51.581 --> 00:53:54.070
<v Speaker 2>hottest chick in the world and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to fuck her anymore.</v>

1068
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:59.180
<v Speaker 2>So like you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get tired of fucking the hottest </v>

1069
00:53:59.180 --> 00:53:59.180
<v Speaker 2>chick in the world and that really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1070
00:53:59.180 --> 00:53:59.180
<v Speaker 2>You know that that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:04.290
<v Speaker 2>If you look at life the wrong way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the other things that's </v>

1072
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:07.261
<v Speaker 2>awesome about weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you smoke weed and you fuck your </v>

1073
00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:07.261
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>

1074
00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:09.490
<v Speaker 2>if you don't usually do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're fucking a new person.</v>

1075
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like you appreciate are all for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like who she is and what she,</v>

1076
00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.030
<v Speaker 2>what she looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You appreciate it all over again.</v>

1077
00:54:16.031 --> 00:54:16.990
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1078
00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:22.020
<v Speaker 2>At least for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like that when you smoke </v>

1079
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.290
<v Speaker 2>weed and get with your lady?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:26.170
<v Speaker 2>When you smoke weed and get with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lady.</v>

1081
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.600
<v Speaker 6>My lady doesn't really smoke weed so </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not really that fun.</v>

1082
00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mine can't right now because she's </v>

1083
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 6>pregnant with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bambino.</v>

1084
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:34.630
<v Speaker 6>So have you played with the nexus one </v>
<v Speaker 6>yet?</v>

1085
00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.070
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have not.</v>

1086
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:37.780
<v Speaker 6>You're not a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>huh?</v>

1087
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:39.130
<v Speaker 6>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not really.</v>

1088
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.470
<v Speaker 6>Michael Tech Review Ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gentlemen to.</v>

1089
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:48.130
<v Speaker 6>The main problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is if you have something like we both </v>

1090
00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.200
<v Speaker 6>have iphones and you have facebook and </v>
<v Speaker 6>twitter and all these applications.</v>

1091
00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:55.540
<v Speaker 6>Why I've had droid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why have an inferior version of facebook</v>

1092
00:54:55.721 --> 00:54:57.880
<v Speaker 6>on the droid sucks the twitter on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>droids.</v>

1093
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:59.950
<v Speaker 6>Not as good as twitter to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1094
00:54:59.951 --> 00:55:03.670
<v Speaker 6>everything is just the blackberry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I have uber,</v>

1095
00:55:03.671 --> 00:55:05.320
<v Speaker 6>twitter on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I use,</v>

1096
00:55:05.321 --> 00:55:07.020
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have an iphone but okay.</v>

1097
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.340
<v Speaker 6>I really</v>

1098
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.620
<v Speaker 2>use it more of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as like a,</v>

1099
00:55:09.621 --> 00:55:10.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1100
00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:15.820
<v Speaker 2>like a laptop that I keep in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what it is for me because </v>

1101
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:16.450
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line with the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1102
00:55:16.451 --> 00:55:19.720
<v Speaker 2>it's on a t and t and a t.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and t sucks when,</v>

1103
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:24.750
<v Speaker 2>when I'm talking to people on a t and t </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can guarantee it's going to cut out </v>

1104
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:25.220
<v Speaker 2>three or four times before I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck I'm going.</v>

1105
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:30.400
<v Speaker 2>When I drive in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that I can have both </v>

1106
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:30.830
<v Speaker 2>hands on the steering wheel and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk,</v>

1107
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:32.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm having conversations and I can,</v>

1108
00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do business and answer questions and </v>

1109
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 2>catch up with old friends that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a chance to catch up with.</v>

1110
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I love that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1111
00:55:38.511 --> 00:55:40.160
<v Speaker 2>That's been huge to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1112
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.770
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>features of communication,</v>

1113
00:55:42.771 --> 00:55:44.660
<v Speaker 2>the ability to fucking talk to somebody.</v>

1114
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't like text messaging just back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth after a while,</v>

1115
00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:49.180
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1116
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear your fucking voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1117
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.940
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way I like talking to people.</v>

1118
00:55:52.941 --> 00:55:53.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

1119
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get things out of you,</v>

1120
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.350
<v Speaker 2>feed off of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1121
00:55:57.351 --> 00:55:58.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a volley,</v>

1122
00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if your fucking phone can't make </v>

1123
00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:03.340
<v Speaker 2>phone calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weak.</v>

1124
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:06.860
<v Speaker 2>That's weak shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I use a blackberry with verizon.</v>

1125
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.680
<v Speaker 2>No one's paying me to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason why I use the blackboard,</v>

1126
00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:15.700
<v Speaker 2>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do a UFC is in the UK and the only </v>

1127
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:15.700
<v Speaker 2>way you could get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1128
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:20.170
<v Speaker 2>a phone that works overseas got to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>world phone because we have two </v>

1129
00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:23.561
<v Speaker 2>different systems here in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have CDMA and GSM and GSM is t mobile</v>

1130
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:28.891
<v Speaker 2>and a t and t and a CBMA is sprint and </v>
<v Speaker 2>verizon and there are two totally </v>

1131
00:56:28.891 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 2>different types of signals.</v>

1132
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other countries,</v>

1133
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Speaker 2>most other countries don't use the CDMA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which verizon has,</v>

1134
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best in America and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America it's the shit.</v>

1135
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1136
00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I drive to Jujitsu,</v>

1137
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I would lose people three times with my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at and t phone three fucking times would</v>

1138
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 2>drive me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my verizon was right there.</v>

1139
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:50.140
<v Speaker 2>That never drops off for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much better.</v>

1140
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:52.810
<v Speaker 2>But the bottom line is this shit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>whack.</v>

1141
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1142
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 2>this phone is like an iphone from 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking years ago.</v>

1143
00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:00.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like some,</v>

1144
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.630
<v Speaker 2>some cheap knock off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1145
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.500

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1146
00:57:04.501 --> 00:57:06.940
<v Speaker 2>where they make fake watches and shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1147
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I try to summarize are pretty nice.</v>

1152
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Not bad to type on the uh,</v>

1153
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 2>the typing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the new one.</v>

1154
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:23.890
<v Speaker 2>The storm to the double clicking is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1155
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not just dropped in the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1156
00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:31.970
<v Speaker 2>this was right next to my pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's job while I was at the 9:30</v>

1157
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:34.540
<v Speaker 2>club in Washington DC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

1158
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I had a good fucking time down there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>DC.</v>

1159
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:41.130
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much for your </v>

1160
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:41.130
<v Speaker 2>hospitality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1161
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Awesome show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a great time.</v>

1162
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the 9:30</v>

1163
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:47.341
<v Speaker 2>club this Friday night and I was pulling</v>
<v Speaker 2>my pre-performance Poopoo and uh,</v>

1164
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I got up and this phone because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>called a piece of shit committed,</v>

1165
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 2>committed suicide and dove from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket into the shitty toilet.</v>

1166
00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a piece of shit is trying </v>

1167
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.611
<v Speaker 2>to kill data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what it's doing because it knows </v>

1168
00:58:02.611 --> 00:58:02.611
<v Speaker 2>that I haven't backed up in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

1169
00:58:02.611 --> 00:58:02.611
<v Speaker 2>has tried to go.</v>

1170
00:58:02.611 --> 00:58:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I've got some cool pictures and videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>on here and there's motherfuckers trying</v>

1171
00:58:05.471 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 2>to kill himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1172
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.340
<v Speaker 2>so I got it out and shook it and shook </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the water out.</v>

1173
00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 2>But I tried it with a hairdryer and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch came back.</v>

1174
00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1175
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's works tire.</v>

1176
00:58:15.251 --> 00:58:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Listen to your Shit Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terribly for anything else.</v>

1177
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:20.320
<v Speaker 2>When you try to go on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to shoot yourself,</v>

1178
00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:24.730
<v Speaker 2>you try to use the twitter function on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here it's so clunky and whack and typing</v>

1179
00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 2>is much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay to type like texts,</v>

1180
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:32.490
<v Speaker 2>but when you have to type in numbers you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to like really constantly this </v>

1181
00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:35.760
<v Speaker 2>little tiny ass keyboard where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers are and you're always fucking </v>

1182
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:35.760
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I have to give someone,</v>

1183
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 2>if I'm answering an email and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give,</v>

1184
00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.280
<v Speaker 2>give someone an address or a phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>number,</v>

1185
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.270
<v Speaker 2>it takes five minutes because I barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>can press down the three.</v>

1186
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:44.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always getting the number right next</v>

1187
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1188
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:48.280
<v Speaker 2>it's really weakened and knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the iphone is shit.</v>

1189
00:58:48.281 --> 00:58:51.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just so goddamn far above every </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

1190
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.460
<v Speaker 2>every other phone out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close.</v>

1191
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 2>If you're thinking about you want one </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1192
00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.400
<v Speaker 2>if you only had to choose between one </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1193
00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 2>you got to go with the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can afford to have two </v>

1194
00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:05.161
<v Speaker 2>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the iphone is great for like a little </v>

1195
00:59:05.161 --> 00:59:07.111
<v Speaker 2>computer to me it's shoes for pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>and twitters and applications and going </v>

1196
00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:12.011
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably wait until after the apple </v>

1197
00:59:12.011 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 2>announcement in two weeks though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a verizon iphone.</v>

1198
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.260
<v Speaker 2>If there's a verizon iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking jump for joy,</v>

1199
00:59:17.261 --> 00:59:18.490
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1200
00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 2>We think that the verizon thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've read online,</v>

1201
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 2>because we're both Brian and I are both </v>
<v Speaker 2>tech retards.</v>

1202
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.850
<v Speaker 2>The late verizon thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1203
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 2>probably going to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tablet,</v>

1204
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 2>like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an internet,</v>

1205
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:35.561
<v Speaker 2>like a kindle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can get on the Internet with </v>

1206
00:59:35.561 --> 00:59:36.140
<v Speaker 2>which would be kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1207
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:41.170
<v Speaker 2>like a netbook with no keyboard or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>an oversized iphone pretty much ever </v>

1208
00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:41.990
<v Speaker 2>heard or upgrade the gray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1209
00:59:41.991 --> 00:59:44.750
<v Speaker 2>he's that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy from England that is a,</v>

1210
00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 2>a professor and a scientist who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>working hard on a life extension.</v>

1211
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:52.010
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of A.</v>

1212
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of a real eccentric character </v>
<v Speaker 2>with crazy long beard and he's got all </v>

1213
00:59:58.041 --> 01:00:01.480
<v Speaker 2>these really complex theories on how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>extend the human lifetimes,</v>

1214
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:04.580
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the only way you would die as if you</v>

1215
01:00:04.581 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 2>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1216
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 2>like got an accident or something or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sickness.</v>

1217
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Fascinating Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is if people live forever,</v>

1218
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough room for everybody.</v>

1219
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to fuck with nature.</v>

1220
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature has us in a cycle and the cycle </v>

1221
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.710
<v Speaker 2>is very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody lives more than like 120 years.</v>

1222
01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:25.460
<v Speaker 2>If you're the baddest motherfucker ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live to be a buck 20 and then you're</v>

1223
01:00:25.461 --> 01:00:30.461
<v Speaker 2>done and the last few years you are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragile mess and you better not go </v>

1224
01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:34.721
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you could tie your shoes and </v>

1225
01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:36.230
<v Speaker 2>break your back in half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you could fall down.</v>

1226
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:41.410
<v Speaker 2>You know when you're going to wipe your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass and head plant into the wall and be </v>

1227
01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:45.491
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crack your neck paralyze shell over the </v>

1228
01:00:45.491 --> 01:00:45.491
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that could be the end.</v>

1229
01:00:45.491 --> 01:00:50.310
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to be a human </v>

1230
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:50.310
<v Speaker 2>role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tissue paper.</v>

1231
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:51.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1232
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the cycle of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1233
01:00:53.601 --> 01:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>and you have children and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

1234
01:00:55.610 --> 01:01:00.610
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pass on your information and that's </v>

1235
01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:00.610
<v Speaker 2>what's supposed to happen.</v>

1236
01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>We are in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the active process of evolving as a </v>

1237
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:08.261
<v Speaker 2>species and there's two things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to aid that involvement or </v>

1238
01:01:08.261 --> 01:01:11.921
<v Speaker 2>evolvement rather that evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be either technology or </v>

1239
01:01:12.021 --> 01:01:15.050
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be what we learn and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we pass on.</v>

1240
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.520
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't pass on something,</v>

1241
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:24.521
<v Speaker 2>if your children don't evolve like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race can't exist from just the people </v>

1242
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:28.190
<v Speaker 2>that are alive now living forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1243
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Because people don't change that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1244
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.000
<v Speaker 2>they try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do their best.</v>

1245
01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:37.001
<v Speaker 2>But the amount of people that change </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the amount of people that don't </v>

1246
01:01:37.001 --> 01:01:37.001
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Shit,</v>

1247
01:01:37.001 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 2>how many people do you know that get </v>
<v Speaker 2>their shit together,</v>

1248
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.730
<v Speaker 2>that have gotten their shit together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have it.</v>

1249
01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people do you know,</v>

1250
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:44.990
<v Speaker 2>not many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that many.</v>

1251
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Most people who are a fucking mess stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mess.</v>

1252
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:53.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't good odds for a whole race </v>

1253
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.230
<v Speaker 2>of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1254
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:57.641
<v Speaker 2>I think that the best bet for the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>race that we're really care about it as </v>

1255
01:01:57.641 --> 01:01:57.680
<v Speaker 2>a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't.</v>

1256
01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:02.890
<v Speaker 2>We care about ourselves because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and because we have these </v>

1257
01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:03.740
<v Speaker 2>instincts in these instincts are </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to make sure that we stay alive</v>

1258
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:09.010
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's just hard wiring even though </v>

1259
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.621
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your logic and your reason would </v>

1260
01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:11.621
<v Speaker 2>dictate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1261
01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:14.771
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only here for a temporary amount of </v>

1262
01:02:14.771 --> 01:02:16.181
<v Speaker 2>time anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to look at this like what is my </v>

1263
01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:16.181

<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1273
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:50.460
<v Speaker 2>when I was growing up in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew a lot of fucking hard ass people.</v>

1274
01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:55.461
<v Speaker 2>I knew a lot of people that were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>always ready to insult you and always </v>

1275

1278
01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:07.941
<v Speaker 2>in that environment where everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of Douchey to each other on </v>

1279
01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:07.941
<v Speaker 2>occasion,</v>

<v Speaker 2>your chances are you're going to see a </v>

1298
01:03:46.641 --> 01:03:49.581
<v Speaker 2>way more aggressive in Boston than like </v>
<v Speaker 2>say if you go out and try to get some </v>

1299
01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 2>something eat in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1300
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:54.030

1301
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody has this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a stereotype of Texas,</v>

1302
01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.870
<v Speaker 2>but you're way safer going out to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some late night food in Texas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>cities in the country.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

1313
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go to the questions.</v>

1314
01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Do you do,</v>

1315
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.240
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be something you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking forward to about fatherhood.</v>

1316
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already a father.</v>

1317
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what you don't look forward to </v>

1318
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:40.160
<v Speaker 2>is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1319
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't look forward to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose a lot of your time.</v>

1320
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.770
<v Speaker 2>You without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to spend.</v>

1321
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.800
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to be a shitty parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know if you've had a childhood that </v>

1322
01:04:48.961 --> 01:04:51.030
<v Speaker 2>was less than perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think most of us have,</v>

1323
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:56.180
<v Speaker 2>right you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learned from that and you're </v>

1324
01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.881
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be a better person and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better parent from that and once you </v>

1325
01:04:58.881 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 2>have a fucking kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1326
01:04:59.130 --> 01:04:59.910
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1327
01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:04.911
<v Speaker 2>you have this in immense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immense responsibility to raise a human </v>

1328
01:05:04.911 --> 01:05:07.350
<v Speaker 2>being correctly and you've got to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own shit together.</v>

1329
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:12.530
<v Speaker 2>You know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forces you and you're going to </v>

1330
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:15.981
<v Speaker 2>definitely have to look at things a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit differently because you're </v>

1331
01:05:15.981 --> 01:05:17.140
<v Speaker 2>not gonna have the same amount of free </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and you can't look at yourself like</v>

1332
01:05:17.141 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>you're the only thing you know.</v>

1333
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:23.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like a lot of people that I know </v>

1334
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.910
<v Speaker 2>that aren't happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why they're not happy</v>

1335
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>is they don't have people in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1336
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:26.900
<v Speaker 2>like that are really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1337
01:05:26.901 --> 01:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>like I know dudes that are like grown </v>
<v Speaker 2>man that don't even have like really,</v>

1338
01:05:29.951 --> 01:05:32.200
<v Speaker 2>really close friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have friends,</v>

1339
01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:35.000
<v Speaker 2>but they're like keep shit from them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1340
01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they get bad arguments with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they don't,</v>

1341
01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:40.180
<v Speaker 2>they don't have anybody that they really</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up and are 100 percent honest with,</v>

1342
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:43.120
<v Speaker 2>which is really huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1343
01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:48.180
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have like a real friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could fucking tell everything </v>

1344
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have those in your life.</v>

1345
01:05:48.671 --> 01:05:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are huge when we're all out.</v>

1346
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Like when it's me and Brian and Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Joey and we're all out bullshit and </v>

1347
01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.910
<v Speaker 2>we tell each other basically everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1348
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the fun things about it.</v>

1349
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:06.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the fun things about hanging out </v>

1350
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.230
<v Speaker 2>with people that you really like is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1351
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you get to see inside each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking the wiring under the board.</v>

1352
01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 2>You get to see how your brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1353
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:16.411
<v Speaker 2>you get to throw out the way you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and what's going on in your </v>

1354
01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:19.951
<v Speaker 2>life to them and see how you know a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's not living your life but </v>

1355
01:06:19.951 --> 01:06:22.110
<v Speaker 2>loves you and looks out for you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants you to be happy.</v>

1356
01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:27.120
<v Speaker 2>He gets to look at it and see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's very important for people </v>

1357
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:27.220
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes you can't see your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life objective,</v>

1358
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you need somebody in your life</v>

1359
01:06:29.381 --> 01:06:32.770
<v Speaker 2>that that cares about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when people don't have that shit,</v>

1360
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 2>they don't feel like they have that 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent honesty with someone.</v>

1361
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:40.590
<v Speaker 2>You already are disconnected to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and that's one of the reasons </v>

1362
01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:40.590
<v Speaker 2>why people get so depressed.</v>

1363
01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:42.970
<v Speaker 2>You know you're depressed because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have all this love in your life.</v>

1364
01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a lot of love and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to put it out there too.</v>

1365
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:50.760
<v Speaker 2>If you're putting out shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get shit back and then </v>

1366
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.190
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get into a downward </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiral that you'd ever gonna to put out.</v>

1367
01:06:51.191 --> 01:06:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Pull out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a shitty life.</v>

1368
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 2>You're putting out bad energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always coming back at you.</v>

1369
01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.910
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to be unlucky.</v>

1370
01:06:57.911 --> 01:07:00.100
<v Speaker 2>You're always going to be unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way it is.</v>

1371
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.860
<v Speaker 2>If you're an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be happy assholes.</v>

1372
01:07:02.861 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 2>They look like they're happy because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see them laughing.</v>

1373
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 2>They go home and cry and drink or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking psycho and they have no emotions</v>

1374
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:12.060
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>

<v Speaker 2>playing?</v>

1390
01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:46.720

<v Speaker 2>While I'm doing this,</v>

1391
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 2>while I'm talking.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1395
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to read the questions off here</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1396
01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Any plans for a book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1397
01:08:05.691 --> 01:08:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1398
01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing a book man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is I'm writing comedy at</v>

1399
01:08:08.961 --> 01:08:12.950
<v Speaker 2>the same time and I'm also writing blog </v>
<v Speaker 2>entries and I'm also trying to do all my</v>

1400
01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 2>other bullshit so it's some time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1401
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:19.850
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to sit down and just write a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book because I sit down and write things</v>

1402
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:22.490
<v Speaker 2>and I just want to write about one thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that day and then I like,</v>

1403
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:25.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what I like about blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just write it,</v>

1404
01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 2>throw it up and Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

1405
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>But I'm always looking for new ways that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could listen to my shit,</v>

1406
01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:38.140
<v Speaker 2>get my ideas out there and get my stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and kids come to see me doing </v>

1407
01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.260
<v Speaker 2>standup and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different ways to do that.</v>

1408
01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like book books are legitimate.</v>

1409
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Wayne's they're wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still a lot of people that don't</v>

1410
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:47.450
<v Speaker 2>even have any idea that I'm a stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>

1411
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I like stuff that I've done</v>

1412
01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:54.281
<v Speaker 2>that's not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fear factor and whatever and you </v>

1413
01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:54.560
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing commentary for the UFC,</v>

1414
01:08:54.561 --> 01:08:59.561
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a lot of people that </v>

1415
01:08:59.561 --> 01:09:03.340
<v Speaker 2>really have no idea that I'm even a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian so I try to like do the best I </v>

1416
01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:07.400
<v Speaker 2>can to use all of the different avenues </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get that out there.</v>

1417
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:12.490
<v Speaker 2>So I think a book is going to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also I think it'd be cool to have </v>

1418
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:13.180
<v Speaker 2>something that I actually wrote that </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

1419
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:18.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think having a real book in the </v>

1420
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.630
<v Speaker 2>bookstore is something cool about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1421
01:09:20.631 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Takes lots of concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke more weed.</v>

1422
01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:25.460
<v Speaker 2>That's excellent advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost always write stoned,</v>

1423
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:27.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it might not make sense.</v>

1424
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.440
<v Speaker 2>The problem is greed it when I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>stoned.</v>

1425
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was I rambling about when </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1569
01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:46.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things I like about </v>

1570
01:15:46.971 --> 01:15:48.360
<v Speaker 1>like a regular goddamn comedy club or </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular comedy club was the ticket cost.</v>

1571
01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk in the door and you pay your 25</v>

1572
01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:53.770
<v Speaker 1>bucks and that's it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1573
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Or if you show up early you can go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the box office or you can order online.</v>

1574
01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:00.010
<v Speaker 1>You just buy it from the club and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it costs.</v>

1575
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:05.340
<v Speaker 1>You go through an agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're going to do like a big </v>

1576
01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.161
<v Speaker 1>concert or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through an agency that's </v>

1577
01:16:08.161 --> 01:16:08.161
<v Speaker 1>another world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1578
01:16:08.161 --> 01:16:11.910
<v Speaker 1>once you start doing like big venues </v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing like several thousand </v>

1579
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.910
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1580
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:13.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a totally different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I love comedy clubs.</v>

1581
01:16:13.661 --> 01:16:18.661
<v Speaker 1>That's first of all the shows better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shows are always better when it's </v>

1582
01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:19.540
<v Speaker 1>like less than 600 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1583
01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:22.180
<v Speaker 1>once you get over like 600 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still fun.</v>

1584
01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.820
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1585
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.490
<v Speaker 1>DC was more than 600 people I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still,</v>

1586
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.170
<v Speaker 1>it's still a good time.</v>

1587
01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not the same experience.</v>

1588
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.450
<v Speaker 1>The same experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get into comedy club,</v>

1589
01:16:34.451 --> 01:16:36.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the mix.</v>

1590
01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:41.791

1634
01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:43.460

<v Speaker 1>When did I start smoking weed?</v>

1635
01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start till I was like 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

1636
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.470
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm so passionate about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my whole life,</v>

1637
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I thought that if you smoke weed you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be lazy.</v>

1638
01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 1>You'd be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I knew a lot of dudes when I was</v>

1639
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:57.491
<v Speaker 1>a kid and the guys that did drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that were partying all the </v>

1640
01:18:57.491 --> 01:19:01.421
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always want to fuck fucking their </v>

1641
01:19:01.421 --> 01:19:01.421
<v Speaker 1>lives up and I was terrified of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life up.</v>

1642
01:19:01.421 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 1>There was my number one fear was being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>loser.</v>

1643
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.010
<v Speaker 1>My number one I didn't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ambition was all fucked up because it</v>

1644
01:19:07.011 --> 01:19:09.950
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that I wanted to be happy and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to,</v>

1645
01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:11.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find some place,</v>

1646
01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:14.400
<v Speaker 1>have some point of success and do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1647
01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve some goal or you know,</v>

1648
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:18.860
<v Speaker 1>be the something for a living that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be.</v>

1649
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying not to be a loser.</v>

1650
01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified I was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loser.</v>

1651
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:24.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1652
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1653
01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:31.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very important to have </v>

1654
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:31.770
<v Speaker 1>the right mindset.</v>

<v Speaker 1>package and how people,</v>

1659
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:43.920
<v Speaker 1>how the people around you think too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very important.</v>

1660
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:46.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember what I was talking</v>

<v Speaker 2>the use of the word faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just explaining how,</v>

1701
01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:45.081
<v Speaker 2>what happened when I did the spike TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that they told him that I could </v>

1702
01:21:45.081 --> 01:21:47.871
<v Speaker 2>say any word except faggot when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the show was uncensored and I was </v>

1703
01:21:48.151 --> 01:21:48.500
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

01:21:52.681 --> 01:21:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to a dog and some aunts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I use the word faggot and it</v>

1706
01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 2>about how it never met gay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Cooney and talks about it all </v>

<v Speaker 2>the time on the opiod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthony,</v>

1711
01:22:09.111 --> 01:22:11.700
<v Speaker 2>about how fag it never really was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexual slur when we were kids.</v>

1712
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1713
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:15.210

<v Speaker 2>but that's true,</v>

1714
01:22:15.211 --> 01:22:19.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's so sort of not true because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew that it also meant that,</v>

1715
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.440
<v Speaker 2>but people didn't use it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it meant.</v>

1716
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:27.950
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's language is supposed to </v>

1717
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:29.280
<v Speaker 2>represent is the context of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>

1718
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:34.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the problem is when words get hyper </v>

1719
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:34.770
<v Speaker 2>powered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cunt or nigger or Faggot,</v>

1720
01:22:34.771 --> 01:22:36.270
<v Speaker 2>now faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the new one,</v>

1721
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:37.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or love.</v>

1722
01:22:37.831 --> 01:22:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Love's a hyper powered word too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1723
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:45.350
<v Speaker 2>these words get hyper powered and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word itself is more important than the </v>

1724
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:46.860
<v Speaker 2>meaning behind the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

1725
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:51.861
<v Speaker 2>It's not a true expression anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean a lot of people in </v>

1726
01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:52.740
<v Speaker 2>relationships and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he say you love me,</v>

1727
01:22:52.741 --> 01:22:57.741
<v Speaker 2>tell me you love me to love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this weird fucking magic word </v>

1728
01:22:57.741 --> 01:22:58.020
<v Speaker 2>thing that you have to say.</v>

1729
01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:01.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like you should know by the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone communicates with you whether or</v>

1730
01:23:01.741 --> 01:23:06.741
<v Speaker 2>not they love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't have to say this one word </v>

1731
01:23:06.741 --> 01:23:09.861
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have all this goddamn power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the same thing with the word </v>

1732
01:23:09.861 --> 01:23:12.370
<v Speaker 2>nigger and the same thing with the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>Faggot as a now I guess because this gay</v>

1733
01:23:12.371 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>guy told me when he was explaining this </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me that I couldn't say Faggot,</v>

1734
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I didn't mean anything,</v>

1735
01:23:17.171 --> 01:23:19.510
<v Speaker 2>it didn't mean gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't say it because I'm not gay.</v>

1736
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.210
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gay people could say [inaudible].</v>

1763
01:24:29.751 --> 01:24:33.920
<v Speaker 2>about him to promote his show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as they were searching him,</v>

1764
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 2>they found out that someone with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same name was a gay porn star and not </v>

1765
01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:45.341
<v Speaker 2>just a gay porn star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the winner of the hungriest bud </v>

1769
01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:01.600
<v Speaker 2>And then they just started searching </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and they found photos and they </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was used pretty easy to find,</v>

1775
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the information first got on the </v>

1776
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:20.591
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn was the first shit to get out </v>

1777
01:25:20.591 --> 01:25:22.541
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porn was there before anything else </v>

1778
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:22.580
<v Speaker 2>before wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before youtube,</v>

1779
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:25.580
<v Speaker 2>porn was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you had porn on the Internet,</v>

1780
01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.160
<v Speaker 2>like you could basically get even stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was illegal,</v>

1781
01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.220
<v Speaker 2>like the early traci lords videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have got those elite,</v>

1782
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:33.590
<v Speaker 2>they could have got those back that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get those now.</v>

1783
01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd go looking for a traci lords </v>
<v Speaker 2>video now,</v>

1784
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.820
<v Speaker 2>anything that's illegal like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is gone.</v>

1785
01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.370
<v Speaker 2>But back then you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So gay porn,</v>

1786
01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.890
<v Speaker 2>it was all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This poor fuck.</v>

1787
01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.710
<v Speaker 2>They pulled up all these pictures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and everything.</v>

1788
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Nick in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like bullshit.</v>

1789
01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.960
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they showed him the photos and </v>

1790
01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:52.960
<v Speaker 2>you got all angry and he was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>headliner.</v>

1791
01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.530
<v Speaker 2>He was the big draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1792
01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:58.850
<v Speaker 2>he just explained that he looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was down on his luck and it was a lot</v>

1793
01:25:58.851 --> 01:26:00.560
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of money.</v>

1794
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:01.880
<v Speaker 2>And so he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

1795
01:26:01.881 --> 01:26:03.150
<v Speaker 2>It turns out he did like 100 movies.</v>

1796
01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:10.410
<v Speaker 1>And the joke is how much money is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of money to you because if I think you </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But this fucking guy did like a lot of </v>

1802
01:26:25.701 --> 01:26:29.280

<v Speaker 1>And the joke was 115 videos.</v>

1803
01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:34.300
<v Speaker 2>By my accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have all the money in the </v>

1804
01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.611
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be no more money left for </v>

1805
01:26:36.611 --> 01:26:38.531
<v Speaker 2>anybody else unless you like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you like socking decks and if </v>

1806
01:26:38.691 --> 01:26:43.691
<v Speaker 2>you're gay then that's not bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no see this when people don't </v>

1807
01:26:43.691 --> 01:26:47.921
<v Speaker 2>understand like just because someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks it's funny because they </v>

<v Speaker 2>they don't want to have gay sex.</v>

1809
01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.380
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it's bad that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay sex.</v>

1810
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:54.050
<v Speaker 2>It's only bad for someone who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have the gay sex.</v>

<v Speaker 2>him and yeah,</v>

1893
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:30.981
<v Speaker 2>all these people dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it 100 percent and it's not like </v>

1894
01:30:30.981 --> 01:30:34.941
<v Speaker 2>being a movie star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same thing in as far as </v>

1895
01:30:34.941 --> 01:30:34.941
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1896
01:30:34.941 --> 01:30:35.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are angry at him.</v>

1897
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is terrible,</v>

1898
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:40.770
<v Speaker 2>but it is right because people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry at him.</v>

1899
01:30:40.771 --> 01:30:45.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's the reason why he's got all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people around because people want </v>

1901
01:30:48.111 --> 01:30:48.111
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

1902
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:50.580
<v Speaker 2>any level of fame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1903
01:30:50.581 --> 01:30:53.970
<v Speaker 2>past a certain level can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a handicap.</v>

1904
01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 2>It becomes like food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have some food,</v>

1905
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you should only eat until you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry anymore.</v>

1906
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.500
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't fucking gorgeous self and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go God damn crazy.</v>

1907
01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to manage any level </v>

1908
01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.320
<v Speaker 2>of fame and to manage the kind of fame </v>
<v Speaker 2>that those guys have managed.</v>

1909
01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible.</v>

1910
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:10.530
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

1911
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.890
<v Speaker 2>why do you think Tom Cruise is so crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be crazy.</v>

1912
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:16.620
<v Speaker 2>No one cannot be crazy if you're that </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>

1913
01:31:16.621 --> 01:31:20.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who can manage that kind of thing?</v>

1914
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:20.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>

1915
01:31:20.891 --> 01:31:24.510
<v Speaker 2>when he was on Matt Lauer talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrists and antidepressants,</v>

1916
01:31:24.511 --> 01:31:26.470
<v Speaker 2>like you're Glib,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Glib,</v>

1917
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.830
<v Speaker 2>like he doesn't even realize how </v>
<v Speaker 2>retarded he sounds.</v>

1918
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:33.980
<v Speaker 2>No one tells him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one tells him that he's talking </v>

1919
01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:33.980
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a voice of reason around</v>

1920
01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:35.040
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have objectivity,</v>

1921
01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.440
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have anybody who talks to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1922
01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:41.600
<v Speaker 2>He has people who gawk and stare and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like Kevin James and I from the </v>

1923
01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.560
<v Speaker 2>10th floor of a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise.</v>

1924
01:31:43.650 --> 01:31:48.650
<v Speaker 2>No one's given that guy the real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he gets on television and talks </v>

1925
01:31:48.650 --> 01:31:49.620
<v Speaker 2>with nonsense like he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has no idea what nonsense is.</v>

1926
01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:54.800
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy because he's super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super famous and it's like almost </v>

1927
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.190
<v Speaker 2>impossible to not be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The rules are completely different for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you than they are for everybody else.</v>

1929
01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:04.360
<v Speaker 2>The rules for everybody else or most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have to create an impression they</v>

1930
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.510
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1931
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 2>You meet someone that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell them,</v>

1932
01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:09.550

<v Speaker 6>things?</v>

1982
01:34:06.931 --> 01:34:11.931
<v Speaker 6>I made myself look more and more sick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was losing weight and I was telling </v>

1983
01:34:11.931 --> 01:34:15.340
<v Speaker 6>him like my photoshopping fat off me and</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's crazy is then I started getting </v>

1984
01:34:15.421 --> 01:34:20.421
<v Speaker 6>interviews from radio stations thinking </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's real and I have it somewhere like </v>

1985
01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:21.980

<v Speaker 6>radio station.</v>

1986
01:34:22.170 --> 01:34:23.940
<v Speaker 6>It was real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1987
01:34:23.941 --> 01:34:28.941
<v Speaker 6>I had people actually I started really </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking I was like dying and stuff like</v>

1988
01:34:29.191 --> 01:34:34.191
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then one day I stopped like 20 days </v>

1989
01:34:34.191 --> 01:34:34.191
<v Speaker 6>in and people all thought I died.</v>

1990
01:34:36.650 --> 01:34:39.230
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the great trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the all time.</v>

1991
01:34:39.231 --> 01:34:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Great trolls.</v>

1997
01:34:55.661 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 2>pedophiles and then right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think they did a about it.</v>

1998
01:34:57.621 --> 01:34:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Then they do a book,</v>

<v Speaker 1>somewhere because one of those,</v>

2002
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:11.861
<v Speaker 1>one of the funniest things that doug </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did and he would pretend to be a </v>

2003
01:35:11.861 --> 01:35:16.360
<v Speaker 1>little girl and Laura pedophiles and say</v>

<v Speaker 2>that kind of commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug is.</v>

2010
01:35:29.011 --> 01:35:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Doug is an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a pit bull.</v>

2011
01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.480
<v Speaker 2>The level of commitment that he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards trolling.</v>

2012
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2055
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't get the dead or the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

2056
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I understand that you like it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would never say that it's not good </v>

2057
01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:20.670
<v Speaker 2>because it's obviously good to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2058
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I gave up saying some things suck a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago when people like them because </v>

2059
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.200
<v Speaker 2>it occurred to me somewhere along the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line that they,</v>

2060
01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:31.710
<v Speaker 2>even though they suck for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I do think they suck as long</v>

2061
01:38:31.711 --> 01:38:33.150
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I care?</v>

2062
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 2>As long as it's not promoting anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously stupid.</v>

2063
01:38:35.851 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as it's not,</v>

2064
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing retarded behavior as long as</v>

2065
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:42.900
<v Speaker 2>it's not negative for human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I give a shit?</v>

2066
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's good.</v>

2067
01:38:44.161 --> 01:38:46.140
<v Speaker 2>You like it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get into it,</v>

2068
01:38:46.141 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't listen to the debt on that.</v>

2069
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this grateful dead experiment </v>

2070
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.510
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2071
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I tried to listen to it for 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was hating it so much that I </v>

2072
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.270
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to write about it.</v>

2073
01:38:57.271 --> 01:39:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I was going to read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to listen to dad for 30 days</v>

2074
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 2>and then write about it at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not my shit,</v>

2075
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2076
01:39:05.131 --> 01:39:08.130
<v Speaker 2>You can like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I was listening to the dead one</v>

2077
01:39:08.131 --> 01:39:12.570
<v Speaker 2>day and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put on right after I listened to it.</v>

2078
01:39:12.571 --> 01:39:17.571
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to for like an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I put on midnight rider by the </v>

2079
01:39:17.571 --> 01:39:19.500
<v Speaker 2>allman brothers and I never listened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debt again.</v>

2080
01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking kidding me man?</v>

<v Speaker 2>that music,</v>

2143
01:43:03.841 --> 01:43:07.710
<v Speaker 2>like whatever they were doing at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and they were making that music.</v>

2144
01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:09.410
<v Speaker 2>They were nailing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2145
01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:10.230
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2146
01:43:10.231 --> 01:43:12.900
<v Speaker 2>there's music from that era that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>smell at all,</v>

2147
01:43:12.901 --> 01:43:15.990
<v Speaker 2>like commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't smell at all.</v>

2148
01:43:15.991 --> 01:43:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were trying to,</v>

2149
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:20.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to trick people or do something,</v>

2150
01:43:20.061 --> 01:43:25.061
<v Speaker 2>thought it was going to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of music from that era </v>

2151
01:43:25.061 --> 01:43:25.330
<v Speaker 2>that's just beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a lie.</v>

2152
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:27.810

<v Speaker 2>the purest version of,</v>

2153
01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:29.850
<v Speaker 2>of musical art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2154
01:43:29.851 --> 01:43:31.890

01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:09.740
<v Speaker 2>you remember that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you agree?</v>

2171
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I know it's pretty big song.</v>

2172
01:44:13.450 --> 01:44:16.930
<v Speaker 6>I think you've just hating on the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You liked that song.</v>

2173
01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:20.200
<v Speaker 6>I think it was okay at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean the main thing that,</v>

2174
01:44:20.250 --> 01:44:21.610
<v Speaker 6>who cares about me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like my number,</v>

2175
01:44:21.670 --> 01:44:22.950
<v Speaker 6>a number one song,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2176
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:25.150
<v Speaker 6>not every song is number one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2177
01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about what people remember it?</v>

2178
01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that sounds horrible.</v>

2179
01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2187
01:44:48.150 --> 01:44:52.440
<v Speaker 2>When Joey Diaz describes it as the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those dirty motherfucking white boys.</v>

2188
01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Dirty white boys from Florida.</v>

<v Speaker 2>week even if we have to change the </v>

2193
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:12.561
<v Speaker 2>schedule for the show and do it at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different time right now because I </v>

2194
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:14.220
<v Speaker 2>didn't look at this at all the last time</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did this.</v>

2195
01:45:14.221 --> 01:45:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I have to look at it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I made a post on my message board asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to put in questions.</v>

2197
01:45:22.410 --> 01:45:27.410
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that I'm going to go there </v>

2198
01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:29.511
<v Speaker 2>right now and check it out what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions are and see if anybody has </v>

2199
01:45:29.511 --> 01:45:32.751
<v Speaker 2>some cool shit because people were upset</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I did it last week.</v>

2200
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:35.550
<v Speaker 2>But when I did it last week I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer any questions.</v>

2201
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.220
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the questions and I,</v>

2202
01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:44.250
<v Speaker 2>it's good to have the questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to make this as loose as </v>

2203
01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:48.081
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make this as much as whatever </v>

2204
01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:48.081
<v Speaker 2>we feel are talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2205
01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:48.081
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever's here,</v>

2206
01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:50.550
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let things come out,</v>

2207
01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and answer twitter questions and all </v>

2208
01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:55.880
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

2209
01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:59.380
<v Speaker 2>What are the best tips for navigating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high dose mushroom trip?</v>

2210
01:45:59.830 --> 01:46:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing them regularly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the first question.</v>

2211
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't do them regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Terence Mckenna,</v>

2212
01:46:06.311 --> 01:46:09.640
<v Speaker 2>who I learned everything I know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics from that guy,</v>

2213
01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:14.020
<v Speaker 2>or at least that's where I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to what he had to say,</v>

2214
01:46:14.021 --> 01:46:19.021
<v Speaker 2>reading his books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he always said is that you </v>

2215
01:46:19.021 --> 01:46:20.680
<v Speaker 2>should do them in a high doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And very rarely,</v>

2216
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:25.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that psychedelic experiences </v>

2217
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:26.950
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be something where you do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right dose and then you take a long time</v>

2218
01:46:26.951 --> 01:46:29.020
<v Speaker 2>off and try to sort of contemplate what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2219
01:46:29.410 --> 01:46:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

2220
01:46:31.410 --> 01:46:34.150
<v Speaker 2>The last time I did anything really </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong like DMT,</v>

2221
01:46:34.151 --> 01:46:37.720
<v Speaker 2>there was over two years ago and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was a very,</v>

2222
01:46:37.721 --> 01:46:40.180
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very profound experience and I wanted to</v>

2223
01:46:40.181 --> 01:46:45.181
<v Speaker 2>make sure that I got as much out of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they understood it and sort of </v>

2224
01:46:45.461 --> 01:46:50.461
<v Speaker 2>deciphered it as much as I could and </v>
<v Speaker 2>applied it to my life as as I could </v>

2225
01:46:50.461 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>before I just went to try to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2226
01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very serious about psychedelic </v>

2227
01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:57.010
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's play.</v>

2228
01:46:57.030 --> 01:47:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think you can have a good time </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mushrooms with your buddies if you </v>

2229
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:04.371
<v Speaker 2>don't take too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you can get a lot out of </v>

2230
01:47:04.371 --> 01:47:06.981
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic trips where you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not criticizing people want to </v>

2231
01:47:06.981 --> 01:47:07.800
<v Speaker 2>do it for fun because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to drink for fun.</v>

2232
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Smoke pot for funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoked pot both for introspective </v>

2233
01:47:12.970 --> 01:47:15.540
<v Speaker 2>quality thinking and also for fun and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't if you want to do it for fun,</v>

2234
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:18.000
<v Speaker 2>that's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is like,</v>

2235
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:23.210
<v Speaker 2>for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot from psychedelic </v>

2236
01:47:23.210 --> 01:47:25.720
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I believe is what turns Mckenna</v>

2237
01:47:25.721 --> 01:47:28.650
<v Speaker 2>has always said is that you should do </v>
<v Speaker 2>them very rarely.</v>

2238
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:29.430
<v Speaker 2>You do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2239
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:34.490
<v Speaker 2>and then you don't do shit for a while </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think about what the fuck you </v>

2240
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.490
<v Speaker 2>learned because it doesn't.</v>

2241
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:38.950
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to prove yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really using it for that reason to </v>

2242
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 2>really expand your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get anything out of it.</v>

2243
01:47:40.981 --> 01:47:45.981
<v Speaker 2>If you can't apply it to your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just have the experience and </v>

2244
01:47:45.981 --> 01:47:49.191
<v Speaker 2>then becomes some fucking shut in who </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't interact with the rest of the </v>

2245
01:47:49.191 --> 01:47:49.191
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all you want to do is go down in</v>

2246
01:47:49.191 --> 01:47:50.250
<v Speaker 2>your basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn the lights out,</v>

2247
01:47:50.251 --> 01:47:51.780
<v Speaker 2>and do mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a curiosity.</v>

2248
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Now you're not even a part of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2249
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you should be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be able to function in </v>

2250
01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.181
<v Speaker 2>both worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the psychedelic world and in this </v>

2251
01:48:02.181 --> 01:48:05.061
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be able to navigate both </v>

2252
01:48:05.061 --> 01:48:05.580
<v Speaker 2>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you do too much drugs,</v>

2253
01:48:05.581 --> 01:48:06.960
<v Speaker 2>if you do them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2254
01:48:06.961 --> 01:48:11.961
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely lose your handle on </v>

2255
01:48:11.961 --> 01:48:13.080
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's my answer to that question.</v>

2256
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing anything consciousness </v>

2257
01:48:18.110 --> 01:48:18.110
<v Speaker 2>expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2258
01:48:18.110 --> 01:48:21.840
<v Speaker 2>and always do things that have been done</v>
<v Speaker 2>for thousands and thousands of years.</v>

2259
01:48:21.841 --> 01:48:26.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you to do anything </v>

2260
01:48:26.841 --> 01:48:28.341
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's stuff that you can do that </v>

2261
01:48:28.341 --> 01:48:28.341
<v Speaker 2>isn't illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just haven't classified it yet.</v>

2262
01:48:28.341 --> 01:48:30.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca isn't technically illegal.</v>

2263
01:48:30.331 --> 01:48:35.331
<v Speaker 2>DMT is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IOWASCA has even been sanctioned </v>

2264
01:48:35.331 --> 01:48:35.331
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2265
01:48:35.331 --> 01:48:35.331
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2266
01:48:35.331 --> 01:48:37.890
<v Speaker 2>some church in New Mexico won a supreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>court case where they,</v>

2267
01:48:37.891 --> 01:48:39.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take dmt as part of their,</v>

2268
01:48:39.421 --> 01:48:40.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their Christian church.</v>

2269
01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:43.170
<v Speaker 2>It's part of their religious ceremonies </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get in touch with God.</v>

2270
01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want a supreme court case for few </v>

2271
01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:49.770
<v Speaker 2>people know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you should know what the fuck you're</v>

2272
01:48:49.771 --> 01:48:54.771
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the real problem with </v>

2273
01:48:54.771 --> 01:48:54.771
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics is that there are no shaman</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2274
01:48:54.771 --> 01:48:55.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

2275
01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:55.840
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2276
01:48:55.860 --> 01:49:00.450
<v Speaker 2>these tribes in Peru and these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that live in the Amazon there,</v>

2277
01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.480
<v Speaker 2>there's like a history of usage that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes back thousands of years and they </v>

2278
01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:06.600
<v Speaker 2>pass it on from generation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

2279
01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.600
<v Speaker 2>And the Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that like brew this Iowasca </v>

2280
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca is very powerful dose of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2281
01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:17.240
<v Speaker 2>of dmt that comes in an orally active </v>
<v Speaker 2>form and they get it from combining </v>

2282
01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.040
<v Speaker 2>these plants and boiling and into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy mixture between that.</v>

2283
01:49:20.041 --> 01:49:23.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's also shaman and other parts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world in Mexico where they,</v>

2284
01:49:23.551 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2285
01:49:24.301 --> 01:49:26.550
<v Speaker 2>they're Sharman where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their thing is mushrooms.</v>

2286
01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:29.220
<v Speaker 2>And these are people that have navigated</v>
<v Speaker 2>these dimensions,</v>

2287
01:49:29.221 --> 01:49:31.140
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Iowaska or mushrooms or </v>
<v Speaker 2>pod.</v>

2288
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:33.540
<v Speaker 2>They've navigated these dimensions many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2289
01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:34.350
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

2290
01:49:34.351 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 2>So they can tell you what to expect </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2291
01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:36.790
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

2292
01:49:36.850 --> 01:49:39.570
<v Speaker 2>they've learned from their experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can help you.</v>

2293
01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:45.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the real problem is that </v>

2294
01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:45.420
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs aren't necessarily bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

2295
01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:50.031
<v Speaker 2>They're just illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they're illegal can be bad for </v>

2296
01:49:50.031 --> 01:49:50.031
<v Speaker 2>you because if you need car with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get locked up,</v>

2297
01:49:50.170 --> 01:49:53.320
<v Speaker 2>your life can get fucked up if they find</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on your in your purse,</v>

2298
01:49:53.321 --> 01:49:58.321
<v Speaker 2>if you have to test for some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job and then all of a sudden you're </v>

2299
01:49:58.321 --> 01:49:58.321
<v Speaker 2>labeled a drug addict.</v>

2300
01:49:58.321 --> 01:50:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that sense psychedelic drugs can be </v>

2301
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other sense it's like a circular</v>

2302
01:50:03.371 --> 01:50:05.890
<v Speaker 2>saw like one those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are awesome.</v>

2303
01:50:05.891 --> 01:50:08.230
<v Speaker 2>If you know how to use one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can build a house,</v>

2304
01:50:08.231 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could fucking do some cool shit.</v>

2305
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:15.360
<v Speaker 2>You can cut some wood that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>never be able to cut with like a steak </v>

2306
01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.481
<v Speaker 2>knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't mean everybody should </v>

2307
01:50:18.481 --> 01:50:19.090
<v Speaker 2>have a fucking circular saw and just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>using it all day.</v>

2308
01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

2309
01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms are just like any kind of tool</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can like.</v>

2310
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with marijuana,</v>

2311
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:30.630
<v Speaker 2>with a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can build a house with a hammer or </v>

2312
01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:30.630
<v Speaker 2>you can just hit yourself in the deck if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking crazy.</v>

2313
01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:31.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that hammer should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

2314
01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:33.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs.</v>

2315
01:50:33.671 --> 01:50:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't give a circular saw to a 13 </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old boy and say,</v>

2316
01:50:36.191 --> 01:50:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go play with this.</v>

2317
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:42.750
<v Speaker 2>But if a guy is a goddamn carpenter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows what he's doing and he's Kinda </v>

2318
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:44.050
<v Speaker 2>gone up through trade school and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2319
01:50:44.051 --> 01:50:49.051
<v Speaker 2>it didn't apprenticeship and worked as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>carpenter's apprentice and learned how </v>

2320
01:50:49.051 --> 01:50:50.710
<v Speaker 2>to use tools properly and learn the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper safety precautions,</v>

2321
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:55.830
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy should be able to hold a </v>

2322
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:57.271
<v Speaker 2>fucking chainsaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy should be able to use a </v>

2323
01:50:57.271 --> 01:50:59.161
<v Speaker 2>circular saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy should be able to work in a </v>

2324
01:50:59.161 --> 01:50:59.161
<v Speaker 2>machine shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's learned how to do it.</v>

2325
01:50:59.161 --> 01:51:00.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs.</v>

2326
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:05.221
<v Speaker 2>There should be someone showing you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangers and the pitfalls and what it's </v>

2327
01:51:05.221 --> 01:51:05.890
<v Speaker 2>all about because it's not simply that </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>

2328
01:51:05.891 --> 01:51:07.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can just do them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be okay.</v>

2329
01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Some people do psychedelic drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so unmentally prepared for it,</v>

2330
01:51:12.281 --> 01:51:13.870
<v Speaker 2>but they're never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2331
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:18.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's a real possibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone needs to be there to evaluate </v>

2332
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.870
<v Speaker 2>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2333
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:21.100
<v Speaker 2>you've got the proper information with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head's in the right place,</v>

2334
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:21.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

2335
01:51:21.741 --> 01:51:24.520
<v Speaker 2>that's why it would help if we were more</v>
<v Speaker 2>open about these fucking things.</v>

2336
01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:29.700
<v Speaker 2>And it's the nutty thing is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still got this terrible reputation </v>

2337
01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:29.710
<v Speaker 2>and here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2338
01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:34.800
<v Speaker 2>in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reputation is all based </v>

2339
01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.160
<v Speaker 2>on the fact that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we get something in our head,</v>

2340
01:51:36.161 --> 01:51:38.110
<v Speaker 2>we stick with it and we get something in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our head.</v>

2341
01:51:38.111 --> 01:51:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Even with all the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like marijuana is still illegal,</v>

2342
01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:43.720
<v Speaker 2>2010 and most states it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2343
01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:48.580
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy when alcohol and tobacco and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit is readily available.</v>

2344
01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.370
<v Speaker 2>But we get it in our head that it's bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's been illegal.</v>

2345
01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:56.371
<v Speaker 2>All our lives were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very tough for us to change </v>

2346
01:51:56.371 --> 01:51:56.371
<v Speaker 2>gears.</v>

2347
01:51:56.371 --> 01:51:59.200
<v Speaker 2>And for a long time we've had this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our head about psychedelic drugs.</v>

2348
01:51:59.530 --> 01:52:01.900
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a cultural pattern,</v>

2349
01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:03.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a lock.</v>

2350
01:52:03.281 --> 01:52:08.281
<v Speaker 2>We got talked into it when the media was</v>
<v Speaker 2>young and when the newspapers were </v>

2351
01:52:08.281 --> 01:52:08.690
<v Speaker 2>around and that was the only way to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2352
01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Now they would publish these stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>about marijuana and the William Randolph</v>

2353
01:52:13.001 --> 01:52:18.001
<v Speaker 2>hearst scandals with William Randolph </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearst owned not only deedee own </v>

2354
01:52:18.001 --> 01:52:22.110
<v Speaker 2>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also owned paper mills and when </v>

2355
01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:24.541
<v Speaker 2>they invented the decorticator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made it more effective to process </v>

2356
01:52:24.541 --> 01:52:28.621
<v Speaker 2>hemp fiber and what he started doing was</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking the hemp industry so that he </v>

2357
01:52:28.621 --> 01:52:32.500
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to change over his paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>mills from wood to hemp paper,</v>

2358
01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:36.160
<v Speaker 2>because hemp is a far superior paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes superior clothing.</v>

2359
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:38.790
<v Speaker 2>It's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can eat it like the is.</v>

2360
01:52:39.210 --> 01:52:44.210
<v Speaker 2>It contains all the essential amino </v>
<v Speaker 2>acids and the seeds besides the fact </v>

2361
01:52:44.210 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 2>that it gets you high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even take away.</v>

2362
01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:49.680
<v Speaker 2>That gets you high part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the plants that don't get you high </v>

2363
01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:50.600
<v Speaker 2>at all or still like really economically</v>
<v Speaker 2>viable,</v>

2364
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:55.660
<v Speaker 2>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we'll we'll you ran off first </v>

2365
01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:55.660
<v Speaker 2>attack that industry because you own the</v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers.</v>

2366
01:52:55.700 --> 01:53:00.700
<v Speaker 2>He started printing these stories saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blacks and Mexicans were swept </v>

2367
01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:04.070
<v Speaker 2>smoking this new drug called marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were going out and raping white</v>

2368
01:53:04.071 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so because of that,</v>

2369
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:07.940
<v Speaker 2>because he did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

2370
01:53:07.941 --> 01:53:08.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2371
01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:13.840
<v Speaker 2>people got crazy and they'll pat got </v>
<v Speaker 2>paranoid and congress actually outlawed </v>

2372
01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.980
<v Speaker 2>marijuana not even knowing that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were outlawing hemp.</v>

2373
01:53:16.190 --> 01:53:17.510
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even know it was the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2374
01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:23.380
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how marijuana became illegal in </v>

2375
01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.931
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's still illegal today </v>

2376
01:53:25.931 --> 01:53:25.931
<v Speaker 2>is at once something is stuck in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

2377
01:53:25.931 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time to get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2378
01:53:27.531 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago,</v>

2379
01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:35.290
<v Speaker 2>it was probably very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common in all cultures to have a </v>

2380
01:53:35.290 --> 01:53:36.240
<v Speaker 2>shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have some sort of a,</v>

2381
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:41.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who is aware of psychedelic </v>

2382
01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:41.440
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2383
01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.440
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marco Allegro,</v>

2384
01:53:42.441 --> 01:53:47.441
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he argues that that's what Christianity </v>

2385
01:53:47.441 --> 01:53:47.441
<v Speaker 2>is all about.</v>

2386
01:53:47.441 --> 01:53:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is all about concealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>these secrets of consuming </v>

2387
01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:53.770
<v Speaker 2>hallucinogenic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy who decided for the Dead </v>

2388
01:53:53.770 --> 01:53:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Sea Scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Mark or allegro,</v>

2389
01:53:53.770 --> 01:53:55.520
<v Speaker 2>worked in the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2390
01:53:55.730 --> 01:54:00.730
<v Speaker 2>And after he did all this discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I don't know if he's right and </v>

2391
01:54:00.730 --> 01:54:00.730
<v Speaker 2>neither of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're a biblical scholar,</v>

2392
01:54:00.730 --> 01:54:01.520
<v Speaker 2>unless you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2393
01:54:01.521 --> 01:54:03.950
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a master of ancient languages.</v>

2394
01:54:03.951 --> 01:54:08.951
<v Speaker 2>You have to study it for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even understand what the fuck he's </v>

2395
01:54:08.951 --> 01:54:08.951
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it,</v>

2396
01:54:08.951 --> 01:54:11.180
<v Speaker 2>it's like make sense sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could be totally bullshitting.</v>

2397
01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:16.420
<v Speaker 2>But what his story is was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire Christian religion was a giant </v>

2398
01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:20.831
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it really was all about was the </v>

2399
01:54:20.831 --> 01:54:22.040
<v Speaker 2>consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fertility cults.</v>

2400
01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:27.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it was all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all about breeding babies and </v>

2401
01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:27.280
<v Speaker 2>taking mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes sense.</v>

2402
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:32.350
<v Speaker 2>People live thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and didn't know what the sky </v>

2403
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.630
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have any science and they're</v>

2404
01:54:32.631 --> 01:54:33.680
<v Speaker 2>popping mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>

2405
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.470
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't want other people to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad ass the mushrooms are.</v>

2406
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.000
<v Speaker 2>You eat mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see God.</v>

2407
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:39.380
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't want other people to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

2408
01:54:39.381 --> 01:54:41.390
<v Speaker 2>So they would hide it in stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told them make sense?</v>

2409
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Some guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been tried robitussin.</v>

2410
01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:49.800
<v Speaker 2>What are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Caucus Powell drinking robitussin?</v>

2411
01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:51.790
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dragon Aftershave,</v>

2412
01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Phil agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discusses,</v>

2413
01:54:57.150 --> 01:54:59.640
<v Speaker 2>hates everything in the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate everything on the radio,</v>

2414
01:54:59.641 --> 01:55:01.380
<v Speaker 2>but Goddamn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of songs.</v>

2415
01:55:02.490 --> 01:55:07.490
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a certain reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like a lot of rap and a lot </v>

2416
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:08.850
<v Speaker 2>of classic rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like soundgarden too.</v>

2417
01:55:08.851 --> 01:55:13.851
<v Speaker 2>I love sound garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard they're getting back together </v>

2418
01:55:13.851 --> 01:55:15.741
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I love because I was not a fan of </v>

2419
01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:15.741
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Cornell Shit I was on.</v>

2420
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:17.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lately I haven't been a fan.</v>

2421
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:21.270
<v Speaker 2>He seems like a really cool guy and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a talented as fuck as a singer,</v>

2422
01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.440
<v Speaker 2>but there's like some bands that get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2423
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:25.890
<v Speaker 2>They got to a magic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2424
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:28.010
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even if they get back together,</v>

2425
01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:29.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's going to be that </v>
<v Speaker 6>character willing.</v>

2426
01:55:29.611 --> 01:55:30.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

2427
01:55:30.381 --> 01:55:34.160
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of bands like soundgarden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were good because they were a young</v>

2428
01:55:34.161 --> 01:55:38.420
<v Speaker 6>and every eight doing drugs and going </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy and just experiencing life now.</v>

2429
01:55:38.421 --> 01:55:40.760
<v Speaker 6>I think these are just people that have </v>
<v Speaker 6>slowed down,</v>

2430
01:55:40.761 --> 01:55:44.300
<v Speaker 6>slowed their role and they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be something or because their music.</v>

2431
01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Just a lot of these guys as music or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that was kind of what I was </v>

2432
01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:53.871
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier when I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a certain level that you </v>

2433
01:55:53.871 --> 01:55:54.780
<v Speaker 2>reach as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a performer,</v>

2434
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get too famous,</v>

2435
01:55:56.551 --> 01:55:58.740
<v Speaker 2>you get too successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to,</v>

2436
01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.270
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cope.</v>

2437
01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Very hard to be still creative and still</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enthusiasm.</v>

2438
01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many guys just get better and better</v>

2439
01:56:06.751 --> 01:56:10.150
<v Speaker 2>every album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that many know stereo.</v>

2440
01:56:10.230 --> 01:56:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Hard to pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think has ever done it the </v>

2441
01:56:15.230 --> 01:56:15.230
<v Speaker 2>longest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most consistently.</v>

2442
01:56:16.210 --> 01:56:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Wells that blend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those guys,</v>

2443
01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 2>probably the Beatles did it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2444
01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Did they ever fall apart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got better,</v>

2445
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:25.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2446
01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.080
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got into their psychedelic stage,</v>

2447
01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:30.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking white album stage,</v>

2448
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:36.390
<v Speaker 2>better beatles rock band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great because he started off like </v>

2449
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Shitty Beatles songs and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2450
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:41.150
<v Speaker 2>this sucks or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you start getting into like </v>

2451
01:56:41.150 --> 01:56:41.150
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

2452
01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:44.170
<v Speaker 2>The more you play the more into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music scene.</v>

2453
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 2>The thing about the Beatles was they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't just change their music.</v>

2454
01:56:46.621 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 2>They changed the whole culture that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to them too because people got</v>

2455
01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:55.251
<v Speaker 2>swept up in their music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were such huge fans of John </v>

2456
01:56:55.251 --> 01:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Lennon and when he started getting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendental meditation and acid and </v>

2457
01:56:58.930 --> 01:56:59.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with gurus and shit,</v>

2458
01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:04.160
<v Speaker 2>they hold onto it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he changed a lot of people's </v>

2459
01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:04.160
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

2460
01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:07.940
<v Speaker 2>That was a guy that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really affected a lot of the way our </v>

2461
01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:12.021
<v Speaker 2>culture operates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people think about Michael </v>

2462
01:57:12.021 --> 01:57:12.021
<v Speaker 2>Jackson to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:57:12.021 --> 01:57:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson.</v>

2464
01:57:12.781 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Just from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2465
01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:19.040
<v Speaker 2>the music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how powerful it was like bad and </v>

2466
01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:19.230
<v Speaker 2>thriller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man when I was a kid,</v>

2467
01:57:19.231 --> 01:57:21.510
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing that was more popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

2468
01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like it was so recognized that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>talent was just so far and above </v>

2469
01:57:26.770 --> 01:57:27.630
<v Speaker 2>everyone else's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2470
01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:28.410
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

2471
01:57:28.411 --> 01:57:30.450
<v Speaker 2>It's so sad that he's such a freak and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so crazy.</v>

2472
01:57:30.630 --> 01:57:35.630
<v Speaker 2>But the more I've been thinking lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you get to a certain </v>

2473
01:57:36.271 --> 01:57:38.700
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a certain level of,</v>

2474
01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:43.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of greatness that some people achieve </v>

2475
01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.091
<v Speaker 2>like a certain frequency that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people cheap and it's almost impossible </v>

2476
01:57:47.091 --> 01:57:47.091
<v Speaker 2>to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not insane,</v>

2477
01:57:47.091 --> 01:57:52.070
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to push yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>that far that hard because it's not easy</v>

2478
01:57:52.531 --> 01:57:53.880
<v Speaker 2>to be like Michael Jackson.</v>

2479
01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.570
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just natural talent.</v>

2480
01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a focus and an energy and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus requires like a very singular way </v>

2481
01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:08.481
<v Speaker 2>of looking at things in a very essential</v>
<v Speaker 2>question by sexual abuse and that </v>

2482
01:58:08.941 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 2>probably helps to relax in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

2483
01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:12.450
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that's what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him?</v>

2484
01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:14.580
<v Speaker 2>You think it was when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think probably.</v>

2485
01:58:14.690 --> 01:58:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2486
01:58:15.331 --> 01:58:16.840
<v Speaker 2>it's all speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all were.</v>

2487
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:22.270
<v Speaker 2>He could have been that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got so fucked up because he got </v>

2488
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:25.281
<v Speaker 2>so famous when he was so young that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>never felt like he had a chance to grow </v>

2489
01:58:25.281 --> 01:58:29.031
<v Speaker 2>up and he wanted to go back to when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a child and it was just so </v>

2490
01:58:29.031 --> 01:58:31.851
<v Speaker 2>psychologically damaged that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally wanted to be around children </v>

2491
01:58:31.851 --> 01:58:35.900
<v Speaker 2>because he wanted to revert back to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment in his life before he realized </v>

2492
01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:35.900
<v Speaker 2>that life was haywire.</v>

2493
01:58:36.190 --> 01:58:41.190
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought that before because you </v>

2494
01:58:41.190 --> 01:58:43.041
<v Speaker 2>know what the thing is about all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>child molesting accusations is that he </v>

2495
01:58:43.041 --> 01:58:47.641
<v Speaker 2>was always around all these poor kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to help all these kids with </v>

2496
01:58:47.641 --> 01:58:49.680
<v Speaker 2>cancer and shit and people were who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke and it's like after awhile,</v>

2497
01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all they have to do is say some </v>

2498
01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:55.930
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit about Michael Jackson and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2499
01:58:55.931 --> 01:59:00.931
<v Speaker 2>it looks weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is my Jackson hanging out with kids </v>

2500
01:59:00.931 --> 01:59:03.151
<v Speaker 2>all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say some crazy shit and he's </v>

2501
01:59:03.151 --> 01:59:05.191
<v Speaker 2>gotta pay you gotta pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start going through the newspaper </v>

2502
01:59:05.191 --> 01:59:05.191
<v Speaker 2>and to these people that were super </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke.</v>

2503
01:59:05.191 --> 01:59:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be so tempting.</v>

2504
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Here's this billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest rockstar music star and the </v>

2505
01:59:11.550 --> 01:59:13.060
<v Speaker 2>history of the world and he's hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with your kid.</v>

2506
01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:18.280
<v Speaker 2>He's a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your kid over for sleepovers and you </v>

2507
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:18.280
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>

2508
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:18.280
<v Speaker 6>I believe it though in some I've paid </v>
<v Speaker 6>him</v>

2509
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:23.530
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is there's not like a </v>

2510
01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:23.530
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of people coming out saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up.</v>

2511
01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:27.660
<v Speaker 2>You want to just fuck a couple of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be fucking kids all over the </v>

2512
01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:27.660
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're Michael Jackson.</v>

2513
01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.300
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like the tiger woods of kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

2514
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:31.580
<v Speaker 2>You'd be just banging kids all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2515
01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:35.150
<v Speaker 2>You would if you got that obsession </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you want to have sex with kids.</v>

2516
01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 2>If you look at like trauma masters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the recidivism rate is through the </v>

2517
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 2>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2518
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:41.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like a 99 percent or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2519
01:59:41.811 --> 01:59:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

2520
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I just made that number up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real high though.</v>

2521
01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read it.</v>

2522
01:59:45.650 --> 01:59:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the numbers are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people have said time and time </v>

2523
01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:50.960
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to reform someone,</v>

2524
01:59:51.230 --> 01:59:55.670
<v Speaker 2>so if he's like banging kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not just going to bang one or two,</v>

2525
01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:00.720
<v Speaker 6>but that's why he had kids and he called</v>
<v Speaker 6>the kid blanket because he's always on </v>

2526
02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:00.720
<v Speaker 6>top of him.</v>

2527
02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:01.190
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>

2528
02:00:03.210 --> 02:00:08.210
<v Speaker 6>Seriously though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you're a child molester and </v>

2529
02:00:08.210 --> 02:00:08.210
<v Speaker 6>you get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what don't you have kids?</v>

2530
02:00:08.210 --> 02:00:08.870
<v Speaker 6>You're just get enough money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2531
02:00:08.871 --> 02:00:09.040
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

2532
02:00:09.610 --> 02:00:14.610
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of his kids have ever come out and </v>

2533
02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:14.610
<v Speaker 2>accused him of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just say that you're just,</v>

2534
02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:16.890
<v Speaker 6>you're adding on now you're making.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying it's true.</v>

2535
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:21.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to say that's what I </v>

2536
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:21.950
<v Speaker 6>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe me.</v>

2537
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:23.160
<v Speaker 6>I believe that he probably slept with </v>
<v Speaker 6>kids,</v>

2538
02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:26.150
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

2539
02:00:26.190 --> 02:00:31.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like doggy style on the side of the bed </v>

2540
02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:33.561
<v Speaker 6>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you think he just did inappropriate </v>

2541
02:00:33.561 --> 02:00:33.561
<v Speaker 6>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet he's just because he thinks he's a</v>

2542
02:00:33.561 --> 02:00:33.800
<v Speaker 6>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2543
02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:37.380
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I was molested by his father </v>
<v Speaker 6>growing up.</v>

2544
02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:43.040
<v Speaker 6>That would cause.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean Miley Cyrus would be fucking </v>

2545
02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:43.450
<v Speaker 6>black by now if that was true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2546
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who said this,</v>

2547
02:00:45.431 --> 02:00:47.890
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to not give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit,</v>

2548
02:00:47.891 --> 02:00:52.891
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that they think that Michael </v>

2549
02:00:52.891 --> 02:00:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Jackson might've been castrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that at certain point in time</v>

2550
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson might've been castrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why he can sing at such a </v>

2551
02:00:58.990 --> 02:01:00.240
<v Speaker 2>high pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though he's a grown man.</v>

2552
02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:03.880
<v Speaker 2>That might be why so fucked up sexually </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it totally makes sense.</v>

2553
02:01:03.970 --> 02:01:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you look at his </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

2554
02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Those are not his children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2555
02:01:06.611 --> 02:01:09.610
<v Speaker 2>there were white kids there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent white and he's a black man.</v>

2556
02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean he might've paid for someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have those kids for them,</v>

2557
02:01:12.281 --> 02:01:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're not as kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2558
02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:17.230
<v Speaker 2>and I think that it's real possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2559
02:01:17.231 --> 02:01:19.230
<v Speaker 2>that that's real possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's special</v>

2560
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 6>culation Janet and all them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all kinds of hair,</v>

2561
02:01:21.521 --> 02:01:22.820
<v Speaker 6>that kind of voice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2562
02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Tito doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jermaine doesn't.</v>

2563
02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Those are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at his brother,</v>

2564
02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>those are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless he's like some sort of a,</v>

2565
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>a biological freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does he have that voice?</v>

2566
02:01:31.901 --> 02:01:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Why is he looked like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is he so feminine?</v>

2567
02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Why is his voice so high pitched?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he's a grown man?</v>

2568
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:39.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine would if.</v>

2569
02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:44.820
<v Speaker 2>What if?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's so crazy with his fucking </v>

2570
02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:47.801
<v Speaker 2>plastic surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he had some bad sexual </v>

2571
02:01:47.801 --> 02:01:48.200
<v Speaker 2>experiences when he was younger and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just decided to Castro himself?</v>

2572
02:01:49.590 --> 02:01:51.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you look at what he does to his face.</v>

2573
02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:56.010
<v Speaker 6>That's not beyond the realm of question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just making a fucking rumors.</v>

2574
02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:00.720
<v Speaker 6>Two hours and five minutes and this to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the goddamn rumors show.</v>

<v Speaker 6>posters.</v>

2585
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.350

<v Speaker 2>Castrating people,</v>

2586
02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.780
<v Speaker 2>unless you take like you have to take </v>

2592
02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:40.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take something.</v>

2593

<v Speaker 2>It's fun for me too,</v>

2598
02:02:57.411 --> 02:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2599
02:02:57.981 --> 02:02:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I banged a 16 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Man.</v>

2600
02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know they look hot.</v>

2601
02:03:03.381 --> 02:03:05.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're ready to fuck.</v>

2602
02:03:05.150 --> 02:03:06.320
<v Speaker 2>They really are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2603
02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.790
<v Speaker 2>teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2604
02:03:07.791 --> 02:03:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anybody should fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you see a girl,</v>

2605
02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.100
<v Speaker 2>like when I was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 16,</v>

2606
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I was having sex weren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having sex and my girlfriend was </v>

2607
02:03:18.651 --> 02:03:21.560
<v Speaker 2>15 and she was built like a woman to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

2608
02:03:21.561 --> 02:03:26.561
<v Speaker 2>She had Turks and she had a big ass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a woman and she wanted sex all </v>

2609
02:03:26.561 --> 02:03:26.630
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2610
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:28.940
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is real.</v>

2611
02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:31.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2612
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:34.730
<v Speaker 2>but you're not supposed to deal it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug Stanhope as a joke about it.</v>

2613
02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

2614
02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and a are ever talking about it on </v>

2615
02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>the plane already told me the joke that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug said,</v>

2616
02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.670
<v Speaker 2>and apparently Doug said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2617
02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say that data that they're 16 years </v>

2618
02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:47.860
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't be having babies.</v>

2619
02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God disagrees.</v>

2620
02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.790
<v Speaker 2>That's why they can get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really good point.</v>

2621
02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:54.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2622
02:03:54.081 --> 02:03:55.310
<v Speaker 2>that's really true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

2623
02:03:55.311 --> 02:03:57.320
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have sex with a 16 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a child,</v>

2624
02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:58.930
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2625
02:03:59.330 --> 02:04:04.010
<v Speaker 2>even if a girl is like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm 40 fucking two years old,</v>

2626
02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:09.130
<v Speaker 2>like I've heard of dudes that are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>my age that have like 20 year old </v>

2627
02:04:09.130 --> 02:04:09.130
<v Speaker 2>girlfriends and everybody laughs about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2628
02:04:09.130 --> 02:04:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look at that guy he's got,</v>

2629
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:12.560
<v Speaker 2>have a buddy that has a wife and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife's 19,</v>

2630
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:14.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's in his forties.</v>

2631
02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.970
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

2632
02:04:17.090 --> 02:04:18.110
<v Speaker 2>That's them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2633
02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:18.720
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2634
02:04:18.721 --> 02:04:20.240
<v Speaker 2>they like it and they have a good time </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2635
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time talking to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2636
02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I'm living with someone they </v>

2637
02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:28.840
<v Speaker 2>have to be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2638
02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I need someone who has some experience.</v>

2639
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:35.410
<v Speaker 2>You have to be on the same level as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's something that you denied </v>

2640
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:37.800
<v Speaker 2>when you're younger but you realize when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get older is that when you fuck,</v>

2641
02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:42.920
<v Speaker 2>when you have sex with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you like to think that it's </v>

2642
02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.221
<v Speaker 2>just physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just getting there and you blow a </v>

2643
02:04:46.221 --> 02:04:46.221
<v Speaker 2>lobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that simple.</v>

2644
02:04:46.221 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 2>There is some sort of a weird connection</v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings make when they fuck.</v>

2645
02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And especially when you do it to someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's young,</v>

2646
02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:59.510
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we learn how to ignore that connection </v>

2647
02:04:59.510 --> 02:05:02.671
<v Speaker 2>and we learned how to like push each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other away when a little older we </v>

2648
02:05:02.671 --> 02:05:03.240
<v Speaker 2>learned how to separate and get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2649
02:05:03.241 --> 02:05:06.040
<v Speaker 2>just deal with it about physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're young,</v>

2650
02:05:06.041 --> 02:05:11.041
<v Speaker 2>like you get so attached,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember how attached to her the </v>

2651
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:11.041
<v Speaker 2>first person you had sex with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2652
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Unless that person's a total douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2653
02:05:13.351 --> 02:05:15.480
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it really like hooked on them.</v>

2654
02:05:15.690 --> 02:05:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Like puppy love is brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2655
02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:23.060
<v Speaker 2>and that that's what they call a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're inexperienced in the incredible </v>

2656
02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:24.750
<v Speaker 2>connection and you as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to manage that connection.</v>

2657
02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:29.751
<v Speaker 2>But the connection is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a grown adult and you </v>

2658
02:05:29.751 --> 02:05:30.640
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2659
02:05:31.650 --> 02:05:34.010
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're in a position to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take advantage of this kid,</v>

2660
02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:39.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're young and naive and silly and </v>

2661
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:39.120
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing,</v>

2662
02:05:39.210 --> 02:05:41.310
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then again,</v>

2663
02:05:41.311 --> 02:05:44.040
<v Speaker 2>a lot of 20 year olds are Horny as fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>or they want them to.</v>

2664
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want to do.</v>

2665
02:05:47.730 --> 02:05:50.480
<v Speaker 2>But to me not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2666
02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:52.980
<v Speaker 2>girls 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a baby to me,</v>

2667
02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 2>it's as a little child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like women,</v>

2668
02:05:55.900 --> 02:05:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like.</v>

2669
02:05:57.001 --> 02:05:57.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm old.</v>

2670
02:05:59.630 --> 02:06:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like a my urge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's women are more fun.</v>

2671
02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I like to be able to talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you?</v>

2672
02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Some dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Jitsu says I'm 23.</v>

2673
02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>

2674
02:06:11.491 --> 02:06:14.070
<v Speaker 2>You young little whipper snapper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was 23,</v>

2675
02:06:14.071 --> 02:06:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2676
02:06:16.501 --> 02:06:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I was a complete and total dumb ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hope you were smarter than me sir.</v>

2677
02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Because a life can be tough when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

2678
02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we all come from a different </v>

2679
02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2681
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:32.490
<v Speaker 2>a different starting point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

2682
02:06:32.610 --> 02:06:33.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

2683
02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:37.140
<v Speaker 2>their parents are super cool and real </v>
<v Speaker 2>open and their dads,</v>

2684
02:06:37.141 --> 02:06:39.990
<v Speaker 2>their best friend and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their dad was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart way.</v>

2688
02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:49.230
<v Speaker 2>And that person has a huge headstart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge,</v>

2689
02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:50.940
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge headstart in life.</v>

2690
02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:55.940
<v Speaker 2>If your parents are cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents were divorced when I was a </v>

2691
02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:55.940
<v Speaker 2>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2692
02:06:55.940 --> 02:07:00.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Stepdad came into the picture when I </v>

2693
02:07:00.081 --> 02:07:00.081
<v Speaker 2>was seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 24.</v>

2694
02:07:00.081 --> 02:07:03.150
<v Speaker 2>And imagine if you were 24 years old and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2695
02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:04.950
<v Speaker 2>actually I was five when he came into </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

2696
02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:09.360
<v Speaker 2>You were 24 years old and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking five year old kid hanging around</v>

2697
02:07:09.361 --> 02:07:10.680
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2698
02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:12.750
<v Speaker 2>So if he came in the picture when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

2699
02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:15.420
<v Speaker 2>then he was like 22,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's young as fuck,</v>

2700
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:20.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be that young and to be around </v>

2701
02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:21.060
<v Speaker 2>someone else's kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else's loud ass kid,</v>

2702
02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:23.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hard to deal with.</v>

2703
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:26.580
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of you out there and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>my 23 year old friend,</v>

2704
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:28.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have a headstart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2705
02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:31.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll be smarter than me when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were 23 than when I was 23.</v>

2706
02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:34.410
<v Speaker 2>But I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2707
02:07:34.530 --> 02:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>what I was talking about recently with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine was that guys like </v>

2708
02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2709
02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:41.050
<v Speaker 2>or anybody that I know that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptional.</v>

2710
02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Almost everybody I know that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptional at anything had kind of a </v>

2711
02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:47.800
<v Speaker 2>fucked up childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really weird.</v>

2712
02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:53.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I know that are like all my </v>

2713
02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:54.970
<v Speaker 2>friends that are really good comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my friends that are like really good</v>

2714
02:07:54.971 --> 02:07:59.971
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them had fucked up childhoods we </v>

2715
02:07:59.971 --> 02:07:59.971
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Showing the beginning thing again,</v>

2716
02:08:00.850 --> 02:08:04.390
<v Speaker 2>showing the beginning thing again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be getting things pretty bad ass.</v>

2717
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2718
02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2719
02:08:09.130 --> 02:08:12.520
<v Speaker 2>that people have fucked up childhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's something,</v>

2720
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:15.040
<v Speaker 2>something that comes out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2721
02:08:15.890 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're in balanced,</v>

2722
02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:21.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ride is so much rockier,</v>

2723
02:08:21.341 --> 02:08:22.960
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much more energy behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2724
02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:24.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you can get ahold of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2725
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:29.830
<v Speaker 2>and control your personality and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and figuring out a way to stabilize it </v>

2726
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:32.440
<v Speaker 2>and it's like you have so much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrust than a person who is content,</v>

2727
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:37.720
<v Speaker 2>but it might be unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Final words,</v>

<v Speaker 2>final words.</v>

2797
02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:31.460

2798
02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:31.460
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2799
02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:33.930
<v Speaker 1>You had to say that because you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be bragging about your wife's </v>

2800
02:11:33.930 --> 02:11:36.070
<v Speaker 1>tits.</v>

2801
02:11:36.071 --> 02:11:38.860
<v Speaker 1>but smoking weed and fucking is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

2802
02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Being drunk is better when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating pussy though.</v>

2803
02:11:41.710 --> 02:11:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being not in my opinion,</v>

2804
02:11:44.230 --> 02:11:49.230
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being drunk is better when it comes to </v>

2805
02:11:49.230 --> 02:11:51.151
<v Speaker 1>eating ass because it's the only time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it because I never even asked when </v>

2806
02:11:51.151 --> 02:11:54.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only time he had asked me sober is </v>

2807
02:11:54.971 --> 02:11:54.971
<v Speaker 1>when you just get out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're.</v>

2808
02:11:54.971 --> 02:11:57.510
<v Speaker 1>When you're high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to eat ass either,</v>

2809
02:11:57.550 --> 02:11:59.830
<v Speaker 1>but I beat the fuck out of some pussy </v>
<v Speaker 1>rental heart.</v>

2810
02:12:00.690 --> 02:12:02.770
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like it depends.</v>

2811
02:12:03.010 --> 02:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>It's Megan Fox asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat that anytime of day.</v>

2812
02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Anytime of the day he thought ass talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yak.</v>

2813
02:12:08.530 --> 02:12:10.840
<v Speaker 1>What if it's all poor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't care.</v>

2814
02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Either wipe it off and just dive in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2815
02:12:13.330 --> 02:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll wipe it off with your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with the hair.</v>

2816
02:12:16.330 --> 02:12:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think it's important to </v>

2817
02:12:21.330 --> 02:12:22.531
<v Speaker 1>drink drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why drinking and eating ass </v>

2818
02:12:22.531 --> 02:12:23.890
<v Speaker 1>goes in hand in hand is the alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>kills the Cola.</v>

2819
02:12:24.370 --> 02:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you're drinking jack and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cokes and you're eating ass,</v>

2820
02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the alcohol is killing any bad bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That alcohol is flushed your whole </v>

2821
02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:34.660
<v Speaker 1>system with poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's grown in that.</v>

2822
02:12:34.770 --> 02:12:36.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bacteria is going to take hold.</v>

2823
02:12:36.670 --> 02:12:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get swallowed up in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole antiseptic chemical reaction that </v>

2824
02:12:42.641 --> 02:12:47.641
<v Speaker 1>the Jack and coke has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you really think you can eat </v>

2825
02:12:47.641 --> 02:12:49.180
<v Speaker 1>ass when you're a jack and coke when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're high.</v>

2826
02:12:49.181 --> 02:12:54.181
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to eat ass because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're high like this is probably not </v>

2827
02:12:54.181 --> 02:12:54.181
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

2828
02:12:54.181 --> 02:12:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I never even put like metal in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cleans the metal.</v>

2829
02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that if you take jewelry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and putting on a candidate coke,</v>

2830
02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:03.460
<v Speaker 1>it just dissolves all the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>coconut frog?</v>

2831
02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take a put a frog in big thing of</v>

2832
02:13:06.221 --> 02:13:07.570
<v Speaker 1>coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dead frog.</v>

2833
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:10.260
<v Speaker 1>It just eats all the skin away and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone makes it go.</v>

2834
02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that true folks or is that one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>

2835
02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Those do exchangers we used because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard that the,</v>

2836
02:13:16.671 --> 02:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>the taking the paint off cars was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2837
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:21.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think snopes anyone do.</v>

2838
02:13:21.330 --> 02:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2839
02:13:22.181 --> 02:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things to clean your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grill is coke.</v>

2840
02:13:24.610 --> 02:13:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2841
02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Damn a rag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

2842
02:13:28.090 --> 02:13:31.350
<v Speaker 1>The doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you haven't like a fucking barbecue</v>

2843

<v Speaker 2>So barbecue pork pulled pork sandwich.</v>

2846
02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Alright Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2847
02:13:43.141 --> 02:13:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's going to be the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to take one more question.</v>

2848
02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:47.220
<v Speaker 2>So we end on a high note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2849
02:13:47.221 --> 02:13:49.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are enjoying the fuck out of this.</v>

2850
02:13:49.230 --> 02:13:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Here's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To disclose your product has 400 </v>

2851
02:13:54.230 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 2>witnesses proving ete life exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even astronauts.</v>

2852
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you have 400 people saying </v>

2853
02:13:59.780 --> 02:13:59.840
<v Speaker 2>that they've seen Ufo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does not mean there's cfos.</v>

2854
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.000
<v Speaker 2>That means you have 400 people that say </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've seen you have false and they </v>

2855
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:05.310
<v Speaker 2>might really believe they cfos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2856
02:14:05.311 --> 02:14:08.040
<v Speaker 2>they have a real problem that hunters </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a real problem.</v>

2857
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:13.310
<v Speaker 2>And this exhibit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happens all over the world where </v>

2858
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm the most experienced hunters are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that wind up accidentally killing </v>

2859
02:14:16.711 --> 02:14:21.711
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason being is that these guys </v>

2860
02:14:21.711 --> 02:14:21.780
<v Speaker 2>are winning your experience.</v>

2861
02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that sometimes your window of </v>

2862
02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:27.210
<v Speaker 2>opportunity where you get a shot at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer is real short.</v>

2863
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:29.460
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be able to react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the deer's right there,</v>

2864
02:14:30.250 --> 02:14:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you got to be able to shoot and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>see things that aren't there and one of </v>

2865
02:14:35.250 --> 02:14:38.430
<v Speaker 2>the things they all say a universally </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have an accident,</v>

2866
02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:40.890
<v Speaker 2>and these are like good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>church going people,</v>

2867
02:14:40.891 --> 02:14:42.840
<v Speaker 2>no anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no violence issues.</v>

2868
02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Guys are just loving on thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

2869
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:48.720
<v Speaker 2>they swear they saw a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They swear they saw deer.</v>

2870
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:50.940
<v Speaker 2>One guy accidentally shot this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2871
02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:52.780
<v Speaker 2>this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2872
02:14:52.781 --> 02:14:56.910
<v Speaker 2>in Maine and she had white mittens on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is following a deer.</v>

2873
02:14:56.970 --> 02:15:00.330
<v Speaker 2>And this lady was in the woods and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>had her white mittens on and he saw that</v>

2874
02:15:00.331 --> 02:15:02.530
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said he saw the book.</v>

2875
02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.640
<v Speaker 2>He said he saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it was right there in front of </v>

2876
02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:07.640
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2877
02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And he said he squeezed off the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't fully understand how the,</v>

2878
02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:15.210
<v Speaker 2>our consciousness and our imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>affects what we see.</v>

2879
02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still very much.</v>

2880
02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:21.360
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something tricky to it.</v>

2881
02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Hallucinations and the ability to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that aren't there,</v>

2882
02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:29.900
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if someone's in a very heightened </v>

2883
02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:29.900
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're in a very heightened state,</v>

2884
02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:31.740
<v Speaker 2>like if they're in the heightened state </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2885
02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:32.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2886
02:15:32.611 --> 02:15:34.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to see a deer,</v>

2887
02:15:34.590 --> 02:15:37.650
<v Speaker 2>or if they're in a heightened state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the woods in the dark,</v>

2888
02:15:37.651 --> 02:15:41.130
<v Speaker 2>and you think you see a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see a fucking monster.</v>

2889
02:15:41.250 --> 02:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>You can really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can convince yourself that you've </v>

2890
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:49.191
<v Speaker 2>actually seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see something and you don't know </v>

2891
02:15:49.191 --> 02:15:52.131
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will turn it into your mind and </v>

2892
02:15:52.131 --> 02:15:54.531
<v Speaker 2>making a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're out in the woods and it's </v>

2893
02:15:54.531 --> 02:15:56.301
<v Speaker 2>Pitch Black and you stumble into a wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>boar and you barely see it and it makes </v>

2894
02:15:56.701 --> 02:15:58.320
<v Speaker 2>noise and runs away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

2895
02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:01.000
<v Speaker 2>it could be some to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2896
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:06.350
<v Speaker 2>to fucking foot tall troll man with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2897
02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:09.750
<v Speaker 2>giant fucking furry feet and glowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

2898
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:13.950
<v Speaker 2>You could make something up in your head</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't think you're doing it,</v>

2899
02:16:14.130 --> 02:16:19.130
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human imagination and human memory </v>

2900
02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:24.140
<v Speaker 2>or not totally to be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unless they have actual evidence </v>

2901
02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:26.580
<v Speaker 2>listening to anybody talk about Ufo as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to listen to them and go,</v>

2902
02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:28.260
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2903
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:31.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not saying that you can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2904
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:33.280
<v Speaker 2>hear from other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2905
02:16:33.281 --> 02:16:38.281
<v Speaker 2>if you were so sophisticated that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can travel to this world from another </v>

2906
02:16:38.281 --> 02:16:42.961
<v Speaker 2>galaxy or another solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you be so sophisticated </v>

2907
02:16:43.061 --> 02:16:48.061
<v Speaker 2>that you could hide?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you be so sophisticated </v>

2908
02:16:48.061 --> 02:16:48.220
<v Speaker 2>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Ufo is completely invisible.</v>

2909
02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you be totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>undetectable?</v>

2910
02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2911
02:16:51.161 --> 02:16:55.570
<v Speaker 2>maybe they would just have everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely master the idea that,</v>

2912
02:16:55.850 --> 02:16:57.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would show themselves and look like</v>

2913
02:16:57.851 --> 02:17:02.851
<v Speaker 2>they're dangling on a string.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allow people to take pictures and you </v>

2914
02:17:02.851 --> 02:17:02.851
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they all,</v>

2915
02:17:02.851 --> 02:17:04.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe they wanted us to see them really.</v>

2916
02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:09.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just showed up and some weird </v>

2917
02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:09.600
<v Speaker 2>obscure place where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2918
02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:10.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2919
02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:11.410
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

2920
02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:12.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what they're doing.</v>

2921
02:17:12.980 --> 02:17:15.610
<v Speaker 2>That if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there really are aliens,</v>

2922
02:17:15.611 --> 02:17:19.120
<v Speaker 2>they're probably so alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even recognize them.</v>

2923
02:17:19.330 --> 02:17:24.330
<v Speaker 2>They're probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what we recognize is what </v>

2924
02:17:24.330 --> 02:17:24.820
<v Speaker 2>we see in our dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we see in our environment,</v>

2925
02:17:24.821 --> 02:17:29.821
<v Speaker 2>what we see in our world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably life forms out </v>

2926
02:17:29.821 --> 02:17:31.990
<v Speaker 2>there exist that are so alien to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even have the sensors to detect</v>

2927
02:17:31.991 --> 02:17:33.120
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2928
02:17:33.130 --> 02:17:37.120
<v Speaker 2>and the way I've talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>before and I was talking about farts and</v>

2929
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 2>that by when someone farts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have a nose,</v>

2930
02:17:40.390 --> 02:17:42.400
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stinks you.</v>

2931
02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:47.430
<v Speaker 2>There's literally something going around</v>
<v Speaker 2>you that's invisible and the sense that </v>

2932
02:17:47.430 --> 02:17:51.001
<v Speaker 2>you have tunes into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we not know that there are an </v>

2933
02:17:51.001 --> 02:17:53.260
<v Speaker 2>infinite amount of things that we cannot</v>
<v Speaker 2>detect that are around us all the time.</v>

2934
02:17:53.410 --> 02:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just guesswork because something's </v>

2935
02:17:58.410 --> 02:17:59.140
<v Speaker 2>not on the same frequency as us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's not solid.</v>

2936
02:17:59.141 --> 02:18:04.141
<v Speaker 2>It's not tangible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't bang on it because just </v>

2937
02:18:04.141 --> 02:18:07.150
<v Speaker 2>because of that doesn't mean it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>real and if there are aliens,</v>

2938
02:18:07.151 --> 02:18:11.110
<v Speaker 2>they're probably so fucking alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even see it there.</v>

2939
02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:13.540
<v Speaker 2>They're probably on a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency than we are.</v>

2940
02:18:14.050 --> 02:18:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying all these dudes that say </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've seen Ufo is because they really </v>

2941
02:18:19.050 --> 02:18:19.610
<v Speaker 2>want to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fos.</v>

2942
02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:24.780
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have all had experiences and </v>

2943
02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:28.681
<v Speaker 2>something's happened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they want to see you for they want </v>

2944
02:18:28.681 --> 02:18:30.610
<v Speaker 2>so bad they've given up on their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've given up on their careers,</v>

2945
02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:33.430
<v Speaker 2>they've decided to pursue [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>full time.</v>

2946
02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:36.850
<v Speaker 2>They make youtube videos constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do conferences and seminars.</v>

2947
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:42.030
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of vested interests </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in the idea of flying saucers </v>

2948
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:43.390
<v Speaker 2>and ships from other planets coming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this earth,</v>

2949
02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:48.660
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you have to take into </v>

2950
02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:50.791
<v Speaker 2>consideration like why these people want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see these things and when these </v>

2951
02:18:50.791 --> 02:18:51.670
<v Speaker 2>experiences happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing.</v>

2952
02:18:51.670 --> 02:18:55.540
<v Speaker 2>People individually experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially alien abduction experiences.</v>

2953
02:18:55.780 --> 02:19:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Most of those things come in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the night while people are dreaming </v>

2954
02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:01.450
<v Speaker 2>and when you're dreaming in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the night,</v>

2955
02:19:01.451 --> 02:19:05.620
<v Speaker 2>your brain is producing all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic chemicals including dmt.</v>

2956
02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:10.740
<v Speaker 2>The most potent psychedelic known to man</v>
<v Speaker 2>is produced when you're in heavy rem </v>

2957
02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:14.011
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when these people are having these </v>

2958
02:19:14.011 --> 02:19:16.051
<v Speaker 2>alien abduction experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you not know that it's not your </v>

2959
02:19:16.051 --> 02:19:19.291
<v Speaker 2>imagination mixed in with psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that you don't even know you're </v>

2960
02:19:19.291 --> 02:19:20.500
<v Speaker 2>having?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're having these things in your brain</v>

2961
02:19:20.501 --> 02:19:21.210
<v Speaker 2>is producing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2962
02:19:21.211 --> 02:19:26.211
<v Speaker 2>and you're having these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking psychedelic trips and maybe </v>

2963
02:19:26.211 --> 02:19:29.311
<v Speaker 2>you're halfway into a dream and you wake</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and you're tripping out of these </v>

2964
02:19:29.311 --> 02:19:33.191
<v Speaker 2>chemicals in your fucking brain and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start creating all these scenarios with </v>

2965
02:19:33.191 --> 02:19:33.470
<v Speaker 2>your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

2966
02:19:33.471 --> 02:19:34.610
<v Speaker 2>you're on a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2967
02:19:34.611 --> 02:19:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Because you're in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking natural dmt trip.</v>

2968
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:40.160
<v Speaker 2>And if you smoked DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb people that want money.</v>

2969
02:19:40.161 --> 02:19:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

2970
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:42.590
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people that are done though.</v>

2971
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:44.600
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that aren't done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have real experiences.</v>

2972
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2973
02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen their interviews,</v>

2974
02:19:47.111 --> 02:19:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I've read stuff they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read all the John Mac books.</v>

2975
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:51.860
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>

2976
02:19:51.861 --> 02:19:53.270
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a very,</v>

2977
02:19:53.271 --> 02:19:55.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one you can't generalize,</v>

2978
02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:58.190
<v Speaker 2>but people have had ufo experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2979
02:19:58.250 --> 02:20:00.680
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any supernatural,</v>

2980
02:20:00.681 --> 02:20:02.020
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2981
02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:07.060
<v Speaker 2>out of the ordinary experience has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered in all sorts of different </v>

2982
02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:07.670
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the evidence and what else could</v>

2983
02:20:07.671 --> 02:20:12.671
<v Speaker 2>it have been?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at what time these </v>

2984
02:20:12.671 --> 02:20:15.431
<v Speaker 2>things are taking place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost universally they take place late </v>

2985
02:20:15.431 --> 02:20:18.310
<v Speaker 2>at night when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the alien abduction </v>

2986
02:20:18.310 --> 02:20:18.310
<v Speaker 2>experiences almost universally take </v>
<v Speaker 2>place late at night.</v>

2987
02:20:18.310 --> 02:20:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And when these people have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

2988
02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:21.860
<v Speaker 2>they're all sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2989
02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:24.800
<v Speaker 2>they're all like half out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>something happens to them.</v>

2990
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:28.460
<v Speaker 2>It's much more likely an endogenous dub </v>
<v Speaker 2>of psychedelic chemicals.</v>

2991
02:20:29.410 --> 02:20:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no expert in my disclaimer.</v>

2992
02:20:31.431 --> 02:20:32.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2993
02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:37.690
<v Speaker 2>This is all shit that I've read on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet and watch documentaries on and </v>

2994
02:20:37.690 --> 02:20:40.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned when I was in my isolation tech </v>

2995
02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:41.290
<v Speaker 2>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>either you have a good time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>50 percent of the time.</v>

2998

<v Speaker 2>What didn't you like about today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a lot before when these </v>

2999
02:20:53.811 --> 02:20:55.580
<v Speaker 2>subjects come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times I've said,</v>
