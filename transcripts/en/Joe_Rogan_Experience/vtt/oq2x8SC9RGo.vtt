<v Speaker 1>That was sad,</v>

9
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The conspiracy theory was already on.</v>

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw on line because he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morrow didn't do ww II yesterday</v>

12
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.031
<v Speaker 2>evening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

13
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was at the funeral of gather edelman.</v>

14
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.391
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

15
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was really sick at home.</v>

16
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 2>that was the craziest news we found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>after we just did our podcast and then</v>

18
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 2>we went online and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

19
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 2>He got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got sick with pneumonia and then it's</v>

20
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 2>going to revive him.</v>

21
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had staph infection worse than</v>

22
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>anybody I've ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see some of</v>

23
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 2>pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I said to people,</v>

24
00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:01.300
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you use smokeless tobacco in that</v>

25
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Speaker 2>little box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could literally put in that hole</v>

26
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 2>that he had in his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

27
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>it was insane.</v>

29
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll show the picture.</v>

30
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he can find the picture of Kevin</v>

31
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Randleman staph infection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that I could get this bad,</v>

32
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>but he had holes in his body where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could look in and you see all the tissue</v>

33
00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>and attendance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it third,</v>

35
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking like a fist sized hole.</v>

36
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

37
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy survived everything as well.</v>

38
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:31.614
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

39
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just incredible.</v>

40
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he fought after this too by the way.</v>

41
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Up and he fought afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when your body is that compromised</v>

42
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>from something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that was mercer where the</v>

43
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>medication resistant staph infection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff is real dangerous and people</v>

44
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:56.110
<v Speaker 1>die from it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at his leg to look how swollen his</v>

45
00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>ankle and his foot is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

46
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

47
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And Kevin Randleman in his prime mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a stud.</v>

48
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>What a specimen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was to see him that</v>

49
00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he just ignored it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just kept getting worse and worse.</v>

51
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened,</v>

52
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the feeling that it's like with</v>

54
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 2>all the flights that were pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

55
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same as well,</v>

56
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have something,</v>

57
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 2>you feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:24.641
<v Speaker 2>your launch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll.</v>

59
00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Everything is hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever man,</v>

60
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take care of that tomorrow once it</v>

61
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 2>gets worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not realizing because we're pushing all</v>

62
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 2>the limits all the time that it at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment you're feeling it's probably</v>

63
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 2>really bad already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should check it out,</v>

64
00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:37.090
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just push it away.</v>

65
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's get rid of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do my work first and then we'll</v>

66
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 2>take care of that later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was too late.</v>

67
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the feeling I have.</v>

68
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 1>That is a problem with mental toughness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some fighters they just keep pushing</v>

69
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>through injuries and I've always</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspected that that might be the case</v>

70
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>with Cain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why cain keeps getting injured over and</v>

71
00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>over again and now he's starting to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some serious injuries where he's had</v>

72
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>back now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both shoulder</v>

73
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 3>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee surgery.</v>

74
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a guy in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

75
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I think Kane is only 33 or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

76
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should be regenerating like,</v>

77
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 3>like this now as a heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your prime.</v>

78
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 3>The early thirties for heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So generally when they really come into</v>

79
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 3>their own and to see him constantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>injured,</v>

80
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I've always suspected it's just his</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental toughness is almost like a burden</v>

81
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 3>because he pushes through everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

82
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the same thing with his knees.</v>

83
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 3>He's had some serious knee problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they,</v>

84
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the problem.</v>

85
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 3>They just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

86
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Let's just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they can block out pain in a way</v>

87
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:38.730
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

88
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 3>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get a series,</v>

89
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:40.970
<v Speaker 3>knee injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

90
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.561
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go to.</v>

91
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 3>The doctor got to get this checked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not when you're in the middle of camp</v>

92
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 3>and you're defending your title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking keep pushing through it.</v>

93
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

94
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 3>all my students know because I used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be executive like all the other guys.</v>

95
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 3>I say if you have an injury and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor tells you,</v>

96
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 3>take two months off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take four months off.</v>

97
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 3>That's my advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you take double the amount of.</v>

98
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two months,</v>

99
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.370
<v Speaker 3>one month or three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

100
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 3>don't do that because later in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with what happened with me,</v>

101
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 3>it will backfire for you and it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good piece of advice right there because</v>

102
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 3>so many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially acl surgeries,</v>

103
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 3>how many times have we seen guys get</v>
<v Speaker 3>theirs?</v>

104
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Their knee reconstructed and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to get back on the mat too quick and</v>

105
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 3>pop bumps again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new knee blows out again and you're</v>

106
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 3>looking at another six to nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

107
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 3>so common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Accrues Elisha Benji redneck.</v>

108
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:32.690
<v Speaker 3>He had like also like from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from an illegal corp.</v>

109
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 3>So he had something in his knee and</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal courtyard.</v>

110
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 3>They had the fbi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

111
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 3>an illegally obtained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It waS.</v>

112
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 3>He got a letter from the fbi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he almost lost his leg and then he had</v>

113
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:44.381
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

114
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:48.110
<v Speaker 3>we went to dinner with him one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a machine on him that filled</v>

115
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:48.944
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His blood,</v>

116
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 3>everywhere he went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got this crazy infection and then</v>

117
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 3>years later he gets a letter from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fbi and it was the guy who was</v>

118
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.170
<v Speaker 3>illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 3>call me crazy when anderson silva was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to speak of this career.</v>

131
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 3>I said if I have six monThs with benji</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would listen to me because</v>

132
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 3>sometimes she gets that ego that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

133
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:38.300
<v Speaker 3>I can strike with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

134
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to take him down and then</v>

135
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 3>strike him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

136
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 3>because she would knock people out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>one punch.</v>

137
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 3>This guy hits so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would hurt my hands on the Focus</v>

138
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 3>mitts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm as the craziest follow he has and</v>

139
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wrestling was so good.</v>

140
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 3>He would just take him down and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beat hIm up.</v>

141
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee You that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's how powerful he was.</v>

142
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.591
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

143
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot</v>

144
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>of guys that don't realize their</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential and benji radical was one of</v>

145
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>those guys that people would always talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and the gym,</v>

146
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say like,</v>

147
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he could figure out how to put it all</v>

148
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:07.484
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

149
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.140
<v Speaker 2>We did a few times at the ifl when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was training for the anaconda.</v>

150
00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 2>She was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.560
<v Speaker 2>And then he started listening and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>go like,</v>

152
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

153
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you transforming them into a kickboxer.</v>

154
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.340
<v Speaker 2>He's just listening at this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you face another guy,</v>

155
00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:23.710
<v Speaker 2>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought a Scott Smith,</v>

156
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told him,</v>

157
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't brawl with the guy.</v>

158
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are people going to think,</v>

159
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to blame it on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell them that I set so otherwise I'm</v>

160
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:35.560
<v Speaker 2>not going to train you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course the fight starts,</v>

161
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.780
<v Speaker 2>smith comes out and he starts brawling</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a guide.</v>

162
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:39.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what the guy does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do thIs.</v>

163
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Like with vandelay silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't brawl with the guy.</v>

164
00:06:41.681 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just got to pick them apart from the</v>

165
00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:47.050
<v Speaker 2>outside and she would take him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got in trouble at the end of the</v>

166
00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:49.450
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he took him down,</v>

167
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.450
<v Speaker 2>hit him once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the end of the round,</v>

168
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 2>but almost half scotsmen aren't exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing where I've lost my voice.</v>

169
00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

170
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.250
<v Speaker 2>why don't you take them down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really that easy for you.</v>

171
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't.</v>

172
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.690
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a funny thing when guys want to beat</v>

173
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:13.440
<v Speaker 1>guys at their own game or they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that they're not aFraid to stand</v>

174
00:07:13.441 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to.</v>

175
00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:18.720
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that fucking thing that</v>

176
00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:21.270
<v Speaker 1>makes you great in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you a fighter in the first</v>

177
00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:23.310
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times can BIte you in the ass.</v>

178
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do wHat the other person is best</v>

179
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's one thing he's weaker than</v>

180
00:07:29.341 --> 00:07:30.690
<v Speaker 2>yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to that,</v>

181
00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:34.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was ground literally striking.</v>

182
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one thing that gsp was always</v>

183
00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:38.550
<v Speaker 1>so good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always so good at imposing his</v>

184
00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:40.050
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever the guy was.</v>

185
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 1>If a guy was good at wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would try to keep the fight standing.</v>

186
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:45.270
<v Speaker 1>If a guy was good at standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would take them down.</v>

187
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>gsp was so good at that and being</v>

188
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:50.640
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable too as to what his</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach was going to be.</v>

189
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.920
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was going to strike and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's going to take you down.</v>

190
00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:54.780
<v Speaker 1>You think he's going to take you down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to kick you.</v>

191
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.940
<v Speaker 2>He was like the la jolla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the la jolla.</v>

192
00:07:56.941 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Every time when he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a new techniques.</v>

193
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 2>He used new combinations and the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing happened with gsp.</v>

194
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Every time you saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>josh koscheck,</v>

195
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I remember the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a jap and was just spinning back,</v>

196
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:12.880
<v Speaker 2>kick to the body and he nailed it over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

197
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 2>You knew that for the six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight weeks,</v>

198
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever he was trading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they worked on that.</v>

199
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of you ad lib a little bit.</v>

200
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.680
<v Speaker 2>What you normally do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to know.</v>

201
00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Just pepper.</v>

202
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the josh koscheck fight.</v>

203
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:23.991
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a.</v>

204
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That was an ugly one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THat one is.</v>

205
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I swole up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh was in a seriously bad shape after</v>

206
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't fly after that fight.</v>

207
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>

208
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 1>That was one where they hear that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a drive from.</v>

209
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I think they had that fight in toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it toronto and montreal?</v>

210
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

211
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

212
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was montreal because I</v>

213
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>think toronto was jake shields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the big one at the roger</v>

214
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:47.430
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

215
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

216
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in Canada and he had a drive down</v>

217
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 1>to boston and I believe he had to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for a couple of weeks before he</v>

218
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>could even fly back home to san jose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

219
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>So you think that will blow up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air as well?</v>

220
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so bad.</v>

221
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It was an orbital fracture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

222
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture of it right there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's after the fight,</v>

223
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but it was so bad that they had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate on it and those blowout</v>

224
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>fractures of the eyes apparently are</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely painful and very dangerous too</v>

225
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.620
<v Speaker 1>because it's the bone behind the eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets broken so they have to go in</v>

226
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 1>behind the eye and repair that bone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when they do that,</v>

227
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 1>your eye ball is never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks different like do you remember</v>

228
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 1>bob sapp after cro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cop Hit him in pride,</v>

229
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I believe you called that faculty member</v>
<v Speaker 1>cro.</v>

230
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Cop cracked him with the left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it or was it [inaudible]?</v>

231
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

232
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 2>They'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

233
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:43.550
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

<v Speaker 2>actually training.</v>

235
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Bob said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

236
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 2>whenever you call it training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained them one and a half times the</v>

237
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 2>rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was doing interviews.</v>

238
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

239
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.270

<v Speaker 2>He wants to kill you because you're on</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

242
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.150

<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

243
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:06.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

244
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Then he came to train with me because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>told him before the fight,</v>

245
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you would fight me,</v>

246
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:13.330
<v Speaker 2>why would you go for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>stamina and I kick your knees instead of</v>

248
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:18.630
<v Speaker 2>your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kick your knees because you have to</v>

249
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:22.790
<v Speaker 2>carry that weight all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who dropped him two or three times with</v>

250
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 2>the liver shot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after that he came.</v>

251
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want to train with you.</v>

252
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:27.391
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

253
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 2>well then I'm going to be in Japan</v>

<v Speaker 2>let's work out.</v>

255
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:33.660

<v Speaker 2>he was still busy doing media.</v>

256
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

257
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 1>He was such a superstar in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to capitalize the amount of money</v>

258
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 1>he was able to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people in America realized how</v>

259
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:44.590
<v Speaker 1>big for those few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob sapp got it.</v>

260
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no clue.</v>

261
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 2>We went out to dinner with him and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to close the restaurant and</v>

262
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 2>have to let them out at the back because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see one person in the front,</v>

263
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.803
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

264
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 2>and there was a whole group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get out anymore.</v>

265
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.450
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't go through the lobby of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel and it's not like he can blend in</v>

266
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.640
<v Speaker 2>a 375 pound man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

267
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:07.960
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

268
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 2>This was in the tokyo post.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a picture of him on the cover</v>

269
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.340
<v Speaker 2>coming out of a like a massage place and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw this little girl thanked him and</v>

270
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 2>here's the amount and the man stands</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and all these little girls that</v>

271
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:25.950
<v Speaker 2>had that little black thing in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyes,</v>

272
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:30.000
<v Speaker 2>you know that they do so you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>who that person is still there and he</v>

273
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 2>was upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

274
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>why didn't they put one in front of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>People are going to go a while.</v>

278
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>When he was fighting in pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was like a character from a</v>

279
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the boss in a video game.</v>

280
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

281
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.100

<v Speaker 1>it was hilarious.</v>

282
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.500
<v Speaker 2>He did all these dances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bulb,</v>

283
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 2>seb dance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they go to every shape and every</v>

284
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 2>show and you had to just love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>

285
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 2>He's a Freak and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time when he fought against</v>

286
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:04.920
<v Speaker 2>nogueira I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

287
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 2>we got to hear from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

288
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.340
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

289
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 2>he was doing really well against a</v>
<v Speaker 2>seasoned guy like nogueira eventually.</v>

290
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:11.711
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last.</v>

291
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 2>But he just started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you would have kept focusing</v>

292
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 2>on the same training that he did at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

293
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 2>it would've been a much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much tougher guy because he had a lot of</v>

294
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 2>talented physically at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

295
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Speaker 2>he was just so fucking big to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maurice was training him at that time.</v>

296
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maury smith was working with a med and</v>

297
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:33.380
<v Speaker 2>married</v>

298
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.120
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're working with his kickboxing and</v>

299
00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:38.000
<v Speaker 1>they're really trying to put some</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique to all that muscle,</v>

300
00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:40.190
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a guy who</v>

301
00:12:40.191 --> 00:12:43.460
<v Speaker 1>legitimately was 375 pounds with abs.</v>

302
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like a science project in the</v>

303
00:12:46.911 --> 00:12:51.110
<v Speaker 2>history of performance enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

304
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

305
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.180
<v Speaker 2>is there a bit of project is he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is as far as you can push it before</v>

306
00:12:57.831 --> 00:13:01.100
<v Speaker 2>you fucking explode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before your skin just explodes.</v>

307
00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Like a water balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>

308
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see it the past.</v>

309
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 2>You see that with these guys who use a</v>
<v Speaker 2>latino,</v>

310
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.760
<v Speaker 2>they always are around to fight as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to become purple,</v>

311
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then suddenly here they died of a</v>

312
00:13:13.101 --> 00:13:15.620
<v Speaker 2>heart attack and so I wonder what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened there?</v>

313
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made it through.</v>

314
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.170
<v Speaker 1>He survived and then he started just</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick tapping.</v>

315
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.450
<v Speaker 1>He started doing all these fights where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would get hit,</v>

316
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:28.190
<v Speaker 1>why he would go in hard and if it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out he would just tap and he fought</v>

317
00:13:28.191 --> 00:13:32.090
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of guys like that where he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>start off the fight really well and then</v>

318
00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:35.210
<v Speaker 1>wind up tapping out just and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight again like three weeks.</v>

319
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just kept doing it.</v>

320
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Living off of the name that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>created while he was in pride.</v>

321
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.520
<v Speaker 2>That's a very sad thing for me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost the same as going on the</v>

322
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:47.190
<v Speaker 2>street then beg for money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is to me,</v>

323
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a man.</v>

324
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.200
<v Speaker 2>He's such a good guy if you meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh so very,</v>

325
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.290
<v Speaker 2>very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

326
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:56.124
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

327
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same occur,</v>

328
00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 2>you know what I saw that special thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they did on him,</v>

329
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:02.430
<v Speaker 2>but he sells cars now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

330
00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:04.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to look at that because</v>

331
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:09.561
<v Speaker 2>especially he knew where he was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past and that old is gone now you know,</v>

332
00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:10.494
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

333
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.920
<v Speaker 2>you can be really high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can fall really low.</v>

334
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

335
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.990
<v Speaker 2>he had fired a saying that they said</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so great to fight this as but when</v>

336
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.920
<v Speaker 2>you're high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're high,</v>

337
00:14:19.921 --> 00:14:20.820
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When.</v>

338
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.910
<v Speaker 2>But when the lows are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their is really low as well.</v>

339
00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:27.000
<v Speaker 2>The difference is too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually,</v>

340
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what just came out with ellen and</v>

341
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.960
<v Speaker 2>rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she broke down just thinking</v>

342
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.870
<v Speaker 2>about it now and it's a moment that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

343
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:40.260
<v Speaker 2>So everybody would have that for a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

344
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.700
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it get you down because like that,</v>

345
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I know that after the fight that night</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just devastated.</v>

346
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a brutal,</v>

347
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:56.740
<v Speaker 1>brutal knockout and it was a fight where</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing worked.</v>

348
00:14:56.741 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean just nOthing worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went after holly and she tried to</v>

349
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:05.081
<v Speaker 1>bully her and holly just great footwork</v>
<v Speaker 1>countered her and that kickboxing and</v>

350
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 1>her movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly's movement is the best in all of</v>

351
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>women's mma or footwork and movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so good At getting out of the way</v>

352
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.130
<v Speaker 1>at countering when you're coming in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the style,</v>

353
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the bulldog style of rhonda has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially the way she fought that fight</v>

354
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just played right into holly zahn.</v>

355
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.100
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knew exactly what she was going to</v>

356
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:26.320
<v Speaker 2>be able to time because she just wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>before forward</v>

357
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.550
<v Speaker 1>and that head kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whew.</v>

358
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that I said</v>

359
00:15:30.361 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 1>after that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

360
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.110
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should take a long time off after</v>

361
00:15:34.111 --> 00:15:37.950
<v Speaker 1>that fight because that's the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>head kick that's the kind of kao that it</v>

362
00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:41.310
<v Speaker 1>takes a long time to recover from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might look fine,</v>

363
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to talk,</v>

364
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but mentally and also the brain itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of an impact like a high kick</v>

365
00:15:49.051 --> 00:15:52.140
<v Speaker 1>like that can really take a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everything.</v>

366
00:15:52.141 --> 00:15:54.570
<v Speaker 1>He'll for Anything to normalize.</v>

367
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kenny rice that she says no because I</v>

368
00:15:56.981 --> 00:16:00.910
<v Speaker 2>took my words back because if we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about a floyd mayweather versus</v>

369
00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:01.601
<v Speaker 2>rhonda said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

370
00:16:01.601 --> 00:16:02.670
<v Speaker 2>if it goes to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

371
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

372
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I truly believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but kenny said footwork on,</v>

373
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.230
<v Speaker 2>make sure it's not going to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grant.</v>

374
00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:08.771
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

375
00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:09.131
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

376
00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes,</v>

377
00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:12.280
<v Speaker 2>25 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll a long time.</v>

378
00:16:12.281 --> 00:16:14.170
<v Speaker 2>He knows there will be a clinch one</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

379
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.240
<v Speaker 2>but that's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

380
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference.</v>

381
00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:19.470
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fighting in an octagon,</v>

382
00:16:19.471 --> 00:16:22.770
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at a boxing ring,</v>

383
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.710
<v Speaker 1>most people you can look them up much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much smaller space.</v>

384
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And also I just don't think rhonda would</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to box a floyd mayweather.</v>

385
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I think she thought that she could stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>with holly holm.</v>

386
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of is based on holly's</v>

387
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:38.730
<v Speaker 1>previous performances in the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the raquel pennington fight.</v>

388
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Yokel pennington who was very tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very durable.</v>

389
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.130
<v Speaker 1>And I've read rico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always give her.</v>

390
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I gave her the nickname of the ear</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploder because she's had so many</v>

391
00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:52.020
<v Speaker 1>moments in the fight where you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screamed so loud that you blow people's</v>

392
00:16:52.021 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 1>eardrums out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

393
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:54.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she fought Ashley,</v>

394
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:56.310
<v Speaker 1>evan smith and bulldog choked her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

395
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

396
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Blood everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she talked to her like one second</v>

397
00:16:59.071 --> 00:17:00.570
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were screaming at the end of that</v>

398
00:17:00.571 --> 00:17:01.650
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's out.</v>

399
00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:05.490
<v Speaker 1>She's out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she but pennington so tough and</v>

400
00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:10.491
<v Speaker 1>fought conservatively against holly holm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost one like that was a split</v>

401
00:17:10.951 --> 00:17:13.930
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at that fight and he go,</v>

402
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 1>well boy man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe rhonda could stand with her and</v>

403
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.240
<v Speaker 1>just go after the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went after bench go,</v>

404
00:17:18.241 --> 00:17:18.980
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

405
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.980
<v Speaker 1>the race she went after a Alexis Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man holly was just on point.</v>

406
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.450
<v Speaker 2>It was game planning also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.780
<v Speaker 2>after that fight with raquel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was perfect for her because that</v>

408
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:32.261
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

409
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:33.820
<v Speaker 2>stay away from the big bumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

410
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:35.920
<v Speaker 2>and they know that rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's an athlete,</v>

411
00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:37.180
<v Speaker 2>she can hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she hit you.</v>

412
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.590
<v Speaker 2>When I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

413
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.000
<v Speaker 2>what is the open workout in Brazil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm one of these guys,</v>

414
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.290
<v Speaker 2>I have always thinks to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

415
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:46.660
<v Speaker 2>does not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should do that.</v>

416
00:17:46.661 --> 00:17:47.950
<v Speaker 2>You can prove this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

417
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very critical and I always think to</v>

418
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I too much?</v>

419
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Is that what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the moment I saw her training</v>

420
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 2>there and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not fighting and I know this</v>

421
00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 2>doesn't translate to fighting by hitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focus mitts and hitting the bag or</v>

422
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked nearly perfect to me.</v>

423
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.100
<v Speaker 2>The rotation of her upper body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movement afterwards to move very</v>

424
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 2>taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like also,</v>

425
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I really thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

426
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.511
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

427
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing to say now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This looks really good.</v>

428
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I felt the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I felt like our hand techniques were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>point and then when she polished off</v>

430
00:18:19.721 --> 00:18:22.330
<v Speaker 1>beds cohere and the first round it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of spoke to that like,</v>

431
00:18:22.331 --> 00:18:23.164
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

432
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.910
<v Speaker 1>obviously she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hits hard.</v>

433
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Her technique is improving and she's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>elite athlete.</v>

434
00:18:28.271 --> 00:18:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about an olympian.</v>

435
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.520
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a person that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mindset to push forward and figures</v>

436
00:18:33.521 --> 00:18:35.140
<v Speaker 1>out a way to get better at everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does,</v>

437
00:18:35.141 --> 00:18:36.980
<v Speaker 1>but so does holly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

438
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:42.150
<v Speaker 1>So does holly and holly has got way</v>
<v Speaker 1>better kickboxing skills and way better.</v>

439
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.600
<v Speaker 1>She's got way more diversity in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>striking game where it was.</v>

440
00:18:46.601 --> 00:18:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Ron is just punching knees to the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she gets close to the clench.</v>

441
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Nice the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the outside it's just punching.</v>

442
00:18:52.181 --> 00:18:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Where's holly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly can head kick you and knock you</v>

443
00:18:55.361 --> 00:18:57.910
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she sets those kicks up with kicks</v>

444
00:18:57.911 --> 00:18:59.770
<v Speaker 1>to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll throw kicks to leg.</v>

445
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.240
<v Speaker 1>That jackson camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all liked that oblique kicked in</v>

446
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.780
<v Speaker 1>the thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a dangerous kick.</v>

447
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a lord.</v>

448
00:19:06.341 --> 00:19:07.930
<v Speaker 2>And when somebody is going to snap their</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee,</v>

449
00:19:07.931 --> 00:19:08.764
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be over.</v>

450
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so because knee bars are</v>
<v Speaker 1>now allowed heel hooks on outlawed.</v>

451
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different thing.</v>

452
00:19:14.511 --> 00:19:17.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do this is once your leg is a little</v>

453
00:19:17.181 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 2>stretched and you get hit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

454
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.890
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A knee bar or you have to be in a</v>

455
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.970
<v Speaker 2>polyamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

456
00:19:22.971 --> 00:19:26.050
<v Speaker 2>But anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just put the knee bar on and give you</v>

457
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.980
<v Speaker 2>time to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won't have that.</v>

458
00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:28.814
<v Speaker 2>We'd no bleed cake.</v>

459
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

460
00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so effective right now when</v>

461
00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.760
<v Speaker 1>it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand why they're using it.</v>

462
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.830
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] jon jones is so good at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't.</v>

463
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winkle john is one of the best striking</v>

464
00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:43.430
<v Speaker 1>coaches in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is so good and so</v>

465
00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:45.860
<v Speaker 1>underappreciated because he's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>humble guy.</v>

466
00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:47.530
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not talking a lot.</v>

467
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not bragging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a very down to earth,</v>

468
00:19:50.391 --> 00:19:51.860
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humble guy.</v>

469
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.460
<v Speaker 1>But the results that that guy has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to.</v>

470
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holly is probably one of his best</v>

471
00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:56.770
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course</v>

472
00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:57.261
<v Speaker 2>jon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jon,</v>

473
00:19:57.261 --> 00:19:59.590
<v Speaker 2>jon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a freak.</v>

474
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.400
<v Speaker 2>He can change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be if he,</v>

475
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.450
<v Speaker 2>if he's now on the straight and narrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just fighting.</v>

476
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I see this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to beat this guy.</v>

477
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.070
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be,</v>

478
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>is going to be hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

479
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:14.730
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worry about john is that john's</v>

480
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 1>going to fuck himself up because like</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently he just got caught driving with</v>

481
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:22.730
<v Speaker 1>no license and no insurance and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>registration and you know,</v>

482
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 1>he lost his license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He get,</v>

483
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 1>he's got millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a fucking driver,</v>

484
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:27.174
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

485
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at tiger woods.</v>

486
00:20:28.911 --> 00:20:32.060
<v Speaker 2>What happened to him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when all the crap happened with</v>

487
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:33.140
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he mentally,</v>

488
00:20:33.141 --> 00:20:35.560
<v Speaker 2>he didn't come back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understand this is golf,</v>

489
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but same as fighting.</v>

490
00:20:36.891 --> 00:20:38.180
<v Speaker 2>It's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mind game.</v>

491
00:20:38.181 --> 00:20:40.870
<v Speaker 2>It's really a mind game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kenny overstepped that.</v>

492
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I think he can because jones is young</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knows how good he is.</v>

493
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.670
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were him,</v>

494
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I say fight for five more years is stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>you going down in history like a</v>

495
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 2>thousand years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will still talk about you if you do</v>

496
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:57.140
<v Speaker 2>it correctly or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sidetracks and something bad's gonna</v>

497
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.210
<v Speaker 2>happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not help.</v>

498
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he pulls it together.</v>

499
00:21:00.021 --> 00:21:02.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked john as a person.</v>

500
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has his flaws like most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's young and the amount of</v>

501
00:21:07.071 --> 00:21:11.450
<v Speaker 1>pressure that he's on to be the youngest</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever ufc champion to have this</v>

502
00:21:11.451 --> 00:21:13.520
<v Speaker 1>spectacular career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So early in life.</v>

503
00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.530
<v Speaker 1>The only loss he had was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disqualification.</v>

504
00:21:15.531 --> 00:21:18.320
<v Speaker 1>That was a bullshit disqualification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

505
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.010
<v Speaker 1>this stupid rule of 12 to six elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to get rid of that.</v>

506
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.720
<v Speaker 1>If we don't know what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks in the ufc,</v>

507
00:21:26.721 --> 00:21:30.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a rule and it's a crazy rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't strike someone with an</v>

508
00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.070
<v Speaker 1>elbow from 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12:00 PM to six on a clock dial,</v>

509
00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.160
<v Speaker 1>like going straight down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AnD the only reason why you can't do it</v>

510
00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.560
<v Speaker 1>is because when they were setting up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic commissions,</v>

511
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.310
<v Speaker 1>the athletic commissions had seen those</v>
<v Speaker 1>karate demonstrations on tv where a guy</v>

512
00:21:43.311 --> 00:21:45.680
<v Speaker 1>would break a brick with his elbow and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

513
00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:46.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

514
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.300
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be illegal because someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>could die and this is what big John</v>

515
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Mccarthy told me that he had to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

516
00:21:51.831 --> 00:21:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

517
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.200
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

518
00:21:54.201 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Then that was illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the only reason why that's</v>

519
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:58.850
<v Speaker 1>still illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the great thing is if you're on your</v>

520
00:21:58.851 --> 00:22:01.040
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to do it because that is</v>

521
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:06.020
<v Speaker 1>the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbest thing ever.</v>

522
00:22:06.021 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the dumbest rules that's</v>

523
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.433
<v Speaker 1>still in place.</v>

524
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

525
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.740
<v Speaker 2>well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a guy in holland,</v>

526
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.760
<v Speaker 2>he police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pulled it and wheat orlando with</v>

527
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.160
<v Speaker 2>these two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they fought each other,</v>

528
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.660
<v Speaker 2>they will sell out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw three fights of them live because</v>

529
00:22:23.661 --> 00:22:27.680
<v Speaker 2>these guys were crazy at full tie rules</v>
<v Speaker 2>and alondo wheat and he put both of</v>

530
00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:28.880
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would end the clench,</v>

531
00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:31.280
<v Speaker 2>like jump all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then come down with our.</v>

532
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Most of the collarbones do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will go full blast.</v>

533
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we who fought in the ufc,</v>

534
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I think ufc two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it two?</v>

535
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 1>We fought against the rem co.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pardot.</v>

536
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:42.371
<v Speaker 1>Pardot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

537
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:46.380
<v Speaker 1>He got him in a scarf and elbows with</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal elbows.</v>

538
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Now it is illegal and so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

539
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Well it might've been legal because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of coming from 12 on the side.</v>

540
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was like 12 to seven or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 11,</v>

541
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.810
<v Speaker 1>five or one to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you what you want to go.</v>

542
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.590
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>

543
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.951
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

544
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with a few rules of the</v>

545
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:09.550
<v Speaker 1>ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the number one.</v>

546
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have also a problem with the putting the</v>

547
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:14.080
<v Speaker 1>hand on the ground and stop news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head.</v>

548
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.990
<v Speaker 1>I always go if you have somebody lifted</v>
<v Speaker 1>him up.</v>

549
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like to down deponent,</v>

550
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a problem when they're up</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the cage because you can't get</v>

551
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 1>your head out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in pride.</v>

552
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the crazy things about pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think to this day and one of the</v>

553
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.090
<v Speaker 1>reasons why I was so excited to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral here too,</v>

554
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you guys called the glory days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of the wildest fights in the</v>

555
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:38.030
<v Speaker 1>history of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

556
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Where you have stomps soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks everything but no elbows,</v>

557
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.160
<v Speaker 1>no elbows to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

558
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

559
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I remember fights that</v>

560
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 1>they literally have ventilators silver</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the corner over or ninja or shogun,</v>

561
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would hold the ropes.</v>

562
00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Just stomp somebody skullen pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

563
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that that shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't be legal.</v>

564
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like what happened in the past with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hydro huerta one fc now one</v>

565
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:09.710
<v Speaker 1>championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at their fight,</v>

566
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the referee really messed up on</v>

567
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He liteRally dropped on all fours</v>

568
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 1>because he was exhausted and then he get</v>
<v Speaker 1>penalty kicked in the face that,</v>

569
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.620
<v Speaker 1>that could've been really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

570
00:24:20.621 --> 00:24:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it was really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how much he</v>

571
00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:26.050
<v Speaker 1>recovered from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a devastating knockout and it</v>

572
00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:30.120
<v Speaker 1>was also roger fighting at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is not really his weight class.</v>

573
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.980
<v Speaker 1>It really should be a 1:55 and he fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big.</v>

574
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Who's the brazilian guy that he fought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't remember his name,</v>

575
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but that guy's a big guy and he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had roger hurt and then that soccer,</v>

576
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 1>they have like a rule at one fc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they still have it where</v>

577
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.050
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say like open,</v>

578
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.820
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to do,</v>

579
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.150
<v Speaker 1>stomp or a kick to the downed opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

580
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.380
<v Speaker 1>this was a closed set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was the guy's name,</v>

581
00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.820
<v Speaker 1>zorro Babo a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man above it.</v>

582
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a devastating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating soccer here.</v>

583
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.500
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not want to throw the kick.</v>

584
00:25:05.501 --> 00:25:06.334
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

585
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Well then don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you do it?</v>

586
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which will be very dangerous at that</v>

587
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:15.290
<v Speaker 2>moment as well because you're breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to crack some rich,</v>

588
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:18.890
<v Speaker 2>so it can be very dangerous as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can recover from the crack ribs</v>

589
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:22.550
<v Speaker 2>a lot better than you can step away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no need for that.</v>

590
00:25:22.551 --> 00:25:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

591
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 2>it means being aware indicates and know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing.</v>

592
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I see a guys our guys out,</v>

593
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:31.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to hit them an extra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

594
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of debate about the old</v>

595
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 1>rules of pride versus the rules of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ufc and that was one of the things that</v>

596
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 1>happen when cro cop started fighting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ufc and then fought in a cage for</v>

597
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 1>the first time against gonzaga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

598
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought eddie sanchez first won that</v>

599
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:51.980
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was not on his level.</v>

600
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 1>And then he fought gonzaga gonzaga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took him down,</v>

601
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.650
<v Speaker 1>held them up against the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elbow the shit out of them,</v>

602
00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.420
<v Speaker 1>and then stood them up and high kicked</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

603
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.400
<v Speaker 1>But he was saying like the elbows</v>
<v Speaker 1>confused him.</v>

604
00:26:02.401 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Like he wasn't used to that and he also</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't used to the cage being trapped.</v>

605
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the pride ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could move around like the ropes</v>

606
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:10.490
<v Speaker 1>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get under the ropes.</v>

607
00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:11.241
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

608
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:12.074
<v Speaker 1>you'd never know</v>

609
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.290
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can look somebody up also in a</v>

610
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:17.270
<v Speaker 2>corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you cannot do in a cage.</v>

611
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.160
<v Speaker 2>When I stepped for the first time into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage,</v>

612
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>

613
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is awesome.</v>

614
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 2>They can never look me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the biggest thing I've ever</v>

615
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:28.210
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

616
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.053
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

617
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gonzaga,</v>

618
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:34.580
<v Speaker 2>that fight an elvis come back to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was so smart what he was</v>

619
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:36.290
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was constantly throwing the right</v>

620
00:26:36.291 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>hand and it didn't even come close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his face like this.</v>

621
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 2>And I'm constantly thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he doing that?</v>

622
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.030
<v Speaker 2>And then it</v>

623
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:44.870
<v Speaker 4>re,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

624
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh he's shutting his gig down because</v>

625
00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 4>woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might think if I just drove right</v>

626
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 4>stRaight like every 20 seconds in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your face,</v>

627
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 4>he's going to think if I throw my left</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the moment he throws that ride</v>

628
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 4>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to knock me out.</v>

629
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 4>So he shut his whole game down and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was moving to the left and that was,</v>

630
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 4>that was the blueprint to coco because</v>
<v Speaker 4>after that everybody started doing it.</v>

631
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's interesting how cro,</v>

632
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.950
<v Speaker 4>cro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cop got his revenge in the rematch in a</v>

633
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 4>big way with elbows on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems kind of ironic that one of the</v>

634
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:18.540
<v Speaker 4>things that cro cop was saying before</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fight is that he didn't</v>

635
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 4>particularly like grappling and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't particularly like elbows on the</v>

636
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:22.980
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

637
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 4>that's what won him the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second fight he won by being on top</v>

638
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.200
<v Speaker 4>and but the elbows that are real</v>
<v Speaker 4>talented striker can throw from the</v>

639
00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 4>guard.</v>

640
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 4>The difference in those elbows is just</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably devastated.</v>

641
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 4>And we saw that in the cro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cop fight.</v>

642
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

643
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 4>he did a really good job that I had at</v>
<v Speaker 4>one time.</v>

644
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:42.080
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody's arm barred me and I,</v>

645
00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I got out when I fought him the second</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

646
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:50.490
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to bar him first and I remembered</v>

647
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:54.740
<v Speaker 4>that armbar him the rope escape there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had him and then he wrote escapes and</v>

648
00:27:54.741 --> 00:27:55.390
<v Speaker 4>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

649
00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.880
<v Speaker 4>so this is pancreas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is bankers.</v>

650
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:57.241
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

651
00:27:57.241 --> 00:28:00.210
<v Speaker 4>you got it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then later on I heal.</v>

652
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:03.240
<v Speaker 4>Hooked him actually will had crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>rules.</v>

653
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 4>You and you were the first guy to figure</v>
<v Speaker 4>those rules out and I loved watching you</v>

654
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 4>fight back then because it was openhand</v>
<v Speaker 4>striking with the hands but kicks.</v>

655
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.480
<v Speaker 4>So like you were with the first guy that</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever saw a fight in that.</v>

656
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.850
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kicks so fucking hard.</v>

657
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 4>You could see when you would slam these</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys with these kicks,</v>

658
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.030
<v Speaker 4>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

659
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:23.010
<v Speaker 4>this is a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

660
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.670
<v Speaker 4>but also you weren't slapping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would see how the fuck.</v>

661
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Do you pull your hand back so far?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

662
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 4>I got very limber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hands the bone.</v>

663
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were pulling your hand way back and</v>

664
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 4>throwing straight punches and hooks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>upper cuts.</v>

665
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 4>like when you fly food narky throwing</v>
<v Speaker 4>upper cut.</v>

666
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 4>Like a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same motion.</v>

667
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Nobody does this still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

668
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:48.450
<v Speaker 4>if I'm in the garden and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just lift my hand like this.</v>

669
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 4>See?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

670
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Just slide over his chest and face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is nobody doing this?</v>

671
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Why is nobody just leave it here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hit them a little bit.</v>

672
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.250
<v Speaker 4>Look away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because most of them,</v>

673
00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.900
<v Speaker 4>when you look away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think and the book just flat hand</v>

674
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:07.290
<v Speaker 4>on the center of the chest and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>shove it over the chest.</v>

675
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

676
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 4>That does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But wouldn't that work with a punch as</v>

677
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:12.110
<v Speaker 4>well with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

678
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 4>but you have more space wIth a poem on</v>
<v Speaker 4>this distance.</v>

679
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Speaker 4>This is much shorter than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like an extra 15 percent,</v>

680
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 4>which will make a lot of difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that distance.</v>

681
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another five or six inches at</v>

682
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 4>least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

683
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 4>that's why I never understood nobody</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong palm strikes.</v>

684
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 4>Now that left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

685
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 4>Straight combination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in boxing,</v>

686
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.970
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a dumb combination.</v>

687
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 4>If you really think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's a short left hook,</v>

688
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm way too close to my straight punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has no power.</v>

689
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:44.560
<v Speaker 4>I can't stretch my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I do a palm strike and then a</v>

690
00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 4>straight punch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I got space for my straight punch.</v>

691
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 4>It's much harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why is nobody doing that?</v>

692
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do closed lines and I posted a thing</v>

693
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 4>on facebook like a year ago when I hit a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bag with a clothesline.</v>

694
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people can imitate me.</v>

695
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 4>My weight with a kick like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can kick and then I said,</v>

696
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.020
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I show clothesline.</v>

697
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.540
<v Speaker 4>Is she the back folding or out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My whole arm is the courageous thing.</v>

698
00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 4>You can blog with ting had tried to</v>
<v Speaker 4>block whatever you want.</v>

699
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 4>If I close line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to stand still.</v>

700
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 4>It goes straight through everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you and knock you out.</v>

701
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it clothes on so power?</v>

702
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 4>It is so powerful because you can really</v>
<v Speaker 4>lock it up.</v>

703
00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Don't stretch your arm because if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>miss time and you hit your,</v>

704
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 4>you're going to hyperextend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can drag your whole body weight</v>

705
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:29.720
<v Speaker 4>in there because you will like it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>your legs are planted on the ground.</v>

706
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're getting all that hip torquing.</v>

707
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 4>It is such a powerful strike and also</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the clench when even when they</v>

708
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 4>stand like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I do this,</v>

709
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.730
<v Speaker 4>it loops around to defense and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mecca to had still the legal part</v>

710
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 4>because it's outside the mohawk.</v>

711
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in the back of the head.</v>

712
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Standing never seems to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in boxing they get penalized for</v>

713
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 4>punching the back of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People say no rabbit punches,</v>

714
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:54.940
<v Speaker 4>but when you think About a head kick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of headaches,</v>

715
00:30:54.941 --> 00:30:57.060
<v Speaker 4>especially ones that go over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulder there,</v>

716
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 4>there the back of the head and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's legal and that's why they're</v>

717
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 4>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why it was so effective with</v>

718
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Speaker 4>me with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

719
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:04.720
<v Speaker 4>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with pancreaS.</v>

720
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I hid behind the ear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at mike dyson's fights,</v>

721
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how he did it,</v>

722
00:31:09.431 --> 00:31:11.530
<v Speaker 4>but he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was always the shorter guy.</v>

723
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 4>But if you see him hooking somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hits almost the back of their head.</v>

724
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.020
<v Speaker 4>He's got very short hooks now the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ready for impact from the front,</v>

725
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.400
<v Speaker 4>from the side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're used to it.</v>

726
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could see the punch coming,</v>

727
00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.480
<v Speaker 4>the behind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always tell people just do with a</v>

728
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:27.910
<v Speaker 4>poem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just do this to the back of your head</v>

729
00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:29.830
<v Speaker 4>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like just me doing this,</v>

730
00:31:29.831 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 4>it's all ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not ready for that.</v>

731
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:37.530
<v Speaker 4>So you can already imagine if you go hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>as hard as you can be here.</v>

732
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 4>It's a sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a sweet bunch.</v>

733
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 4>I can understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's doing it.</v>

734
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the head that much more</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

735
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do this,</v>

736
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.861
<v Speaker 4>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

737
00:31:46.861 --> 00:31:49.930
<v Speaker 4>is it that much more data than just</v>
<v Speaker 4>behind it?</v>

738
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.130
<v Speaker 4>Here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just do that.</v>

739
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

740
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 4>remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

741
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 4>when the hens old fart and world combat</v>
<v Speaker 4>against that judo guy.</v>

742
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget the dutch guy.</v>

743
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got his back and spikers spike as</v>

744
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:11.210
<v Speaker 4>best baker by trade with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also got his back and just bet if they,</v>

745
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.210
<v Speaker 4>if you can elbow the back of the head</v>
<v Speaker 4>rear naked,</v>

746
00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:17.590
<v Speaker 4>choke her out the window,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just going to bang bang to the</v>

747
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:19.780
<v Speaker 4>back of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's almost more effective than a</v>

748
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:22.690
<v Speaker 4>rear naked choke because kaiser just</v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna they're just gonna try to cover</v>

749
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:23.321
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

750
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:24.750
<v Speaker 4>And eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

751
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.930
<v Speaker 4>slIp through that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting to me that there's some</v>

752
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.560
<v Speaker 4>really effective martial arts techniques</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are outlawed and that's one of</v>

753
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't hit that spot.</v>

754
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.570
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

755
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of strange because In a self</v>
<v Speaker 4>defense situation or an actual martial</v>

756
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 4>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if</v>

757
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 3>you think about what is the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>effective technique to use,</v>

758
00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 3>knees the ground are very effective to</v>
<v Speaker 3>head on a down opponent.</v>

759
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 3>Elbows to the back of the head are very</v>
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>

760
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 3>But are they that much more dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>much?</v>

761
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Should they be outlawed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

762
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 3>here's the video.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but he choked him anyway,</v>

767
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:00.600

809
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 3>they stopped us trouble and he looks at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys and the guys go,</v>

810
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:48.941
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

811
00:34:48.941 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

812
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

813
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.050
<v Speaker 3>you just picked the wrong guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told them they fuck you.</v>

814
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

815
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

816
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:58.590
<v Speaker 3>he looks so friendly and nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

817
00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

818
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.240
<v Speaker 3>when he's got his game face on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks like a killer,</v>

819
00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:03.950
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hence off smiling.</v>

820
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.070
<v Speaker 3>He's like one of those smileys happiest</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys you're ever going to run into.</v>

821
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.420
<v Speaker 3>And they look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're big smile.</v>

822
00:35:09.421 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

823
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Is that an ifl ifl ring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

824
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.710
<v Speaker 3>this is the paperweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is another really big one,</v>

825
00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:19.910
<v Speaker 3>is a paperweight that they gave to us</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the hens or couldn't be a nicer guy,</v>

826
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be a nicer guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so nice to see how well he's</v>

827
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:26.540
<v Speaker 3>done with his school too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has one of the biggest jujitsu</v>

828
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:27.850
<v Speaker 3>schools in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

829
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in manhattan where it's so hard to be</v>

830
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:33.020
<v Speaker 3>successful because it's so expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real estate.</v>

831
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I think the ifl had a big part in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they did a thing on 20 slash 20</v>

832
00:35:37.141 --> 00:35:39.630
<v Speaker 3>for him and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or 15 minutes,</v>

833
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:40.810
<v Speaker 3>one of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

834
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 3>and after that it just exploded because</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get into the world of enzo,</v>

835
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.730
<v Speaker 3>you know about what kind of person he</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

836
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone likes him,</v>

837
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even even the guys like him.</v>

838
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.260
<v Speaker 3>so to people at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they saw that guy and then they saw the</v>

839
00:35:53.261 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 3>technique and uh,</v>

845
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:06.660

<v Speaker 3>of the gracies and being one of the most</v>

850
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.770
<v Speaker 3>famous jujitsu practitioners ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also on top of that,</v>

851
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 3>it's the product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the results that they've gotten in</v>

852
00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>teaching there,</v>

855
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 3>which is a very important thing because</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time guys who are really</v>

856
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to control it too much,</v>

857
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it goes down.</v>

858
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Like he did a great job just gettiNg the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right guys for the job.</v>

859
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.340
<v Speaker 3>What's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see extreme loyalty from the people</v>

860
00:36:44.341 --> 00:36:46.590
<v Speaker 3>that train there because they love hanzo</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>

861
00:36:46.591 --> 00:36:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like a real bond with</v>
<v Speaker 3>henzel gracie.</v>

862
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Of course you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt serra who came from that lineage</v>

863
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:55.290
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of his guys as well just can't say</v>

864
00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 3>enough good things about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>

865
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.670
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the one that's the first time</v>

866
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:06.710
<v Speaker 3>looking for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a model</v>

867
00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.010
<v Speaker 3>and then it gets old comfortable sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a certain way.</v>

868
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a show called looking for a</v>

869
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:18.270
<v Speaker 3>fight and it's dana white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>matt,</v>

870
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:22.110
<v Speaker 3>sarah and nick the tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they do is they go to small mma</v>

871
00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:27.111
<v Speaker 3>shows all over the world and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see fights and find talent and</v>

872
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:31.230
<v Speaker 3>that's where they find that kid go sage</v>
<v Speaker 3>northcutt as well.</v>

873
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.100
<v Speaker 3>And then the guy who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who they were setting up to fight bunk.</v>

874
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cm punk,</v>

875
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.410
<v Speaker 3>which is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going to happen with</v>

876
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand this whole thing.</v>

877
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 3>She got a lot of injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

878
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 3>I also think it's ridiculous for him to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight in the ufc.</v>

879
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.320
<v Speaker 3>I think he should fight in a small</v>
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>

880
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.530
<v Speaker 3>Take a fight in a small organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>build yourself up.</v>

881
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I have always said that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>should have happened with brock lesnar.</v>

882
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at brock lesnar as an</v>

883
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:57.180
<v Speaker 3>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always said if you took brock lesnar</v>

884
00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.230
<v Speaker 3>and got him to a guy like matt hume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or for us a hobby and said,</v>

885
00:38:01.231 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make this guy a chance.</v>

886
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with a freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unreal.</v>

887
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Just train them correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Building them up,</v>

888
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 3>building them up slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get them through the right.</v>

889
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.340
<v Speaker 3>But he wanted to fight right away in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ufc one fighting k one right to the ufc</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and then right to the ufc.</v>

892
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.283
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a shame,</v>

893
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

894
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.450

<v Speaker 3>a baby has got to be a lot of people.</v>

898
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.070
<v Speaker 3>He's going to have a gun into bayview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

899
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.870

<v Speaker 3>It's always short.</v>

900
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Like the money later in your career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your greg,</v>

901
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:36.040

908
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:50.020

913
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just wasn't ready for guys like cain</v>

914
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.910
<v Speaker 4>or especially allister.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

915
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a bad foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

916
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 4>if he could have taken it to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have been different against</v>

917
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 4>goto or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the first time that I thought,</v>

918
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully now more people start doing</v>

919
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was that crazy punch.</v>

920
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 4>And wiTh him it was because she was not</v>
<v Speaker 4>super technically yet striking,</v>

921
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 4>but he hit an overhead and it hit with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this part of the hand with the fist,</v>

922
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.040
<v Speaker 4>the back of the head down.</v>

923
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.220
<v Speaker 4>Then with junior dos santos knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 4>cain velasquez like that.</v>

924
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:31.054
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

925
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.400
<v Speaker 4>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People finding out they start getting it</v>

926
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 4>to it and then the laskers did the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to junior coming back,</v>

927
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:38.780
<v Speaker 4>so I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

928
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 4>they looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now we're going to see this more</v>

929
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:43.750
<v Speaker 4>often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was pretty much it.</v>

930
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:47.460
<v Speaker 4>You see it here and there one time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a real overhead or data</v>

931
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 4>throw real over and not with the site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then hits the back of the head again.</v>

932
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 4>What we just talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You almost like a ridge hands try.</v>

933
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.200
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like a richard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

934
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Well you remember when chocolate</v>
<v Speaker 4>delicioso throw that you got to</v>

935
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.520
<v Speaker 4>chocolate liddell's sweatshirt on those</v>
<v Speaker 4>new routes of fight ones,</v>

936
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:01.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

937
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:06.110
<v Speaker 4>Had a boss one t shirt at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh you guys got one chocolate deli said</v>

938
00:40:06.141 --> 00:40:08.560
<v Speaker 4>throw it like over the top of his head.</v>

939
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Like he would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would throw this crazy one and that's</v>

940
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 4>how he hit allister when they find him</v>
<v Speaker 4>pride,</v>

941
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.380
<v Speaker 4>he threw it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not a.</v>

942
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Not circular at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

943
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 4>like a 12 slash six punch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

944
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:22.360
<v Speaker 4>It's a complete different punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I tell people.</v>

945
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do I say,</v>

946
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:29.370
<v Speaker 4>I've always really liked the technique</v>
<v Speaker 4>from chuck is he's also wide open.</v>

947
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.320
<v Speaker 4>A bitch gives them almost power equal</v>
<v Speaker 4>left or right,</v>

948
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:36.430
<v Speaker 4>so just like the and just I like to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight like that as well and he can hit</v>

949
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:38.830
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really hot and he's not afraid about</v>

950
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.720
<v Speaker 4>opening up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes though with him,</v>

951
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he gets too excited instead of</v>

952
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:46.660
<v Speaker 4>stepping back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes in for the kill and that got him</v>

953
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:49.720
<v Speaker 4>in trouble later in his career because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you would simply step back and come</v>

954
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's why every person,</v>

955
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 4>every guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

956
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:56.480
<v Speaker 4>everybody likes chocolate l you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at chocolate day,</v>

957
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.801
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

958
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 4>he lost a couple of times by knockout.</v>

959
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.410
<v Speaker 4>Nobody will say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did not lose one fan because he's</v>

960
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 4>always there to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I really liked chuck.</v>

961
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had one of the most exciting</v>

962
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:12.750
<v Speaker 4>attitudes ever in fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was always do or die and early in his</v>

963
00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:16.540
<v Speaker 4>career he had an incredible chin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chin was just iron.</v>

964
00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 4>You ever see the palae fight when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>fought and valley tudo in Brazil?</v>

965
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

966
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.200
<v Speaker 4>I heard about it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy,</v>

967
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 4>crazy fighting that that was a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they had a net under the bottom</v>

968
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:28.750
<v Speaker 4>rope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fought in a ring,</v>

969
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.980
<v Speaker 4>but it was modified for valley tuto</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the bottom rope from the bottom,</v>

970
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>the to the floor</v>

971
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 1>of the ring was a net going get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trapped,</v>

972
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.900
<v Speaker 1>bare knuckle and chuck's got hIm trapped</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and just beating the fuck out</v>

973
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:43.880

<v Speaker 1>like smushed up there.</v>

974
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 1>And this was back when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 1>chuck was known for his striking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a very good wrestler.</v>

976
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that.</v>

977
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I stopped everything though,</v>

978
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that,</v>

979
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who,</v>

980
00:41:55.821 --> 00:41:57.830

<v Speaker 1>was the matchmaker for the ufc already.</v>

981
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 1>John perretti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John perretti told chuck right before he</v>

982
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:02.990
<v Speaker 1>fought his first fight in the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

983
00:42:02.991 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 1>if you take this guy down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never fight for us again.</v>

984
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like somebody said it to chuck</v>

985
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 1>right before he fought and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want them to try to wrestle.</v>

986
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Fuck his way.</v>

1027
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:43.030
<v Speaker 5>suit so they thought I was messing with</v>

<v Speaker 1>a lot of what you were doing,</v>

1039
00:44:10.141 --> 00:44:11.790
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if I was working for</v>

1040
00:44:11.791 --> 00:44:15.240
<v Speaker 1>the ufc back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guys from jujitsu we would all get</v>

1041
00:44:15.241 --> 00:44:17.490
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd either go over my friend john's</v>

1042
00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:20.760
<v Speaker 1>house where we go over my house and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get together with a bunch of guys and we</v>

1043
00:44:20.761 --> 00:44:23.700
<v Speaker 1>would watch pride and ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were the days.</v>

1044
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.650
<v Speaker 1>So were the days because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the early days of mma and you</v>

1045
00:44:28.651 --> 00:44:30.780
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had had in the nineties you'd have</v>

1046
00:44:30.781 --> 00:44:33.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was kind of struggling at the time</v>

1047
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 1>because they were kicked off a cable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way you could get it was on</v>

1048
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:39.420
<v Speaker 1>direct tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is presumed Was before zoo</v>

1049
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's like right up around the time</v>

1050
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 1>where pride started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take off with a first hixon fight in a</v>

1051
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 1>lot of people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hixon started off pride.</v>

1052
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hickson was in pride month.</v>

1053
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.713
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Takota.</v>

1054
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the first fight.</v>

1055
00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 5>A second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robert put them on a map by beating the</v>

1056
00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:57.420
<v Speaker 5>gracious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when it became big.</v>

1058
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:01.050
<v Speaker 5>That's why I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1059
00:45:01.051 --> 00:45:05.850
<v Speaker 5>for reason for that is rising that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>need.</v>

1060
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 5>They need a sacral rob.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like.</v>

1061
00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:08.990
<v Speaker 5>I didn't need a japanese guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1062
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:13.200
<v Speaker 5>they could do a few shows like this with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fade or an ankle and vandelay silva</v>

1063
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 5>coming back and they can do a few shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but eventually people want to root for</v>

1064
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:17.210
<v Speaker 5>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1065
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 5>they needed the japanese guy like South</v>
<v Speaker 5>Africa.</v>

1066
00:45:19.471 --> 00:45:21.890
<v Speaker 5>You remember in k one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was getting very.</v>

1067

<v Speaker 5>but that was before all the foreigners</v>

1075
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.160
<v Speaker 5>We had four guys from Thailand who were</v>
<v Speaker 5>there and they were fighting old guys</v>

1076
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:49.170

1084
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:09.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1085
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the top holland guys when right around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time where ramon dekkers started</v>

1086
00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:19.960
<v Speaker 1>dominating and rob came and started</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominating so much talent came out of</v>

1087
00:46:19.961 --> 00:46:24.961
<v Speaker 1>holland in holland is a small country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the size of holland,</v>

1088
00:46:25.091 --> 00:46:27.970
<v Speaker 1>do you look at the amount of high level</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick boxers that have come out of there?</v>

1089
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.470
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty incredible.</v>

1090
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.560
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you did the k one for instance.</v>

1091
00:46:32.561 --> 00:46:35.440
<v Speaker 5>They at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the final eight,</v>

1092
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.680
<v Speaker 5>they fight all year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make a final tournament for the</v>

1093
00:46:38.681 --> 00:46:42.170
<v Speaker 5>people who don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fight 10 times a year or 10 shows</v>

1094
00:46:42.171 --> 00:46:44.770
<v Speaker 5>year and then in decemBer does the final</v>
<v Speaker 5>aid,</v>

1095
00:46:44.771 --> 00:46:48.430
<v Speaker 5>like the ufc started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight fighters the best from the whole</v>

1096
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.550
<v Speaker 5>year compete against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoever wins gets like 40 to $50,000,</v>

1097
00:46:51.551 --> 00:46:54.880
<v Speaker 5>whatever the price money is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they start realizing that the final</v>

1098
00:46:54.881 --> 00:46:57.670
<v Speaker 5>aids were six were dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven words show now,</v>

1099
00:46:57.671 --> 00:46:58.660
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

1100
00:46:58.661 --> 00:47:03.180
<v Speaker 5>in a guy who was born in Morocco but</v>
<v Speaker 5>lives in holland or even when you were</v>

1101
00:47:03.181 --> 00:47:05.360
<v Speaker 5>born in a moroccan parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1102
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.610
<v Speaker 5>suddenly you come up with the moroccan</v>
<v Speaker 5>flag because they say we can have the</v>

1103
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.540
<v Speaker 5>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roman vegas.</v>

1104
00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:16.930
<v Speaker 5>The first guy I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first time I saw him fight,</v>

1105
00:47:16.931 --> 00:47:19.330
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't the same cart I was fighting as</v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

1106
00:47:19.331 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 5>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is long time ago.</v>

1107
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:22.350
<v Speaker 5>This was just see class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1108
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.910
<v Speaker 5>in holland you have new c class b class</v>
<v Speaker 5>a class.</v>

1109
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.310
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I just started.</v>

1110
00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 5>So I probably was new and fought c class</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1111
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.300
<v Speaker 4>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a friend of mine calls me,</v>

1112
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:32.970
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to watch.</v>

1113
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:33.251
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1114
00:47:33.251 --> 00:47:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I got to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a warm up.</v>

1115
00:47:34.341 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to watch this?</v>

1116
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 4>Get was just get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I see him and he's with the little</v>

1117
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 4>mullet and he is skinny and he fights</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy who was much older than he was</v>

1118
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 4>like 16,</v>
<v Speaker 4>17 years old,</v>

1119
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 4>an older guy with tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So automatically you go,</v>

1120
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my buddy goes,</v>

1121
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 4>just wait til he starts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1122
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 4>And the first gig I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still remember he kicked a guy,</v>

1123
00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 4>a low kick and the guy horizontal right</v>
<v Speaker 4>horizontal and fell on the ground.</v>

1124
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at my buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go as the craziest power I've ever</v>

1125
00:48:03.941 --> 00:48:06.550
<v Speaker 4>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so explosive and he was so skinny</v>

1126
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.010
<v Speaker 4>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but his technique was perfect.</v>

1127
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.800
<v Speaker 4>His technique was perfect and he was so</v>
<v Speaker 4>ferocious.</v>

1128
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he didn't care.</v>

1129
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 4>Like when towards the end his ankles</v>
<v Speaker 4>were so fucked up that he wanted to</v>

1130
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 4>fight southpaw because he started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to throw the right kick,</v>

1131
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Speaker 4>but he would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would kick a few times and we'd go</v>

1132
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:25.690
<v Speaker 4>fuck it and go right back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with his bad leg,</v>

1133
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:26.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean they were telling him like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1134
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.850
<v Speaker 4>we're close to amputating your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've broken your foot so many times.</v>

1135
00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:32.390
<v Speaker 4>You broken your shin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1136
00:48:32.391 --> 00:48:36.140
<v Speaker 4>your whole leg is just a series of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he would wrap it up tight and just</v>

1137
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:39.610
<v Speaker 4>still wants to fight started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't give a fuck and just throw it</v>

1138
00:48:39.611 --> 00:48:41.800
<v Speaker 4>right into elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd kick everything.</v>

1139
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Our motto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suck it.</v>

1140
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.160
<v Speaker 4>He would just place it back in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>corner and the core hammers his trainer.</v>

1141
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 4>He told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never heard him complain.</v>

1142
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 4>Like he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1143
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:55.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hurt my ankle or I hurt my hand.</v>

1144
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had never heard him say anything.</v>

1145
00:48:57.911 --> 00:49:00.070
<v Speaker 4>when he comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

1146
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting my shoulder,</v>

1147
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 4>but I can put this under the socket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like it wasn't his body.</v>

1148
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was using a borrowed body.</v>

1149
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Crazy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1150
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:11.224
<v Speaker 4>Super good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1151
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.320

<v Speaker 4>kevin randleman freak of nature.</v>

1152
00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could have done any,</v>

1153
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.830
<v Speaker 4>any sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1154
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.170
<v Speaker 4>guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where ramon dekkers too and</v>

1155
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 4>happy they found finding though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1156
00:49:22.451 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 4>well ramon dekkers really set the</v>
<v Speaker 4>standard.</v>

1157
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:28.720
<v Speaker 4>He really set the standard for ferocity</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he sort of embodied that holland</v>

1158
00:49:28.721 --> 00:49:31.450
<v Speaker 4>style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dutch style of more tie where they</v>

1159
00:49:31.451 --> 00:49:34.600
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was just a crusher crusher.</v>

1160
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like a rob came and all these</v>

1161
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:38.020
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start what they did,</v>

1162
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:41.020
<v Speaker 4>what they lit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason was they started winning</v>

1163
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 4>fights in Thailand was because they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>better hands tied to hence and the kicks</v>

1164
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 4>together and they didn't do that in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thailand yet.</v>

1165
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Predominantly only kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking in a lot of clenching.</v>

1166
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:56.430
<v Speaker 4>And then you had like a rob rob came on</v>
<v Speaker 4>or what is the greatest kick boxers</v>

1167
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:57.430
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1168
00:49:57.431 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 4>and then you suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the technical version.</v>

1169
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:04.600
<v Speaker 4>The more smooth one probably he had the</v>
<v Speaker 4>slow twitch fibers,</v>

1170
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:05.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he,</v>

1171
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.830
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knock you out with every punch.</v>

1172
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:13.600
<v Speaker 4>but then you had ramon dekkers was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>explosive guy that he had that technique</v>

1173
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.480
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he added the explosiveness to.</v>

1174
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 4>It's pricelessness too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's just crazy power.</v>

1175
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he fights bomb the first time,</v>

1176
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he hits him with 26 punchy,</v>

1177
00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 4>you gotta to see the shots that he was</v>

1178
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 3>never a 200 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never been knocked out in his life.</v>

1179
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.180
<v Speaker 3>He was the first guy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just see after the five wendy's</v>

1180
00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole place is quiet.</v>

1181
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Nobody moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then rob cameron jumps in the ring</v>

1182
00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:43.560
<v Speaker 3>with the dutch flag</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>on luck.</v>

1185
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.500
<v Speaker 3>Some toy tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1190
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:03.770

<v Speaker 3>The amount of adverbs and adjectives</v>

1191

<v Speaker 3>they have in their fucking like</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1192
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:09.893
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1194
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:14.990
<v Speaker 3>the amount of consonance all just lumped</v>
<v Speaker 3>in together and all these crazy names</v>

1195
00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.520
<v Speaker 3>period is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1196
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 3>but just to see What kind of barriers</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hook,</v>

1197
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:24.490
<v Speaker 3>the kick bond.</v>

1198
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leave that left hook,</v>

1199
00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:27.270
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What rob came in.</v>

1200
00:51:27.271 --> 00:51:28.770
<v Speaker 3>The difference between rob came in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

1201
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>

1202
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Rob came and was just more technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't take as many chances.</v>

1203
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.140
<v Speaker 3>You didn't get hit as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very smart and very technical</v>

1204
00:51:36.141 --> 00:51:38.970
<v Speaker 3>when he fought and he's a great trainer</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know.</v>

1205
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Rob cayman was really one of the guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was responsible for brandon vera</v>

1206
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.680
<v Speaker 3>early in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when brandon vera was knocking</v>

1207
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:47.960
<v Speaker 3>everybody dead in the ufc early in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>

1208
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.150
<v Speaker 3>he was training with rob came in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he stopped training with rob came</v>

1209
00:51:51.151 --> 00:51:53.930
<v Speaker 3>in is when things started lIke not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>so well For them.</v>

1210
00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is caLled bond.</v>

1211
00:51:56.391 --> 00:52:00.440
<v Speaker 3>This is a slow motion dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They show cobana no knocking people out</v>

1212
00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I think so they know who co bonus and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they called them the buffalo hat.</v>

1213
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.090
<v Speaker 3>That was his nickname because he never</v>
<v Speaker 3>went down while he had a giant head.</v>

1214
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.580
<v Speaker 3>And then this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if they can show.</v>

1215
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:15.610
<v Speaker 3>So go slow motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that says slowmo honestly,</v>

1216
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.570
<v Speaker 3>that there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're actually fighting.</v>

1217
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.800
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be so crazy the way he</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives him the extra punch lights,</v>

1218
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.310
<v Speaker 3>an event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see it.</v>

1219
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.420
<v Speaker 3>So ramon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most of the time,</v>

1220
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:31.460
<v Speaker 3>fought south paws that what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1221
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:36.350
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get the docs don't fault both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of the time when he fights</v>

1222
00:52:36.351 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 3>different is because he hAs an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said.</v>

1223
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is lawrence skin,</v>

1224
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.120
<v Speaker 3>a kenshin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1225

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1226
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:47.720
<v Speaker 3>like analyst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a fantastic job of breaking down</v>

1227
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>HiS fight breakdowns are amazing,</v>

1228
00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:53.240
<v Speaker 3>but he does a lot of it in slow motion</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show technique.</v>

1229
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.120
<v Speaker 3>So see if he could find just the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight instead of that video because when</v>

1230
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:59.670
<v Speaker 3>you should definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a fan of striking and you want</v>

1231
00:52:59.671 --> 00:53:02.220
<v Speaker 3>to understand it a little bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit better watch lawrence and</v>

1232
00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:02.780
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1233
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.411
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

1237
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Lawrence is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does such a great job of breaking</v>

1238
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:14.870
<v Speaker 3>down fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His videos are incredible.</v>

1239
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really deserves a lot of credit for</v>

1240
00:53:18.471 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love watching his breakdowns,</v>

1241
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.000
<v Speaker 3>especially tie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves it.</v>

1242
00:53:22.001 --> 00:53:25.530
<v Speaker 3>A lot of moitai moitai breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the actual fight itself,</v>

1243
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the,</v>

1244
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:32.330
<v Speaker 3>these are like in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like unprecedented times because that</v>

1245
00:53:32.331 --> 00:53:37.331
<v Speaker 3>ties back in those days we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were used to karate and we were used</v>

1246
00:53:38.611 --> 00:53:41.170
<v Speaker 3>to a pka kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1247
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 3>10 gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wok to the.</v>

1248
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:47.280
<v Speaker 3>At first I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when westerners started going</v>

1249
00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 3>over to Thailand and competing as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ties,</v>

1250
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 3>we've started seeing what high level</v>
<v Speaker 3>more time they had and they're kicking</v>

1251
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially the low kicks was just</v>

1252
00:53:56.761 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 3>devastating.</v>

1253
00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 3>That was the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1254
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the american championship when they</v>

1255
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they lost it was low kicks,</v>

1256
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.180
<v Speaker 3>gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're making sure weren't ready for</v>

1257
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 3>rufus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went and fought.</v>

1258
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:08.490
<v Speaker 3>And it's kind of funny because duke</v>
<v Speaker 3>roufus talks about,</v>

1259
00:54:08.491 --> 00:54:11.140
<v Speaker 3>he kind of laughs about it now that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were saying when,</v>

1260
00:54:11.141 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 3>when his brother got fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who his brother fought,</v>

1261
00:54:14.131 --> 00:54:16.230
<v Speaker 3>but he got lit up with leg kicks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped.</v>

1262
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:17.810
<v Speaker 3>And duke was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1263
00:54:17.811 --> 00:54:20.070
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of techniques of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1264
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's much doesn't take</v>
<v Speaker 3>much talent,</v>

1265

<v Speaker 3>many as he took clean to the face and</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he died young as well.</v>

1292
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A heart attack while he was riding his</v>

1293
00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:51.691
<v Speaker 3>bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His bike.</v>

1294
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>

1295
00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Do they know what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1296
00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.590
<v Speaker 3>the first started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it fell,</v>

1297
00:55:55.591 --> 00:55:56.790
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just hard.</v>

1298
00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:59.150
<v Speaker 3>And he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we all been crazy every week.</v>

1299
00:55:59.151 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 3>We all liked going push,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing limits,</v>

1300
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were drinking with everything in it,</v>

1301
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 3>but he was stoli like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing was started cycling and I knew,</v>

1302
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once he starts showing and he loved</v>

1303
00:56:09.511 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 3>cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm was going to go 50 miles an hour.</v>

1304
00:56:12.961 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I know he's going to because that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he is.</v>

1305
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:18.930
<v Speaker 3>He can't stop being the best at</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything he does.</v>

1306
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 3>So I thought it wasn't just riding his</v>
<v Speaker 3>bike,</v>

1307
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 3>be going crazy with wisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1308
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 3>that's his attitude was pushing animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>such an animal.</v>

1309
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 3>He probably pushed himself to his heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>broke.</v>

1310
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Speaker 3>And also when you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1311
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 3>all the elder punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got into tae with all the cuts on his</v>

1312
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 3>forehead</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks really bad.</v>

1313
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:39.720
<v Speaker 3>So when you're looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

1314
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.580
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1315
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want that.</v>

1316
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when he fought duane ludwig</v>

1317
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.710
<v Speaker 3>towards the end of his career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean deep into.</v>

1318
00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean his face was flattened out is</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive scar tissue all over his eyes.</v>

1319
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:54.200
<v Speaker 3>His nose was flattened out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he took a lot of fun.</v>

1320
00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody's face changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than vandalized though,</v>

1321
00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:01.130
<v Speaker 3>that his face got flattened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1322
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:03.640
<v Speaker 3>you look at vandelay during the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>valley,</v>

1323
00:57:03.641 --> 00:57:06.330
<v Speaker 3>tudo days and then vandelay towards the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end and pride.</v>

1324
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean it changed his face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't they do surgery?</v>

1325
00:57:09.461 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 3>But the post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nick diaz did,</v>

1326
00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:13.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a flutter in the ufc.</v>

1327
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.600
<v Speaker 3>They did not only did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took cartilage out of his rib and</v>

1328
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:18.580
<v Speaker 3>reconstructed his nose and vandal.</v>

1329
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.280
<v Speaker 3>He had his nose made big so that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>could get more.</v>

1330
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Aaron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked crazy because his nose looks</v>

1331
00:57:24.791 --> 00:57:26.620
<v Speaker 3>very different than it used to look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1332
00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time I saw him was</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the way.</v>

1333
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:33.010
<v Speaker 3>He was like for the weigh ins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't fighting.</v>

1334
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 3>He was with someone else and he came up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stage and I didn't know who the fuck</v>

1335
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:39.280
<v Speaker 3>it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>scary and someone said,</v>

1336
00:57:39.281 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 3>that's vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>

1337
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.560
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1338
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Because he had just gotten the surgery</v>
<v Speaker 3>so his face was pulled tight.</v>

1339
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:49.780
<v Speaker 3>His eyebrows were pulled tight and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose was big.</v>

1340
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:54.130
<v Speaker 3>It was like he had his nose made much</v>
<v Speaker 3>larger with a big piece of cartilage so</v>

1341
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:57.280
<v Speaker 3>that they can take punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1342
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:01.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the same at the stupid air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know those golden flowers.</v>

1343
00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I sucked them out three times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to step through it and you</v>

1344
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:10.150
<v Speaker 3>didn't need a big syringe and a large</v>
<v Speaker 3>needle because I do not want to have</v>

1345
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.230
<v Speaker 3>those areas and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no.</v>

1346
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.910
<v Speaker 3>The considerate trophies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1347
00:58:12.911 --> 00:58:14.050
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>

1348
00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always worry your guards.</v>

1349
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:19.960
<v Speaker 3>I have a little tiny pieces of it here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they always wore at your garden.</v>

1350
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just not smart.</v>

1351
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:23.890
<v Speaker 3>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It affects your hearing,</v>

1352
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.080
<v Speaker 3>like it looks cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it affects the way,</v>

1353
00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 3>the reason that is designed that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the sound echoes off the outside of</v>

1354
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 3>the year and you could hear better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you take your ear like folks who</v>

1355
00:58:33.311 --> 00:58:34.990
<v Speaker 3>don't have cauliflower ear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take your ear,</v>

1356
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.390
<v Speaker 3>go over the top of your ear and bend it</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1357
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:40.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what those guys are hearing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1358
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.430
<v Speaker 3>Like randy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>randy can't even use iphone earpods.</v>

1359
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1360
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.823
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1361
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.640
<v Speaker 3>they can put them in things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1362
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:51.170
<v Speaker 3>walk around with a bluetooth and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you listen to.</v>

1363
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not even an air will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Randy told me to his,</v>

1364
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 3>you know what happens with what it is is</v>
<v Speaker 3>calcification.</v>

1365
00:58:58.661 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 3>So when your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brakes and bleeds,</v>

1366
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 3>if you don't drain it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually turns the calcium.</v>

1367
00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Turns out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a bone.</v>

1368
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 3>So what randy would do is get on top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys and grind his ear into their</v>

1369
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Speaker 3>eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would get his ear like when he's</v>

1370
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:14.370
<v Speaker 3>taking guys down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was shoved his ear.</v>

1371
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he had a rock.</v>

1372
00:59:15.431 --> 00:59:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Something very wrong with this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at.</v>

1373
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:20.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1374
00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:25.430
<v Speaker 3>and just to let people know at home it</v>
<v Speaker 3>really tiny surgery can fix this right</v>

1375
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:26.264
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1376
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 3>they can fix this in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1377

<v Speaker 3>in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1378
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 3>One of eddie bravo's black belts.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because that.</v>

1461
01:02:47.451 --> 01:02:50.100
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a personality I think.</v>

1462
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to make it.</v>

1463
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good data.</v>

1464
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Also an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1465
01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 3>they fought and it was a split decision</v>
<v Speaker 3>very close right away.</v>

1466
01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.830
<v Speaker 3>The codella luke's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1467
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Her body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1468
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Like in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also like a machine.</v>

1469
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Very good moitai too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really good ground game.</v>

1470
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>

1471
01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:12.540
<v Speaker 3>what is she gonna be able to get it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground because joanna hurt her in</v>

1472
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 3>the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked her down and won that round.</v>

1473
01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>claudIa,</v>

1474
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 3>I might've won the second and third.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a very close fight,</v>

1475
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 3>very close fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very controversial and very tightly</v>

1476
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:27.210
<v Speaker 3>disputed fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the rematch can be very</v>

1477
01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:28.920
<v Speaker 3>exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to that.</v>

1478
01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Who said chika work with for wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

1479
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.540
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who her wrestling coaches,</v>

1480
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but I think she does a lot of her work</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Poland,</v>

1481
01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:40.410

<v Speaker 3>because she lives in Poland.</v>

1482
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:43.350

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1495
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:11.790
<v Speaker 3>there's so many really high level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at what's happening now in</v>

1496
01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:16.470
<v Speaker 3>the ufc with all these sambo guYs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These high level grapplers like,</v>

1497
01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:17.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1498
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.300
<v Speaker 3>well first of all you've got a habib,</v>
<v Speaker 3>norma madoff who,</v>

1499
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 3>who's one of the best in the lightweight</v>
<v Speaker 3>division,</v>

1500
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.440
<v Speaker 3>but he's another one that has a hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>time staying healthy,</v>

1501
01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:27.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1502
01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:29.670
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's a training or you think</v>

1503
01:04:29.671 --> 01:04:32.250
<v Speaker 3>it's just the person who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1504
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.510
<v Speaker 3>it could be both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1505
01:04:33.511 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 3>He's such a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the way he fights,</v>

1506
01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:37.570
<v Speaker 3>you got to think he trains that way.</v>

1507
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:40.140
<v Speaker 3>The way he fights it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so grinding.</v>

1508
01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:42.810
<v Speaker 3>He so fucking attacking and relentless</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a badger,</v>

1509
01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:44.670
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who knows?</v>

1510
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1511
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:46.340
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1512
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was guilty of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I trained really hood like,</v>

1513
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 3>but what I hear stories I hear fight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1514
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go like on fridays we spar like 70</v>

1515
01:04:57.061 --> 01:05:00.780
<v Speaker 3>percent and I go in and they said no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1516
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I say that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it for sparring.</v>

1517
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>

1518
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.370
<v Speaker 3>And they always ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1519
01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 3>so how many times she did it after your</v>
<v Speaker 3>workout?</v>

1520
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what we're gonna do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if we're going to try to.</v>

1521
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.030
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to hurt your legs while I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have to fight,</v>

1522
01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 3>I won't be in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will go with kickstarter.</v>

1523
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.440
<v Speaker 4>I expect that most show to go hard with</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and the hats,</v>

1524
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:21.251
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1525
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.480
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We watch out for the head.</v>

1526
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 4>We don't knock each other out too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too much,</v>

1527
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:27.120
<v Speaker 4>too much because it happens as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1528
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 4>It's inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's why.</v>

1529
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:32.800
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't fight for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I did that,</v>

1530
01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:33.431
<v Speaker 4>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

1531
01:05:33.431 --> 01:05:35.830
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt great to share no ring rust.</v>

1532
01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.200
<v Speaker 4>I said no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're doing it two times a day.</v>

1533
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:39.970
<v Speaker 4>We're training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're training,</v>

1534
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you're used to it is the same as</v>

1535
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 4>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they go hard,</v>

1536
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.710
<v Speaker 4>that's a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1537
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.950
<v Speaker 4>Well it's very similar if you train like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1538
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Some people feel like that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas behind hard training is that when</v>

1539
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:55.150
<v Speaker 4>you train hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fight hard and it becomes normal.</v>

1540
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:59.440
<v Speaker 4>But then other people think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you really should just train</v>

1541
01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Speaker 4>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of the ties.</v>

1542
01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 4>Do they train more technical and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>light wIth their sparring.</v>

1543
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 4>The hard work is all pad work in bag</v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

1544
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.660
<v Speaker 4>So there's people that think like that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way to save yourself.</v>

1545
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 4>Wonderboy says that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says he spars very light now because</v>

1546
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.520
<v Speaker 4>he wants to preserve his chin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to preserve hIs head.</v>

1547
01:06:15.521 --> 01:06:16.910
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saves the,</v>

1548
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 4>the hard work for the bag and for</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>

1549
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:22.180
<v Speaker 4>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to in a lot with my buddy amir,</v>

1550
01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:25.570
<v Speaker 4>amir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps the navy seal guy from Israel.</v>

1551
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:27.040
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1552
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:29.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the one guy who could hang with me</v>

1553
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:32.440
<v Speaker 4>and I mean stemming noise because I will</v>
<v Speaker 4>not go my way,</v>

1554
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:35.050
<v Speaker 4>but we will go hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who see us,</v>

1555
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.990
<v Speaker 4>they think without a control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not at all.</v>

1556
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:41.670
<v Speaker 4>So it's also about who you train with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If one day your,</v>

1557
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:46.090
<v Speaker 4>your steady sparring partner is sick and</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else pops up or you don't know</v>

1558
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 4>that guy and that guy tries to make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>name for himself,</v>

1559
01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you get the injuries.</v>

1560
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.170
<v Speaker 4>But I truly believe in going hArd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many times do you see?</v>

1561
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:58.380
<v Speaker 4>It really angers me if I see guys in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>clinch needing other people and they</v>

1562
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:01.900
<v Speaker 4>need them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they need training,</v>

1563
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:06.490
<v Speaker 4>they just lift their legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gives a real neat look at joanna</v>

1564
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 4>when she makes sydney different story or</v>
<v Speaker 4>alister explode in there.</v>

1565
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have a sticker on a nice to the</v>

1566
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.140
<v Speaker 4>thighs and it's not going to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do it like that.</v>

1567
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do one hard one,</v>

1568
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.460
<v Speaker 4>it's worse than a low kick because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't expect it.</v>

1569
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:23.230
<v Speaker 4>The muscles relax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes straight through,</v>

1570
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.770
<v Speaker 4>but nobody doeS it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1571
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:27.340
<v Speaker 4>there's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were talking about it one percent</v>

1572
01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:28.720
<v Speaker 4>of the fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but isn't it though,</v>

1573
01:07:28.721 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 4>like all techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some guys just aren't that good at</v>

1574
01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:33.520
<v Speaker 4>certain techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't have the kind of pop</v>

1575
01:07:33.521 --> 01:07:36.430
<v Speaker 4>like you'll see guys throw kicks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is nothing to them.</v>

1576
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 4>And it's not that they're not trying as</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have the looseness of the</v>

1577
01:07:39.371 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 4>hips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have that sort of snap into</v>

1578
01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:43.840
<v Speaker 4>the keg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no emotional time.</v>

1579
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:45.410
<v Speaker 4>It's just technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he,</v>

1580
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.360
<v Speaker 4>if you train your legs and you put like</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 pound ankle weights and you just</v>

1581
01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:50.980
<v Speaker 4>start throwing knees from zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

1582
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.490
<v Speaker 4>don't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then a bouncing lake,</v>

1583
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit ups,</v>

1584
01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.650
<v Speaker 4>I can do a thousand sit ups as long as I</v>
<v Speaker 4>use momentum to get back up.</v>

1585
01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem with a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1586
01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:04.960
<v Speaker 4>They do the knees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all momentum standstill,</v>

1587
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:07.520
<v Speaker 4>xplode standstill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>explode.</v>

1588
01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:11.460
<v Speaker 4>And a trick also with nis is to move</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hips away from your partner</v>

1589
01:08:11.461 --> 01:08:14.320
<v Speaker 4>statements with a straight punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The longer than he is on its way,</v>

1590
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.850
<v Speaker 4>the more power it's going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these guys,</v>

1591
01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:17.391
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1592
01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:18.680
<v Speaker 4>they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they teach.</v>

1593
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Throw your hips in with the needs of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>body is the dumbest thing to do.</v>

1594
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like me giving you a straight punch</v>
<v Speaker 4>and closing the distance.</v>

1595
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:26.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm jamming myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to do that.</v>

1596
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:28.370
<v Speaker 4>Free it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>let the hip flexor do the work.</v>

1597
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.440
<v Speaker 4>And at the moment you connect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1598
01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:32.230
<v Speaker 4>that's when you want to push your weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1599
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of guys don't do it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just need like they do in training.</v>

1600
01:08:36.861 --> 01:08:39.660
<v Speaker 4>Inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you get frustrated when.</v>

1601
01:08:39.661 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously there's some very high</v>
<v Speaker 4>level training going on an mma,</v>

1602
01:08:43.071 --> 01:08:45.500
<v Speaker 4>some very high level training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also some training where you</v>

1603
01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:48.140
<v Speaker 4>see these guys like they're just not</v>
<v Speaker 4>really prepared correctly.</v>

1604
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.750
<v Speaker 4>Well if kicking inTo bowls and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside low kick a night,</v>

1605
01:08:52.751 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 4>90 percent of when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just because the guy doesn't know</v>

1606
01:08:55.161 --> 01:08:57.950
<v Speaker 4>how to get because he's kicking me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking up his right foot.</v>

1607

1609
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.720

<v Speaker 4>letter,</v>

1610
01:09:04.721 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 4>toes point to the side,</v>

<v Speaker 4>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will never have that problem.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was just unloading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everYthing is left,</v>

1638
01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:16.971
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

1639
01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:17.301
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

1640
01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:17.661
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1641
01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:19.700

<v Speaker 4>Double left.</v>

1644
01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:28.520
<v Speaker 4>You mix that into a pattern because if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you throw a boxer in the corner and you</v>

1645
01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:30.200

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you go left,</v>

1650
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.150
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

1651
01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:36.140
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left bubble,</v>

1652
01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 4>and you changed the second punch as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1653
01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.940
<v Speaker 4>like a three shot with a left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you go to the body.</v>

1654
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:43.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep looking in his eyes or a left</v>

1655
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:45.230
<v Speaker 4>uppercut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Change the angle of the punch,</v>

1656
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:48.620
<v Speaker 4>but use the same arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you get really effective and</v>

1657
01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:51.860
<v Speaker 4>you see it as in boxing and thai boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody who does it is really</v>

1658
01:10:51.861 --> 01:10:54.050
<v Speaker 4>effective at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet he didn't do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He fought one mma fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1722
01:13:21.991 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 3>he's just never really trained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grappling.</v>

1723
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:25.460
<v Speaker 3>IT's not really his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1724
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:28.590
<v Speaker 3>put fucking has moitai goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I trained with him.</v>

1725
01:13:28.591 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 3>I got a chance to work out with him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn some techniques from everything he</v>

1726
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:34.460
<v Speaker 3>throws is with power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he throws a leg,</v>

1727
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.310
<v Speaker 3>he pulls the right hand back as he</v>
<v Speaker 3>throws that jab,</v>

1728
01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:40.670
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't just jab like a boxer would</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw,</v>

1729
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.090
<v Speaker 3>jab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he jabs.</v>

1730
01:13:42.091 --> 01:13:45.080
<v Speaker 3>He's like pulling back the right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stepping for got</v>

1731
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 3>everything he throws is designed to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1732
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.820
<v Speaker 2>That's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been my my thing also.</v>

1733
01:13:51.821 --> 01:13:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I like it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything you throw make them.</v>

1734
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.530
<v Speaker 2>When you said in the beginning I kicked</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody and you see their faces and I</v>

1735
01:13:59.531 --> 01:14:02.620
<v Speaker 2>don't care if they block it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jusT kick as hard as I can on the</v>

1736
01:14:02.621 --> 01:14:05.860
<v Speaker 2>defense just to get inside their heads</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they know that you better blog this</v>

1737
01:14:05.861 --> 01:14:08.350
<v Speaker 2>kick because next time if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>blogging it,</v>

1738
01:14:08.351 --> 01:14:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have it's gonna be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1739
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then start breaking your</v>

1740
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.720
<v Speaker 4>opponent down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mentally hit him,</v>

1741
01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.680
<v Speaker 4>hold the hands up high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hit as hard as you can under.</v>

1742
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Hence a lot of guys don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They truly believed that this is enough</v>

1743
01:14:20.621 --> 01:14:22.570
<v Speaker 4>defense for like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a right hook.</v>

1744
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:24.790
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like me putting on a helmet.</v>

1745
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I say this in seminars at seminars to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1746
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:34.380
<v Speaker 4>imagine I would tape a focus mit to my</v>
<v Speaker 4>face and you can give me a straight</v>

1747
01:14:34.691 --> 01:14:37.660
<v Speaker 4>punch or a hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think I go down and everybody goes,</v>

1748
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you're going to go down.</v>

1749
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why is everybody doing this?</v>

1750
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.740
<v Speaker 4>You make yourself one with your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to hit your hands as hard</v>

1751
01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.450
<v Speaker 4>as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will still go down,</v>

1752
01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what happens in the mind of a</v>

1753
01:14:49.211 --> 01:14:51.820
<v Speaker 4>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as I hit you and I see your hand</v>

1754
01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.910
<v Speaker 4>going up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>automatically I let my power off because</v>

1755
01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:55.781
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1756
01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:57.280
<v Speaker 4>it's it's defendant.</v>

1757
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:59.770
<v Speaker 4>What if you just don't care or closed</v>
<v Speaker 4>line?</v>

1758
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 4>And like I said in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll go straight through.</v>

1759
01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you started throwing kicks in the</v>

1760
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:06.360
<v Speaker 4>pancrase days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

1761
01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I came from a kicking</v>

1762
01:15:07.931 --> 01:15:10.480
<v Speaker 4>background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was not that many good kickers in</v>

1763
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:15.180
<v Speaker 4>mma before maury smith for conan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We really didn't see that many head kick</v>

1764
01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:19.960
<v Speaker 4>kaos in mma and especially against a</v>
<v Speaker 4>black belt when maurice fought conan</v>

1765
01:15:19.961 --> 01:15:22.450
<v Speaker 4>soviet era.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a first time that was in</v>

<v Speaker 4>And that was the first time I was like,</v>

1772
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:34.811
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 4>throw some kicks in mma,</v>

1774
01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:40.580
<v Speaker 4>but with the first time really was you</v>

<v Speaker 4>shin thing.</v>

1777
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:49.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you still at slam that kick into</v>

1778
01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:54.100
<v Speaker 4>their arms and just see like nobody</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to hold pads for a guy like that.</v>

1779

1781
01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:59.210
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a great way to go in,</v>

1782
01:15:59.211 --> 01:16:00.940
<v Speaker 4>into a fight because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're capable of doIng that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.330
<v Speaker 4>So you only have to connect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1793
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.860
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1794
01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:26.740
<v Speaker 4>I train a few guys at my gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've been traveling a lot now so,</v>

1795

1797
01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:34.150
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three pros and then a bunch of amateur</v>

1798
01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:34.650
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1799
01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:39.650
<v Speaker 4>So you're stIll doing inside mma with</v>
<v Speaker 4>ken kenny and um,</v>

1800
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.510
<v Speaker 4>you do world series of fighting still</v>
<v Speaker 4>wheelchairs a fight.</v>

1801
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:48.130
<v Speaker 4>Actually this weekend coming up on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>saturday this saturday on nbc isn't</v>

1802
01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.950
<v Speaker 4>really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More osis funding again.</v>

1803
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.490
<v Speaker 4>He's very talented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His footwork to.</v>

1804
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:55.300
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy that people sleep on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1805
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:57.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't really realize how talented</v>

1806
01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.960
<v Speaker 4>that guy's in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unfortunate that world series of</v>

1807
01:16:58.961 --> 01:17:02.170
<v Speaker 4>fighting is not getting as much</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention as it deserves.</v>

1808
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:03.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1809
01:17:03.461 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of mma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's very hard to pull eyeballs</v>

1810
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:08.610
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1811
01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:11.180
<v Speaker 4>but it's the with gloria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gloria doesn't have the eyeballs,</v>

1812
01:17:11.181 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 4>which blows me away because if there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something exciting,</v>

1813
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gore,</v>

1814
01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:18.770
<v Speaker 4>it's a gloria event in that just</v>
<v Speaker 4>engaging kid to.</v>

1815
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what an animal.</v>

1816
01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:22.670
<v Speaker 4>A fucking sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a fun,</v>

1817
01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 4>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fun to watch.</v>

1818
01:17:24.381 --> 01:17:25.214
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1819
01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.050
<v Speaker 4>he should tone a little down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loa say,</v>

1820
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.460
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1821
01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.310
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's just fight style and he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to go because sometimes he gets</v>

1822
01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:35.050
<v Speaker 4>hit hard and I think eventually we had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were clay guida or you know,</v>

1823
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 4>like fighters.</v>

1824
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Eventually it's going to be who's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to give.</v>

1825
01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can only get hit hard and just walk</v>

1826
01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:44.780
<v Speaker 4>through things so much until eventually</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body doesn't cooperate anymore.</v>

1827
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:47.240
<v Speaker 4>And then most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once that happens,</v>

1828
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.480
<v Speaker 4>it's going to happen a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of crazy shit going on</v>

1829
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:52.520
<v Speaker 4>right now in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the big one.</v>

1830
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:54.770
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one that I'm most excited about is</v>

1831
01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.660
<v Speaker 4>March 5th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conor mcgregor versus those.</v>

1832
01:17:57.530 --> 01:18:00.020
<v Speaker 4>That is a fucking crazy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1833
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:02.540
<v Speaker 4>who the hell has ever been like connor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep,</v>

1834
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:05.210
<v Speaker 4>well I mean the best shit talker of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I love everything about him.</v>

1839
01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:15.140
<v Speaker 4>We had him on his show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's funny as you know,</v>

1840
01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:17.240
<v Speaker 4>everything he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every speech he does,</v>

1841
01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:19.730
<v Speaker 4>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like he's repeating everything</v>

1842
01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:22.010
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I do an interview before and it's</v>

1843
01:18:22.011 --> 01:18:23.210
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1846
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:26.870
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1847
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:29.270
<v Speaker 4>and he doesn't really use profanity as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1848
01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 4>so it keeps it clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but very encouraging.</v>

1849
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use it on television was so</v>

1850
01:18:35.361 --> 01:18:36.270

<v Speaker 4>But to see,</v>

1853
01:18:41.781 --> 01:18:43.880
<v Speaker 4>but he's making gets in everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

1854
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.300
<v Speaker 4>That's why he beat the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although you could tell,</v>

1855
01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 4>you could simply tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody can say,</v>

1856
01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:50.320
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1857
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will put a street over or rafael dos</v>

1858
01:18:52.831 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 4>anjos says that also.</v>

1859
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually it's gonna come through,</v>

1860
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta start doing something back.</v>

1861
01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:02.930
<v Speaker 4>He was a few fun things that you always</v>
<v Speaker 4>can do is not engaging him.</v>

1862
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I liked the way dos sandra says</v>
<v Speaker 4>handling.</v>

1863
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:06.460
<v Speaker 4>He's just letting him talk and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1864
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:10.130
<v Speaker 4>when we find this one I'm out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I know he's just like solid and</v>

1865
01:19:10.131 --> 01:19:12.950
<v Speaker 4>stoic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's also learning the lesson of</v>

1866
01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:16.340
<v Speaker 4>how although sorta got rattled and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to get route.</v>

1867
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I think told sandra is a different guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a.</v>

1868
01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:24.150
<v Speaker 4>He's even doing the chapel posed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shaking hands and sean penn and that</v>

1869
01:19:25.131 --> 01:19:27.410

<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get great.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean it's timing is really good.</v>

1874
01:19:37.011 --> 01:19:39.680
<v Speaker 4>He's using his reach really well and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way for us to,</v>

1875
01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:40.290
<v Speaker 4>as a hobby.</v>

1876
01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 4>He described his lefthand for us to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hobby,</v>

<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did an amazing breakdown.</v>

1878
01:19:44.031 --> 01:19:47.330
<v Speaker 4>If you're listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to youtube for rasa hobby,</v>

1879
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:50.970
<v Speaker 4>who I in my mind is one of the true</v>
<v Speaker 4>great masters of video.</v>

1880
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.990
<v Speaker 4>He does an amazing breakdown of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

1881
01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:56.270
<v Speaker 4>but the way he describes ca connor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1882
01:19:56.271 --> 01:19:59.210
<v Speaker 4>he's got the touch of death that left</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand and it's true.</v>

1883
01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:01.290
<v Speaker 4>He just lights guys up at that left</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Plus it's a laser guided,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's on target.</v>

1886
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:06.300
<v Speaker 4>It's not just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just doesn't hit the head.</v>

1887
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Hit your jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 4>He's so</v>

1889
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.860
<v Speaker 3>great timing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so accurate and so and so beautiful with</v>

1890
01:20:11.861 --> 01:20:14.400
<v Speaker 3>his footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way slid out of the way of all those</v>

1891
01:20:14.401 --> 01:20:16.320
<v Speaker 3>advanced and just drop that left hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1892
01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.593
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1894
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:23.100
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning I go always under the</v>
<v Speaker 3>radar.</v>

1895
01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of these,</v>

1896
01:20:24.301 --> 01:20:26.190
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's there and he's just beating</v>

1897
01:20:26.191 --> 01:20:27.024
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1898
01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 3>I had ever expected that it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

1899
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.500
<v Speaker 3>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1900
01:20:31.501 --> 01:20:34.920
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what's going on to his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His conditioning is off the charts.</v>

1901
01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Was working with nick curse on who's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the disciples of marinovich and</v>

1902
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:43.950
<v Speaker 3>they've got him doing these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>explosive plyometric drills and all</v>

1903
01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:47.130
<v Speaker 3>these footwork drills and have you ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen his training routine?</v>

1904
01:20:47.131 --> 01:20:51.330
<v Speaker 3>You're realIzing they got a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen mask on him and he's throwing</v>

1905
01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.240
<v Speaker 3>body shots on the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all this incredible,</v>

1906
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.250
<v Speaker 3>brutal breakdown for for strength and</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning so that he could really go</v>

1907
01:20:59.251 --> 01:21:00.450
<v Speaker 3>five rounds like that.</v>

1908
01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.640
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as having enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar.</v>

1909
01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what I always tell everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No such thing.</v>

1910
01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to go all the way.</v>

1911
01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:09.570
<v Speaker 3>That's why I trained so hard because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to have that.</v>

1912
01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 3>I had to experience in thai boxing one</v>
<v Speaker 3>time when I run out of gas.</v>

1913
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:17.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun and especially in you no</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer around and with an opponent</v>

1914
01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:21.120
<v Speaker 3>seeing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he getting tired now?</v>

1915
01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 3>They get wings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1916
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 3>they turn it on and you're in a bad spot</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1917
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the worst thing in the worlD to see</v>

1918
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 3>an opponent notice that you're tired and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>

1919
01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.690
<v Speaker 3>He's coming after you and he starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping low kicks on you and punching</v>

1920
01:21:33.691 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you in the face and you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1921
01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Your Body's not cooperating and they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse because then your breathing starts</v>

1922
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.560
<v Speaker 3>going wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The breathing patterns not too relaxed</v>

1923
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:42.930
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1924
01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 3>You have to stop flexing because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>punches are coming.</v>

1925
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll take your stamina even more away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything goes down.</v>

1926
01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stamina is a weapon.</v>

1927
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:51.631
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1928
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:56.250
<v Speaker 3>look at nick diaz who was a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought so many guys and outwork them.</v>

1929
01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean the frank shamrock five's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect example that fight.</v>

1930
01:21:59.311 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just kept popping them with punches</v>

1931
01:22:02.011 --> 01:22:04.590
<v Speaker 3>like 50 percent punches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's hitting him and he can't</v>

1932
01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:07.200
<v Speaker 3>breathe because when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I punched persons punching you,</v>

1933
01:22:07.201 --> 01:22:09.120
<v Speaker 3>even if they're punching you and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not full blast,</v>

1934
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:11.700
<v Speaker 3>you're still tightening up so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a chance to breathe.</v>

1935
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 3>And nick diaz doesn't get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does ultra marathons?</v>

1936
01:22:14.881 --> 01:22:17.250
<v Speaker 3>The fucking guy swam from alcatraz</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice.</v>

1937
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:21.540
<v Speaker 3>He's in incredible shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's done triathlons.</v>

1938
01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's done ultra</v>
<v Speaker 3>marathons,</v>

1939
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.860
<v Speaker 3>probably take that back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but swimming from alcatraz is a fucking</v>

1940
01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:26.820
<v Speaker 3>crazy endeavor.</v>

1941
01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Done it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well pedis for instance,</v>

1942
01:22:30.061 --> 01:22:33.090
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was never going to lose and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only time she was losing what's</v>

1943
01:22:33.091 --> 01:22:34.860
<v Speaker 3>against guys with great stamina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1944
01:22:34.861 --> 01:22:38.520
<v Speaker 3>clay guida and an rda who just keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing the fight,</v>

1945
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:40.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the grappling grappling.</v>

1946
01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think physically pedis is not strong</v>

1947
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:48.000
<v Speaker 3>enough for those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys like dos anjos that just put it to</v>

1948
01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:49.710
<v Speaker 3>them or eddie alvarez just put it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1949
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:52.080
<v Speaker 3>The physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they turned it into one of those</v>

1950
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:55.280
<v Speaker 3>grueling wrestling match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think his take down defense is</v>

1951
01:22:55.281 --> 01:22:57.240
<v Speaker 3>pretty good and I think his grappling is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not bad.</v>

1952
01:22:57.390 --> 01:23:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean he won the title with an arm bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think physically when it</v>

1953
01:23:01.591 --> 01:23:04.710
<v Speaker 3>comes to these grueling exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know if he's physically</v>

1954
01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:08.150
<v Speaker 3>strong to fight that fight with lego</v>
<v Speaker 3>dosantos yup.</v>

1955
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Or even eddie alvarez and in that.</v>

1956
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 3>In that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Well footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1958
01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:14.460
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna he needs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to need a lot of forward</v>

1959
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:16.400
<v Speaker 3>laker mariah's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stopped staying down by.</v>

1960
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Well he didn't even stop and just moves</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the way he moves out of the way the</v>

1961
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.470
<v Speaker 3>lights guys up to and in his power to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing in pettis has a lot</v>

1962
01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 3>of power to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not counting pedis pedis could</v>

1963
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 3>easily come back and win the title again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a monster,</v>

1964
01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.600
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never expected him to lose.</v>

1965
01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.670
<v Speaker 3>I thought because she has this complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>package,</v>

1966
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.280
<v Speaker 3>it was she a great striker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great submissions,</v>

1967
01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:37.780
<v Speaker 3>takedown defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1968
01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:38.680
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the guy,</v>

1969
01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:42.550
<v Speaker 3>put them on a weedy bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put away ceremony even better and</v>

1970
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:44.050
<v Speaker 3>more impressive than dos anjos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:47.650
<v Speaker 3>That was the craziest dos anjos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hurts her one and battered him up</v>

1972
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:50.380
<v Speaker 3>against the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought that the stoppage was so</v>

1973
01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:53.530
<v Speaker 3>weird because like looked at the referee</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's telling the referee stopped the</v>

1974
01:23:53.531 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 3>fight and dosantos has serone sororities</v>
<v Speaker 3>turtled up and he's still covering up.</v>

1975
01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when a fight should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped in that situation.</v>

1976
01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 3>When a guy's guy gets hurt to the body</v>
<v Speaker 3>was obviously hurt,</v>

1977
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.020
<v Speaker 3>but dos anjos is hitting them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cowboys covering up.</v>

1978
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Like when do you stop a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if a guy's covering up and you're</v>

1979
01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:14.260
<v Speaker 3>hitting his arms and he's talking like</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to get back up to his feet,</v>

1980
01:24:14.261 --> 01:24:16.630
<v Speaker 3>like when does a fight get stopped?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When is it okay?</v>

1981
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Because some referees wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped the fight.</v>

1982
01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.541
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1983
01:24:19.541 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a perfect example,</v>

1984
01:24:20.981 --> 01:24:23.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris weidman versus luke rockhold.</v>

1985
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:26.560
<v Speaker 3>When luke rockhold got on top of chrIs</v>
<v Speaker 3>weidman at the end of the round was</v>

1986
01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:29.050
<v Speaker 3>beating the fuck out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying they should stop that.</v>

1987
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Like he's not defending him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like that's not the same as like the</v>

1988
01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:36.580
<v Speaker 3>cowboy cerrone dos anjos fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1989
01:24:36.581 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a little bit of a more</v>

1990
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 3>controversial stuff because you're still</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a defense.</v>

1991
01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't.</v>

1992
01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:44.860
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't stop the only one wIthout</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in and do.</v>

1993
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:46.690
<v Speaker 3>If he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't cover up.</v>

1994
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.480
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get hit with a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got to cover up and when you're</v>

1995
01:24:49.481 --> 01:24:50.860
<v Speaker 3>covering up and the guys boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1996
01:24:50.861 --> 01:24:51.370
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1997
01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:52.840
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot You can do.</v>

1998
01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you got to put your hand down to get</v>

1999
01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:56.230
<v Speaker 3>up and if you put your hand down and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

2000
01:24:56.231 --> 01:24:57.210
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2001
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2002
01:24:59.210 --> 01:25:03.730
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a guy can have a fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped without you being in real</v>

2003
01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.410
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although cowboy was certainly in</v>

2004
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:06.070
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2005
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:07.960
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird little kind of a.</v>

2006
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.030
<v Speaker 3>It's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so subjective.</v>

2007
01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 3>It's up to the referee to decide the</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>

2008
01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:16.660
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't want to be a referee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very hard decision today.</v>

2009
01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:18.040
<v Speaker 3>It really is just never good.</v>

2010
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:18.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

2011
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:20.140
<v Speaker 3>But you did for the safety of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>photos.</v>

2012
01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.380
<v Speaker 3>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2013
01:25:21.381 --> 01:25:22.840
<v Speaker 3>drawn to go out and they don't defend</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2014
01:25:22.841 --> 01:25:24.460
<v Speaker 3>I should've stopped right away if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2015
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 3>because they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're doing it.</v>

2016
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:26.621
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2017
01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:27.710
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how uh,</v>

2018
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 3>like a big jaw and he tells me that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him doing it against the</v>

2019
01:25:30.851 --> 01:25:32.020
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the dressing room.</v>

2020
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:36.070
<v Speaker 3>He'll tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do not come to me after the fight that</v>

2021
01:25:36.071 --> 01:25:38.480
<v Speaker 3>if you lay on the ground to the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit you and you're just bugging up,</v>

2022
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 3>I will stop the fight and he says it two</v>
<v Speaker 3>or three times.</v>

2023
01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Do not come to me after the fight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>complain about it because you know right</v>

2024
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:49.240
<v Speaker 3>now improve your position and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2025
01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:51.940
<v Speaker 3>you don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm also,</v>

2026
01:25:51.941 --> 01:25:53.910
<v Speaker 3>it's for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guillotine attempt.</v>

2027
01:25:53.911 --> 01:25:56.680
<v Speaker 3>So or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you see guys who defend the</v>

2028
01:25:56.681 --> 01:25:58.810
<v Speaker 3>guillotine like you're standing still</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

2029
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:00.180
<v Speaker 3>don't defend the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2030
01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.920
<v Speaker 3>go for position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that you get close,</v>

2031
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>you hold a heads to make sure</v>

2032
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't jump guard because if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>defend well,</v>

2033
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.250
<v Speaker 4>look at that militate against henzel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gracie in the ifl use definitive did</v>

2034
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.040
<v Speaker 4>yoga.</v>

2035
01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Now he's got them now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda rousey against carmouche.</v>

2036
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:21.080
<v Speaker 4>You know she's got a crazy crank on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on their head and instead of defending</v>

2037
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:21.651
<v Speaker 4>what people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2038
01:26:21.651 --> 01:26:22.890
<v Speaker 4>differently the defendant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2039
01:26:22.891 --> 01:26:23.420
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she didn't.</v>

2040
01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 4>She's had to position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She grabbed the foot,</v>

2041
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.060
<v Speaker 4>feet unlocked to fit and she got out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She took a chance that she took a chest</v>

2042
01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:30.920
<v Speaker 4>and that's what people should do on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground also.</v>

2043
01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:31.940
<v Speaker 4>They said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2044
01:26:31.941 --> 01:26:33.530
<v Speaker 4>but if they hit you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2045
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.820
<v Speaker 4>escape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buck up,</v>

2046
01:26:34.821 --> 01:26:35.990
<v Speaker 4>move to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you bulk up,</v>

2047
01:26:35.991 --> 01:26:37.130
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to look for</v>
<v Speaker 4>balance.</v>

2048
01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:40.640
<v Speaker 4>Make sure they never sit on your chest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push them always to your belly.</v>

2049
01:26:40.641 --> 01:26:43.760
<v Speaker 4>If you can push into your belly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hold a nice and you push yourself up</v>

2050
01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:45.920
<v Speaker 4>or it's same result is sitting on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>belly.</v>

2051
01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:48.770
<v Speaker 4>But you gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta move how easy it is.</v>

2052
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:52.280
<v Speaker 4>Is it for you if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody mounts you to go to put them</v>

2053
01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:53.240
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least to have god?</v>

2054
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:54.493
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to.</v>

2055
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.610
<v Speaker 4>It's real easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2056
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.830
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of guys don't train off</v>
<v Speaker 4>their back then.</v>

2057
01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 4>It's the craziest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It drives me nuts.</v>

2058
01:26:59.871 --> 01:27:03.830
<v Speaker 4>Get them into gartman y amount position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't even be happening.</v>

2059
01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.590
<v Speaker 4>Go to the side mount position when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>could stop you.</v>

2060
01:27:06.591 --> 01:27:08.960
<v Speaker 4>It's only when they put the stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you out a hook,</v>

2061
01:27:08.961 --> 01:27:10.000
<v Speaker 4>their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2062
01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:13.650
<v Speaker 4>but then there's not a lot they can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she just stopped their arms.</v>

2063
01:27:13.651 --> 01:27:16.070
<v Speaker 4>So it's interesting when you see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>different levels of,</v>

2064
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.190
<v Speaker 4>of their game off their back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Brian Ortega,</v>

2065
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:22.580
<v Speaker 4>have you been watching that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus fucking christ.</v>

2066
01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 4>His triangles are good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His guard game is so good and he's one</v>

2067
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:27.620
<v Speaker 4>of those guys.</v>

2068
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:30.230
<v Speaker 4>He's like a gold standard for how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight off your back.</v>

2069
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:31.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they get him on his back,</v>

2070
01:27:31.821 --> 01:27:36.290
<v Speaker 4>he is just that packing attacking you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get him stagnant</v>

2071
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:39.260
<v Speaker 4>where he's just lying there waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the referee to stand them back up.</v>

2072
01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:42.560
<v Speaker 4>That's when you've got that kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground game off your back.</v>

2073
01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 4>It's A totally new dimension for your</v>
<v Speaker 4>opponents.</v>

2074
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 4>They're used to taking a guy down and</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe throw in some body punches with</v>

2075
01:27:48.381 --> 01:27:50.090
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking defense defending the</v>

2076
01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:54.340
<v Speaker 4>whole tags are up on your neck and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to try to pass her up and get outta</v>

2077
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:56.210
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the gold standard and that's what</v>

2078
01:27:56.211 --> 01:27:59.570
<v Speaker 4>everybody should aspire to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have that kind of a dangerous ground</v>

2079
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:00.540
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2080
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.160
<v Speaker 4>That's why I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2081
01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.880
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2082
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Hendricks is a wonderful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2083
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:08.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2084
01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:10.430
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

2085
01:28:10.690 --> 01:28:13.190
<v Speaker 4>How could I forget him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was carlos condit,</v>

2086
01:28:13.191 --> 01:28:14.690
<v Speaker 4>the international bulk carrier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was gonna say.</v>

2087
01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:17.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I thought a conduit honda because</v>

2088
01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:20.280
<v Speaker 4>he's constantly attacking underground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2089
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 4>And if somebody is on top of you and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit you once every what time?</v>

2090
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.840
<v Speaker 4>That shouldn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If destroy undefeated,</v>

2091
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.970
<v Speaker 4>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it goes through a decision and nobody</v>

2092
01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 4>get really hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the guy who's constantly attacking</v>

2093
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.080
<v Speaker 4>is going to win the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2094
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why so why doesn't that count on the</v>

2095
01:28:35.061 --> 01:28:37.850
<v Speaker 4>ground?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because it goes on top doesn't mean</v>

2096
01:28:37.851 --> 01:28:38.750
<v Speaker 4>he's winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2097
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:42.150
<v Speaker 4>How about the fact that that's how you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want the title versus kevin rowlanD down</v>

2098
01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:45.020
<v Speaker 4>random?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even with submission,</v>

2099
01:28:45.021 --> 01:28:46.220
<v Speaker 4>that example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

2100
01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was shook you down and you just</v>

2101
01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:50.710
<v Speaker 4>kept attacking from your back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Mccarthy said later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't put them back on a fit because</v>

2103
01:28:53.841 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 4>boss was working from his bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the reason they didn't put us</v>

2104
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:58.430
<v Speaker 4>back on the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2105
01:28:58.431 --> 01:29:00.410
<v Speaker 4>if you have a gay guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologists content or what,</v>

2106
01:29:00.411 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 4>you saw a lot of pride,</v>
<v Speaker 4>also great</v>

2107
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 5>groundwork and a constantly attacking</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they get rewarded for that</v>

2108
01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 5>after the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They actually win the fight and it</v>

2109
01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:09.090
<v Speaker 5>should be because people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2110
01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:11.100
<v Speaker 5>but the defense is no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2111
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not about the defense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same as the strike.</v>

2112
01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:16.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about a guy who takes the chances</v>

2113
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:17.940
<v Speaker 5>because we all know if you have somebody</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the guard,</v>

2114
01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:20.960
<v Speaker 5>you go for an arm bar as I possibility</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be an assignment.</v>

2115
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:22.650
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a worse posItion for you.</v>

2116
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.710
<v Speaker 5>So you're taking risks and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to take those chris,</v>

2117
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:27.810
<v Speaker 5>they should be rewarded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2118
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:30.660
<v Speaker 5>how also like pride.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that 10 minute first round.</v>

2119
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 5>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes it,</v>

2120
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:33.750
<v Speaker 5>makes it more strategical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:35.270
<v Speaker 5>He really can't burn out in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning.</v>

2122
01:29:35.290 --> 01:29:36.750
<v Speaker 5>That was the thing with bankers in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning,</v>

2123
01:29:36.751 --> 01:29:39.570
<v Speaker 5>but 30 minute fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why the arts came on my hands</v>

2124
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:43.740
<v Speaker 5>because that means holistic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is relaxed because I was such a</v>

2125
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:46.350
<v Speaker 5>hothead in thai boxing like somebody</v>
<v Speaker 5>hits me,</v>

2126
01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.530
<v Speaker 5>god there might just knock them out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2127
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 5>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2128
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.800
<v Speaker 5>these japanese guys are known for being</v>
<v Speaker 5>tough.</v>

2129
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 5>If this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first three minutes I get 27 more</v>

2130
01:29:55.621 --> 01:29:57.870
<v Speaker 5>minutes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm empty,</v>

2131
01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.390
<v Speaker 5>that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So stay calm,</v>

2132
01:30:00.391 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 5>stay calm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you start to be more strategical.</v>

2133
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:05.270
<v Speaker 5>So pancreas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was there any rounds or was it just know</v>

2134
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:09.990
<v Speaker 5>30 minutes at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the end there were a few under,</v>

2135
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:11.790
<v Speaker 5>unlike the undercard for 10 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 5>fights,</v>

2136
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:15.180
<v Speaker 5>but most of the time was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything was 15 minutes and the title</v>

2137
01:30:15.181 --> 01:30:17.880
<v Speaker 5>fights and the end was 30 in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning the first year.</v>

2138
01:30:17.881 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 5>And a half minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three minutes.</v>

2139
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:20.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2140
01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:21.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:23.550
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a real strategic fight.</v>

2142
01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:25.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fan of that though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked that.</v>

2143
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:26.790
<v Speaker 5>I liked that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2144
01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:28.500
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

2145
01:30:28.501 --> 01:30:31.540
<v Speaker 5>if you look at some ufc fights where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just lay la la,</v>

2146
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.240
<v Speaker 5>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the old days,</v>

2147
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.900
<v Speaker 5>whoever without a standup and then it</v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes kind of boring.</v>

2148
01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:41.310
<v Speaker 5>But that was one of the things when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>moved to pancras always tell this story,</v>

2149
01:30:41.370 --> 01:30:44.930
<v Speaker 5>but when I saw my opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was 45 pounds heavier and I asked</v>

2150
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.950
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way in was,</v>

2151
01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no way in we everybody fights,</v>

2152
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:49.740
<v Speaker 5>everybody go out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's great.</v>

2153
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:50.650
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2154
01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:52.800
<v Speaker 5>I was just bluffing of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

2155
01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:53.631
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so how many months?</v>

2156
01:30:53.631 --> 01:30:54.780
<v Speaker 5>We got one round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one round.</v>

2157
01:30:54.781 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many minutes?</v>

2158
01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:56.091
<v Speaker 5>Thirty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd go.</v>

2159
01:30:56.091 --> 01:30:56.970
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

2160
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:58.950
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I look at my manager,</v>

2161
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:04.250
<v Speaker 5>I could lose 30 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>45 more pounds on me as opposed to a</v>

2162
01:31:04.951 --> 01:31:07.770
<v Speaker 5>three minute kickboxing for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I was thinking around,</v>

2163
01:31:07.771 --> 01:31:08.604
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing,</v>

2164
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:09.650
<v Speaker 5>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2165
01:31:09.650 --> 01:31:10.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2166
01:31:10.861 --> 01:31:14.490
<v Speaker 5>that opened my eyes a little bit there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you become more strategical.</v>

2167
01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.420
<v Speaker 5>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2168
01:31:15.421 --> 01:31:17.520
<v Speaker 5>it's also good for grapplers when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>

2169
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:20.790
<v Speaker 5>like say if you have a five minute fight</v>
<v Speaker 5>or a five minute round and you work for</v>

2170
01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 5>four minutes and 30 seconds and get the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight to the ground,</v>

2171
01:31:22.891 --> 01:31:24.870
<v Speaker 5>you only have 30 seconds to try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>secure a submission.</v>

2172
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:28.770
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you take god to ground a 10</v>
<v Speaker 5>minute fight in your format in 30</v>

2173
01:31:28.771 --> 01:31:31.410
<v Speaker 5>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you have five minutes and 30 seconds</v>

2174

01:35:54.090 --> 01:35:56.840
<v Speaker 1>And what happened with sean tompkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did sean,</v>

2290
01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was the saddest thing ever because</v>

2291
01:35:59.511 --> 01:36:01.850
<v Speaker 5>when I went to the funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

2292
01:36:01.851 --> 01:36:03.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

2293
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:06.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was in a coffin and I didn't want to</v>

2294
01:36:06.051 --> 01:36:07.940
<v Speaker 5>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did that one time with a friend of</v>

2295
01:36:07.941 --> 01:36:09.690
<v Speaker 5>mine and I didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I said,</v>

2296
01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 5>don't want to do it in his mother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so sad,</v>

2297
01:36:12.261 --> 01:36:12.990
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>

2298
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:15.890
<v Speaker 5>she came to me crying and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2299
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 5>he was in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was home and that weekend she was</v>

2300
01:36:20.241 --> 01:36:23.580
<v Speaker 5>going to tell him that he had to go to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the doctor because in the family that</v>

2301
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:25.910
<v Speaker 5>runs in the family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they have enlarged hearts and he</v>

2302
01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:29.690
<v Speaker 5>needs to check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was what was going down there.</v>

2303
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 5>He was no drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2304
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 5>not because people start,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

2305
01:36:32.331 --> 01:36:34.750
<v Speaker 5>the conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't find anything,</v>

2306
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.640
<v Speaker 5>find anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the crazy thing was I talked the day</v>

2307
01:36:37.641 --> 01:36:39.320
<v Speaker 5>before we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sean,</v>

2308
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:42.860
<v Speaker 5>it was so weird because then you guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>announced it on uc.</v>

2309
01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:44.480
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2310
01:36:44.481 --> 01:36:45.030
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sean.</v>

2311
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:46.430
<v Speaker 5>So I started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started googling,</v>

2312
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:48.260
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was so weird.</v>

2313
01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:52.100
<v Speaker 5>He texted me something and I thought for</v>
<v Speaker 5>some reason I thought,</v>

2314
01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:53.930
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wants to talk to me because normally</v>

2315
01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:56.180
<v Speaker 5>we would text.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I picked up the phone and I called</v>

2316
01:36:56.181 --> 01:36:58.640
<v Speaker 5>him and he was going out with a muscle</v>
<v Speaker 5>beach,</v>

2317
01:36:58.641 --> 01:37:02.630
<v Speaker 5>one of our friends that we'd call the</v>
<v Speaker 5>muscle beach and he was um,</v>

2318
01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.910
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he muscle beach was drunk and he says,</v>

2319
01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:07.520
<v Speaker 5>by can't leave a man behind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to stay with him,</v>

2320
01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:08.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to make sure he's going to be</v>

2321
01:37:08.811 --> 01:37:09.720
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

2322
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:13.970
<v Speaker 5>And he kept going and the problem that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was reading about didn't even come up.</v>

2323
01:37:13.971 --> 01:37:16.070
<v Speaker 5>We start talking about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was great,</v>

2324
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:19.190
<v Speaker 5>great diaries as part I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that I really love you.</v>

2325
01:37:19.191 --> 01:37:21.830
<v Speaker 5>And then finally when we hang up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he started texting,</v>

2326
01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:24.650
<v Speaker 5>you know that I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tom.</v>

2327
01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:27.140
<v Speaker 5>The whole team tompkins loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really weird.</v>

2328
01:37:27.141 --> 01:37:29.600
<v Speaker 5>He never did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the next day he passed away.</v>

2329
01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.290
<v Speaker 5>So it was almost like he felt that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to happen.</v>

2330
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:34.363
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2332
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was another guy that was really loved</v>

2333
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:44.000
<v Speaker 1>by the guys that he trained those</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships between trainers and</v>

2334
01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainers and fighters.</v>

2335
01:37:45.621 --> 01:37:47.270
<v Speaker 1>They're so important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2336
01:37:47.271 --> 01:37:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's so hard for a fighter to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right trainer,</v>

2337
01:37:49.641 --> 01:37:51.440
<v Speaker 1>the right train of the fits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their personality.</v>

2338
01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2339
01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>someone who has also that emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>bond.</v>

2340
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:59.040
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does 100 percent commitment.</v>

2341
01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:02.130
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was being a fighter.</v>

2342
01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 5>It's soul sound cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why a lot of guys don't make</v>

2343
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:08.550
<v Speaker 5>it because they only want to look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2344
01:38:08.551 --> 01:38:11.790
<v Speaker 5>you don't really fight foot to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like once they fight a start fighting</v>

2345
01:38:11.791 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 5>for money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2346
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:17.070
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it's going downhill.</v>

2347
01:38:17.071 --> 01:38:18.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I needed a paycheck then don't</v>

2348
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:19.020
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find it,</v>

2349
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.330
<v Speaker 5>find another job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need that commitment.</v>

2350
01:38:21.331 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 5>You need to be 100 percent emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same with the trainers.</v>

2351
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.180
<v Speaker 5>You know you can be off for a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>because this guy is going to go in the</v>

2352
01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:30.660
<v Speaker 5>ring or in a cage and you have to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure that he's going to stay safe.</v>

2353
01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you see a fighter that's only</v>

2354
01:38:33.181 --> 01:38:36.280
<v Speaker 5>fighting for the paycheck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very rarely works out,</v>

2355
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:37.530
<v Speaker 5>which is very rarely.</v>

2356
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:39.760
<v Speaker 5>We're not at a championship level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2357
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:43.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean it miGht,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be okay at a journeyman level,</v>

2358
01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:46.020
<v Speaker 5>you might pull it off if you're tough</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're Skilled,</v>

2359
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.660
<v Speaker 5>but to beat the best guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be obsessed.</v>

2360
01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 5>Like the best guys are obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.190
<v Speaker 5>You want to be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not about Payday.</v>

2362
01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:54.120
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2363
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 5>that will come if you are the best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bay,</v>

2364
01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:59.070
<v Speaker 5>they will be better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But focus on getting good at fighting</v>

2365
01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:00.300
<v Speaker 5>for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always say,</v>

2366
01:39:00.670 --> 01:39:02.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't put your family number one spot.</v>

2367
01:39:02.971 --> 01:39:04.590
<v Speaker 5>I understand you want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2368
01:39:04.591 --> 01:39:06.600
<v Speaker 5>once you start,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means that you care.</v>

2369
01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 5>Care care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very.</v>

2370
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:12.120
<v Speaker 5>How you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a selfish.</v>

2371
01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.370
<v Speaker 5>It should be selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be.</v>

2372
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:17.280
<v Speaker 5>I fight for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

2373
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:19.260
<v Speaker 5>The way I explained it to my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

2374
01:39:19.290 --> 01:39:21.420
<v Speaker 5>my students is when they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

2375
01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:22.560
<v Speaker 5>they are nervous.</v>

2376
01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:23.700
<v Speaker 5>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2377
01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:25.170
<v Speaker 5>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's take a step back.</v>

2378
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.440
<v Speaker 5>Imagine your opponent now and you will</v>
<v Speaker 5>go in a room.</v>

2379
01:39:28.441 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 5>They loved the room and you guys going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to compete against each other.</v>

2380
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.540
<v Speaker 5>Whoever wins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter who wins.</v>

2381
01:39:33.541 --> 01:39:36.300
<v Speaker 5>When the door opens you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>both of you are not going to say who won</v>

2382
01:39:36.301 --> 01:39:37.710
<v Speaker 5>or lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's going to say,</v>

2383
01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:40.350
<v Speaker 5>do you really care if you lose at that</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment?</v>

2384
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:42.300
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2385
01:39:42.301 --> 01:39:42.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>

2386
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.320
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because yeah,</v>

2387
01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 5>he's just a better fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2388
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.800
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why do you care?</v>

2389
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:49.140
<v Speaker 5>And then they start realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2390
01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:52.740
<v Speaker 5>it's because the people more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he might think this and he might</v>

2391
01:39:52.741 --> 01:39:56.160
<v Speaker 5>think this and see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I always say fight for</v>

2392
01:39:56.161 --> 01:39:57.960
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you lose,</v>

2393
01:39:57.961 --> 01:40:00.900
<v Speaker 5>you give a joel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are always a winner.</v>

2394
01:40:00.901 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

2395
01:40:02.311 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 5>Bad is not going all the way not using</v>
<v Speaker 5>all your potential and then lose.</v>

2396
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 5>Because you didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that after a fight</v>

2397
01:40:09.271 --> 01:40:10.680
<v Speaker 5>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>

2398
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:12.320
<v Speaker 5>I could have gotten harder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why didn't you?</v>

2399
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:14.760
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just leave it all out there and if you</v>

2400
01:40:14.761 --> 01:40:17.640
<v Speaker 5>leave it all out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no excuses and every other</v>

2401
01:40:17.641 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 5>fighter will really enjoy you winning or</v>
<v Speaker 5>losing.</v>

2402
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:22.200
<v Speaker 5>How many fighters do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who,</v>

<v Speaker 5>important.</v>

<v Speaker 5>always fought with everything he had and</v>

2415
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:53.770
<v Speaker 5>whether he lost by knockout or won</v>
<v Speaker 5>knockout,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Nobody does it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but do it as hard as you can.</v>

2432
01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:34.750
<v Speaker 5>Cross hook,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cross and a left hook to the head.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a heart issue.</v>

2436
01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:44.530
<v Speaker 5>Can you will force them to block it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which will open up for the left hook to</v>

<v Speaker 5>the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same as with the body body ahead too.</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2440
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:54.220

<v Speaker 5>You see a ricoh over hoover who does his</v>

<v Speaker 5>first mixed martial arts fight,</v>

2444
01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:03.850
<v Speaker 5>If this guy doesn't block him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to get knocked out to the</v>

2445
01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.830
<v Speaker 5>body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now he respects your power.</v>

2446
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:08.380
<v Speaker 5>That's what Mike Tyson did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spleen might,</v>

2447
01:42:08.381 --> 01:42:10.810
<v Speaker 5>upper gut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hits you so hard on the spleen that</v>

2448
01:42:10.811 --> 01:42:14.170
<v Speaker 5>the second time when he loads up or you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he thinks he thinks it's going to be the</v>

2449
01:42:14.171 --> 01:42:16.390
<v Speaker 5>same punch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then he changed his angle to an</v>

2450
01:42:16.391 --> 01:42:19.000
<v Speaker 5>uppercut and his defenses here for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>screenshot.</v>

2451
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:22.630
<v Speaker 5>If you do it powerful and heart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will work,</v>

2452
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:25.010
<v Speaker 5>but if you do a buddy buddy hair bite</v>

<v Speaker 5>Make everything count.</v>

2454
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of guys are trying to conserve</v>

2455
01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 5>their energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You buy what I did after a workout,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I will put it back on the ground and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>would 30 minutes,</v>

2457

<v Speaker 5>just go punching on a bag on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rolling into god giving you don't get</v>

<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

01:42:45.191 --> 01:42:47.470
<v Speaker 5>You can just go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is she going to do?</v>

2461
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.870
<v Speaker 5>If he's on his back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to hit you back.</v>

2462
01:42:49.871 --> 01:42:52.030
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to hit you back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to watch out for submissions,</v>

2463
01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:54.270
<v Speaker 5>but that's not get get you in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2464
01:42:54.650 --> 01:42:57.130
<v Speaker 5>in trouble with your stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just go.</v>

2465
01:42:57.190 --> 01:43:00.010

<v Speaker 5>do you think now looking back when you</v>

2466
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:01.840
<v Speaker 5>have these tendinitis and all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>other issues,</v>

2467
01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:04.300
<v Speaker 5>will you too tough for your body because</v>
<v Speaker 5>that what it is?</v>

2468
01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.030
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2469
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:06.970
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I think is that because I was so</v>

2470
01:43:06.971 --> 01:43:09.860
<v Speaker 5>sick as a kid that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they overflow.</v>

2471
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:12.880
<v Speaker 5>We with cortisones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had so many cortisone,</v>

2472
01:43:12.881 --> 01:43:14.190
<v Speaker 5>so where was I?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2473
01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:17.130
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was like 46 pills a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took all.</v>

2474
01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.130
<v Speaker 5>I had really bad skin disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2475
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:24.220
<v Speaker 5>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I had a lot of stuff that I took for</v>

2476
01:43:24.221 --> 01:43:24.960
<v Speaker 5>that and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

2477
01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.020
<v Speaker 5>the tests they did on me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean every week I had to go get 20</v>

2478
01:43:29.021 --> 01:43:31.480
<v Speaker 5>shots,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 shots in each arm of what they would</v>

2479
01:43:31.481 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would inject a little tiny bit of</v>

2480
01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:37.960
<v Speaker 5>where you are alert for and then to</v>
<v Speaker 5>hopefully it's like the flu vaccine.</v>

2481
01:43:37.961 --> 01:43:40.840
<v Speaker 5>They hopefully the body finds a way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>counter attack that,</v>

2482
01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:45.640
<v Speaker 5>but every time when to do that I'll be</v>
<v Speaker 5>sick and so I needed to recoup from that</v>

2483
01:43:45.641 --> 01:43:49.510
<v Speaker 5>the whole time and I think eventually</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cortisones because they're really</v>

2484
01:43:49.511 --> 01:43:51.040
<v Speaker 5>bad for the bones and attendance.</v>

2485
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:54.110
<v Speaker 5>I think the court is really got my</v>
<v Speaker 5>tendinitis.</v>

2486
01:43:54.111 --> 01:43:56.960
<v Speaker 5>That's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

2487
01:43:56.961 --> 01:44:00.080
<v Speaker 5>I never heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard of anybody having.</v>

2488
01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never heard of anybody having that</v>

2489
01:44:01.371 --> 01:44:04.220
<v Speaker 5>many shots as a kid and then going on to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be a world championship fighter.</v>

2490
01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:10.310
<v Speaker 5>And the craziest thing is that when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was young I did track and field and I</v>

2491
01:44:10.311 --> 01:44:14.480
<v Speaker 5>did it a pretty high level already</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I wanted it to be the next bruce</v>

2492
01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:16.550
<v Speaker 5>jenner at the time he was my hero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know wHat I mean?</v>

2493
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:19.400
<v Speaker 5>That's how old I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the guy,</v>

2494
01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:23.340
<v Speaker 5>the decathlon guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I wanted and I remember in</v>

2495
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 5>the end every time with javelin I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I already had that tendonitis and I</v>

2496
01:44:27.891 --> 01:44:31.430
<v Speaker 5>started recognizing that and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>know why it stayed away my entire career</v>

2497
01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:34.820
<v Speaker 5>and came back only at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be the gods wiLl of god</v>

2498
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:35.361
<v Speaker 5>telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2499
01:44:35.361 --> 01:44:37.640
<v Speaker 5>it was good fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2500
01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:40.460
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for some reason at the end it came back,</v>

2501
01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:44.630
<v Speaker 5>but I remember the pain from when I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>14 years old.</v>

2502
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:48.620
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a desire to train like</v>
<v Speaker 5>championship level fighters because I</v>

2503
01:44:48.621 --> 01:44:53.180
<v Speaker 5>see you're talking about what guys don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>do correctly in which would like to see</v>

<v Speaker 5>with someone who's like really trying to</v>

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:18.780
<v Speaker 5>Give me two hours of my time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

2517
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:20.990
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got to be very,</v>

2518
01:45:20.991 --> 01:45:23.240
<v Speaker 5>very helpful for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking to be a coach because</v>

2519
01:45:23.241 --> 01:45:25.010
<v Speaker 5>they don't have the time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm way too busy for that,</v>

2520
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:26.690
<v Speaker 5>but I can get you in two hours.</v>

2521
01:45:26.690 --> 01:45:29.270
<v Speaker 5>I can get you a lot of inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or like for instance,</v>

2522
01:45:29.271 --> 01:45:32.060
<v Speaker 5>John jones is a while back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was interviewing him and then he said</v>

2523
01:45:32.061 --> 01:45:36.140
<v Speaker 5>right away I was in albuquerque.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you going to do after this?</v>

2524
01:45:36.141 --> 01:45:38.060
<v Speaker 5>I said to my hotel is amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you train me.</v>

2525
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:40.580
<v Speaker 5>You sEe those guys who really want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>learn and they want you to start</v>

2526
01:45:40.581 --> 01:45:44.810
<v Speaker 5>learning and these guys listen and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>suddenly they start being more explosive</v>

2527
01:45:44.811 --> 01:45:46.890
<v Speaker 5>with kicking air and they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2528
01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:48.110
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2529
01:45:48.111 --> 01:45:49.490
<v Speaker 5>like sound effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do a lot.</v>

2530
01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:53.210
<v Speaker 5>It had high pitch sound effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you see somebody,</v>

2531
01:45:53.211 --> 01:45:55.580
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you do the focus mitts or you hit a</v>

2532
01:45:55.581 --> 01:45:56.420
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go pump,</v>

2533
01:45:56.421 --> 01:45:57.860
<v Speaker 5>pump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pump pump one,</v>

2534
01:45:57.861 --> 01:45:58.281
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

2535
01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 5>four like that punch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so if you just stop or you go in</v>

2536
01:46:01.671 --> 01:46:04.220
<v Speaker 5>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go just do that.</v>

2537
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:09.220
<v Speaker 5>And then just by doing that your body</v>
<v Speaker 5>automatically will adapt and will get</v>

2538
01:46:09.231 --> 01:46:11.630
<v Speaker 5>more explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he realized that.</v>

2539
01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:12.464
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2540
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:16.760
<v Speaker 5>and the next week or two weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had greg jackson on the show and greg</v>

2541
01:46:16.761 --> 01:46:18.080
<v Speaker 5>tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2542
01:46:18.081 --> 01:46:18.914
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2543
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:22.220
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what have you been teaching and what do</v>

2544
01:46:22.221 --> 01:46:22.701
<v Speaker 5>you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

2545
01:46:22.701 --> 01:46:25.670
<v Speaker 5>everybody makes these crazy son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2546
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:28.100
<v Speaker 5>do they hit faster and harder?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

2547
01:46:28.110 --> 01:46:29.250
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2548
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it really works to get in people's</v>

2549
01:46:32.871 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 5>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2550
01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:38.240
<v Speaker 5>And then if you have an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an athlete like jones who will</v>

2551
01:46:38.241 --> 01:46:39.980
<v Speaker 5>listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:44.750
<v Speaker 5>that's gold that came to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have a guy like that came to you and</v>

2553
01:46:44.751 --> 01:46:45.471
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen boss,</v>

2554
01:46:45.471 --> 01:46:48.140
<v Speaker 5>I want you to train me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How is that something you would be</v>

2555
01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:51.290
<v Speaker 5>interested in doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be harder.</v>

2556
01:46:51.291 --> 01:46:55.520
<v Speaker 5>It depends whether you know the tv show</v>
<v Speaker 5>now to new podcast that elder to jim and</v>

2557
01:46:55.521 --> 01:46:55.890
<v Speaker 5>I met,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2558
01:46:55.890 --> 01:46:56.940
<v Speaker 5>so much stuff.</v>

2559
01:46:56.950 --> 01:47:00.510
<v Speaker 5>The world shares of fighting that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>suddenly cannot do because then we got</v>

2560
01:47:00.511 --> 01:47:02.900
<v Speaker 5>to have 100 percent commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2561
01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 5>I like a lot because I'm a very basic</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

2562
01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:09.420
<v Speaker 5>Everything is basic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the basics with me because everybody</v>

2563
01:47:09.421 --> 01:47:12.150
<v Speaker 5>forgets the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So most of the time when when somebody</v>

2564
01:47:12.151 --> 01:47:13.560
<v Speaker 5>comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like tim silvia,</v>

2565
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 5>a little while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he came to my gym and he threw the left</v>

2566
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:17.990
<v Speaker 5>hook wrong and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell them,</v>

2567
01:47:17.991 --> 01:47:18.390
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2568
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 5>just can be way harder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he started learning to throw the</v>

2569
01:47:21.121 --> 01:47:24.810
<v Speaker 5>hook without loading up and he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 5>his fight in 15 seconds with a left</v>

2570
01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:25.360
<v Speaker 5>hook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

2571
01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.160
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It works that I enjoy to give them an</v>

2572
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 5>hour time and show them what they do</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

2573
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.380
<v Speaker 5>And then if they actually listened to</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2574
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 5>they realize why wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got more power.</v>

2575
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:38.430
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't try to change the style.</v>

2576
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.720
<v Speaker 5>I just showed them how you get maximum</v>
<v Speaker 5>power and if you mix it up between your</v>

2577
01:47:42.721 --> 01:47:43.680
<v Speaker 5>styles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's up to you.</v>

2578
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:47.730
<v Speaker 5>But I see you have this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 5>passion about this guys and about</v>

2579
01:47:47.731 --> 01:47:49.470
<v Speaker 5>working on technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm,</v>

2580
01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you ever thought about like,</v>

2581
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:53.250
<v Speaker 5>just going into training and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>YeaH,</v>

2582
01:47:53.251 --> 01:47:53.620
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2583
01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:55.170
<v Speaker 5>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was too busy,</v>

2584
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.790
<v Speaker 5>too busy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also,</v>

2585
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:58.970
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't now anymore,</v>

2586
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:01.210
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of guys that you do over the</v>

2587
01:48:01.210 --> 01:48:01.940
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you put a lot,</v>

2588
01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.050
<v Speaker 5>you invest a lot of time and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>

2589
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:08.160
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't work out or they get a better</v>
<v Speaker 5>deal somewhere else and they just leave</v>

2590
01:48:08.161 --> 01:48:09.960
<v Speaker 5>you in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She does with a lot of fighters,</v>

2591
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:12.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and trainers that finally the trainer</v>

2592
01:48:12.901 --> 01:48:16.350
<v Speaker 5>has something or a manager and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>just kick him to the side because I'm</v>

2593
01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:17.920
<v Speaker 5>going to save 10 percent here are going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2594
01:48:18.210 --> 01:48:19.043
<v Speaker 5>you know then.</v>

2595
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:20.250
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then again,</v>

2596
01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.710
<v Speaker 5>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the time you see them losing,</v>

2597
01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you broke the winning</v>

2598
01:48:24.961 --> 01:48:27.120
<v Speaker 5>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have something.</v>

2599
01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:30.390
<v Speaker 5>My stretching routine and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>always says please post is because you</v>

2600
01:48:30.391 --> 01:48:33.270
<v Speaker 5>always talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My stretching routine is the same as it</v>

2601
01:48:33.271 --> 01:48:34.104
<v Speaker 5>was when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2602
01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:37.050
<v Speaker 5>when I started in [inaudible] 93,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's probably even before my</v>

2603
01:48:37.051 --> 01:48:38.070
<v Speaker 5>karate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I say,</v>

2604
01:48:38.071 --> 01:48:39.250
<v Speaker 5>you never changed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2605
01:48:39.251 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never change her.</v>

2606
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Why wouldn't you do more access?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because with that stretching routine,</v>

2607
01:48:43.801 --> 01:48:46.770
<v Speaker 5>I never had a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would I change it and they've given</v>

2608
01:48:46.771 --> 01:48:50.010
<v Speaker 5>me a problem in training is he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now if I start adding things or</v>

2609
01:48:50.011 --> 01:48:52.110
<v Speaker 5>subtracting to certainly I get injured.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just my own fault.</v>

2610
01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.720
<v Speaker 5>I had a winning combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never always helped me.</v>

2611
01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.720
<v Speaker 5>Let's not break that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's keep it the same.</v>

2612
01:48:58.170 --> 01:48:59.220
<v Speaker 5>And that's what everythinG.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So important is the most important thing</v>

2631
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:45.270
<v Speaker 5>for a bad spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put yourself in a bad spot and</v>

2632
01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to be comfortable in</v>
<v Speaker 5>those bad and work out of them all the</v>

2633
01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2634
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.600
<v Speaker 5>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2635
01:49:49.601 --> 01:49:52.570
<v Speaker 5>and the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had an a student one time coming over</v>

2636
01:49:52.571 --> 01:49:54.780
<v Speaker 5>to me and after class and he said,</v>

2638
01:49:55.730 --> 01:49:56.800
<v Speaker 5>tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2639
01:49:57.010 --> 01:50:00.940
<v Speaker 5>I've been working in now for three years</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're teaching the same stuff.</v>

2640
01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:02.261

<v Speaker 5>so you wouldn't have something more</v>

2642
01:50:03.851 --> 01:50:05.190
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>

01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:10.090
<v Speaker 5>you're still not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason I'm doing this is because</v>

2645
01:50:10.091 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 5>if people like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you guys don't listen,</v>

<v Speaker 5>look around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2647
01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 5>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't do it every bug to forget the</v>

2648
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:17.330
<v Speaker 5>basics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all want to do Just spinning</v>

<v Speaker 5>becky's to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the breakfast and the crazy elbows and</v>

2650
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:22.840
<v Speaker 5>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forget about basic stuff.</v>

2651
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:26.140
<v Speaker 5>A simple one to how many times in boxing</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see a Knockout,</v>

2652
01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 5>highest level of the planet who will do</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trick is just the timing and when</v>

2653
01:50:31.541 --> 01:50:32.770
<v Speaker 5>you throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the timing,</v>

2654
01:50:32.771 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 5>the efficiency of the technique and</v>
<v Speaker 5>having it down where you own it.</v>

2655
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:36.760
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2656
01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're enjoying teaching.</v>

2657
01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:42.790
<v Speaker 5>You enjoy teaching couple times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You enjoy doing that.</v>

2658
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:44.990
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And here's your striking class.</v>

2659
01:50:44.991 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Were guys sparring in there or are they</v>
<v Speaker 5>mostly working on technique and it's all</v>

2660
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 5>technique and my classes you go like you</v>
<v Speaker 5>see girls in my class,</v>

2661
01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:54.670
<v Speaker 5>but I still like to double love double</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2662
01:50:54.671 --> 01:50:57.360
<v Speaker 5>I can tell them any combination of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are watching diego,</v>

2663
01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:58.600
<v Speaker 5>like whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

2664
01:50:58.601 --> 01:51:01.300
<v Speaker 5>But they've been with me for awhile and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're very technical,</v>

2665
01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:02.051
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>

2666
01:51:02.051 --> 01:51:05.520
<v Speaker 5>they do really well with the striking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like yesterday again,</v>

2667
01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.810
<v Speaker 5>they were laughing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She still goes,</v>

2668
01:51:07.811 --> 01:51:10.170
<v Speaker 5>always worked together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lora and dina,</v>

2669
01:51:10.171 --> 01:51:11.950
<v Speaker 5>that they're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're probably gonna listen to this</v>

2670
01:51:11.951 --> 01:51:13.120
<v Speaker 5>also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I said,</v>

2671
01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:15.880
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody throws a low kick at the end.</v>

2672
01:51:15.881 --> 01:51:17.320
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a combination with a low kick,</v>

2673
01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.720
<v Speaker 5>but once you do that in a class at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>local,</v>

2674
01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.810
<v Speaker 5>they have their hands always down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I let him do it to me,</v>

2675
01:51:22.811 --> 01:51:23.590
<v Speaker 5>that combination.</v>

2676
01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:26.350
<v Speaker 5>And then just before they make kick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stretch my hand in front of the face</v>

2677
01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.320
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want everybody to do this because I</v>

2678
01:51:29.321 --> 01:51:30.730
<v Speaker 5>just walked around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2679
01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.120
<v Speaker 5>and as we're only three people from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>likes of 22 or 24 people,</v>

2680
01:51:34.121 --> 01:51:35.650
<v Speaker 5>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're doing it,</v>

2681
01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:37.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just keep your hands up,</v>

2682
01:51:37.241 --> 01:51:38.770
<v Speaker 5>just make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to hit him.</v>

2683
01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:42.040
<v Speaker 5>Just be aware that I could be a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2684
01:51:42.041 --> 01:51:44.670
<v Speaker 5>keep your hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I walked over and they said,</v>

2685
01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.550
<v Speaker 5>where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the three.</v>

2686
01:51:45.551 --> 01:51:46.091

<v Speaker 5>guys are always doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Make it good habit then don't lose the</v>

2689
01:51:53.501 --> 01:51:55.990

2787
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.240
<v Speaker 5>deal.</v>

<v Speaker 5>fight was it starts,</v>

2790
01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.070
<v Speaker 5>the first thing he does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he slept his thigh,</v>

2791
01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:55.480
<v Speaker 5>like kicked me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2792
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:58.920
<v Speaker 5>So now I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I go,</v>

2793
01:55:58.921 --> 01:56:01.260
<v Speaker 5>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's gonna think I gave him a low kick</v>

2794
01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:04.410
<v Speaker 5>so I've got to act like you give them a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lucky but gave him a front kick to the</v>

2795
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:09.411
<v Speaker 5>face so if he will wants to time it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>take me down to get him square in the</v>

2796
01:56:09.621 --> 01:56:11.660
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I move,</v>

2797
01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:15.390
<v Speaker 5>I make a front kick and it goes just in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of it and he's backing up.</v>

2798
01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.040
<v Speaker 5>I just miss him with the front kick to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the face and I see something in his eyes</v>

2799
01:56:20.041 --> 01:56:23.610
<v Speaker 5>and I pulled his day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't have told this data while</v>

2800
01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:27.600
<v Speaker 5>after I couldn't figure what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in his mind he of course thought I</v>

2801
01:56:27.601 --> 01:56:30.180
<v Speaker 5>thought we said we're not going to kick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2802
01:56:30.181 --> 01:56:32.850
<v Speaker 5>but he did that slapping thing on his</v>
<v Speaker 5>thigh.</v>

2803
01:56:32.851 --> 01:56:34.260
<v Speaker 5>So it threw me off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

2804
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:35.730
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wants me to kick him.</v>

2805
01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I guess that whole thing was not</v>

2806
01:56:38.161 --> 01:56:39.270
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's start kicking,</v>

2807
01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he got me because I kicked it,</v>

2808
01:56:41.301 --> 01:56:42.134
<v Speaker 5>took me down,</v>

2809
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:45.500
<v Speaker 4>and then the only the front could get</v>
<v Speaker 4>missed.</v>

2810
01:56:45.501 --> 01:56:47.900
<v Speaker 4>He backed up a ca would have been fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2811
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:49.690
<v Speaker 4>there's always gamesmanship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2812
01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:51.830
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2813
01:56:51.831 --> 01:56:55.250
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to him the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big john wooden in his book,</v>

2814
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:57.650

01:58:59.351 --> 01:59:01.570
<v Speaker 1>That's exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now in 2016,</v>

2859
01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have ronda rousey's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ellen show that we've talked about</v>

2860
01:59:04.211 --> 01:59:04.880
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy,</v>

2861
01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 1>greg or joel dos anjos fight is probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna get close to $2 million pay per</v>

2862
01:59:08.921 --> 01:59:09.551
<v Speaker 1>view buys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2863
01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:12.910
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with the sport that's</v>

2864
01:59:12.911 --> 01:59:15.130
<v Speaker 1>exploding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just exploding now.</v>

2865
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange that this is this</v>

2866
01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>combination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest sport is also the newest</v>

2867
01:59:20.891 --> 01:59:24.520
<v Speaker 1>sport and you from the time you started</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing,</v>

2868
01:59:24.521 --> 01:59:26.770
<v Speaker 1>you caught it like right at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the wave.</v>

2869
01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it's,</v>

2870
01:59:27.930 --> 01:59:29.750
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

2871
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:33.230
<v Speaker 5>it's an amazing feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many times fence ask,</v>

2872
01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:35.540
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't you want to be born like 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>years later?</v>

2873
01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:35.961
<v Speaker 5>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2874
01:59:35.961 --> 01:59:39.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm perfectly happy right now and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll show the way I wrapped it up.</v>

2875
01:59:39.331 --> 01:59:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I didn't lose him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost 22.</v>

2876
01:59:40.651 --> 01:59:45.651
<v Speaker 5>Five is a great way to stop while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>ahead to every week I keep going.</v>

2877
01:59:46.081 --> 01:59:46.914
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I get home and what,</v>

2878
01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:47.970
<v Speaker 5>what vin?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One more,</v>

2879
01:59:48.090 --> 01:59:50.020
<v Speaker 5>you'll lose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You win or you lose,</v>

2880
01:59:50.021 --> 01:59:52.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's not a great way to wrap up a</v>

2881
01:59:52.531 --> 01:59:54.960
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know of course injuries with me played a</v>

2882
01:59:54.990 --> 01:59:56.280
<v Speaker 5>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2883
01:59:56.281 --> 01:59:58.350
<v Speaker 5>maybe I got the injuries because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

2884
01:59:58.351 --> 02:00:00.010
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been going really well man.</v>

2885
02:00:00.150 --> 02:00:03.800
<v Speaker 5>You got to stop now in know because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're getting older and you don't want</v>

2886
02:00:03.801 --> 02:00:07.400
<v Speaker 5>to admit that you get older because</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's still explosive and you still want</v>

2887
02:00:07.401 --> 02:00:08.970
<v Speaker 5>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you still train with guys.</v>

2888
02:00:08.970 --> 02:00:11.010
<v Speaker 5>When I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I trained with the guys in vegas and I</v>

2889
02:00:11.011 --> 02:00:12.810
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did everybody looked at me?</v>

2890
02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:14.490
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you have a second career.</v>

2891
02:00:14.491 --> 02:00:15.780
<v Speaker 5>This is the craziest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2892
02:00:15.781 --> 02:00:16.770
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this crazy right.</v>

2893
02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm feeling so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2894
02:00:18.871 --> 02:00:21.600
<v Speaker 5>I could have ended a warm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't to do 20 minutes of warm up</v>

2895
02:00:21.601 --> 02:00:24.840
<v Speaker 5>when I started because I didn't train</v>
<v Speaker 5>for three and a half years and six weeks</v>

2896
02:00:24.841 --> 02:00:28.440
<v Speaker 5>later I'm not taking breaks anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just go into the next opponents.</v>

2897
02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:30.600
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even myself,</v>

2898
02:00:30.601 --> 02:00:32.010
<v Speaker 5>I am a single man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is great.</v>

2899
02:00:32.011 --> 02:00:36.390
<v Speaker 5>And then all the injury started coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>back and now I go,</v>

2900
02:00:36.391 --> 02:00:37.430
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I got it.</v>

2901
02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.050
<v Speaker 5>My knees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my tendinitis.</v>

2902
02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:42.000
<v Speaker 5>I tore a hamstring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull the rip,</v>

2903
02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:46.410
<v Speaker 5>rip out at the place at the dan</v>
<v Speaker 5>henderson's place,</v>

2904
02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they took me down in the mid air.</v>

2905
02:00:48.151 --> 02:00:52.650
<v Speaker 5>I reversed the take down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with that I use so much upper bodY</v>

2906
02:00:52.651 --> 02:00:54.540
<v Speaker 5>strength strength that I popped the rip</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2907
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.870
<v Speaker 5>So now there was 12 days before the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight I couldn't punch anymore.</v>

2908
02:00:58.110 --> 02:01:00.540
<v Speaker 5>Can point you back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only thing I did was the workout.</v>

2909
02:01:00.541 --> 02:01:03.300
<v Speaker 5>I have the audio workout in the air and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the only thing I could do.</v>

2910
02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:04.463
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2911
02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.560
<v Speaker 5>So what you got out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sport</v>

2912
02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>with your faculties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent intact,</v>

2913
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>that is the ultimate goal of any fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>to retire.</v>

2914
02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And especially you because you're now a</v>
<v Speaker 1>commentator,</v>

2915
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>you're also an analyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean what you do,</v>

2916
02:01:16.641 --> 02:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>a fantastic job of breaking down fights,</v>

<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also you're very honest.</v>

2919
02:01:24.621 --> 02:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't play politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very honest about how you feel</v>

2920
02:01:27.711 --> 02:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>about a fight coming up about where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy fucked up.</v>

2921
02:01:29.991 --> 02:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>but we're where a person's chances lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's,</v>

2922
02:01:33.851 --> 02:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sharp ever.</v>

2925
02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:40.551
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knoW,</v>

2926
02:01:40.551 --> 02:01:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost trying not to get hit,</v>

2927
02:01:43.130 --> 02:01:44.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't really work in my tunnel</v>

2928
02:01:44.591 --> 02:01:48.230
<v Speaker 3>fighting as kevin</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he'd beat the crap out of me,</v>

2929
02:01:48.231 --> 02:01:49.820
<v Speaker 3>but the first four minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2930
02:01:49.821 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after that it was okay for the rest.</v>

2931
02:01:53.661 --> 02:01:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I ever got hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2932
02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always try to,</v>

2933
02:01:57.110 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slip and move or fighting intelligent is</v>

2934
02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:05.270
<v Speaker 3>most important aspect of fighting to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind to use your mind and proper</v>

2935
02:02:05.271 --> 02:02:07.880
<v Speaker 3>tactics and techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love mighty mouse.</v>

2936
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Mighty mouse is on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2937
02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:11.960
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2938
02:02:11.961 --> 02:02:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm think jon jones is a phenomenal</v>

2939
02:02:15.081 --> 02:02:17.430
<v Speaker 3>talent and he's an amazing fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>

2940
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:21.320
<v Speaker 3>it's almost disrespectful to put him as</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound for pound the best when you look</v>

2941
02:02:21.321 --> 02:02:23.460
<v Speaker 3>at some of the wars that he's had with</v>
<v Speaker 3>gustafson.</v>

2942
02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean the war that he had with daniel</v>
<v Speaker 3>cormier was daniel.</v>

2943
02:02:26.271 --> 02:02:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he's a great fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a really good fight in,</v>

2944
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:31.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>john won the fight of course clearly,</v>

2945
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:33.800
<v Speaker 3>but you look at what mighty mouse is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going into.</v>

2946
02:02:33.801 --> 02:02:37.490
<v Speaker 3>The competition doesn't even get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dodson is a fucking freak.</v>

2947
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean dotson's a freak and dotson just</v>

2948
02:02:39.681 --> 02:02:41.100
<v Speaker 3>couldn't touch him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dotson.</v>

2949
02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Elvis said in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he's glued to the ground,</v>

2950
02:02:44.150 --> 02:02:45.770
<v Speaker 3>like he moves back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never slipped.</v>

2951
02:02:45.771 --> 02:02:50.660
<v Speaker 3>She never just grateful to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the man dj who met tom did a really</v>

2952
02:02:50.661 --> 02:02:52.520
<v Speaker 3>good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really,</v>

2953
02:02:52.521 --> 02:02:53.354
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2954
02:02:53.370 --> 02:02:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole new level where he's got</v>

2955
02:02:55.281 --> 02:02:58.220
<v Speaker 3>so much going on in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very smart.</v>

2956
02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:01.460
<v Speaker 3>He's very dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a great control of his ego.</v>

2957
02:03:01.461 --> 02:03:03.290
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't fight like a fully fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

2958
02:03:03.291 --> 02:03:06.260
<v Speaker 3>very technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His footwork is fantastic.</v>

2959
02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.660
<v Speaker 3>He's his choices that he makes it a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

2960
02:03:08.810 --> 02:03:11.510
<v Speaker 3>He's unpredictable in his movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Just,</v>

2961
02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:13.460
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

2962
02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:16.470
<v Speaker 3>He needs to guide to fight like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>carnival gregor though,</v>

2963
02:03:16.471 --> 02:03:18.710
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he has a big payday one day because</v>

2964
02:03:18.711 --> 02:03:21.170
<v Speaker 3>rafael dos anjos is going to make a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>

2965
02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:22.240
<v Speaker 3>This fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2966
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:24.200
<v Speaker 3>if a 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's really going to hit it.</v>

2967
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2968
02:03:24.911 --> 02:03:27.520
<v Speaker 3>and you watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll probably get up also if he,</v>

2969
02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 3>if for some reason mcgregor wins this</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're going to be very hard to</v>

2970
02:03:30.831 --> 02:03:33.410
<v Speaker 3>fight for him because I think a dos</v>
<v Speaker 3>anjos yeah.</v>

2971
02:03:33.411 --> 02:03:35.420
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be verY tough fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we saw with mendez.</v>

2972
02:03:35.421 --> 02:03:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll,</v>

2973
02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:36.920
<v Speaker 3>we'll noTice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing,</v>

2974
02:03:36.921 --> 02:03:38.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once it goes to the ground,</v>

2975
02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:43.840
<v Speaker 3>but you still don't know in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is so aware of where he is.</v>

2976
02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:46.400
<v Speaker 3>When he fought mendez and I talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about mcgregor,</v>

2977
02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:48.720
<v Speaker 3>he was Just laying on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2978
02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:51.060
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even try to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like he said,</v>

2979
02:03:51.070 --> 02:03:52.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to run out of gas.</v>

2980
02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Mendez tooK that fight on two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>

2981
02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Just different as you could have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2982
02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:57.950
<v Speaker 3>But he knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2983
02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.140
<v Speaker 3>He knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2984
02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to carry it into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second round and I'm going to get them,</v>

2985
02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:02.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even try.</v>

2986
02:04:03.230 --> 02:04:06.020
<v Speaker 3>So I think once against the rafael dos</v>
<v Speaker 3>anjos yeah,</v>

2987
02:04:06.021 --> 02:04:07.370
<v Speaker 3>he's going to need this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go into the garden.</v>

2988
02:04:07.590 --> 02:04:10.460
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different aniMal.</v>

2989
02:04:10.461 --> 02:04:12.470
<v Speaker 3>He'll be there every minute of every</v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

2990
02:04:12.471 --> 02:04:14.660
<v Speaker 3>He'd be There for 25 minutes trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill you.</v>

2991
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dos anjos is a fucking animal man.</v>

2992
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:18.980
<v Speaker 3>He's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different animal.</v>

2993
02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Totally different kind of a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm so curious as to how that's going</v>

2994
02:04:23.071 --> 02:04:26.030
<v Speaker 3>to play out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look aT how obsessed connor is</v>

2995
02:04:26.031 --> 02:04:31.031
<v Speaker 3>with footwork and movement and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>smooth and fast and laying like one of</v>

2996
02:04:31.671 --> 02:04:34.220
<v Speaker 3>the things that he said when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing them after the fight,</v>

2997
02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.690
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no power lucy,</v>

2998
02:04:35.691 --> 02:04:37.100
<v Speaker 3>that no power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just precision,</v>

2999
02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 3>just precision.</v>

3000
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 5>Like all those come out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just drops out,</v>

3001
02:04:39.901 --> 02:04:40.950
<v Speaker 5>punch in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3002
02:04:40.951 --> 02:04:42.930
<v Speaker 5>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not grunting.</v>

3003
02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:45.900
<v Speaker 5>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just drops it in and boom.</v>

3004
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:48.840
<v Speaker 5>It takes them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is I see him everywhere,</v>

3005
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 5>so I hope he's not gonna make the rousey</v>
<v Speaker 5>mistake because I said it two weeks</v>

3006
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what she's doing is not good.</v>

3007
02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.350
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every talk show every mexican I go to</v>

3008
02:04:58.351 --> 02:05:00.780
<v Speaker 5>the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three magazine covers.</v>

3009
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>iT's insane.</v>

3010
02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Stopped doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3011
02:05:03.781 --> 02:05:05.220
<v Speaker 5>fight first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight first.</v>

3012
02:05:05.221 --> 02:05:06.630
<v Speaker 5>That makes you big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3013
02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 5>once you lose that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the other stuff that you're doing</v>

3014
02:05:09.271 --> 02:05:12.240
<v Speaker 5>right now is going to go as well because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want that champion,</v>

3015
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:13.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so mcgregor,</v>

3016
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:18.830
<v Speaker 5>I hope that he keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stays focused and only picks the ones</v>

3017
02:05:19.081 --> 02:05:21.810
<v Speaker 5>that he needs to do contractually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's It.</v>

3018
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:24.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's going to be a lot smarter</v>

3019
02:05:24.031 --> 02:05:24.370
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

3020
02:05:24.370 --> 02:05:28.080
<v Speaker 5>I think rhonda just got overwhelmed with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amount of superstardom that came her</v>

3021
02:05:28.081 --> 02:05:29.590
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unprecedented him.</v>

3022
02:05:29.591 --> 02:05:31.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's never been an athlete like that</v>

3023
02:05:31.351 --> 02:05:33.570
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This female ass kicker who's on top of</v>

3024
02:05:33.571 --> 02:05:36.420
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean she was a new thing and because</v>

3025
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:38.320
<v Speaker 5>of that there were so many temptations</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3026
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:40.460
<v Speaker 5>and that's why for her it's also what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3027
02:05:40.461 --> 02:05:41.610
<v Speaker 5>so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When she lost,</v>

3028
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:44.220
<v Speaker 5>she was such a high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3029
02:05:44.221 --> 02:05:46.790
<v Speaker 5>and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there you have such a low that well does</v>

3030
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:49.420
<v Speaker 5>the auto,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is how your opponents could have</v>

3031
02:05:49.421 --> 02:05:50.580
<v Speaker 5>felt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3032
02:05:50.581 --> 02:05:53.130
<v Speaker 5>and I think that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want one side,</v>

3033
02:05:53.131 --> 02:05:56.370
<v Speaker 5>it's really good for her because now she</v>
<v Speaker 5>understands that now she's going to go,</v>

3034
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.240
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3035
02:05:57.330 --> 02:05:59.040
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tasted the other side.</v>

3036
02:05:59.350 --> 02:06:00.700
<v Speaker 5>You're going to make you a better</v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

3037
02:06:00.701 --> 02:06:02.520
<v Speaker 5>Then you start reminiscing about all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

3038
02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Did I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3039
02:06:03.571 --> 02:06:06.240
<v Speaker 5>what I owe and that interview I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

3040
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3041
02:06:08.041 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 5>those things are backfiring once you</v>
<v Speaker 5>said losing as mcgregor,</v>

3042
02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.440
<v Speaker 5>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although with him there's always.</v>

3043
02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:15.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3044
02:06:15.930 --> 02:06:18.030
<v Speaker 5>with rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's real,</v>

3045
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:19.140
<v Speaker 5>like real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real,</v>

3046
02:06:19.141 --> 02:06:22.320
<v Speaker 5>but mcgregor said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will he do the reason is so</v>

3047
02:06:22.321 --> 02:06:23.154
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He good?</v>

3048
02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:25.410
<v Speaker 5>Is he in his mind?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He truly lives.</v>

3049
02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:27.090
<v Speaker 5>There's no way he could lose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3050
02:06:27.091 --> 02:06:29.850
<v Speaker 5>and a guy was a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mendez hit them hard.</v>

3051
02:06:30.330 --> 02:06:35.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean heart and he didn't even flinch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was no zero,</v>

3052
02:06:35.011 --> 02:06:36.600
<v Speaker 5>no movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

3053
02:06:36.690 --> 02:06:39.990
<v Speaker 5>It was the craziest thing we sell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mendez took out ricardo lopez,</v>

3054
02:06:40.530 --> 02:06:43.470
<v Speaker 5>ricardo lamas rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>luggage mendez.</v>

3055
02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.640
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a hard area.</v>

3056
02:06:45.730 --> 02:06:48.390
<v Speaker 5>Connor Just eats it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Each on the tip of his job.</v>

3057
02:06:48.710 --> 02:06:50.410
<v Speaker 5>It was not like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just crazy.</v>

3058
02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:51.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his chart,</v>

3059
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:52.500
<v Speaker 5>his jaw is incredible.</v>

3060
02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:55.650
<v Speaker 5>His mind is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so fascinated by that fight.</v>

3061
02:06:55.710 --> 02:06:56.880
<v Speaker 5>so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

3062
02:06:57.130 --> 02:06:59.080
<v Speaker 5>we're one for one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes to order.</v>

3063
02:06:59.110 --> 02:07:01.650
<v Speaker 5>We all go to work all the way back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he said that,</v>

3064
02:07:01.710 --> 02:07:04.100
<v Speaker 5>remember in boston was that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

3065
02:07:04.130 --> 02:07:06.500
<v Speaker 5>that's where he got me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when roadway.</v>

3066
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:07.081
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3067
02:07:07.081 --> 02:07:08.800
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why we got to worry about on the</v>

3068
02:07:08.801 --> 02:07:11.570
<v Speaker 5>inside of way we wanted and then the</v>
<v Speaker 5>next time it wasn't inside mma.</v>

3069
02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:12.061
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He was so happy.</v>

3072
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.990
<v Speaker 5>He got his name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And did you ever see the video?</v>

3073
02:07:19.290 --> 02:07:21.450

<v Speaker 4>So he walks over,</v>

3085
02:07:43.931 --> 02:07:46.150
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she comes with a coconut and there's a</v>

3086
02:07:46.151 --> 02:07:48.310
<v Speaker 4>hole in there that put a little cork</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing in there.</v>

3087
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:50.560
<v Speaker 4>So he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>

3088
02:07:51.450 --> 02:07:52.760
<v Speaker 4>He never saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coconut.</v>

3089
02:07:53.210 --> 02:07:57.180
<v Speaker 4>So they pull the thing I think with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>straw and go or no way.</v>

3090
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 4>You think they did this for a bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I have to fight a brazilian guy</v>

3091
02:08:01.751 --> 02:08:04.720
<v Speaker 4>and that's why they put their start</v>
<v Speaker 4>reminiscing and that is a knock on the</v>

3092
02:08:04.721 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He opened the door and he has the</v>

3093
02:08:07.361 --> 02:08:10.180
<v Speaker 4>cognitive dissonance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This trainer at a trade that sees the</v>

3094
02:08:10.181 --> 02:08:11.280
<v Speaker 4>co,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does her,</v>

3095
02:08:11.490 --> 02:08:12.820
<v Speaker 4>the trader goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>

3096
02:08:13.770 --> 02:08:16.780
<v Speaker 4>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is so funny.</v>

3097
02:08:16.781 --> 02:08:18.040
<v Speaker 4>And then you see him at the attic.</v>

3098
02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:23.040
<v Speaker 4>He lifts at the attic from his mom and</v>
<v Speaker 4>dad with his wife the attic and he's</v>

3099
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:28.270
<v Speaker 4>putting a suit on and he's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out a thing in the pocket,</v>

3100
02:08:28.271 --> 02:08:28.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

3101
02:08:28.931 --> 02:08:30.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3102
02:08:30.761 --> 02:08:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in a few years from now,</v>

3103
02:08:32.711 --> 02:08:34.110
<v Speaker 4>I will say though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3104
02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:37.330
<v Speaker 4>this becomes second nature and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>see him now.</v>

3105
02:08:38.050 --> 02:08:41.710
<v Speaker 4>How cool is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're really there and now all the way</v>

3106

<v Speaker 4>up there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was talking to dana on the phone today</v>

3109
02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:50.680
<v Speaker 4>and dana was saying he's going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first guy to make $100,000,000,</v>

3110

<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

3111

<v Speaker 4>$5 million and all those going back to</v>

<v Speaker 4>probably like who knows,</v>

3113
02:08:59.471 --> 02:09:00.320
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

3114
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:01.690
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3116
02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:04.690

<v Speaker 4>people in Brazil with that money to.</v>

3119
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you bring That money to</v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

3120
02:09:12.761 --> 02:09:17.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean $5,000,000,000 in los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get it in house and then it's</v>

3121
02:09:18.821 --> 02:09:21.490
<v Speaker 4>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in Brazil he can,</v>

3122
02:09:21.491 --> 02:09:23.350
<v Speaker 4>he can hold onto that money for a long</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3123
02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:25.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows how much current is going to</v>

3124
02:09:25.271 --> 02:09:28.240
<v Speaker 4>make in this dos dos anjos fight and</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if he loses you still defenses,</v>

3125
02:09:28.241 --> 02:09:29.980
<v Speaker 4>featherweight title,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is crazy.</v>

3126
02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:32.500
<v Speaker 4>What if he fucking wins?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he fucking winter,</v>

3127
02:09:32.530 --> 02:09:34.840
<v Speaker 4>then he goes up and fights robbie lawler</v>
<v Speaker 4>at welterweight.</v>

3128
02:09:35.130 --> 02:09:37.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wonder boy,</v>

3129
02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:39.940
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what a boy has.</v>

3130
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.190
<v Speaker 4>The same kind of timing that he asked is</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

3131
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:47.230
<v Speaker 4>I always talk about distance as</v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday in my class.</v>

3132
02:09:47.231 --> 02:09:49.540
<v Speaker 4>I said again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most important thing if fighting</v>

3133
02:09:49.541 --> 02:09:51.640
<v Speaker 4>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep your nose pointed to your opponent</v>

3134
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:56.910
<v Speaker 4>because if you say ice that they think</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking away dishes is not keep you full</v>

3135
02:09:56.951 --> 02:10:00.190
<v Speaker 4>vision and distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know if you,</v>

3136
02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 4>if you manage to stay just outside this</v>
<v Speaker 4>reach and then you can counter,</v>

3137
02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:05.920
<v Speaker 4>it's golden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>

3138
02:10:06.070 --> 02:10:11.070
<v Speaker 4>You know what a boy wonder boy has that</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one has his karate kicks.</v>

3139
02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:14.020
<v Speaker 4>He's got the front leg side kick to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

3140
02:10:14.021 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 4>the front leg roundhouse kick to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>face when he was fucking Johnny</v>

3141
02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Hendricks up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He front leg side,</v>

3142
02:10:18.931 --> 02:10:21.250
<v Speaker 4>kick them to the body and then frontline</v>
<v Speaker 4>roundhouse kicked him in the face.</v>

3143
02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:23.140
<v Speaker 4>You can see hendrix was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3144
02:10:23.141 --> 02:10:24.330
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3145
02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:27.420
<v Speaker 4>he kicks in a way that no one does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

3146
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:30.250
<v Speaker 4>Like when he wheeled kicked allen burger</v>
<v Speaker 4>ellenberger was saying before that</v>

3147
02:10:30.251 --> 02:10:31.480
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those kicks are a waste of time.</v>

3148
02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:32.980
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a waste of energy.</v>

3149
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.823
<v Speaker 4>All that spinning stuff.</v>

3150
02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:38.750
<v Speaker 3>He'll kick some</v>
<v Speaker 3>hope solo is a big fan.</v>

<v Speaker 3>out moment like where you really got to</v>

<v Speaker 3>so to have a guy like weidman training,</v>

3187
02:12:04.530 --> 02:12:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I knew that they do a lot of training</v>
<v Speaker 3>sessions at hofstra.</v>

3188
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:08.510

<v Speaker 3>work with the wrestling,</v>

3189
02:12:08.890 --> 02:12:11.930
<v Speaker 3>but that's what he needed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needed to be able to confidently stay</v>

3190
02:12:11.931 --> 02:12:15.500
<v Speaker 3>on his feet and not worry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>executing the kicks because you see them</v>

3191
02:12:15.501 --> 02:12:17.480
<v Speaker 3>earlier in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just didn't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but it's so unusual because iT's hands</v>

3198
02:12:34.281 --> 02:12:36.710
<v Speaker 3>down and loose and in and out like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>snake.</v>

3199
02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Trying to find a guy who emulates those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean leona machida is obviously got</v>

3200
02:12:42.171 --> 02:12:45.800
<v Speaker 3>great karate skill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wonder boys on another level.</v>

3201
02:12:46.130 --> 02:12:50.150
<v Speaker 3>it's like several levels past that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The combinations that guy throws.</v>

3202
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Like when he hit hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's tagging them and then as he slide</v>

3203
02:12:53.661 --> 02:12:55.600
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roundhouse kicks them in the body and</v>

3204
02:12:55.610 --> 02:12:58.850
<v Speaker 3>then he slides back in and hit them with</v>
<v Speaker 3>another combination and then he slides</v>

3205
02:12:58.851 --> 02:13:01.310
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slides back in again and hendrix is just</v>

3206
02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.770
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never saw anybody do that to hendrix.</v>

3207
02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>

3208
02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:10.540
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting to try with guys like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that elvis said this with cheeto show</v>

3209
02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:15.450
<v Speaker 3>and even with conor mcgregor and when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought aldo and,</v>

3210
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:17.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in this case now as well,</v>

3211
02:13:17.570 --> 02:13:20.030
<v Speaker 3>because the stance is so karate white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3212
02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:24.350
<v Speaker 3>But it's a karate with low kicks there</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to here iN America,</v>

3213
02:13:24.850 --> 02:13:25.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm,</v>

3214
02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I said to my buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine that I'm the camp former aldo</v>

3215
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:34.860
<v Speaker 3>said four months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3216
02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:38.070
<v Speaker 3>you're going to face mcgregor eventually</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to happen.</v>

3217
02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's switch you to south pole so we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>use your left low kicks.</v>

3218
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:43.380
<v Speaker 3>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they stand,</v>

3219
02:13:43.650 --> 02:13:48.000
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be very hard for them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get away from low kicks on the outside</v>

3220
02:13:49.010 --> 02:13:52.040
<v Speaker 3>inside is easy because what mcgregor</v>
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

3221
02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:56.460
<v Speaker 3>he lowers himself and once his knee goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the same line as this,</v>

3222
02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:58.410
<v Speaker 3>but so to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

3223
02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:01.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any space to land that</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside located.</v>

3224
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:03.660
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you angle it up,</v>

3225
02:14:03.661 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 3>the angle is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but low kicks in that stand outside</v>

3226
02:14:07.801 --> 02:14:10.290
<v Speaker 3>located outside low kicks froM the</v>
<v Speaker 3>southpaw stance,</v>

3227
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:12.420
<v Speaker 3>from a southpaw stance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful loki.</v>

3228
02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:14.370
<v Speaker 3>So that lag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you stop the legs,</v>

3229
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:17.400
<v Speaker 3>you're going stop every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well nikki holtz getting Raymond Daniels</v>

3230
02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:19.440
<v Speaker 3>because raymond danIels is a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar style.</v>

3231
02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Daniels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it was a karate champion as</v>

3232
02:14:21.511 --> 02:14:25.440
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable kicking Talent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nikki hall skin stays glued to him</v>

3233
02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:27.780
<v Speaker 3>and throws leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just chops them down,</v>

3234
02:14:27.781 --> 02:14:29.160
<v Speaker 3>chops them down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>champs him down,</v>

3235
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:30.150
<v Speaker 3>and then beats them up.</v>

3236
02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:33.690
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same thing with joseph</v>
<v Speaker 3>valtellina st did the same thing with</v>

3237
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Raymond Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3238
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Chop them down with low kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chop them down with low kicks.</v>

3239
02:14:37.141 --> 02:14:40.170
<v Speaker 3>And then he had ticked them and knocked</v>
<v Speaker 3>them out of linea is also something.</v>
