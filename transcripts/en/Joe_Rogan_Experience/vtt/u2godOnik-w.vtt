<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience are you?</v>

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.061
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you have to do.</v>

3
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>This is my new theory.</v>

4
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Identify the vampire in your life.</v>

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Find The van Pyre.</v>

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Identify the parasite.</v>

7
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have to be that you have parasites in life.</v>

8
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It is possible that you could have gotten lucky and there's no parasites and you</v>

9
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>get off groovy.</v>

10
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.961
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

11
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

12
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying everyone's got one,</v>

13
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>but if you got one,</v>

14
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking around with those fucking vampire blues,</v>

15
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you've got the fucking heavy heart and you and you can't feel happy and you feel</v>

16
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

17
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>there may be an action that you need to take that you're afraid to take.</v>

18
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the vampire and you've got to fucking not even a person.</v>

19
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

20
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a situation,</v>

21
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.763
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

22
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

23
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a vampire in your life.</v>

24
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Find a life sucking situation that you're afraid to kill.</v>

25
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I say vampires because vampire is only go or they're invited.</v>

26
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>And generally the situation that you're in,</v>

27
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you invited it in,</v>

28
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>you invited this thing into your life and now it's sucking your life energy and</v>

29
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>your blood and your happiness away.</v>

30
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

31
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's in.</v>

32
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you'll try to believe,</v>

33
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll try to convince yourself that this thing is not a vampire,</v>

34
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.071
<v Speaker 1>but in your heart,</v>

35
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.904
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a servant to a fucking blood sucker.</v>

37
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Urn felt this thing is like sucking your life as it's away.</v>

38
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's doing it with a trade.</v>

39
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Quite often there'll be a bad trade.</v>

40
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.731
<v Speaker 1>You'll be,</v>

41
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:24.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever the situation you're in and you'll,</v>

43
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.871
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

44
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

45
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel like you're in this situation.</v>

46
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.161
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

48
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.851
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of bad,</v>

49
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:30.684
<v Speaker 1>but it's totally worth it.</v>

50
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>This happens with jobs quite often,</v>

51
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:33.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:33.361
<v Speaker 1>or you're like,</v>

53
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:33.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:33.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's good enough.</v>

56
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the vampires.</v>

57
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>You got to take a fucking stake and drive it into its art too.</v>

58
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>How do you kill a vampire?</v>

59
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Two ways.</v>

60
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Direct Action.</v>

61
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't kill a vampire by like making up with a vampire.</v>

62
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't kill a vampire by like having a sit down talk with a vampire.</v>

63
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to like,</v>

64
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>make friends with the vampire.</v>

68
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>There's two ways to kill a vampire.</v>

69
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

70
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you fucking,</v>

71
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>put a stake in its heart.</v>

75
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>The other one is light sunlight,</v>

76
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.483
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

77
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>light that it's the greatest metaphor of all time.</v>

78
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>You shine the light of truth onto the situation,</v>

79
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>fearlessly analyze it and then you'll destroy it.</v>

80
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>because if you really allow yourself a few can act.</v>

82
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>You got to add the real problem with people is not recognizing the enemy.</v>

83
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>It's acting on that enemy.</v>

84
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>

85
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>That enemy being,</v>

86
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:24.931
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

88
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>your personal demons,</v>

89
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

90
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>your personal jihad.</v>

91
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a personal issue.</v>

92
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>You got to fight the beast and it's,</v>

93
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>and you know what I mean?</v>

94
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody's beast is different.</v>

95
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Chapter two of the Bhagavad Gita.</v>

96
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.401
<v Speaker 1>Arjun,</v>

97
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>as dejection arginine has drawn between these two forces.</v>

98
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>He does not want to fight.</v>

99
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>He drops his bow and God says to him,</v>

100
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you've got rise to the fight.</v>

101
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

102
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>You're a warrior.</v>

103
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're here for.</v>

104
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.693
<v Speaker 1>Fight,</v>

105
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.280
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

106
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

107
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>It's better to die.</v>

108
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>It's better to die in a righteous battle.</v>

109
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Then goes skulking off into the fucking woods and be a beggar.</v>

110
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It's better to fucking do what you do on,</v>

111
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:00.791
<v Speaker 1>you're a warrior.</v>

112
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>You got to fucking do it,</v>

113
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

114
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>It fucking sucks.</v>

115
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>When when you're drunk and you want to throw up and you try to not make yourself</v>

116
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:08.914
<v Speaker 1>throw up,</v>

117
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>just throw up.</v>

118
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel better.</v>

119
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel better in the end.</v>

120
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:13.361
<v Speaker 1>When you're puking,</v>

121
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>it's going to suck because you're helpless and you can't breathe.</v>

122
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.241
<v Speaker 1>Go through it,</v>

123
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

124
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Fucking jab a fucking knife into the foot.</v>

125
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Not Literally of course,</v>

126
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

127
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>you got to act and you've got to make the big fucking decisions sometimes.</v>

128
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:24.634
<v Speaker 1>And it's scary.</v>

129
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't scary,</v>

130
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be worth anything.</v>

131
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>For some people it's almost like they don't know how to start.</v>

133
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>They know that there's action that they need to take in their life,</v>

134
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>but they're paralyzed trying to think about it,</v>

135
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how to start,</v>

136
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>and they can never gather up the courage to get away.</v>

137
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like what saw a lot of people stay in abusive relationships.</v>

138
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.301
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

139
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the courage to lead.</v>

140
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.271
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

141
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's scary and it in it and it seems like it,</v>

142
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:48.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that people will like w ideas people will create,</v>

144
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>they'll keep you trapped and whatever.</v>

145
00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Prison,</v>

146
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>urine,</v>

147
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar to um,</v>

148
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.031
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

149
00:03:57.031 --> 00:03:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

150
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.690
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about in the UFC with these fucking fighters,</v>

151
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.440
<v Speaker 1>this is a visual representation of what anyone can do in their life,</v>

152
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>but you're not getting,</v>

153
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe not all of us are going to get obviously be worldclass fighters.</v>

154
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>He in a ring in front of the entire planet and fucking knock someone out.</v>

155
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.200
<v Speaker 1>But you have in your life right now,</v>

156
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't already done this,</v>

157
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.700
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

158
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 1>you have the chance to be heroic.</v>

159
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>You have the ability right now to make a heroic act.</v>

160
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.140
<v Speaker 1>They could kill you.</v>

161
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.340
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

162
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.061
<v Speaker 1>these actions,</v>

163
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not always guaranteed that because you do the right thing,</v>

164
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up in a great place.</v>

165
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You might end up fucked.</v>

166
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>You might end up,</v>

167
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you might end up temporarily in a homeless or you might end up temporarily</v>

168
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>jobless.</v>

169
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>If there wasn't risk associated with it,</v>

170
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>you would've already done it.</v>

171
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.793
<v Speaker 1>That's the point,</v>

172
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>if there wasn't a risk associated with,</v>

174
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be worth anything.</v>

175
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

176
