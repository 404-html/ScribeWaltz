1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.550
<v Speaker 2>it was a place in Australia and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the property owners like the ranch has</v>

3
00:00:07.551 --> 00:00:10.610
<v Speaker 2>called me up and they said you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out and shoot some of the boxes.</v>

4
00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Like they'd devastating our lambs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 2>I end up going out there and when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving in with a full drive at night</v>

6
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 2>with the high beams on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seen this massive big black and white</v>

7
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:24.230
<v Speaker 2>ball walking between the flock of sheep</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a laminates mouth.</v>

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 2>It was these pig and it got a taste for</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat and it happens all the time.</v>

9
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Like so a big bore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a mature animal,</v>

10
00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 2>will get a taste for meat in harsh</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

11
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:37.310
<v Speaker 2>And now just stick the meat after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ended up catching up with these pig</v>

12
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 2>the next morning and shot it with a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually attacked me.</v>

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>The first shot wasn't perfect and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>charged me and I ended up stabbing it to</v>

14
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:44.834
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Speaker 2>I was on a slope like this on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain cheese and it was really a</v>

16
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 2>battle like high end up hooking the ball</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of my hand because when he charged</v>

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 2>me I'll put an Arrow and shot and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>went down one side and hit one lung and</v>

18
00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 2>it just infuriated this bowl and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>on me and when I was sending him off</v>

19
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 2>with the bow is tasked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the bottom of the bow or the</v>

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 2>cam or something like that and rip the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bow out of my hand and I ended up</v>

21
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>getting a knife off me and I ended up</v>
<v Speaker 2>stabbing this pig was electronic.</v>

22
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Run me over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

23
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 2>How big was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big boys like big mountain.</v>

24
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 2>It made eight and bullet like this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many pounds,</v>

25
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking big 10.</v>

26
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Many pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not 300 hour mountain bullshit.</v>

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Get real solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 2>probably $200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

29
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

30
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I ended up stabbing this thing to death</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I ended up cutting it open,</v>

31
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>it's whole insides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's whole stomach was like lambs</v>

32
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 2>hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the feet,</v>

33
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the feet where they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>swallow and skulls and just like little</v>

34
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 2>bits of wool and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd just been going around and just</v>

35
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 2>picking these lambs often killing them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a really known occurrence in</v>

36
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Australia and how that if things get</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

37
00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 2>I would just go just because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just absolutely ruthless.</v>

38
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I would just walk right between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep and just fucking grab a land walk</v>

39
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 2>off of chewed up and Ada.</v>

40
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much comes out in the fucking</v>

41
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

42
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>That's where the next note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or swamp thing happened while I was</v>

43
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>thinking this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they found out that in some plants</v>

44
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>some plants contain DNA from salmon</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the salmon were used as</v>

45
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer by the plant as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>decomposed.</v>

46
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It got into the actual plant itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can actually somehow or another</v>

47
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>through some sort of scientific process</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm too stupid to understand.</v>

48
00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 1>They can actually detect salmon in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual plant itself.</v>

49
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>We're close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were whacking off on that tree</v>

50
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and that tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everyday.</v>

51
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>That's your spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went down to that titty tree and</v>

52
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>whacked off on the roots and then like</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a while you did an analysis and</v>

53
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>you found your dna in the tree itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine.</v>

54
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be great,</v>

55
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it maintains the information of</v>

56
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 1>everything that whacked off on it.</v>

57
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>You have a little son made out of wood</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day mom,</v>

58
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kid in our town one time.</v>

59
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Does he go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a son a wooden shirt that I tell</v>

60
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:04.310
<v Speaker 1>you that a wooden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

61
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made his son a shirt out of plywood</v>

62
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want a kid to wear it?</v>

63
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

64
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I was um,</v>

65
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a stiff shirt or is it you make it</v>

66
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>like little itty bitty tiny pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>plywood and weave it all together?</v>

67
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty stiff and the dad was a um,</v>

68
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.160
<v Speaker 1>like an Elvis impersonator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

69
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.140
<v Speaker 1>But Dad was an Elvis impersonator at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>casino or did he do it at carnivals this</v>

70
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.470
<v Speaker 1>locally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't even meet him that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

72
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>no money really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably an alcoholic,</v>

73
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>but he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had four kids and one of them he</v>

74
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

75
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I was going walking home one night and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard them in the garage and he's making</v>

76
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.210
<v Speaker 1>like a son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

77
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>like a for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a wooden shirt,</v>

78
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.360
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

79
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.430

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

83
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.150

<v Speaker 1>like a sculpture.</v>

84
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

85
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Can you just get one more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>

86
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>like if you go over someone's house and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a wooden shirt on a hanger,</v>

87
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>like and they think that's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just leave.</v>

88
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Now people are assholes now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kid needed it because people used</v>

89
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>to this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that salmon?</v>

90
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a framed wouldn't shirt.</v>

91
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>It looks like we used to beat him up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was wooden shirt now people</v>

92
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:25.520
<v Speaker 1>used to beat him up anyway on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the wouldn't share.</v>

93
00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>It would protect you from a lot of shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it helped and it helped.</v>

94
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.940
<v Speaker 1>He didn't wear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't.</v>

95
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better shut the fuck.</v>

96
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not walking around with wood over</v>

97
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>his body like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Today.</v>

98
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>This was your pads inside of it looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy.</v>

100
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

101
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his dad is estee lauder ladies</v>

102
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to play devil's advocate here so that</v>

103
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>that stuff that comes in those dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>pills and you can get from other</v>

104
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.200
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happens to be in those days.</v>

105
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>You certainly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

106
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is one narrative that you took</v>

107
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>clear that you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's in these dick pills.</v>

108
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>

109
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's in such a small amount in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and it wasn't in his body before</v>

110
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't in his body after which</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that it was only in his body and</v>

111
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:12.290
<v Speaker 1>extremely small amounts for a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>window amount,</v>

112
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but a small window of time.</v>

113
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like he had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like this stuff,</v>

114
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>which is a metabolite which is showing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to the body,</v>

115
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>the body responding to the steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let me ask this,</v>

116
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

117
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Why does no other fighter have any Pico</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pico grant that this pulsating effect</v>

118
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean other tested.</v>

120
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir tested positive for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

121
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Tom Law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our tests,</v>

122
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but Frank Mir didn't go through the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps that Jon Jones did.</v>

123
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:48.991
<v Speaker 1>He didn't provide them with A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the exact there was.</v>

124
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.050
<v Speaker 1>There was something that John did also</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lowered his sentencing reform it.</v>

125
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cooperating with Usada yeah.</v>

126
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or agreeing to cooperate with Usada.</v>

127
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That then were just cool with that.</v>

128
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what that means.</v>

129
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me ask you this.</v>

130
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>If I agreed to Usada to be an informant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snitches get stitches.</v>

131
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're John,</v>

132
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>that no one can beat you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're fine.</v>

133
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

134
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>the only way I can inform you is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that have that,</v>

135
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that I know of,</v>

136
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I can inform you of just stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

137
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>you lay shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what I asked Novitsky I was</v>

138
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't do anything wrong,</v>

139
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what is he going to offer?</v>

140
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless he took something,</v>

141
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>unless you know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm an informant for the FBI or</v>

142
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 1>for the feds for cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my cocaine,</v>

143
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get joe blow.</v>

144
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>That makes my fucking express so we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the guy who knows the ins and outs</v>

145
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>of cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's again,</v>

146
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.261
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

147
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:00.270
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

148
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Before they have a conversation with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says he can provide them with</v>

149
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 1>information with how guys are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>away with passing truck to.</v>

150
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And how would you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're in on that?</v>

151
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>

152
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me all of this is a little too much</v>

153
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>of a coincidence that the best fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet earth has these issues.</v>

154
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 1>The best fight in the planet earth also</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran away from a hit and run.</v>

155
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Smash into a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke her arm.</v>

156
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.090
<v Speaker 1>He also drove his car into a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a reckless person who takes a lot</v>

157
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>of chances and he does some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the past,</v>

158
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>has done some things that are not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>

159
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>This could fall under that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could fall in correct.</v>

160
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Or I began to play devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not accusing them of anything.</v>

161
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's play devil's advocate or a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that Lucy goosey outside the</v>

162
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've taken some performance</v>

163
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>enhancing things because that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the similar traits.</v>

164
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

165
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.130
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain things that this</v>

166
00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.210
<v Speaker 3>administration is doing foreign policy</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise that I think are good.</v>

167
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are other things that I think you</v>

168
00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:06.820
<v Speaker 3>just leave you scratching your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

169
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.710
<v Speaker 3>but that's like every administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess my point is we've gotten away</v>

170
00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:11.850
<v Speaker 3>from that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

171
00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I have conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go out to dinner with folks that,</v>

172
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:14.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

173
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:16.560
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the hard left.</v>

174
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.480
<v Speaker 3>And when you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fully believe,</v>

175
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.990
<v Speaker 3>fully believe that president trump is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian puppet,</v>

176
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 3>a winning asset of Putin who is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing Putin's bidding.</v>

177
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.360
<v Speaker 3>And they honestly honestly believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nothing is going to shift them off</v>

178
00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:36.490
<v Speaker 3>that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have a,</v>

179
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of frame of reference,</v>

180
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the ability to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything rationally and say,</v>

181
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.451
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

182
00:08:42.451 --> 00:08:45.300
<v Speaker 3>I like this policy related to China.</v>

183
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.780
<v Speaker 3>It's about time we call them out and say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you obviously have not been a fair</v>

184
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:50.880
<v Speaker 3>trading partner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that every</v>

185
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:53.460
<v Speaker 3>administration has agreed to but has</v>
<v Speaker 3>never done anything about.</v>

186
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 3>So you would think that everybody will</v>
<v Speaker 3>be to say makes sense.</v>

187
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

188
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Everybody should be able to say the</v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration system here in the states is</v>

189
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 3>somewhat dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It needs fixing.</v>

190
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's talked about that and yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't do it because they've got</v>

191
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this mindset that,</v>

192
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 3>that that prevents them from having any</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of conversation,</v>

193
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 3>any sort of rational discussion that</v>
<v Speaker 3>could lead to some compromise that could</v>

194
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 3>then advance the ball and make the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government more functional.</v>

195
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.323
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

196
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even ready for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's</v>

197
00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:28.190
<v Speaker 4>animated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on youtube now.</v>

198
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.660
<v Speaker 4>Have you and him coming over your house</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a limousine and us.</v>

199
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.770
<v Speaker 4>It was a lion or a tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tiger.</v>

200
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Tiger dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is one of the craziest fucking</v>

201
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:41.450
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always win.</v>

202
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.630
<v Speaker 4>So for people that don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to hang out with you at one of my</v>

203
00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:47.960
<v Speaker 4>shows one time and it was a great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had the best time talking about</v>

204
00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:50.660
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What made you think you could get a</v>

205
00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:52.700
<v Speaker 4>tiger?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how did that even happen?</v>

<v Speaker 4>so I'm in prison.</v>

210
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to my car dealer at the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he has,</v>
