<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me now.</v>

4
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

5
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's funny,</v>

6
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to tell you a funny story </v>

7
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:13.040
<v Speaker 1>about your address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be,</v>

8
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be funny for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk later about that.</v>

9
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we share African ancestry.</v>

10
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

11
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm one point six percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

13
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have more,</v>

14
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.343
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have more credentialed in math </v>

15
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>departments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your two percent,</v>

16
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny because,</v>

18
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of have your,</v>

19
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.903
<v Speaker 1>the story in your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like where he came from and </v>

20
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>everything mates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always knew I was 25 percent,</v>

21
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian.</v>

22
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.673
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew that my family came from </v>

23
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Sicily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

24
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

25
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.973
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rainelle is that came from Sicily </v>

26
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>all seemed to become kind of established</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

27
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>in the produce world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

28
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>my dad was brought up in the south side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Chicago.</v>

29
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm 44 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.534
<v Speaker 1>So think about that for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was brought up in south side of </v>

31
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Chicago and he was raised by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather who was Sicilian,</v>

32
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>had come from Sicily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his grandfather delivered produce with a</v>

33
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>horse and cart whoa in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

34
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>to have lived through that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be brought up in a house where a</v>

35
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>guy like leaves in the morning and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse and cart to deliver,</v>

36
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:26.714
<v Speaker 1>produce an end to be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to fight in world war two to be </v>

37
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:35.510
<v Speaker 1>through the atomic era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advent of the Internet.</v>

38
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.333
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I always knew that we had Sicilians </v>

39
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>when I did the genetic test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what some of those.</v>

40
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.413
<v Speaker 1>At some point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those Sicilians must have shot </v>

41
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>southward and crossed the Mediterranean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lightheaded hookup down there.</v>

42
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>that was the history of Sicily in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

44
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cecily just being Sicilian in the first </v>

45
00:01:58.311 --> 00:01:59.144
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so many people that were a </v>

46
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>impregnated by the doors and by various </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of West Africa and North Africa.</v>

47
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I should've probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always assumed,</v>

49
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't thought about it.</v>

50
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing I was reading about this </v>

51
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:15.674
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might know more about it than I </v>

52
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when you do those tests,</v>

53
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>there's missing parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>it does it like it captures what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

55
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:24.014
<v Speaker 1>But there's could be a lot there that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not captured just in the way that </v>

56
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>chromosomes are inherited and passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

57
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incomplete picture.</v>

58
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be influences.</v>

59
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>There could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be in your.</v>

60
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't create a full picture of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>lineage.</v>

61
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.263
<v Speaker 1>There could be lineages that are there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't represented in your </v>

62
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.320
<v Speaker 1>particular makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

63
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He know?</v>

64
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.303
<v Speaker 1>I hate to right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into south that I can't speak about </v>

65
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>any level of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading a piece and the piece</v>

66
00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.264
<v Speaker 1>I was reading to do it was kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissection of like what happened with </v>

67
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:06.661
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Warren when she claimed we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been going off about that on the podcast</v>

68
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like 100 times more African than</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is native American.</v>

69
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I found.</v>

70
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm 10 times more or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a piece about.</v>

71
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.283
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a piece in the times explaining </v>

72
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>like how to make sense of now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's doing these tasks,</v>

73
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>like how to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense,</v>

74
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.050
<v Speaker 1>these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

75
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.963
<v Speaker 1>but my understanding of it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have a lot of ancestry that isn't </v>

76
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.793
<v Speaker 1>captured in your genetic code and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that would be detected through the </v>

77
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
<v Speaker 1>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning there could be ancestors it for </v>

78
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you're inheriting half,</v>

79
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Harrington chromosomes from each </v>

80
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>parent in somehow you could have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be an incomplete picture.</v>

81
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>You could have ancestors that had come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from other,</v>

82
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:50.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

83
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these tests break out the world and do a</v>

84
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:52.834
<v Speaker 1>100 or some odd regions or zones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be people from those zones </v>

85
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>who were in your lineage that are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>captured in your personal,</v>

86
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>that are not captured in your genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

87
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.503
<v Speaker 1>That's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think it would all be in </v>

88
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:07.160
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a,</v>

89
00:04:07.161 --> 00:04:07.994
<v Speaker 1>an incomplete measuring tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is or is it just </v>

90
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>actually not in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

91
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to have a dude on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to understands it and as I say,</v>

93
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm off on a bad start here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

94
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm much a neanderthal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't say less than normal.</v>

95
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Really less than average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

96
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number it said it gives you what you</v>

97
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.881
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three and me,</v>

98
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

99
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

100
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I just remember it was less than average</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

101
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>and those things like our refined by how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people do,</v>

102
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:36.664
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>but it was less than average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which bummed me out,</v>

104
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hair is like a 13 year old Norwegian</v>

105
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

106
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocking,</v>

107
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.270
<v Speaker 1>didn't surprise me too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I was wishing to have a little more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that floating around in me.</v>

109
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there was a different type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human that bread with Homo sapiens </v>

111
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>and that there's little bits and pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it floating around and people.</v>

112
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people discuss them.</v>

113
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>People discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say an argument the other day where</v>

114
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:07.984
<v Speaker 1>they see a neanderthal or neanderthal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone grows up saying </v>

115
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things you're supposed</v>

116
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>to switch once you realize how you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do it,</v>

117
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neanderthal,</v>

118
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but I just can't get comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

119
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.083
<v Speaker 1>I go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of words that like that </v>

120
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're supposed to do it,</v>

121
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:22.024
<v Speaker 1>but I can't get comfortable with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like it makes you sound </v>

122
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:24.664
<v Speaker 1>pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like rolling your r's and certain </v>

123
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Spanish words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had this idea that the.</v>

124
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>We had this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neanderthals as unsuccessful.</v>

125
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.743
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

126
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>They are these brutish thugs that died </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

127
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>but they had a 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>year run in Europe alone.</v>

128
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.763
<v Speaker 1>600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years longer run than Homo sapiens have </v>

129
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 1>actually existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever.</v>

131
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that we're going to hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

132
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that we're going to match </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and have that run.</v>

133
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably have a 23 and</v>

134
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 2>me for whatever the fuck is after us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look somebody back then fuck the </v>

135
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.340
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

136
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.213
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those crazy warmonger Mexican </v>

137
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 2>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thieving humans died out.</v>

138
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 2>It turns out they didn't totally die </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

139
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Overrun with emotions and lies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

140
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 2>someone of a superior race infiltrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>the humans and banged one of them.</v>

141
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

142
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny to look at that,</v>

143
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 2>that understanding of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that understanding of those people.</v>

144
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm an end to have the site to picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your mind's eye,</v>

145
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.784
<v Speaker 2>even though you can't picture it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what was look like when they were </v>

146
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:37.270
<v Speaker 2>hooking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone are,</v>

147
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anatomically,</v>

148
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.130
<v Speaker 2>behaviorally modern humans were hooking </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with neanderthals was that was.</v>

149
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.643
<v Speaker 2>How is it perceived by their peers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet the people that we think of as </v>

150
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 2>people back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

151
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 2>you know George,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal steele is no George.</v>

152
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 2>The animal steel is a very famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress or from back in the day,</v>

153
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.273
<v Speaker 2>and I thought you were gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say It was a paleontologist or </v>

154
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 2>anthropologists Rasler just arrest pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>

155
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Very famous guy who could be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>cave man.</v>

156
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Like legitimately could be a cave man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you,</v>

157
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a good image of him.</v>

158
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.633
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I think when I think of </v>

159
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 2>people now give me a full body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day you go,</v>

160
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.663
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I think of people he's hanging </v>

161
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 2>onto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so homo sapiens,</v>

162
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Homo sapiens from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

164
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I think at George the animal steele.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there were something like that.</v>

165
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of George fucking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthal chick,</v>

166
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 2>not that far off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our idea is that like Dan rather</v>

167
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 2>would be out there banging some monkey </v>
<v Speaker 2>lady.</v>

168
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the case.</v>

169
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Like look at George's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

170
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 2>He's got the hairiest shoulders I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen in a man.</v>

171
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 2>She's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not know.</v>

172
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope he's not listening right now.</v>

173
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a legend.</v>

174
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Legend in the world with the pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>

175
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to take more notes to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>his feelings.</v>

176
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 2>That guy don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a legend.</v>

177
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in a kid in high school,</v>

178
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

179
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 2>he's olds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

180
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 2>he's a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well those guys,</v>

181
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:18.260
<v Speaker 2>they all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard way to make a at that.</v>

182
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 2>At Age 79,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a good run.</v>

183
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good run for,</v>

184
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.643
<v Speaker 2>for those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking hard way to make a </v>

185
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But have we were talking about,</v>

186
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

187
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 2>the idea of neanderthals is like having </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Ca,</v>

188
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 2>a confrontational hunting style?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

189
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we have because when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

190
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 2>when anthropologists look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skeletal remains of neanderthals,</v>

191
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:43.064
<v Speaker 2>they see this sort of suite of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern of injuries on them and a </v>

192
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:50.084
<v Speaker 2>researcher is looking at the types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractures that they have on their bones </v>

193
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 2>in where the fractures occurred and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks and cracks</v>

194
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.173
<v Speaker 1>and they're scholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was looking at all this and wound up </v>

195
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 1>working with a doctor who had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to rodeo riders,</v>

196
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.094
<v Speaker 1>bull riders and the doctor was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was observing the way in which that </v>

197
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>suite of injuries was very familiar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him from rodeo riders,</v>

198
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>the types of breaks and the location of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brakes.</v>

199
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And this guy has this idea that they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

200
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.190
<v Speaker 1>like a very confrontational hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>style that they're mixing it up with big</v>

201
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:30.504
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another thing they found is that </v>

202
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at skeletal remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>from early people,</v>

203
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.600
<v Speaker 1>you still see that separation in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>saxes right,</v>

204
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.473
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the males would suffer injuries at </v>

205
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 1>with a greater prevalence than females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with the neanderthals,</v>

206
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they didn't have the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like duplicity of roles.</v>

207
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.430
<v Speaker 1>So many of the females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the females have the same prevalence of,</v>

208
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.060
<v Speaker 1>of these types of injuries.</v>

209
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe they didn't have that,</v>

210
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't share that division of labor</v>

211
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.600
<v Speaker 1>where the females as large as the males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know that they had stone tools,</v>

213
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crude stone tools.</v>

214
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:13.614
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know whether or not they </v>

215
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>had anything that could launch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't have to.</v>

216
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.731
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

217
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:18.564
<v Speaker 1>we know if they had spears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that they've found they </v>

218
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>had adult adult and I don't know if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were hafting materials,</v>

219
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>but they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing art.</v>

220
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.633
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's a little bit of a </v>

221
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 1>debate about whether they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>representational art,</v>

222
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>but they were doing art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were doing,</v>

223
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.350
<v Speaker 1>they were probably making jewelry and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

224
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 1>these are all things that as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we kind of like wake up to what these</v>

225
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>people really like and it paints like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complicated picture.</v>

226
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.930
<v Speaker 1>There's even this theory and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if this held any water,</v>

227
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.773
<v Speaker 1>how long it was fashionable for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you had this really long history of </v>

228
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.353
<v Speaker 1>it was extremely long history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of years in the </v>

229
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>occupation in Europe and then it seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the.</v>

231
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I remember someone putting forth this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that it seemed to be that there was</v>

232
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.094
<v Speaker 1>this flourishing of advancement that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporaneous with the arrival of our </v>

233
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:14.920
<v Speaker 1>own ancestors in Europe is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.833
<v Speaker 1>they were being exposed to or seeing art</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing jewelry and mimicking this </v>

235
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>from these new invaders that were coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

236
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know where that idea sits </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

237
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.923
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's been dispelled </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of other discoveries and </v>

238
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.314
<v Speaker 1>everything does an interesting idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would then it kind of paints this </v>

239
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>really sad picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>That they would be sort of in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>autumn,</v>

241
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their existence and here's these </v>

242
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:40.914
<v Speaker 1>adorned people showing up with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing tool kits and all these </v>

243
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>abilities and kind of struggling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start a catch up,</v>

244
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like the country Bumpkin,</v>

245
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the big city and.</v>

246
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there was also this idea,</v>

247
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.233
<v Speaker 2>I think up until very recently that </v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals were not as violent as </v>

248
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.684
<v Speaker 2>humans as homo sapiens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now there was an article that was </v>

249
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.733
<v Speaker 2>published just a couple of days ago that</v>
<v Speaker 2>new evidence shows that neanderthals </v>

250
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 2>like internet and tall violence between </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

251
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.330
<v Speaker 2>It was just as bad as homosapians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 2>And find that in evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannibalism.</v>

253
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of that.</v>

254
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:16.084
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scraping of inside of the skulls </v>

255
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 2>indicative of tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

256
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:21.334
<v Speaker 2>ad blocker got busted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get us every time with the fucking </v>

257
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 2>ad blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

258
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.843
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

259
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.553
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans are just as violent as </v>

260
00:12:32.811 --> 00:12:33.590
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals.</v>

261
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.480
<v Speaker 4>Are you familiar with the writer John Mu</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allen?</v>

262
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.490
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd like his stuff.</v>

263
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:38.683
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a really beautiful piece about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a really beautiful piece about </v>

264
00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:42.380
<v Speaker 4>neanderthals not long ago.</v>

265
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked it up.</v>

266
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.730
<v Speaker 2>What they're saying is that modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans were just as prone to violence as</v>

267
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:49.920
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem.</v>

268
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm conflating this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else that I read about.</v>

269
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Inter Inter interspecies violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthal on neanderthal violence.</v>

270
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.430
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that's weird about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they had bigger brains than us,</v>

271
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.220
<v Speaker 2>they had bigger brains and they would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like five,</v>

272
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.160
<v Speaker 2>seven and weighed 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just jacked.</v>

273
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Just a little gorilla thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

274
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.213
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a really dumb theory that was </v>

275
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:18.570
<v Speaker 2>being bounced around a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really hilarious about how,</v>

276
00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:19.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wiped out.</v>

277
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.453
<v Speaker 2>We assumed that neanderthals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't have any soft tissue </v>

278
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:23.244
<v Speaker 2>samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen that neanderthals looked </v>

279
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.553
<v Speaker 2>similar to humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of the very different shape </v>

280
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:29.274
<v Speaker 2>of their skull this guy had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of giving them European looking </v>

281
00:13:33.181 --> 00:13:35.460
<v Speaker 2>white skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn them into a gorilla,</v>

282
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>turned them into a giant muscle bound </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorilla that preyed on people.</v>

283
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.770
<v Speaker 2>And this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was an actually is actually</v>

284
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:44.604
<v Speaker 2>was a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed almost like a goof at </v>

285
00:13:46.651 --> 00:13:47.690
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember this champion?</v>

286
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.700
<v Speaker 2>We pulled this up a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like killer neanderthal theory,</v>

287
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.690
<v Speaker 2>think you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had drawn this thing black,</v>

288
00:13:57.691 --> 00:13:58.524
<v Speaker 2>like a gorilla with like giant muscles </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the place and these big crazy </v>

289
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:02.904
<v Speaker 2>eyes and that painting neanderthals as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator of humans and that's why we </v>

290
00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:08.100
<v Speaker 2>wiped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

291
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

292
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.010
<v Speaker 4>That my limitations as</v>

293
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.630
<v Speaker 4>I see I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just say my limitations as an,</v>

294
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.543
<v Speaker 4>as an anthropologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm certainly not an anthropologist at </v>

295
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:19.580
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a dude who's interested in it.</v>

296
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.600
<v Speaker 4>But one of my limitations is I'll hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>theories floated.</v>

297
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.763
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't follow them long enough to </v>

298
00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:29.660
<v Speaker 4>see which ones have any traction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

299
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.890
<v Speaker 4>I'll just read about them and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>take it as Gospel,</v>

300
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.010
<v Speaker 4>but I'll read about it and I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>

301
00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:39.020
<v Speaker 4>And was sort of shaped my understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

302
00:14:39.021 --> 00:14:43.250
<v Speaker 4>But then I don't keep track of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I try to really follow the story of</v>

303
00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:47.990
<v Speaker 4>like the peopling of the Americas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it comes to the human history of</v>

304
00:14:47.991 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 4>the Western Hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sort of follow and like ideas will get</v>

305
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 4>floated and</v>

306
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 1>they'll track the idea to see where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>lands in terms of scholarly consensus,</v>

307
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.953
<v Speaker 1>but on other stuff with neanderthals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always a sucker for a neanderthal </v>

308
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't track</v>

309
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.543
<v Speaker 2>what ideas that float up or just very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly denounced as being complete </v>

310
00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:07.560
<v Speaker 2>rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

311
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird one.</v>

312
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes time to.</v>

313
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.190
<v Speaker 2>It takes time to follow this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

314
00:15:14.191 --> 00:15:17.080
<v Speaker 2>go to that other picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is them them and,</v>

315
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.780
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

316
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.763
<v Speaker 2>But look at some of his images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that image that he has on the </v>

317
00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:25.020
<v Speaker 2>cover of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those are the idea.</v>

318
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 2>There's some way better ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some way better images with they</v>

319
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.210
<v Speaker 2>drew of a full body ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a.</v>

320
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.223
<v Speaker 2>is it in the article?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a link to your website from a </v>

321
00:15:37.651 --> 00:15:39.060
<v Speaker 2>different article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go,</v>

322
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 2>go to that and then go to images because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some really bizarre fucking.</v>

323
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

324
00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Upper left hand corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what,</v>

325
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:48.660
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>

326
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

327
00:15:49.051 --> 00:15:50.760
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he's got going on,</v>

328
00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that thing is not making art.</v>

329
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

330
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 2>He's making meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

331
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty preposterous.</v>

333
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 2>But neanderthals didn't have things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

334
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.423
<v Speaker 2>Did they know what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's he morphing in neanderthal into a </v>

335
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 2>gorilla that was trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

336
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 2>that's Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a monkey gorilla.</v>

337
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Neanderthal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

338
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:17.841
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

339
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 2>It's got it snarling with it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetable eating teeth.</v>

340
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

341
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:25.643
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the do even know what </v>

342
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:30.700
<v Speaker 2>those Denovo eons to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say that word?</v>

343
00:16:30.701 --> 00:16:31.534
<v Speaker 2>The one from Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have any idea what they </v>

344
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:34.144
<v Speaker 2>looked like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't look like so pinky bones and </v>

345
00:16:35.591 --> 00:16:36.424
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That one's not that one.</v>

347
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him in your cookbook is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fantastic.</v>

348
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.810
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.330
<v Speaker 2>You put a lot of God damn work into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

350
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.460
<v Speaker 2>We started collecting images for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

351
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.570
<v Speaker 2>He could tell it's really good because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want it to look like I'm.</v>

352
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.390
<v Speaker 1>What was it boring you tell about </v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthals now I'm out of stuff to say</v>

353
00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:58.050
<v Speaker 1>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

354
00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go on for days.</v>

355
00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:04.551
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things were not quite sure about exactly</v>

356
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.690
<v Speaker 1>what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do for a living.</v>

357
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.860
<v Speaker 1>So I watch I to get back to the coupe </v>
<v Speaker 1>but real quick.</v>

358
00:17:12.611 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>But Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny as a</v>

359
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:16.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

360
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.340
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't know this,</v>

361
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:19.803
<v Speaker 1>but how many people in the wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 1>world listened to your show and get </v>

362
00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:25.510
<v Speaker 1>angry about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm like a conduit.</v>

363
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

364
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.013
<v Speaker 1>that that's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a conduit where I'm oftentimes </v>

365
00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:32.314
<v Speaker 1>getting frantic text messages is though </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be able to jump in and clarify </v>

366
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:44.010
<v Speaker 1>like how a porcupine quill works or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny how many people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>here from what I can tell when you're on</v>

368
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:49.783
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know like when you're on the subject </v>

369
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 1>of wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's marijuana in the room,</v>

370
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:57.610
<v Speaker 1>we got a real issue with antlers or for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should really know</v>

371
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 2>who knows what antlers for other than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

372
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:01.790
<v Speaker 2>there are two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

373
00:18:01.791 --> 00:18:04.040
<v Speaker 2>If there for fighting and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection,</v>

374
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

375
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Two things that definitely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We in like a sexual display,</v>

376
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.850
<v Speaker 2>we've got a bull in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

377
00:18:11.851 --> 00:18:12.684
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this year and when we were butchering </v>

378
00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:15.194
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the hind quarters had been </v>

379
00:18:16.131 --> 00:18:21.131
<v Speaker 2>punctured by an antler and got infected </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when we cut into the Hindquarter,</v>

380
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:26.930
<v Speaker 2>just this bucket of pus came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was fucking nasty.</v>

381
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:27.764
<v Speaker 2>We thought it was pissed at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone actually puncture the </v>

382
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:30.644
<v Speaker 2>bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we realized when we got deep </v>

383
00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:36.080
<v Speaker 2>into it that there was just this giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>has and he had been asked like literally</v>

384
00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:39.890
<v Speaker 2>right in the flank and it was just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking nasty.</v>

385
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you find really high pressure poss </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets in like</v>

386
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.550
<v Speaker 2>in animals all over his body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had holes in his ribs.</v>

387
00:18:49.551 --> 00:18:52.730
<v Speaker 2>He had big one and his face had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked in the face.</v>

388
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I got to seek a deer last year who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost his eye completely gone.</v>

389
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the desire ball had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>punctured and people were asking me,</v>

390
00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:05.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder you got them.</v>

391
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.461
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

392
00:19:06.461 --> 00:19:10.060
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was facing me on his line of approach.</v>

393
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.993
<v Speaker 1>It didn't know where you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has left perception is a left I was </v>

394
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.194
<v Speaker 1>facing me but yet with the cookbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we started gathering pictures up for </v>

395
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.800
<v Speaker 1>it years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

396
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.913
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to have this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete idea of how to process </v>

397
00:19:27.161 --> 00:19:27.994
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the book includes everything </v>

398
00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:32.780
<v Speaker 1>from how to process a bullfrog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

399
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.663
<v Speaker 1>to a deer to pig to Mahi Mahi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a problem I run into when I've done </v>

400
00:19:37.271 --> 00:19:38.104
<v Speaker 1>books is I never wind up needing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never wind up needing a pad them in </v>

401
00:19:43.361 --> 00:19:44.194
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always might have having like very </v>

402
00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:48.370
<v Speaker 1>painful cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

403
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I did my book,</v>

404
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.580
<v Speaker 1>My book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American Buffalo member,</v>

405
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.493
<v Speaker 1>I had to lose 100 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was hard to do when we did the </v>

406
00:19:56.801 --> 00:19:59.620
<v Speaker 1>complete guide to hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>butchering and cooking wild game.</v>

407
00:19:59.621 --> 00:20:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It came out at 700 pages.</v>

408
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever think of going back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting those 100 pages back into.</v>

409
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it made sense to remove it?</v>

410
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.000
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight had to happen.</v>

411
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It had to happen in terms of like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative stuff I've written.</v>

412
00:20:12.621 --> 00:20:13.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.833
<v Speaker 1>the narrative nonfiction I've written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite thing that I've done </v>

414
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.810
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to happen,</v>

415
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but it was painful and we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I did those guidebook,</v>

416
00:20:23.001 --> 00:20:26.560
<v Speaker 1>the guidebook series that came in at 700</v>
<v Speaker 1>pages and my publisher was a,</v>

417
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.450
<v Speaker 1>my publisher was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:31.460
<v Speaker 1>you just don't really make 700 page </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

419
00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:32.294
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why we wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>another volume one and volume two </v>

420
00:20:33.411 --> 00:20:36.050
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want to get rid of any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then in doing this,</v>

421
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.913
<v Speaker 1>this cookbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mediator fishing game cookbook is </v>

422
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.700
<v Speaker 1>what it's called and putting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

423
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.863
<v Speaker 1>I think early on we started to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit kind of running a little bit </v>

424
00:20:45.651 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 1>wild about what was going to fit but </v>
<v Speaker 1>then caught it earlier.</v>

425
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.923
<v Speaker 1>But that was the first thing we did is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we started collecting the pictures </v>

426
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:53.320
<v Speaker 1>because I think a lot of times you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a book,</v>

427
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:54.923
<v Speaker 1>an illustrated book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of smells like a photo </v>

428
00:20:57.671 --> 00:20:59.590
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

429
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Where you can tell that they get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sort of how they got the images.</v>

430
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.373
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't want to feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it to sort of feel like really </v>

431
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:09.334
<v Speaker 1>representative of so many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places and different experiences that </v>

432
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 1>are captured in here and so we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started filming his process shots of how</v>

433
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 1>to walk stuff through like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 1>how to like turn things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to take an animal and make it into a</v>

435
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:26.074
<v Speaker 1>variety of usable ingredients and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collecting all those took a long time </v>

436
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 1>and then and then actually like </v>
<v Speaker 1>assembling it and putting,</v>

437
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.020
<v Speaker 1>putting it together was more systematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>once we had that underway.</v>

438
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.980
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's like it's cool looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

439
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.621
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

440
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:43.350
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the book in the end where it's kind</v>

441
00:21:43.351 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 1>of like half could almost pass as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee table book.</v>

442
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

443
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

444
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.474
<v Speaker 5>it really could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's a really valuable </v>

445
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:51.724
<v Speaker 5>resource for people that hunt because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just mean he was only so many </v>

446
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:57.410
<v Speaker 5>different ways you can cook backstraps </v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

447
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.430
<v Speaker 5>There's so many different ways you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>put ground venison into spaghetti sauce,</v>

448
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're giving people such a wide variety</v>

449
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 5>of things to include in your original </v>
<v Speaker 5>books as well.</v>

450
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.170
<v Speaker 5>A wide variety of things to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

451
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to cook and ways to cook them.</v>

452
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.603
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the things I really enjoyed </v>

453
00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 5>about your show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

454
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:17.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and still do,</v>

455
00:22:17.831 --> 00:22:19.670
<v Speaker 5>but now that it's on Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

456
00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.210
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy it even more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

457
00:22:21.211 --> 00:22:23.160
<v Speaker 5>you do a lot of cooking on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

458
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.470
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's very rare in the hunting world.</v>

459
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see these hunting shows,</v>

460
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:29.380
<v Speaker 5>they're very one dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

461
00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:32.920
<v Speaker 5>You see someone looking for the animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they finally get it and Yay,</v>

462
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:35.290
<v Speaker 5>everybody's happy the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you,</v>

463
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you spend a great deal of time,</v>

464
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 5>break it down animals and cooking a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of different things,</v>

465
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 5>including like marrow and shanks and </v>
<v Speaker 5>unusual preparations.</v>

466
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:46.060
<v Speaker 5>I think that's really important.</v>

467
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

468
00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.773
<v Speaker 1>that's something that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was always there for me growing up </v>

469
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 1>and hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>

470
00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do them for a bunch of reasons.</v>

471
00:22:56.791 --> 00:23:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that people in explaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting to audiences or explaining it to</v>

472
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:05.310
<v Speaker 1>people who are uninitiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uninformed about it,</v>

473
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe adversarial toward it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of,</v>

474
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:12.150
<v Speaker 1>you wind up grabbing these things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up grabbing these things that,</v>

475
00:23:12.151 --> 00:23:14.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think will resonate with them.</v>

476
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>

477
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Greg Blaskiewicz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who'd even worked on this research piece</v>

478
00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:21.684
<v Speaker 1>of taking justifications for hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding test subjects who are skeptical </v>

479
00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:32.544
<v Speaker 1>of hunting and explaining various </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifications to them and seeing which </v>

480
00:23:37.831 --> 00:23:40.770
<v Speaker 1>ones of those that they find to be most </v>
<v Speaker 1>impactful.</v>

481
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.940
<v Speaker 1>So he's actually done research around </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you take this great,</v>

482
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 1>like these broad spectrum of reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do this,</v>

483
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

484
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 1>and everyone that has many of them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of their story,</v>

485
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

486
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

487
00:23:54.671 --> 00:23:55.504
<v Speaker 1>you run them by people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sees these ones that they really </v>

488
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 1>resonate and which ones kind of move the</v>
<v Speaker 1>needle and their perception of it.</v>

489
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's a little bit surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

490
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 1>there's some surprises in there of ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think would be really impactful</v>

491
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 1>but in fact are not impactful at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't care about.</v>

492
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

493
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 1>population control people don't care </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

494
00:24:14.631 --> 00:24:15.464
<v Speaker 1>I think that people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of people you're talking about </v>

495
00:24:18.621 --> 00:24:19.454
<v Speaker 1>who are largely unfamiliar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're looking at it from the </v>

496
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 1>outside and they're skeptical of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a hard.</v>

497
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.023
<v Speaker 1>They don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that they're afraid of </v>

498
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 1>deer generally,</v>

499
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 5>but people who live in high population </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas.</v>

500
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 5>Like I did a Gig once in western </v>
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts.</v>

501
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.763
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was in western Massachusetts and I </v>

502
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:39.494
<v Speaker 5>had a drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was coming from New York and I had to </v>

503
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:46.691
<v Speaker 5>drive through the most dear infested </v>
<v Speaker 5>place I've ever been to in my life.</v>

504
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.540
<v Speaker 5>It was completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're driving on the highway,</v>

505
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:51.374
<v Speaker 5>you have to go 25,</v>
<v Speaker 5>30 miles an hour and things are just </v>

506
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 5>jumping in front of your car every 15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 seconds.</v>

507
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

508
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.033
<v Speaker 5>And I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took the side road down to get to </v>

509
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:01.694
<v Speaker 5>wherever the Gig was and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching these animals jumping in front </v>

510
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 5>of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like left and right.</v>

511
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people that live here,</v>

512
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:09.643
<v Speaker 5>these things are God damn nuisance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if this was your everyday reality </v>

513
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 5>and you ask those people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

514
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:15.434
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think about deer population </v>

515
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:18.434
<v Speaker 5>control?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need to hunt to keep the population </v>

516
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:19.731
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd be like,</v>

517
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:20.540
<v Speaker 5>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do.</v>

518
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

519
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that there are quite a lot of </v>

520
00:25:24.331 --> 00:25:27.180
<v Speaker 1>people that live in some of these areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have a great abundance of deer that</v>

521
00:25:27.181 --> 00:25:29.670
<v Speaker 1>feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with general population,</v>

522
00:25:29.671 --> 00:25:30.504
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was looking at it with just </v>

523
00:25:31.711 --> 00:25:33.900
<v Speaker 1>general population thing and it was full</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop to.</v>

524
00:25:33.901 --> 00:25:35.460
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a lot of.</v>

525
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.480
<v Speaker 1>He didn't go in and give case scenarios </v>
<v Speaker 1>and examples.</v>

526
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.373
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a question that you ask and </v>

527
00:25:41.851 --> 00:25:44.250
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't immediately click with people.</v>

528
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that didn't immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>click with people,</v>

529
00:25:46.081 --> 00:25:51.081
<v Speaker 1>but it's extremely important to me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues around heritage and legacy.</v>

530
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So meaning that,</v>

531
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my maternal grandfather,</v>

532
00:25:56.761 --> 00:26:01.200
<v Speaker 1>my paternal grandfather were hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father was a hunter.</v>

533
00:26:01.201 --> 00:26:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I was brought up hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

534
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.780
<v Speaker 1>to anon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hunter.</v>

535
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your grandparents and parents could have</v>

536
00:26:06.721 --> 00:26:08.220
<v Speaker 1>been involved in all kinds of bad shit.</v>

537
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:09.203
<v Speaker 1>I don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you need to continue doing </v>

538
00:26:10.711 --> 00:26:11.544
<v Speaker 1>bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one that's very obvious is people </v>

539
00:26:15.151 --> 00:26:15.984
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people understand and respect the idea </v>

540
00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:20.430
<v Speaker 1>of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

541
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your general population,</v>

542
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.050
<v Speaker 1>look and respect the idea of food now </v>
<v Speaker 1>tobacco,</v>

543
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:25.884
<v Speaker 1>what I was getting at about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that being a big element </v>

544
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:29.820
<v Speaker 1>of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

545
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.073
<v Speaker 1>it almost winds up being that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was like fortunate or lucky or </v>

546
00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:35.751
<v Speaker 1>whatever that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

547
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:40.751
<v Speaker 1>that early in my career I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on talking about that aspect of</v>

548
00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:42.054
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't something I just made up </v>

549
00:26:42.661 --> 00:26:43.494
<v Speaker 1>out of because it was a huge part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up where for whatever reason I </v>

550
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:48.534
<v Speaker 1>happen to be raised by a dad who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just really interested in cooking stuff </v>

551
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 1>and sharing with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

552
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.193
<v Speaker 1>And if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're driving down the road in June </v>

553
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>and you see a snapping turtle laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs on the side of the road,</v>

554
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:05.214
<v Speaker 1>it's come up out of a swamp and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to find some sandy ground and he </v>

555
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 1>finds it on the edge of a dirt road.</v>

556
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.811
<v Speaker 1>And there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Land,</v>

557
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:13.610
<v Speaker 1>eggs on the side of the dirt road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were eating that turtle right?</v>

558
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And everything we ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

559
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.903
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had a lot of things that other </v>

560
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:19.644
<v Speaker 1>people weren't interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could go out and bring back our dad </v>

561
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 1>bullfrogs you would love if we went out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and got them.</v>

562
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:25.194
<v Speaker 1>Frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take our bows out at night using </v>

563
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:28.044
<v Speaker 1>flashlights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which unbeknownst to me was illegal and </v>

564
00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:30.384
<v Speaker 1>remains illegal in the state where I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up even for frog to use </v>

565
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 1>artificial light for frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.243
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no dude when I found that out </v>

567
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

568
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

569
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the day that you weren't supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

570
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 1>where we would do it and we'd come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bring them.</v>

571
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.240
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

572
00:27:45.241 --> 00:27:46.074
<v Speaker 1>To bring her dad the frog legs and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would cook them and he would cook and </v>

573
00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:48.510
<v Speaker 1>eat anything.</v>

574
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.343
<v Speaker 1>And then he would do stuff where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would catch salmon when the salmon were </v>

575
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 1>running the rivers in October and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have people over and we would have</v>

576
00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 1>a salmon boil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

577
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So I was raised around that stuff of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of celebrating wild game.</v>

578
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Having to be very social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to be a way to connect salmon.</v>

579
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Boil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

580
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Boiled fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take your little,</v>

581
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.333
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're literally cubing up salmon and </v>

582
00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Pearl onions and little baby potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you.</v>

583
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:18.390
<v Speaker 1>So you're making like a stew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fish boil,</v>

584
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.333
<v Speaker 1>and then you drain it off and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn butter and you drown all that </v>

585
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And drawn butter.</v>

586
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>

587
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound.</v>

588
00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 1>We'll do fish boils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do fish.</v>

589
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Boyles was not normal to do a salmon </v>
<v Speaker 1>boil.</v>

590
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's such a flavorful fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>would lose some of that in the broth.</v>

591
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

592
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.190
<v Speaker 1>But it's like when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you have the Pearl onions</v>

593
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.073
<v Speaker 1>and a little baby potatoes and cubed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you drown all that shit and bought </v>

594
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:41.971
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a thing.</v>

595
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:42.804
<v Speaker 1>People like the taste is really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessarily the taste of </v>

596
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 1>salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

597
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:50.220
<v Speaker 1>What if you went to great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you went to the Pacific northwest and</v>

598
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:51.054
<v Speaker 1>asked like a bunch of great chefs in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific northwest to list their five </v>

599
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:59.751
<v Speaker 1>favorite stamen preparations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boiling them in a pot of water isn't,</v>

600
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.790
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to be on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to make their list?</v>

601
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 1>But he would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

602
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 1>and it'd be a thing and you'd invite </v>
<v Speaker 1>people over to do it.</v>

603
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda early at like early on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things I enjoyed about hunting,</v>

604
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food aspect was big for me in really</v>

605
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:19.914
<v Speaker 1>informed all of the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations that I've had around it </v>

606
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:25.620
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>

607
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.453
<v Speaker 1>And so then in doing a show about </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting wasn't something that was going </v>

608
00:29:28.611 --> 00:29:29.444
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something that I was going to </v>

609
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>lean out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in all fairness,</v>

610
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.473
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of fur trapping too and </v>

611
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 1>trapped muskrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaver,</v>

612
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 1>mink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of stuff.</v>

613
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.363
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing that to sell the sell the </v>

614
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:44.014
<v Speaker 1>furs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would use some of the meat out of </v>

615
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.533
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the meat for Bait at sometimes </v>

616
00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.113
<v Speaker 1>sell meat to dog sled racers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you realize that beaver were </v>

617
00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 1>delicious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not till after.</v>

618
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I think I know the first one when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first one I ever ate,</v>

619
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.653
<v Speaker 1>I was in community college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still tell people about the beaver </v>

620
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:02.770
<v Speaker 1>that you cook for us and Wisconsin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how good it is.</v>

621
00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And they look at you sideways and Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

622
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:07.030
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like the most delicious pot roast</v>

623
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had was fantastic.</v>

624
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really good.</v>

625
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.893
<v Speaker 1>There's even stories about early on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one early explorers are in this </v>

626
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:15.934
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a difficult time getting fish </v>

627
00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:18.034
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And beaver were approved for the lenten </v>

628
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:26.000
<v Speaker 1>meal because they were aquatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

629
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.853
<v Speaker 1>So on Fridays when you had to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're supposed to have your </v>

630
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:29.584
<v Speaker 1>meat free day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were allowed to eat beaver meat </v>

631
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:34.960
<v Speaker 1>because they were a water animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very popular food item.</v>

632
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 1>You follow what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

633
00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:37.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

634
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

635
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.330
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first ones we ate,</v>

636
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I had started reading about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd always read narratives,</v>

637
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 1>stories about the mountain men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

638
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 1>meaning like when I say mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a very specific thing,</v>

639
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

640
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.093
<v Speaker 1>a rocky mountain beaver trapper who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwiched between who is sandwiched in </v>

641
00:30:56.711 --> 00:31:01.711
<v Speaker 1>time between the end of the Lewis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark expedition and the collapse of the</v>

642
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:04.860
<v Speaker 1>beaver market in the 1840 [inaudible].</v>

643
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.230
<v Speaker 1>So like they're a very finite period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

644
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.083
<v Speaker 1>Was what a mountain man was explained to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people how big the market is because </v>

645
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:15.040
<v Speaker 1>this is going to blow people's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

646
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 1>America's first asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jacob Astor,</v>

647
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 1>like the beaver market made America's </v>
<v Speaker 1>first millionaires.</v>

648
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.510
<v Speaker 1>His fortunes came from being a beaver </v>
<v Speaker 1>trader.</v>

649
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.560
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest men in the country.</v>

650
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Their money came from beavers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

651
00:31:29.111 --> 00:31:32.100
<v Speaker 1>And he was in on the business end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't another trap and end of it.</v>

652
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 1>He was in on the habits for companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

653
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 1>The big companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when we bought,</v>

654
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.633
<v Speaker 1>think about like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big it was for us to do the </v>

655
00:31:41.111 --> 00:31:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Louisiana purchase and buy that chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

656
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Lewis and Clark came out,</v>

657
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:49.594
<v Speaker 1>part of their mandate was to suss out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for the trade and beaver </v>

658
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:55.654
<v Speaker 1>hides.</v>

659
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.660
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like buying some oil and gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

660
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:01.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we justify this?</v>

661
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:02.743
<v Speaker 1>The oil and gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking to justify it through </v>

662
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.280
<v Speaker 1>trade and beaver heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now also,</v>

663
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.613
<v Speaker 1>there was also language about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might find out about whether wooly </v>

664
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 1>mammoth through existing out there as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

665
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So there was some confusion about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>

666
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really thought that woolly mammoths</v>

667
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:17.194
<v Speaker 1>were still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jefferson was interested in that stuff </v>

668
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:21.130
<v Speaker 1>because he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been to some areas,</v>

669
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had some familiarity and to some </v>

670
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:26.220
<v Speaker 1>areas with these large bones and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzled the bottom.</v>

671
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.063
<v Speaker 1>He was wondering if this wasn't some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it may be in fact was not an extinct </v>

672
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:30.994
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was somehow living in the American </v>

673
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>west still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard is it to the historians,</v>

674
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:37.020
<v Speaker 1>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not historian,</v>

675
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 1>popular historians really loved to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big deal out of that.</v>

676
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.230
<v Speaker 1>X is so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like,</v>

677
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's buy the,</v>

678
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.293
<v Speaker 1>let's do the Louisiana purchase </v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction because of the possibility </v>

679
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:47.714
<v Speaker 1>of locating Mamet's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an idea that was floated </v>

680
00:32:49.911 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People see it in a.</v>

681
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 1>people such as me see it and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>overemphasized what it meant.</v>

682
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:56.924
<v Speaker 1>But it was an idea that was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beaver trade stuff was certainly a </v>

683
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:01.784
<v Speaker 1>big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing I was reading about </v>

684
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 1>recently that just point out to your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your,</v>

685
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:05.684
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might think is interesting is </v>

686
00:33:08.811 --> 00:33:09.644
<v Speaker 1>that we as people have this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Clark going into this </v>

687
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:13.813
<v Speaker 1>unspoiled uncontacted landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was recently reading a piece by a </v>

688
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.633
<v Speaker 1>historian who's talking about at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time of Lewis and Clark headed out into </v>

689
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:22.664
<v Speaker 1>the great plains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were native Americans living on </v>

690
00:33:24.891 --> 00:33:25.724
<v Speaker 1>the great plains who had been to Europe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and met the King of France and returned </v>

691
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.270
<v Speaker 1>back to the great plains.</v>

692
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.330
<v Speaker 1>What year they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went out in the early 18 hundreds.</v>

693
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So they're out in 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

694
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

695
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.460
<v Speaker 1>You gotta if you imagine the time from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time I'm in the 15 hundreds when the</v>

696
00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

697
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 1>We're poking around and come like Corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Otto,</v>

698
00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.693
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming up from Mexico into the great </v>

699
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:01.994
<v Speaker 1>plains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cabeza de Vaca being shipwrecked along </v>

700
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.353
<v Speaker 1>the Gulf coast and people pushing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into these areas that was hundreds of </v>

701
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.000
<v Speaker 1>years prior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the distance that separates.</v>

702
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's separated.</v>

703
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.084
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Clark from the first year </v>
<v Speaker 1>peons who were doing activities in and </v>

704
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 1>around the great plains is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance and time that separates us from</v>

705
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Clark more so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

706
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the distance in time that separates</v>

707
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:29.924
<v Speaker 1>us from the declaration of independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a long history of people </v>

708
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:33.800
<v Speaker 1>messing around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

709
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 1>However.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

710
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:35.564
<v Speaker 1>But think about too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Lewis and Clark were encountering </v>

711
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 1>people who had horses.</v>

712
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:38.923
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

713
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 1>And those horses had been his horsemen </v>
<v Speaker 1>traded up.</v>

714
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So that is like a side note to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of eating beaver.</v>

715
00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 1>So I got from reading about the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

716
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.233
<v Speaker 1>I got interested in this because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always do like anytime you read about </v>

717
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:52.874
<v Speaker 1>mountain and you're going to find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part where the author talks about how </v>

718
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:55.664
<v Speaker 1>much mountain men like beaver tail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first people that tried and be </v>

719
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.823
<v Speaker 1>retailing was around when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in community college at the time </v>

720
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.503
<v Speaker 1>and my brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember stuck a b retail in the oven </v>

721
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:09.043
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and cooked it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>reported back to me that like whatever </v>

722
00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:13.184
<v Speaker 1>it is they're talking about a isn't that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there must be some other </v>

723
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:20.480
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't we eat beaver tail?</v>

724
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

725
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.280
<v Speaker 1>we ate it and was constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

726
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.153
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a how to pictures and an </v>

727
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:26.924
<v Speaker 1>explanation of how to prepare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to actually prepare beaver tail </v>

728
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:32.960
<v Speaker 1>mountain man style in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fishing game cookbook.</v>

729
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.990
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a blend.</v>

730
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so</v>

731
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.193
<v Speaker 4>after that we started thinking that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say the mountain and like be </v>

732
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:43.044
<v Speaker 4>retail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we thought it most amended like rump </v>

733
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 4>based,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the hind quarters.</v>

734
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.160
<v Speaker 4>So we started when we went I would catch</v>
<v Speaker 4>beavers.</v>

735
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.473
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be careful when Skin Adam's not get </v>

736
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:55.710
<v Speaker 4>the caster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The beavers have two large glands on the</v>

737
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:57.450
<v Speaker 4>inside of their legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like tucked in there.</v>

738
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 4>It looks like if you lay a beaver on its</v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

739
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.093
<v Speaker 4>talked to kind of on either side of its </v>
<v Speaker 4>of its like if it's a male I talked to </v>

740
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:06.450
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your side of his penis or either side of</v>

741
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:08.790
<v Speaker 4>it's Clo Eiko you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll see a,</v>

742
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 4>not waco but like vent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll see these.</v>

743
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.960
<v Speaker 4>These glands that are the size of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you make like a.</v>

744
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 4>If you take your index finger and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>thumb and make a circle,</v>

745
00:36:17.491 --> 00:36:19.700
<v Speaker 4>there's like a gland on each side called</v>
<v Speaker 4>the castor gland.</v>

746
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.020
<v Speaker 4>There's oil gland in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to use it for perfume.</v>

747
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 4>It still has value today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's used for a wide variety of things.</v>

748
00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:25.944
<v Speaker 4>It smells beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ever walking on the stream bank </v>

749
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:29.580
<v Speaker 4>and you smell like a strange perfume </v>
<v Speaker 4>smell,</v>

750
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 4>it's usually beaver caster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

751
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 4>Smells great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tastes like shit.</v>

752
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.303
<v Speaker 4>Tastes like you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you rubbed roses or something all </v>

753
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:38.754
<v Speaker 4>over your food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So started figuring out like to skin </v>

754
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:45.420
<v Speaker 4>them and be very careful not to get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cast or on your knife or get the cast on</v>

755
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:46.254
<v Speaker 4>your hands and then we would just take </v>
<v Speaker 4>the meat and put it in crock pots with </v>

756
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:53.820
<v Speaker 4>potatoes and onions and stuff and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>cook them down in a crock pot.</v>

757
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.740
<v Speaker 4>You could pick them and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>roast beef.</v>

758
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.770
<v Speaker 4>So when I started eating that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still.</v>

759
00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.643
<v Speaker 4>Then later I realized that the read </v>
<v Speaker 4>other accounts of how people are </v>

760
00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:02.714
<v Speaker 4>prepared be retail and if you take the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tail like the scaly ass tail and it </v>

761
00:37:06.421 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 4>really should be from a fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beaver,</v>

762
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.560
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] the tail would be twice as </v>
<v Speaker 4>thick in the fall.</v>

763
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.840
<v Speaker 4>Then in the spring or a macerated in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>spring,</v>

764
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 4>take the tail into skewered on a stick </v>
<v Speaker 4>and put it next to a fire where the skin</v>

765
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:20.034
<v Speaker 4>starts to bubble and boiled away and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty soon you can just peel that skin </v>

766
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:28.110
<v Speaker 4>away and was hiding under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is the the best equivalent,</v>

767
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:28.944
<v Speaker 4>like the best equivalent or point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison that I can think of would be </v>

768
00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:33.984
<v Speaker 4>to just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you had a really like </v>

769
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 4>imagining you're getting a grass fed </v>
<v Speaker 4>steak,</v>

770
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still has that fatty gristle on it.</v>

771
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.383
<v Speaker 4>It's just made up of that gristle like </v>
<v Speaker 4>what allow people to trim away from </v>

772
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 4>mistake and not eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's inside that beavertail,</v>

773
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:49.883
<v Speaker 4>but people eat these individuals that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing this for fat starved eating </v>

774
00:37:55.561 --> 00:37:56.394
<v Speaker 4>such lean meat all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they loved it because here's </v>

775
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:00.930
<v Speaker 4>like a chunk of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

776
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:02.783
<v Speaker 4>and they had ready access to it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they catching them to make a living and </v>

777
00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 4>if you're just eating the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no fat on the meat.</v>

778
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:08.843
<v Speaker 4>And so they would compliment it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>just eating the beavertail fat and I'll </v>

779
00:38:13.621 --> 00:38:16.220
<v Speaker 4>often tell people about it and I even </v>
<v Speaker 4>gave some to the.</v>

780
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.123
<v Speaker 4>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a culinary arts institute and I gave </v>

781
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:20.604
<v Speaker 4>some chefs that stuff and everyone who </v>
<v Speaker 4>eats it points out there's not that it </v>

782
00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:24.504
<v Speaker 4>tastes so fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just like really interesting to try </v>

783
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:29.250
<v Speaker 4>and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fat from the tail.</v>

784
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.710
<v Speaker 4>And it's like you've got to put yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>in position.</v>

785
00:38:31.711 --> 00:38:33.190
<v Speaker 4>You've probably been in this too where </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

786
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're out hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating</v>

787
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903
<v Speaker 1>freeze dried food or not eating great </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're just exerting yourself all </v>

788
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:41.490
<v Speaker 1>day all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're,</v>

789
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.270
<v Speaker 1>what you want to eat changes a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And you the level of appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was off the charts.</v>

791
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just like to eat like a big slab </v>

792
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 1>of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be very excited.</v>

793
00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It was appealing to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

794
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.813
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body starts craving things that </v>

795
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.600
<v Speaker 1>absolutely needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

796
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

797
00:38:58.610 --> 00:38:59.443
<v Speaker 1>In particularly when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that are hiking across the </v>

798
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:03.514
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling massive amounts of distance </v>

799
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.303
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably very physically strenuous </v>

800
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.063
<v Speaker 1>dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their shit with them and they get a </v>

801
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.420
<v Speaker 1>cross some big ass piece of fat from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>

802
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a huge treat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

803
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And then our understanding of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we used to have this idea of like,</v>

804
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:21.670
<v Speaker 1>especially of early native Americans is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

805
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.490
<v Speaker 1>they're like just eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.050
<v Speaker 1>nothing but mammoth meat and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

807
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.840
<v Speaker 1>like as our understanding of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>grows,</v>

808
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.683
<v Speaker 1>you see like how much they are utilizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant resources and probably had like </v>

809
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:33.940
<v Speaker 1>pretty plant rich diets.</v>

810
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:39.510
<v Speaker 1>But with the one with the equestrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>bison hunters on the great plains,</v>

811
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.213
<v Speaker 1>those guys were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't cultivating at that era </v>

812
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.260
<v Speaker 1>like especially the era when Lewis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark came in.</v>

813
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not cultivating crops.</v>

814
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.373
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the people who had been farming</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the Mississippi and Missouri </v>

815
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Valleys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they got horses,</v>

816
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.173
<v Speaker 1>they just gave up on that shit and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started Roman landscape eaten meat and </v>

817
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 1>the mountain men certainly weren't doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

818
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.723
<v Speaker 1>They were just eating like you're eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat 365 days out of the year and you </v>

819
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:12.070
<v Speaker 1>see that they really probably to make up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of nutrient deficiencies.</v>

820
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Eight shitloads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon's your guy,</v>

821
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the gall putting Gol on your food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gallbladder,</v>

822
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.020
<v Speaker 1>squeezing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the garb,</v>

823
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.893
<v Speaker 1>the putting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeezing the bile from gallbladder on </v>

824
00:40:24.611 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 1>your food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did that once.</v>

825
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's horrific.</v>

826
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they put a nine volt battery on </v>

827
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:30.754
<v Speaker 1>your tongue and you think they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing just because they were just </v>

828
00:40:32.861 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 1>nutrient starved?</v>

829
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they,</v>

830
00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:36.003
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a high emphasis on eating just </v>

831
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 1>like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just organ meats,</v>

832
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.710
<v Speaker 1>organ meats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk from milk,</v>

833
00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:44.620
<v Speaker 1>from mammary glands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

834
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't just eat that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>seemed like was 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

852
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 1>it could have occurred 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

853
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.251
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

854
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 1>the episode of the podcast is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good man.</v>

855
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool Dude.</v>

857
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.833
<v Speaker 1>Buck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is body mind says to him in the </v>

858
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.883
<v Speaker 1>shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

859
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.620
<v Speaker 1>he's a cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

860
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a treat to get a chance to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy that you think probably never even</v>

861
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking heard of a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

862
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.810
<v Speaker 1>and certainly comes from a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different era.</v>

863
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:58.783
<v Speaker 1>The reason he was living had to live off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the land is an interesting story where </v>

864
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.913
<v Speaker 1>he was working for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just getting into the guiding </v>

865
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:06.074
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so guiding Moose hunters and they were </v>

866
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:08.654
<v Speaker 1>wanting to find some ways to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt some very remote areas and they </v>

867
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:11.444
<v Speaker 1>hidden in us the idea that they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just bring horses in because if you </v>

868
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 1>don't have landing strips and stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just really hard to operate out of these</v>

869
00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

870
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.021
<v Speaker 1>So they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

871
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:20.920
<v Speaker 1>if we can get horses in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have them in there,</v>

872
00:42:20.921 --> 00:42:23.210
<v Speaker 1>will want for the season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll ride the horses out.</v>

873
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.540
<v Speaker 1>But getting the horses in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so difficult.</v>

874
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.433
<v Speaker 1>It took far longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The route they wanted to use was </v>

875
00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:31.043
<v Speaker 1>impassable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time they got the horses in </v>

876
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:33.704
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized that they're never going </v>

877
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:35.114
<v Speaker 1>to get these horses back Outta here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize that someone needs to stay </v>

878
00:42:38.301 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 1>over winter to take care of the horses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has volunteered to do it.</v>

879
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.233
<v Speaker 1>So he started spending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go in and hunt in September </v>

880
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:52.700
<v Speaker 1>and then he would just start hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just stay there to agree to care for</v>

881
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:53.534
<v Speaker 1>the horses until spring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how he found himself living </v>

882
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 1>out by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would bring some food in,</v>

883
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but it would be never enough and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be eating wolverine,</v>

884
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:05.120
<v Speaker 1>beaver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moose,</v>

885
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever he could come up with.</v>

886
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.920
<v Speaker 1>But he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

887
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:15.130
<v Speaker 1>he was just open to it and didn't care </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was really comfortable with solitude</v>

888
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.180
<v Speaker 1>when I spend time with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very gracious.</v>

889
00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.860
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he spent time with them,</v>

890
00:43:21.861 --> 00:43:26.861
<v Speaker 1>you see him just engage in conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a,</v>

891
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

892
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.833
<v Speaker 1>a sort of weariness kick in where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone who's very </v>

893
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:37.550
<v Speaker 1>comfortable going months without human </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

894
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So him talking to people like,</v>

895
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:40.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enough,</v>

896
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 1>let me get the fuck out of house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you realize like when I've stayed at</v>

897
00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 1>his place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cabin and he's got,</v>

898
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.870
<v Speaker 1>he's got a remote cabins stolen when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed out there.</v>

899
00:43:47.871 --> 00:43:48.704
<v Speaker 1>You kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll sort of drift off and vanish for </v>

900
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 1>good spells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

901
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Even when he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when he's like entertaining,</v>

902
00:43:54.951 --> 00:43:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he sells bowls like wooden bowls for</v>

903
00:43:57.891 --> 00:43:58.671
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

904
00:43:58.671 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that he does have</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those bowls.</v>

905
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I have one in my home now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get one of those bowls.</v>

906
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:05.901
<v Speaker 1>Birch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

907
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:07.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

908
00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:08.084
<v Speaker 1>it's like a salad bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a growth on the side of a birch </v>

909
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:12.500
<v Speaker 1>tree that you cut off with a chainsaw </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hollow out.</v>

910
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Know they call them Birch Birch Bark or </v>
<v Speaker 1>burl?</v>

<v Speaker 1>shops.</v>

914
00:44:21.531 --> 00:44:24.350

<v Speaker 1>tourist shops.</v>

915
00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.610
<v Speaker 1>It should be all be direct consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well from him.</v>

917
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.473
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you hook it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking zero point zero people on the </v>

918
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:32.360
<v Speaker 1>case</v>

919

<v Speaker 1>fire too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

922
00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.910
<v Speaker 1>that was a sad story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But besides.</v>

923
00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's still guides and um,</v>

924
00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.220
<v Speaker 1>does that and makes his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

925
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:45.680
<v Speaker 1>takes some time</v>

926
00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Berles and makes bowls out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just talking to a guy like that.</v>

927
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.823
<v Speaker 2>Listening to you talk to a guy like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so fascinating because he lives a </v>

928
00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:56.050
<v Speaker 2>life that I can barely comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just everything about it from.</v>

929
00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.550
<v Speaker 1>And just to think that,</v>

930
00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:00.783
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he does is almost impossible to </v>

931
00:45:02.141 --> 00:45:02.974
<v Speaker 2>comprehend now think about Lewis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clark making their way across the </v>

932
00:45:05.951 --> 00:45:10.950
<v Speaker 2>country and not really knowing what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there really not knowing like,</v>

933
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.290
<v Speaker 2>guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having some people gave some reports.</v>

934
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.270
<v Speaker 2>This is what we saw here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we saw there.</v>

935
00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.030
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even have a good account of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different animals.</v>

936
00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had won or lost.</v>

937
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this point.</v>

938
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.133
<v Speaker 1>There are days we're talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people now you'll hear people say </v>

939
00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:27.171
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

940
00:45:27.171 --> 00:45:28.400
<v Speaker 1>he's a real mountain man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

941
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:32.930
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes when people hear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they imagined this old hermit,</v>

942
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

943
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.590
<v Speaker 1>who's living in his cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

944
00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.380
<v Speaker 1>him being a mountain man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about what the mountain</v>

945
00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:42.470
<v Speaker 1>men were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were for the time,</v>

946
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:45.590
<v Speaker 1>the most well traveled people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

947
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zena phobic people alive.</v>

948
00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.610
<v Speaker 1>The equivalent today to be a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>man today,</v>

949
00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:55.550
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd have to go to,</v>

950
00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:57.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuming and ascend the Amazon and </v>

951
00:46:03.381 --> 00:46:04.214
<v Speaker 1>follow tributary after tributary and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into like the borderlands around </v>

952
00:46:08.661 --> 00:46:13.661
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela and then go in and despite the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language barrier,</v>

953
00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:21.310
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to go in and travel amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>and live amongst people who,</v>

954
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes who had not had a lot of outside </v>

955
00:46:26.901 --> 00:46:27.734
<v Speaker 1>contact but had a familiarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a familiarity with outside peoples </v>

956
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.033
<v Speaker 1>and you'd live there foods you eat their</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods and live with them and take their </v>

957
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.260
<v Speaker 1>ways that they dress themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopted as your own.</v>

958
00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:43.753
<v Speaker 1>The kind of guy that would do that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the kind of guy we're talking about </v>

959
00:46:47.331 --> 00:46:49.700
<v Speaker 1>nowadays when we talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real mountain man,</v>

960
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:50.743
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about reality show people </v>

961
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:53.613
<v Speaker 1>that people talk about now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these people were like insatiably </v>

962
00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.370
<v Speaker 1>curious explorers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the people now,</v>

963
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:02.803
<v Speaker 1>the people that do like go to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy war zones or like decided to go </v>

964
00:47:06.981 --> 00:47:09.920
<v Speaker 1>backpack up in the Hindu Kush and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>

965
00:47:09.921 --> 00:47:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just see what happens.</v>

966
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

967
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.500
<v Speaker 1>very different kinds of people.</v>

968
00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Your episodes that you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

969
00:47:17.811 --> 00:47:18.644
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where was that in with the most recent </v>

970
00:47:21.381 --> 00:47:26.381
<v Speaker 2>series where your boat fishing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people?</v>

971
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down in Guyana.</v>

972
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Diana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

973
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be a trip.</v>

974
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 1>How long were you down there for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

975
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long weeks.</v>

976
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

977
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:38.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

978
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of travel.</v>

979
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff needs to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out on the river,</v>

980
00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.593
<v Speaker 1>but when you're around these people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all walking around barefoot and </v>

981
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 1>they're making cassava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we talked about the other day,</v>

982
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:50.980
<v Speaker 1>that it could easily kill you if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wrong.</v>

983
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 1>The water as all this cyanide in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

984
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:59.461
<v Speaker 1>you're about as close as you can get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of environment.</v>

985
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.191
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:48:00.191 --> 00:48:05.191
<v Speaker 1>What you're in a situation like that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who are very familiar with,</v>

987
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 1>like where are you familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern world?</v>

988
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a great awareness of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when the,</v>

989
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.360
<v Speaker 1>when the rubber meets the road of daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

990
00:48:13.361 --> 00:48:18.361
<v Speaker 1>they're still really connected to life </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and skillsets that were,</v>

991
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that their grandparents used and still </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing like a very similar ways.</v>

992
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

993
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.473
<v Speaker 4>where you might've had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were a boy lehman is someone </v>

994
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.580
<v Speaker 4>now is in their thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were a boy,</v>

995
00:48:34.581 --> 00:48:35.414
<v Speaker 4>they probably use a 12 pound handmade </v>
<v Speaker 4>wooden paddle and maybe now they have a </v>

996
00:48:38.841 --> 00:48:41.180
<v Speaker 4>different paddler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe somehow they've come into,</v>

997
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:42.403
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a plastic paddle say and they use that </v>

998
00:48:45.741 --> 00:48:48.890
<v Speaker 4>for their boat or they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they still have a dug out canoe,</v>

999
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:53.210
<v Speaker 4>but they also have an aluminum boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's major differences.</v>

1000
00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.620
<v Speaker 4>But just the general sort of approach </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that you're deriving all of</v>

1001
00:48:57.621 --> 00:49:02.621
<v Speaker 4>your protein from the river and that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt and fish 250 300 days a year in the</v>

1002
00:49:07.071 --> 00:49:09.080
<v Speaker 4>places where your ancestors have always </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it.</v>

1003
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:10.303
<v Speaker 4>You're still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still gaining this really </v>

1004
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:16.510
<v Speaker 4>beautiful glimpse at how people lived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though they've had enormous changes</v>

1005
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.880
<v Speaker 4>in their own lifetime and are very much </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern,</v>

1006
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very modern,</v>

1007
00:49:21.141 --> 00:49:23.720
<v Speaker 4>but you can still like glimpse it more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

1008
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you really get that as </v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

1009
00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that as much here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1010
00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.140
<v Speaker 1>hunting is his ancestral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1011
00:49:33.141 --> 00:49:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and there's this kind of continuation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes on.</v>

1012
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.930
<v Speaker 1>But when Europeans came here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1013
00:49:38.931 --> 00:49:43.931
<v Speaker 1>when Europeans came to the new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't coming in as hunters.</v>

1014
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1015
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.390
<v Speaker 4>If you have to go look like Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 4>Boone's family,</v>

1016
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.670
<v Speaker 4>Dana Boone's family came from England.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't come here as hunters because</v>

1017
00:49:53.671 --> 00:49:55.890
<v Speaker 4>you could like the peasantry you </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't hunt there.</v>

1018
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:57.263
<v Speaker 4>They came here and learned hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So hunting and America for Euro </v>

1019
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.633
<v Speaker 4>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting and America is like an </v>

1020
00:50:03.481 --> 00:50:04.314
<v Speaker 4>invention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a thing that people kind of got to </v>

1021
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.430
<v Speaker 4>learn and took from the Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't have a.</v>

1022
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.103
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that deep deep thread that you'd </v>

1023
00:50:16.501 --> 00:50:18.960
<v Speaker 4>find with indigenous communities where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>

1024
00:50:18.961 --> 00:50:23.370
<v Speaker 4>This continuation has gone on for </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever on broken,</v>

1025
00:50:23.371 --> 00:50:25.470
<v Speaker 4>but on this continent unbroken for </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1026
00:50:25.471 --> 00:50:26.310
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>16,</v>

1027
00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:29.000
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fashionable number is </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years.</v>

1028
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.133
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like our understanding is </v>

1029
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 1>different because our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my ancestors came here and got into</v>

1030
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:36.914
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1031
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:38.773
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a cultural continuation for </v>

1032
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:43.220
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you look at like for,</v>

1033
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:46.670
<v Speaker 1>for food and wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And an interesting thing is my,</v>

1034
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my use and understanding of wild game is</v>

1035
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 1>really influenced by like contemporary </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

1036
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1037
00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 1>like restaurant food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that chefs do.</v>

1038
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you take wild game and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>these like cool,</v>

1039
00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Speaker 1>exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern,</v>

1040
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 1>innovative kinds of things with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with wild game and cook it,</v>

1041
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:07.503
<v Speaker 1>you go talk to her like a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though dude like Bach or </v>

1042
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>particularly people in people in South </v>
<v Speaker 1>America who have,</v>

1043
00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:16.640
<v Speaker 1>have haunted for more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a subsistence literally subsistence</v>

1044
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:17.474
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their whole attitude is different about </v>

1045
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like people in South America will</v>

1046
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:25.260
<v Speaker 1>eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

1047
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the Chimani or the Macuna is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll eat the same thing every day for</v>

1048
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:33.080
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday</v>

1049
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:35.503
<v Speaker 1>boiled fish with a dried pepper on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a grain made from cassava </v>

1050
00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.830
<v Speaker 1>boiled as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is he a grain?</v>

1051
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:45.720
<v Speaker 1>But like a dish made from cassava.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they boiling it?</v>

1052
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't they just grill it?</v>

1053
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.090
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1054
00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:48.923
<v Speaker 1>they sometimes do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for lunch it's like you take </v>

1055
00:51:50.511 --> 00:51:51.380
<v Speaker 1>leftover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might,</v>

1056
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:52.214
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably like smoked with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were they able to call barbecue fish </v>

1057
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>where you make a big rack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a fire and make a big rack high</v>

1058
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:58.520
<v Speaker 1>above it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kicks off a bunch of smoke.</v>

1059
00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You split fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

1060
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.630
<v Speaker 1>lamb on that rack and smoke them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dry them out,</v>

1061
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:08.050
<v Speaker 1>and then you take that fish and break it</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and poor river water over cassava.</v>

1062
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then put fish in there with river </v>

1063
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:18.350
<v Speaker 1>water and kind of stir it up or you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>take fish and throw it in a pot and boil</v>

1064
00:52:18.351 --> 00:52:19.430
<v Speaker 1>it and put that on there.</v>

1065
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.430
<v Speaker 1>But to eat that same thing every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you come and talk about,</v>

1066
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no recipe,</v>

1067
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.233
<v Speaker 1>there's no like written preparation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you come and talk about like wild </v>

1068
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:30.074
<v Speaker 1>game cook is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that where you make a book </v>

1069
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:34.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's got 100 different recipes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these ways to approach stuff.</v>

1070
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just like it's very particular to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

1071
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 1>like other people aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiving it that way,</v>

1072
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 1>like they don't use wild game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recipes.</v>

1073
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:45.890
<v Speaker 1>They have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

1074
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:46.903
<v Speaker 1>here's how you cook this and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really deviate from cooking this way </v>

1075
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.880
<v Speaker 1>where it's like fish on a rack over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire or efficient,</v>

1076
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 1>a pot of water and very limited diet.</v>

1077
00:52:59.000 --> 00:52:59.833
<v Speaker 2>Does it weird you out when you're around</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like that because you have </v>

1078
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.740
<v Speaker 2>options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1079
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat any way you like.</v>

1080
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 2>You can go to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a burger from fast food,</v>

1081
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.960
<v Speaker 2>you choose to go hunting with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1082
00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:15.530
<v Speaker 2>It's literally how they survive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no option.</v>

1083
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.810
<v Speaker 2>There's no options and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it that way forever.</v>

1084
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:18.913
<v Speaker 2>Like is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you feel like a weird recreational </v>

1085
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:24.100
<v Speaker 2>sort of person around them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it.</v>

1086
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Does it feel?</v>

1087
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no,</v>

1088
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:35.090
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely like an,</v>

1089
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:40.150
<v Speaker 1>an envious part two how to live that </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately.</v>

1090
00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a little bit envious of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really the thing that I feel most,</v>

1091
00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel I'm more than separated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1092
00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I tend to feel more of the areas in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'd be like aligned,</v>

1093
00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where like appreciate the perspective </v>

1094
00:53:59.021 --> 00:54:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and I appreciate the skill set but never</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling,</v>

1095
00:54:02.171 --> 00:54:03.004
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1096

<v Speaker 1>never feeling like,</v>

1097
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.373
<v Speaker 1>like a fuller ashamed or something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be something that I would </v>

1098
00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:10.903
<v Speaker 1>choose to engage in and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they were engaged in and </v>

1099
00:54:13.611 --> 00:54:14.444
<v Speaker 1>I think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that helps make it </v>

1100
00:54:15.111 --> 00:54:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that way is how much they love to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1101
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:20.023
<v Speaker 1>That when you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the infectious excitement of </v>

1102
00:54:23.001 --> 00:54:26.750
<v Speaker 1>heading out in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they still feel it.</v>

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Like there is Giddy is anybody about </v>

<v Speaker 2>My uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my youngest daughter has become enamored</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited that you want to have </v>

1119
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.800
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She caught it six pound bass.</v>

1120
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Then she's hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got quite a few bass.</v>

1121
00:55:16.111 --> 00:55:19.280
<v Speaker 2>It was a great lake in in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Florida.</v>

1122
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.960

<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1123
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:24.800
<v Speaker 2>but we caught a ton of large mouth bass </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she caught up fat boy.</v>

1124
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.070
<v Speaker 2>It was like a six pounder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was freaking yet had bit her finger.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She fucking loves fishing,</v>

1127
00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:34.423
<v Speaker 2>but that feeling in the morning when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at her little face and like </v>

1128
00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:39.770
<v Speaker 2>we're on the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a genetic thing.</v>

1129
00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.220
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's just in the DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fishing is.</v>

1130
00:55:43.221 --> 00:55:44.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

00:55:44.271 --> 00:55:46.550
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go play soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she likes to,</v>

1132
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.840
<v Speaker 2>but there's not that kind of excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be so fun.</v>

1134
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:52.873
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's triggering something that is deep </v>

1135
00:55:56.541 --> 00:56:00.560
<v Speaker 2>inside human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it and I see it in.</v>

1136
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I see it in varying degrees and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>

1137
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Like some kids seem to come out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>box with more of it.</v>

1138

<v Speaker 4>soon as she found out what it was gonna </v>

1151
00:56:28.281 --> 00:56:29.114
<v Speaker 4>be a daughter like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will not exclude our daughter in </v>

1152
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 4>this world that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1153
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course not.</v>

1154
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:37.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

1155
00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.260
<v Speaker 4>and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1156
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:43.860
<v Speaker 4>having in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like I've messed this up.</v>

1157
00:56:43.861 --> 00:56:46.920
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I've put the same emphasis </v>
<v Speaker 4>right on my.</v>

1158
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:48.510
<v Speaker 4>I have three kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my older two,</v>

1159
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:50.043
<v Speaker 4>I'm the little one just a little bit too</v>
<v Speaker 4>little yet to really know what's going </v>

1160
00:56:52.441 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the old chair,</v>

1161
00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:54.673
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I put the same emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and my daughter just isn't </v>

1162
00:56:58.231 --> 00:57:03.231
<v Speaker 4>demonstrating the same enthusiasm that </v>
<v Speaker 4>her older brother does.</v>

1163
00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:04.763
<v Speaker 4>And you and you try to suss out like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature nurture question because I feel </v>

1164
00:57:08.341 --> 00:57:10.080
<v Speaker 4>like I'm doing the same inputs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1165
00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:14.730
<v Speaker 4>But I'm getting different results and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>leads you to wonder,</v>

1166
00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:16.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1167
00:57:16.861 --> 00:57:20.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a very small sample size,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I talked to other parents,</v>

1168
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.470
<v Speaker 4>like parents who are parenting right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1169
00:57:22.471 --> 00:57:23.304
<v Speaker 4>young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just keep encountering other dads who </v>

1170
00:57:27.481 --> 00:57:32.481
<v Speaker 4>are having the same experience and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really leads you to wonder,</v>

1171
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:38.520
<v Speaker 4>sort of like what sort of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>influences are going on there,</v>

1172
00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.373
<v Speaker 4>where it's like the enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 4>oftentimes among young girls are not as </v>

1173
00:57:44.101 --> 00:57:45.900
<v Speaker 4>high as the enthusiasm among bugs.</v>

1174
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to unpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1175
00:57:48.311 --> 00:57:49.930
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to unpack everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1176
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:50.764
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my question is I don't know how </v>

1177
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:56.170
<v Speaker 2>old your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the two on talking about are eight</v>

1178
00:57:56.171 --> 00:57:57.070
<v Speaker 2>and five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1179
00:57:57.071 --> 00:57:57.904
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much culture plays a </v>

1180
00:57:58.751 --> 00:57:59.530
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1181
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:00.363
<v Speaker 2>I really think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's obviously in my small sample </v>

1182
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:06.250
<v Speaker 2>group and eight year old and a 10 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old for the youngest kids,</v>

1183
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:08.650
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eight year old fucking loves it.</v>

1184
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.540
<v Speaker 2>They're both girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10 year old,</v>

1185
00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1186
00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I tried to wake her up,</v>

1187
00:58:13.211 --> 00:58:15.330
<v Speaker 2>take her fish and she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave me alone.</v>

1188
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going back to sleep.</v>

1189
00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there are parents out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

1190
00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't met him yet.</v>

1191
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:22.873
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're out there where they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a boy and a girl and the girls </v>

1192
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:26.720
<v Speaker 4>fired up and the boys not maybe</v>

1193
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie and I were just talking about this</v>

1194
00:58:30.331 --> 00:58:32.490
<v Speaker 2>yesterday because I was watching this </v>
<v Speaker 2>video of these.</v>

1195
00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:34.533
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to try to put this in a </v>

1196
00:58:37.051 --> 00:58:40.410
<v Speaker 2>respectful way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1197
00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're aware of this.</v>

1198
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.230
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are in the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1199
00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:47.064
<v Speaker 2>the outdoor industry that I think are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it's a good avenue to get </v>

1200
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:54.390
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're like a hot chick.</v>

1201
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:55.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a hot check and you know you </v>

1202
00:58:56.821 --> 00:58:58.920
<v Speaker 2>wear pink and you go out and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1203
00:58:58.921 --> 00:58:59.754
<v Speaker 2>you take all these grip and grins with </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer and you're gonna get a lot of </v>

1204
00:59:02.491 --> 00:59:03.660
<v Speaker 2>likes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1205
00:59:03.661 --> 00:59:04.494
<v Speaker 2>Because it's.</v>

1206
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:08.240
<v Speaker 4>Imagine the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the male perspective on it.</v>

1207
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:09.123
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like here's the woman who has </v>

1208
00:59:10.281 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1209
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she likes to hunt.</v>

1210
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:13.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's hot and she likes to hunt and </v>

1211
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:19.630
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a few of them and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling Jamie,</v>

1212
00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:24.631
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird world because part of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a sexist.</v>

1213
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to look at these girls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't.</v>

1214
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.553
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at a guy who hunts and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to be a part of the outdoor </v>

1215
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:31.671
<v Speaker 2>industry and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1216
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:32.504
<v Speaker 2>this guy is just doing this because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks this is his avenue for fame and </v>

1217
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1218
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.533
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a guy who really likes to hunt </v>

1219
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:40.543
<v Speaker 2>and he realizes there's people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Rinella and John Dudley out there </v>

1220
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:46.450
<v Speaker 2>and these famous haunters man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a famous hunter.</v>

1221
00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 2>How do I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I go?</v>

1222
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just start taking instagram</v>

1223
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:51.164
<v Speaker 2>pictures and say a lot of the same shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they say and sort of put myself </v>

1224
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:58.430
<v Speaker 2>into the cultural norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think like that with girls</v>

1225
00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.350
<v Speaker 1>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to.</v>

1226
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them I think are super legit.</v>

1227
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.684
<v Speaker 2>A lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's unquestionably this added </v>

1228
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:08.564
<v Speaker 2>element in that world and it with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be super generous and say it's </v>

1229
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:17.381
<v Speaker 2>only 10 percent of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that 10 percent of my smell a rat.</v>

1230
01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not unaware of what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then you go to their instagram page </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like there's pictures of that </v>

1245
01:00:49.421 --> 01:00:50.254
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a lot of pictures with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their butt up in the air where they're </v>

1246
01:00:52.151 --> 01:00:52.984
<v Speaker 2>doing some strange exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting ready for both things and </v>

1247
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.770
<v Speaker 2>accentuating there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

1248
01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.920
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do any of those exercises.</v>

1249
01:00:59.010 --> 01:00:59.843
<v Speaker 1>I really liked you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I would really like to because </v>

1250
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.253
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to continue leaning on my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue leaning on my daughter </v>

1251
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>because I would really like her.</v>

1252
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to keep leaning on her and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like she's in the ad age or she can</v>

1253
01:01:15.451 --> 01:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>legitimately say she doesn't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1254
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Because right now if I asked her </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>

1255
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:20.523
<v Speaker 1>hey you want to go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be having real delinquency </v>

1256
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>

1257
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really like a,</v>

1258
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.863
<v Speaker 1>you make kids do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took her duck on a couple of weekends </v>

1259
01:01:29.911 --> 01:01:30.744
<v Speaker 1>ago and it was cold morning and we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and before it's even legal </v>

1260
01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's felt terrible.</v>

1261
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>She's laying there crying about colder </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet are.</v>

1262
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.233
<v Speaker 1>If my boy was doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have a very different attitude </v>

1263
01:01:46.741 --> 01:01:47.574
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when she's crying her crank and </v>

1264
01:01:50.911 --> 01:01:51.744
<v Speaker 1>she's cold,</v>

1265
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 1>like made me feel awful with my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been like,</v>

1266
01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>suck it up for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1267
01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's all cold now.</v>

1268
01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it makes it so you really,</v>

1269
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.750
<v Speaker 1>there really is a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1270
01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1271
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference there and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1272
01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>the people that buy a hunting license in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

1273
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of people by hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent are males,</v>

1274
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1275
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So one in 10 license holders is a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's,</v>

1276
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.653
<v Speaker 1>there's more women than men in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly more men women than men in the </v>

1277
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>country and there's a ton of ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining it.</v>

1278
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:30.564
<v Speaker 1>We talked about earlier with </v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthals or maybe an inner falls </v>

1279
01:02:32.121 --> 01:02:37.121
<v Speaker 1>didn't have these divided roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in all the hunter in hunter gatherer</v>

1280
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:38.394
<v Speaker 1>cultures is very normal to see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>division of labor here and to have like </v>

1281
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>the men were out hunting and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>

1282
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of explanations for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1283
01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Like people were tied to being home to </v>
<v Speaker 1>care for small children and you know,</v>

1284
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>couldn't afford that risk to something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they vary?</v>

1285
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>There's some women that go out with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting parties,</v>

1286
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it is,</v>

1287
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1288
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.673
<v Speaker 1>the minute you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was going to point out to some </v>

1289
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.430
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Variation,</v>

1290
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.880
<v Speaker 1>but in your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1291
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 1>you've done several of these trips to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these remote jungles.</v>

1292
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's just,</v>

1293
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>that's such a small thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1294
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:15.054
<v Speaker 1>you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than looking at personal </v>

1295
01:03:15.961 --> 01:03:16.794
<v Speaker 1>experience just from kind of exploring </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature and reading about historic </v>

1296
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 1>accounts and what people found in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>

1297
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very much the norm is very much </v>

1298
01:03:26.191 --> 01:03:29.040
<v Speaker 1>the norm that hunting was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1299
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 1>patrilineal descent activity in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these cultures.</v>

1300
01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 1>You go to like the cult of the hunter is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a male sort of coal,</v>

1301
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 1>but the factors that made it that way.</v>

1302
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sort of the,</v>

1303
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you you have to assume it comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of practical factor.</v>

1304
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:46.734
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The factors that made that way aren't </v>

1305
01:03:47.611 --> 01:03:48.444
<v Speaker 1>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said it's a difficult thing to </v>

1306
01:03:51.391 --> 01:03:52.224
<v Speaker 1>unpack if it winds up being that if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have two boys and one girl winds up </v>

1307
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:57.240
<v Speaker 1>being that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1308
01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.733
<v Speaker 1>both boys become avid hunters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishermen and somehow my daughter does </v>

1309
01:04:05.431 --> 01:04:06.264
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably view it as some bit of a </v>

1310
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:09.264
<v Speaker 1>personal failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never know what really was going </v>

1311
01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:12.264
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1312
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to like unload it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could have 100 children like 50</v>

1313
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:17.990
<v Speaker 1>girls and 50 boys and have a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>samples,</v>

1314
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.431
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1315
01:04:20.431 --> 01:04:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I do wonder about it and what's funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>too is there's no,</v>

1316
01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>like at our home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kids are,</v>

1317
01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:27.944
<v Speaker 1>our kids eat tons of wild game at our </v>
<v Speaker 1>home to the point where they don't have </v>

1318
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:32.663
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

1319
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.983
<v Speaker 1>You could give them anything to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would eat it and it would not </v>

1320
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:43.851
<v Speaker 1>register to them is unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've eaten everything right.</v>

1321
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>They've even eaten breakfast sausage </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of Fox and beaver meat.</v>

1322
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>They've eaten Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1323
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>they've eaten everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1324
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Eat Fox a half.</v>

1325
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I made a batch of breakfast sausages </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had an Arctic Fox one time and</v>

1326
01:04:56.761 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I made breakfast sausage out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that like?</v>

1327
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I just caught it in with beaver meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1328
01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:02.183
<v Speaker 1>Deer meat and a little bit of pork fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids ate it and then every wink you </v>

1329
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:08.100
<v Speaker 1>try any of the Fox on its own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1330
01:05:08.101 --> 01:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Didn't try the Fox on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a ton of things,</v>

1331
01:05:11.161 --> 01:05:11.994
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't eat just straight old </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed you to stuff that Fox into </v>

1332
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>that sausage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that they were good and I had an</v>

1333
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Arctic Fox and I wanted to get a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>made if my wife from it.</v>

1334
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:23.783
<v Speaker 1>So I had a hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arctic Fox hat made for and then I </v>

1335
01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:27.594
<v Speaker 1>retained the meat and then we just ate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat and breakfast sausage and then </v>

1336
01:05:29.911 --> 01:05:31.140
<v Speaker 1>like if I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1337
01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.710
<v Speaker 1>if they were to ask like what meat it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I would say,</v>

1338
01:05:33.711 --> 01:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's know this,</v>

1339
01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:38.310
<v Speaker 1>this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't freak them out.</v>

1340
01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't even know.</v>

1341
01:05:39.991 --> 01:05:40.824
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't even register as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing that might seem unusual to some </v>

1342
01:05:44.371 --> 01:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the squirrel rabbit all manner stuff,</v>

1343
01:05:47.461 --> 01:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The just anything.</v>

1344
01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:50.723
<v Speaker 1>And so I know there's no element of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no influence like that with </v>

1345
01:05:54.301 --> 01:05:56.250
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no influence of,</v>

1346
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.010
<v Speaker 1>oh that's gross or you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

1347
01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:00.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their day we were hunting the other day </v>

1348
01:06:01.231 --> 01:06:03.630
<v Speaker 1>we went out and we're hunting street </v>
<v Speaker 1>pigeons,</v>

1349
01:06:03.631 --> 01:06:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll eat pigeon meat.</v>

1350
01:06:05.821 --> 01:06:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And where were you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Montana.</v>

1351
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1352
01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1353
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:13.380
<v Speaker 1>there's like a guy at a grain silo that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was infested with pigeons.</v>

1354
01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Folks don't know that many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>

1355
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:19.650
<v Speaker 1>that pigeons were actually brought over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here as food.</v>

1356
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:22.890
<v Speaker 1>And when you get like fancy squad on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>menu,</v>

1357
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what a pigeon is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No flightless pigeon pigeon hasn't flown</v>

1358
01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:28.140
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a squad is.</v>

1359
01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.330
<v Speaker 1>So smaller and younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

1360
01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meats,</v>

1361
01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:31.854
<v Speaker 1>pinkish on the meats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pinkish on squad if you want to get </v>

1362
01:06:33.691 --> 01:06:34.524
<v Speaker 1>squad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we used to go out and catch squads </v>

1363
01:06:35.551 --> 01:06:37.950
<v Speaker 1>where we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had like a little,</v>

1364
01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:41.370
<v Speaker 1>almost like the equivalent of a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>trap line where they would,</v>

1365
01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:42.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1366
01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:43.764
<v Speaker 1>Nasa and various places around town and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we would just know all the places to go </v>

1367
01:06:47.551 --> 01:06:50.790
<v Speaker 1>check to get squabbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

1368
01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's one that hasn't flown yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1369
01:06:52.381 --> 01:06:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that commercially produced squad,</v>

1370
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you can just keep them from flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want squad from the wild,</v>

1371
01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.960
<v Speaker 1>you need to go out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go and collect them.</v>

1372
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And what's the difference between pigeon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and squad in terms of the way it taste?</v>

1373
01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Pigeon meat is tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grayer,</v>

1374
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has more livery quality and squad is </v>

1375
01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.230
<v Speaker 1>like very tender pinkish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's lean.</v>

1376
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.173
<v Speaker 1>It's not like quail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's leaning way more in the </v>

1377
01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:26.241
<v Speaker 1>direction of quail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it'd be like if a pigeon in a quail</v>

1378
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:32.490
<v Speaker 1>had a baby squads more like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1379
01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.480
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the biggest surprises I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1380
01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:39.600
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the biggest surprises </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever had in,</v>

1381
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.823
<v Speaker 1>in game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we can count that as wild game </v>

1382
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:44.183
<v Speaker 1>would be what a squad tasted like </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had been eating it for a long </v>

1383
01:07:48.181 --> 01:07:49.014
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eating Street pigeons because no street </v>

1384
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:51.410
<v Speaker 1>pigeons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1385
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.180
<v Speaker 1>they're around even up in the Missouri </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks,</v>

1386
01:07:54.181 --> 01:07:55.900
<v Speaker 1>you got street pinch that nest up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1387
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:57.360
<v Speaker 1>in the cliffs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1388
01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:58.213
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many places you can hunt street </v>

1389
01:07:59.311 --> 01:08:03.150
<v Speaker 1>pigeons and they become a agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>past and they're not regulated.</v>

1390
01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So there's no closed season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bag limit,</v>

1391
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1392
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 1>They're treated like they have no more </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>

1393
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.713
<v Speaker 1>Like rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could talk to wildlife managers </v>

1394
01:08:14.071 --> 01:08:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and ask them if they could wave a magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>wand and make street pigeons go away.</v>

1395
01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Most everybody would waive it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so costly.</v>

1396
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>They're costly to cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're costly to agriculture.</v>

1397
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd always eat and pigeons,</v>

1398
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but the minute of discovering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovering like what a squad was like,</v>

1399
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:31.280
<v Speaker 1>which is well known to people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine dining,</v>

1400
01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but I had never had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was shocking how good it is.</v>

1401
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never picked it off the menu,</v>

1402
01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm tented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1403
01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:42.030
<v Speaker 1>you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But street pigeon.</v>

1404
01:08:42.031 --> 01:08:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Should I avoid that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1405
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I would eat something first just to test</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and make lattes from it.</v>

1406
01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:47.653
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not something that you would </v>

1407
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:49.063
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of my favorite things to </v>

1408
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1409
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way to do it where you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like,</v>

1410
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:56.000
<v Speaker 1>is there a preparation maybe that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed?</v>

1411
01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.793
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put it in a marinade and you can </v>

1412
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>grill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1413
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:08.480
<v Speaker 1>You want to take little brass and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>poke it whole bunch,</v>

1414
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.373
<v Speaker 1>like poke it with a fork and tenderize a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and also make some like </v>

1415
01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:16.520
<v Speaker 1>avenues of approach for the marinade and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grill them over.</v>

1416
01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Very hot flame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1417
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:19.993
<v Speaker 1>but what was good is like to use it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to like stuff with Ptarmigan or </v>

1418
01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:23.864
<v Speaker 1>whatever is to make patties and Tureens </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ptarmigan is something that you would </v>

1419
01:09:27.061 --> 01:09:27.894
<v Speaker 1>cook that way as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen people do Ptarmigan on </v>

1420
01:09:30.711 --> 01:09:31.544
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1421
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 1>with sexual called life below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lady who lives,</v>

1422
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:38.930
<v Speaker 1>she's been on the show before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she lives like fucking hell.</v>

1423
01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.810
<v Speaker 1>What does she live like 200 miles above </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arctic circle.</v>

1424
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she hunts Ptarmigan up there.</v>

1425
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.790
<v Speaker 1>The best time I've ever eaten in this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1426
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.210
<v Speaker 1>this is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our new cookbook too,</v>

1427
01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:56.390
<v Speaker 1>but I mentioned using Ptarmigan for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a,</v>

1428
01:09:56.391 --> 01:09:59.150
<v Speaker 1>a dish that's great for regular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any,</v>

1429
01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:01.220
<v Speaker 1>any kind of meat particularly gamers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have,</v>

1430
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.300
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had hot pot.</v>

1431
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you like,</v>

1432
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.100
<v Speaker 1>where you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1433
01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.013
<v Speaker 1>you have like the simmering broth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have all these raw like raw </v>

1434
01:10:09.351 --> 01:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>sliced meats that you dip in there.</v>

1435
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.830
<v Speaker 1>The best timing I've ever had is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1436
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1437
01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it's other worldly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
01:10:19.401 --> 01:10:20.234
<v Speaker 1>it's just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kinda like when you slice it thin </v>

1439
01:10:21.921 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and cooked that way I just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vanishes on your tongue.</v>

1440
01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:25.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tender meat.</v>

1441
01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:26.654
<v Speaker 1>You can almost kind of mash it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like a thing you hear with a lot </v>

1442
01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:31.090
<v Speaker 1>of gamers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People described harm.</v>

1443
01:10:31.091 --> 01:10:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat street pigeon,</v>

1444
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:35.870
<v Speaker 1>lot of game birds people describe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>livery diving,</v>

1445
01:10:35.871 --> 01:10:39.320
<v Speaker 1>ducks being livery because it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>texture thing to it.</v>

1446
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And in the strength of flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a darkness of color.</v>

1447
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those people make a lot of pathways.</v>

1448
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:48.163
<v Speaker 1>Liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1449
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:50.930
<v Speaker 1>So those birds that have that quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes they just,</v>

1450
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.560
<v Speaker 1>they can find their way into patties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we also have recipes for that.</v>

1451
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Like how to do pat taste from using all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all manner of meat.</v>

1452
01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any recipes in the book for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown bear?</v>

1453
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have bare recipes.</v>

1454
01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1455
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.453
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black bears are among people who know </v>

1456
01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>blackbirds are widely accepted as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>good to eat.</v>

1457
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:16.973
<v Speaker 1>If you go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to earlier I mentioned Daniel </v>

1458
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.881
<v Speaker 1>Boone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you go into that,</v>

1459
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>like the frontier era of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

1460
01:11:24.181 --> 01:11:25.014
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which proceeded just these little lingo </v>

1461
01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.114
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The frontier era of American history </v>

1462
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:29.304
<v Speaker 1>proceeded the mountain man era of </v>
<v Speaker 1>American history with like the eastern </v>

1463
01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:33.294
<v Speaker 1>settlements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1464
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read it like about Daniel Boone's</v>

1465
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:38.300
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1466
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>early 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds up into,</v>

1467
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:41.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1468
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:45.900
<v Speaker 1>open to the revolutionary war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear me was the most popular meet on the</v>

1469
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>frontier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black bears.</v>

1470
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>The most popular is in preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferred over venison.</v>

1471
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1472
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 1>People hunted deer to sell deer hides </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would eat the deer meat.</v>

1473
01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.350
<v Speaker 1>People want to barriers to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they like to eat late.</v>

1474
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.740
<v Speaker 1>So there's more beef like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>People love bear meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brown bears.</v>

1477
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bears just don't enjoy the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation.</v>

1478
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different diets.</v>

1479
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:18.420
<v Speaker 1>One run in with Brown when we use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we use the term Brown,</v>

1480
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:20.040
<v Speaker 1>like brown bear is kind of almost like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1481
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's used amongst hunters a lot,</v>

1482
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:26.790
<v Speaker 1>but it is all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all one species,</v>

1483
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:27.624
<v Speaker 1>so whether you've got a grizzly bear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming or a brown bear on Kodiak </v>

1484
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:34.110
<v Speaker 1>taxonomically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's regarded as as a single species.</v>

1485
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.730
<v Speaker 1>People Call Brown bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown bear is a grizzly.</v>

1486
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.850
<v Speaker 1>You'll get all kinds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1487
01:12:40.851 --> 01:12:43.310
<v Speaker 1>and you to say this about various points</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this book,</v>

1488
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.800
<v Speaker 1>like debating various aspects of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A brown bear is a grizzly with access to</v>

1489
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:51.143
<v Speaker 1>marine resources were marine resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>make up a major component of it's diet </v>

1490
01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and then the question you bring up is </v>
<v Speaker 1>then like if you go to the north slope,</v>

1491
01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:01.770
<v Speaker 1>so if you go to the Arctic coast and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw a grizzly there,</v>

1492
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.521
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1493
01:13:02.521 --> 01:13:04.380
<v Speaker 1>he has access to marine resources.</v>

1494
01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:06.930
<v Speaker 1>He can eat a beached whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1495
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:12.300
<v Speaker 1>but he's a grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like brown bears kind of extend right</v>

1496
01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:17.301
<v Speaker 1>from northern BC up around and Hook </v>
<v Speaker 1>around into the bering sea,</v>

1497
01:13:18.721 --> 01:13:21.270
<v Speaker 1>but at some point they're just not brown</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears anymore and there he,</v>

1498
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:26.220
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be big and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and oftentimes because of the name,</v>

1499
01:13:26.221 --> 01:13:28.050
<v Speaker 1>like the tend to have like a darker </v>
<v Speaker 1>coloration,</v>

1500
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:32.080
<v Speaker 1>they have a horrible reputation is food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll always find people who will point</v>

1501
01:13:32.081 --> 01:13:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1502
01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Or nowadays because people are so aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the social media world nowadays,</v>

1503
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you'll have people that will kill a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brown bear and here you are,</v>

1504
01:13:40.591 --> 01:13:45.591
<v Speaker 1>you've got four or 500 pounds of meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll talk about how they're going</v>

1505
01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.790
<v Speaker 1>to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like dude,</v>

1506
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 1>you're in for a pound a day this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1507
01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that really what happened for real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that really what happened?</v>

1508
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:56.220
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1509
01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And then there's no salvage requirement </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

1510
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no salvage requirement on it.</v>

1511
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have to in Alaska?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have to pack it out?</v>

1512
01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some areas that have zero.</v>

1513
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:11.031
<v Speaker 1>Some areas you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically typically no,</v>

1514
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 1>but there are areas that do have salvage</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirements where I have a cabin,</v>

1515
01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:14.974
<v Speaker 1>there's a salvage requirement on bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat in the spring because in areas </v>

1516
01:14:18.341 --> 01:14:20.600
<v Speaker 1>where bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a black but yours,</v>

1517
01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 1>your cabin is that there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's island by island,</v>

1518
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.080
<v Speaker 1>so somehow like the ABC islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1519
01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.173
<v Speaker 1>like you know you go to Admiralty </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islands in Admiralty Islands is all </v>

1520
01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:33.634
<v Speaker 1>brown bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it winds up being that if the island </v>

1521
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:40.950
<v Speaker 1>is good brown bear habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will only have brown bears because on</v>

1522
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:41.944
<v Speaker 1>the islands where it's smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just would kill all the </v>

1523
01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.073
<v Speaker 1>blackberries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there and blackbirds aren't </v>

1524
01:14:47.351 --> 01:14:48.184
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the island is not brown bear habitat </v>

1525
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.830
<v Speaker 1>and can't support brown bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will become a black bear island.</v>

1526
01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Prince Wales is a black bear island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Admiral Tom Brown,</v>

1527
01:14:56.921 --> 01:14:57.754
<v Speaker 1>bear island and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of depends on how much seems to </v>

1528
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:04.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe depending on how much like open </v>
<v Speaker 1>country or Alpine or you know,</v>

1529
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:05.343
<v Speaker 1>if it's like densely densely forested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less suitable and becomes a black </v>

1530
01:15:10.361 --> 01:15:11.194
<v Speaker 1>bear territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But black bears in the spring have a </v>

1531
01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:17.710
<v Speaker 1>salvage requirement because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about coastal bears,</v>

1532
01:15:17.711 --> 01:15:18.544
<v Speaker 1>coastal bears are better to eat in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spring when they're not eating tons of </v>

1533
01:15:21.071 --> 01:15:21.904
<v Speaker 1>rotten salmon in the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be a salvage requirement </v>

1534
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
<v Speaker 1>because when they're eating dead salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their flesh can become not good.</v>

1535
01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.113
<v Speaker 1>I remember you telling me a story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the guy smoker and he told the </v>

1536
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:34.451
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1537
01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you need to clean that smoker out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smells like fish.</v>

1538
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:38.643
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never cooked efficient [inaudible] </v>

1539
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were smoking a barren it.</v>

1540
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a.</v>

1541
01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:45.460
<v Speaker 1>That was an early June in early June.</v>

1542
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Blackberry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not getting salmon,</v>

1543
01:15:46.871 --> 01:15:47.704
<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stores up that that flavor stores on </v>

1544
01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:50.254
<v Speaker 1>their fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched even woves eating salmon </v>

1545
01:15:53.111 --> 01:15:58.111
<v Speaker 1>that were so rotten that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lapping it up where it just turns into a</v>

1546
01:15:58.871 --> 01:15:59.704
<v Speaker 1>grey Bush into the bears and people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of a bear is like eating a brand </v>

1547
01:16:04.511 --> 01:16:05.344
<v Speaker 1>new fresh fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they love to do and they seem to </v>

1548
01:16:06.881 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 1>prefer it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when there's tons of fresh fish and</v>

1549
01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting fresh fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just eat eggs.</v>

1550
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as the fish run dies down,</v>

1551
01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 1>they just start eating rotten fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1552
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember how we got to talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about quality food.</v>

1553
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you asking?</v>

1554
01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So even like Mark Bowden's Buck Bowden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1555
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:25.263
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's picked the head meat off of </v>

1556
01:16:26.701 --> 01:16:27.534
<v Speaker 1>Wolverine skull to eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bowden and said he struggled his </v>

1557
01:16:29.951 --> 01:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1558
01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:36.100
<v Speaker 1>and just hasn't found a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>brown bears that good.</v>

1559
01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.770
<v Speaker 1>There are exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People run into good taste in one's the,</v>

1560
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about like,</v>

1561
01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:44.440
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies up on the north slope have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good reputation.</v>

1562
01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Any black bear in the rockies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any is good.</v>

1563
01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:51.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard stories like I had a body </v>

1564
01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:57.310
<v Speaker 1>that kill one over a dead cow one time </v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed and it was scavenging a rotten</v>

1565
01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.840
<v Speaker 1>cow and he had a hard time with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

1566
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:01.010
<v Speaker 1>But generally</v>

1567
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:06.900
<v Speaker 1>bears that aren't eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marine resources are pretty,</v>

1568
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.280
<v Speaker 1>are phenomenally good.</v>

1569
01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.910
<v Speaker 5>Talk to my friend Eric Weinstein </v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday.</v>

1570
01:17:11.911 --> 01:17:14.550
<v Speaker 5>He's a mathematician.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the smartest guys I know.</v>

1571
01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.473
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is been fascinated by my obsession </v>

1572
01:17:18.511 --> 01:17:19.344
<v Speaker 5>with hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he started watching a bunch of </v>

1573
01:17:21.181 --> 01:17:23.610
<v Speaker 5>hunting things online and he said he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>very put off.</v>

1574
01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.113
<v Speaker 5>I saw people killing bears with spears </v>
<v Speaker 5>and celebrating and the way they were </v>

1575
01:17:29.641 --> 01:17:31.020
<v Speaker 5>celebrating about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1576
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.670
<v Speaker 5>you found the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing,</v>

1577
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:33.953
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1578
01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:38.360
<v Speaker 5>and I saw his point and we had this </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion about it where,</v>

1579
01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1580
01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:42.083
<v Speaker 5>acknowledging the need to control the </v>
<v Speaker 5>population and that this is all that </v>

1581
01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:46.893
<v Speaker 5>they're allocated a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>tags by wildlife biologist and this </v>

1582
01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:53.520
<v Speaker 5>keeps the moose population healthy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the deer population,</v>

1583
01:17:53.521 --> 01:17:54.690
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different things.</v>

1584
01:17:54.691 --> 01:17:57.240
<v Speaker 5>And even that people eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those things made sense to him.</v>

1585
01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:02.520
<v Speaker 5>But the celebration and the all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hooting and hollering and stuff,</v>

1586
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:05.130
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was just not enough of a reverence</v>

1587
01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:06.840
<v Speaker 5>for the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it really,</v>

1588
01:18:06.841 --> 01:18:07.770
<v Speaker 5>really disturbed them.</v>

1589
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1590
01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a great subject and it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to approach because.</v>

1591
01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So you find so many contradictions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird parts of it.</v>

1592
01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 1>And by that I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having a conversation tonight with</v>

1593
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 1>a gentlemen over dinner and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1594
01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:28.063
<v Speaker 1>He was explained to me what is the role </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a rancher and what is the role of </v>

1595
01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.000
<v Speaker 1>farmer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the person who's bringing animals</v>

1596
01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:35.834
<v Speaker 1>into life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's propagating breeding animals with </v>

1597
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:38.504
<v Speaker 1>the sole intention that they will all </v>
<v Speaker 1>die and he will make his living off of </v>

1598
01:18:44.841 --> 01:18:45.674
<v Speaker 1>their death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that person remains a sort of </v>

1599
01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 1>cultural icon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They enjoy like a celebration.</v>

1600
01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:58.850
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're trying to sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell a pickup truck,</v>

1601
01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can tie it to a rancher,</v>

1602
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:03.913
<v Speaker 1>it makes that pickup trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He more legitimate that celebrated </v>

1603
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.040
<v Speaker 1>character and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1604
01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 1>he's an old cowboy.</v>

1605
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we like that.</v>

1606
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it.</v>

1607
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Not that I'm definitely not knocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1608
01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Let me get where I'm going with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is that like?</v>

1609
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.573
<v Speaker 1>That person is based off of like rearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in order that they may die and </v>

1610
01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:25.514
<v Speaker 1>he profits from their death and remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrated and then you get into the </v>

1611
01:19:30.711 --> 01:19:32.450
<v Speaker 1>idea of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way,</v>

1612
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.480
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to American wildlife where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a population of wildlife,</v>

1613
01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:39.554
<v Speaker 1>many respects we have it and enjoy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>management that we do and the abundance </v>

1614
01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:48.260
<v Speaker 1>that we do in many ways that abundance </v>
<v Speaker 1>is supported,</v>

1615
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:50.750
<v Speaker 1>bolstered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financed by hunters,</v>

1616
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:56.500
<v Speaker 1>but hunters tend to not enjoy that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural support because of the death.</v>

1617
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:03.810
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also because of media depictions.</v>

1618
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:05.640
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the big part of it.</v>

1619
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 5>More than even so than the if are.</v>

1620
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.533
<v Speaker 2>If all of our depictions about hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're tied into this sort of rational </v>

1621
01:20:13.741 --> 01:20:18.741
<v Speaker 2>discourse and they showed all the images</v>
<v Speaker 2>from your show of animals being shot and</v>

1622
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:23.970
<v Speaker 2>carefully butchered in the field and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then prepared and cooked and enjoyed.</v>

1623
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 2>I think people would have a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different perception,</v>

1624
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:27.623
<v Speaker 2>but we have elmer fudd and we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil hunters and the movies that are </v>

1625
01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:34.800
<v Speaker 2>always trying to torture the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1626
01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:35.723
<v Speaker 2>it's Disney and anthropomorphization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals and all these different </v>

1627
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:44.751
<v Speaker 2>films and media depictions and books </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Shit and then teddy bears all these</v>

1628
01:20:44.821 --> 01:20:45.654
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like stained into people's </v>

1629
01:20:46.351 --> 01:20:49.560
<v Speaker 2>brains of what's good and what's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1630
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:53.950
<v Speaker 2>very few kids have stuffed cows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their pets are,</v>

1631
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.823
<v Speaker 2>that their toys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have teddy bears and maybe rudolph </v>

1632
01:20:57.451 --> 01:20:59.490
<v Speaker 2>the red nose reindeer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to shoot Rudolph.</v>

1633
01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:00.413
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to.</v>

1634
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:04.080
<v Speaker 4>It seems that it gets much worse and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more contentious.</v>

1635
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:09.240
<v Speaker 4>The less the pop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the American population is looking at</v>

1636
01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:10.074
<v Speaker 4>something that they recognize as game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel different things that they </v>

1637
01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:15.564
<v Speaker 4>don't recognize this game that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't readily recognizes game to see </v>

1638
01:21:20.011 --> 01:21:24.210
<v Speaker 4>that death is more abhorrent to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it is being treated as game,</v>

1639
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:25.283
<v Speaker 4>but like you don't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see social media explosions </v>

1640
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:31.020
<v Speaker 4>come up around someone with a Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1641
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.990
<v Speaker 4>You don't see a lot of social media </v>
<v Speaker 4>explosions come up with someone around a</v>

1642
01:21:33.991 --> 01:21:34.824
<v Speaker 4>white tail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deer.</v>

1643
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.750
<v Speaker 4>People look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They see this animal that they perceived</v>

1644
01:21:38.751 --> 01:21:41.610
<v Speaker 4>to be very abundant in the case of white</v>
<v Speaker 4>tails and Turkeys are correct,</v>

1645
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 4>very abundant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're familiar with them.</v>

1646
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:45.443
<v Speaker 4>They're familiar with the idea of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things being haunted and it feels </v>

1647
01:21:48.301 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1648
01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 4>if there's things where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceived scarcity,</v>

1649
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:53.423
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1650
01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:59.120
<v Speaker 4>and they don't immediately recognize it </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a food item,</v>

1651
01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.033
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for them extremely in this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>way outside of my personal area of </v>

1652
01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:07.970
<v Speaker 4>expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why like what goes on in Africa,</v>

1653
01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.013
<v Speaker 4>but for people to see animals in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 4>that had been hunted and they recognize </v>

1654
01:22:12.771 --> 01:22:13.770
<v Speaker 4>them only from like</v>

1655
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:17.370
<v Speaker 4>film depictions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cartoon depictions,</v>

1656
01:22:17.371 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 4>mobiles over their child's Crib,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1657
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:20.873
<v Speaker 4>like a hippopotamus is very like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't look at that and it's hard to </v>

1658
01:22:24.181 --> 01:22:25.014
<v Speaker 4>see that as like the harvest of game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes something very different and </v>

1659
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:33.780
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've watched it happen with bears,</v>

1660
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:35.093
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also a thing that will happen is if you </v>

1661
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:42.240
<v Speaker 4>initiate the hunting of something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't hunted before,</v>

1662
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:43.763
<v Speaker 4>that's very difficult for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you take a state where like New </v>

1663
01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:51.630
<v Speaker 4>Jersey or Florida where they for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time historically they would have a bear</v>

1664
01:22:51.631 --> 01:22:53.850
<v Speaker 4>season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would lose the bear,</v>

1665
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:56.160
<v Speaker 4>so the bear sees would go away because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>

1666
01:22:56.210 --> 01:22:57.043
<v Speaker 4>of a resource scarcity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then later they would recover the </v>

1667
01:22:59.551 --> 01:23:00.384
<v Speaker 4>resource in want to reinitiate the hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have very difficult time with </v>

1668
01:23:05.171 --> 01:23:06.004
<v Speaker 4>that being like</v>

1669
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't hunted before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can it be hunted now?</v>

1670
01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:10.403
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that trips people up really bad </v>

1671
01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.340
<v Speaker 1>where they people have are hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>on board with it.</v>

1672
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:16.263
<v Speaker 1>If you watch what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears around what has been </v>

1673
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:20.164
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately named the greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone ecosystem where you sort of </v>

1674
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:23.254
<v Speaker 1>have this cultural custody battle around</v>
<v Speaker 1>who owns this Indiana size Hunka land </v>

1675
01:23:26.921 --> 01:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>surrounding yellowstone where because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>naming,</v>

1676
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:34.210
<v Speaker 1>people sort of think of it as as </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone when it certainly is not,</v>

1677
01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.073
<v Speaker 1>it's a large area surrounding it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there we had a period where we </v>

1678
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:40.650
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1679
01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 1>we stopped grizzly hunting because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are being over harvested habitat</v>

1680
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:45.454
<v Speaker 1>destruction and then you go through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous amount of work to recover the </v>

1681
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:49.324
<v Speaker 1>species and people are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistant to the idea that you would </v>

1682
01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:56.230
<v Speaker 1>start hunting now that you would now </v>
<v Speaker 1>start hunting something.</v>

1683
01:23:56.230 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 1>You weren't hunting a few days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1684
01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.313
<v Speaker 1>That's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also what you were saying </v>

1685
01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.173
<v Speaker 1>earlier that it's not recognized as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>game species because it's thought of </v>

1686
01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.160
<v Speaker 1>something you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1687
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:05.303
<v Speaker 1>Like mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even if mountain lions are a </v>

1688
01:24:07.031 --> 01:24:09.390
<v Speaker 1>nuisance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a woman that had um,</v>

1689
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:14.550
<v Speaker 1>she had a depredation permit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions had killed 10 alpacas and</v>

1690
01:24:15.461 --> 01:24:20.461
<v Speaker 1>a goat in her farm in Malibu and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided not to act on the permit because</v>

1691
01:24:21.611 --> 01:24:22.444
<v Speaker 1>there were so many different people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were threatening her with so many </v>

1692
01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 1>wildlife activists that were threatening</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and just general people online death</v>

1693
01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:32.580
<v Speaker 1>threats because she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.740
<v Speaker 1>she was gonna hire someone to shoot this</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion that had been.</v>

1695
01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just went on a thrill kill and</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into one of our pens,</v>

1696
01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:41.240
<v Speaker 1>just went ham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>

1698
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:47.440
<v Speaker 1>they think of that thing is somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another better than her alpacas,</v>

1699
01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 1>which is very weird.</v>

1700
01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.490
<v Speaker 1>No people just recently protested the </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing of tiger,</v>

1701
01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:53.950
<v Speaker 1>a tiger in India that had killed 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1702
01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:54.813
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put that online and people in the </v>

1703
01:24:56.321 --> 01:24:59.170
<v Speaker 1>comments where we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck those people.</v>

1704
01:24:59.770 --> 01:25:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out of your mind.</v>

1705
01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:05.080
<v Speaker 1>What if that was your sister when it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>your daughter?</v>

1706
01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 1>When was your mom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if is your brother,</v>

1707
01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:08.410
<v Speaker 1>your brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch,</v>

1708
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:11.350
<v Speaker 1>watch your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting dragged away by a giant monster.</v>

1709
01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1710
01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:15.250
<v Speaker 1>just because it's called a tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're cool with that.</v>

1711
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1712
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:19.000
<v Speaker 1>fuck your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying that this was</v>

1713
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:21.960
<v Speaker 1>an interesting year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that.</v>

1714
01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me finish my thought and I don't </v>

1715
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:26.860
<v Speaker 1>want to sound callous when I called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting,</v>

1716
01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:31.861
<v Speaker 1>but Washington state had its first </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion mortality,</v>

1717
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.033
<v Speaker 1>like where a mountain lion killed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human for the first time and I think it </v>

1718
01:25:34.521 --> 01:25:35.354
<v Speaker 1>was 94 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon is when Oregon had its first in </v>

1719
01:25:37.151 --> 01:25:42.151
<v Speaker 1>state history and I'm with the one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington killed a person.</v>

1720
01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:43.503
<v Speaker 1>They tracked the lying down and killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion and the state fish and game </v>

1721
01:25:48.011 --> 01:25:48.844
<v Speaker 1>department got predictably like a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of blowback for having killed and I was </v>

1722
01:25:52.331 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone who was involved with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I was standing up.</v>

1723
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that the blowback would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a lot worse had you not done it.</v>

1724
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1725
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:02.650
<v Speaker 1>but you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear from those people,</v>

1726
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but there is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be blow</v>

1727
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:04.963
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1728
01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:06.363
<v Speaker 2>if they didn't kill the lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lion is just out there roaming </v>

1729
01:26:08.681 --> 01:26:09.514
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people would just ignore it </v>

1730
01:26:10.661 --> 01:26:12.550
<v Speaker 2>because the new cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking quick.</v>

1731
01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they would lose.</v>

1732
01:26:13.961 --> 01:26:14.794
<v Speaker 2>It would get lost and trump would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something stupid about North Korea or </v>

1733
01:26:16.931 --> 01:26:18.130
<v Speaker 2>whatever and people would forget.</v>

1734
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:19.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1735
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:21.180
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1736
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:22.810
<v Speaker 4>I continue to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1737
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:26.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I continued to hunt black bears,</v>

1738
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:28.010
<v Speaker 4>black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1739
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the case of mountain lions,</v>

1740
01:26:29.811 --> 01:26:32.270
<v Speaker 4>you have a rapidly expanding mountain </v>
<v Speaker 4>lion populations.</v>

1741
01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:33.710
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain lions,</v>

1742
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:36.590
<v Speaker 4>or [inaudible] new territory's all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1743
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:38.910
<v Speaker 4>They're managed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1744
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:43.210
<v Speaker 4>most states manage them very tightly </v>
<v Speaker 4>with mortality quotas,</v>

1745
01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:47.060
<v Speaker 4>female mortality quarters open season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close these and permit draws,</v>

1746
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That they're managed as a game animal.</v>

1747
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1748
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:52.663
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hunted and there's some </v>

1749
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:57.103
<v Speaker 4>allowable use of the renewable resource.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at the same time that that's going </v>

1750
01:27:01.011 --> 01:27:01.844
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're enjoying expanding populations of </v>

1751
01:27:03.171 --> 01:27:04.420
<v Speaker 4>mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>

1752
01:27:04.450 --> 01:27:05.283
<v Speaker 4>I personally welcome the return of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain lions to any suitable habitat </v>

1753
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:11.143
<v Speaker 4>where there's enough space for them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live without causing undue friction by </v>

1754
01:27:17.631 --> 01:27:18.464
<v Speaker 4>them butting up against human interests </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I encourage people who are in areas </v>

1755
01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:26.420
<v Speaker 4>that are being caught recolonized by </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain lions to practice some level of</v>

1756
01:27:26.421 --> 01:27:27.254
<v Speaker 4>tolerance and use best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>best use practices or best case </v>

1757
01:27:29.421 --> 01:27:33.080
<v Speaker 4>practices around to like avoid conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1758
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I welcome the return of barriers.</v>

1759
01:27:36.051 --> 01:27:38.390
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of areas in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country a lot,</v>

1760
01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:39.224
<v Speaker 4>but there's a handful of areas in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country that could have sustainable </v>

1761
01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:44.653
<v Speaker 4>populations of grizzly bears that psych </v>
<v Speaker 4>suitable habitat that is not being used </v>

1762
01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:49.850
<v Speaker 4>by grizzly bears and couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be used by grizzly bears.</v>

1763
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:54.140
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to see when it's appropriate.</v>

1764
01:27:54.141 --> 01:27:54.974
<v Speaker 4>I like to see state managed wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>practices and then allowable harvest of </v>

1765
01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:00.164
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

1766
01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:02.170
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1767
01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:03.023
<v Speaker 2>the don't even understand that mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>lions are edible and in fact you say </v>

1768
01:28:06.821 --> 01:28:07.654
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>

1769
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.903
<v Speaker 4>I liked them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was eating mountain lions long before </v>

1770
01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:11.424
<v Speaker 4>I ever hunted mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred one mount line in my life </v>

1771
01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:14.933
<v Speaker 4>and I've eaten a bunch more net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had never had the question about </v>

1772
01:28:19.081 --> 01:28:19.680
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1773
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.480
<v Speaker 4>I'd never had the question about whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was good or not.</v>

1774
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Majority of the people listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1775
01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably like what?</v>

1776
01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>among among Pounds Min,</v>

1777
01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.910
<v Speaker 4>like monkey who deal lines is widely </v>
<v Speaker 4>known that it's a very good meat,</v>

1778
01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:32.403
<v Speaker 4>but I was introduced to it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a place when I was living in </v>

1779
01:28:35.531 --> 01:28:37.600
<v Speaker 4>Missoula,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana as a place 20 miles east.</v>

1780
01:28:37.601 --> 01:28:40.270
<v Speaker 4>They're called Rock Creek Lodge and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're famous for having this big thing</v>

1781
01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:45.280
<v Speaker 4>called the testicle festival in the fall</v>
<v Speaker 4>where after you castrate steers,</v>

1782
01:28:45.281 --> 01:28:47.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will fry up the nuts.</v>

1783
01:28:47.441 --> 01:28:48.274
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the testicle festivals as big as </v>

1784
01:28:49.361 --> 01:28:50.194
<v Speaker 4>kind of like turning like this big head </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned into this kind of bike biker </v>

1785
01:28:52.451 --> 01:28:54.280
<v Speaker 4>festival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was this,</v>

1786
01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:55.693
<v Speaker 4>this big party and it was centered </v>
<v Speaker 4>around eating deep fried cow balls and </v>

1787
01:28:59.591 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 4>we used to go down there all the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go drinking.</v>

1788
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1789
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.843
<v Speaker 1>one time I was at that same place in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spring and this guy had a pot of a </v>

1790
01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.330
<v Speaker 1>potluck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will look like pulled pork,</v>

1791
01:29:09.331 --> 01:29:10.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bart with barbecue sauce and he had a </v>

1792
01:29:11.551 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 1>bunch of bonds out and he's just giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>it away.</v>

1793
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.780
<v Speaker 1>And I was eating it and he was telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me how it was mountain lion meat and you</v>

1794
01:29:18.781 --> 01:29:19.614
<v Speaker 1>were saying you'll is he saying like </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls in the fall and posting in the </v>

1795
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:22.750
<v Speaker 1>spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1796
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:23.583
<v Speaker 1>read mountain land there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first time I had </v>

1797
01:29:25.351 --> 01:29:26.184
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later I had a girlfriend who's </v>

1798
01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:32.480
<v Speaker 1>from Wyoming and she one day is standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a guy in a.</v>

1799
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:33.833
<v Speaker 1>she's standing behind a guy in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardware store who's buying a mountain </v>

1800
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:37.020
<v Speaker 1>land tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she asked him,</v>

1801
01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:40.200
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with all that meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't want it.</v>

1802
01:29:40.201 --> 01:29:41.880
<v Speaker 1>So she gave me her phone number.</v>

1803
01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And then when he got his line he gave us</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn thing.</v>

1804
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.273
<v Speaker 1>And so we ate that whole mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it had when I came into other </v>

1805
01:29:49.771 --> 01:29:53.880
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion meat in other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And always enjoyed it to the point where</v>

1806
01:29:54.210 --> 01:29:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't eating it because I had a moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation to eat what I killed.</v>

1807
01:29:58.770 --> 01:29:59.603
<v Speaker 1>I was going out of my way to get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'd rather eat someone else's </v>

1808
01:30:02.941 --> 01:30:05.940
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion than buy pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Pork,</v>

1809
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.920
<v Speaker 1>is that similar to white meat man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1810
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.310
<v Speaker 1>You can take the back straps with fat on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1811
01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:15.450
<v Speaker 1>You can leave the fat on it and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>that back strap and see.</v>

1812
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:16.560
<v Speaker 1>You've got a cookbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll have,</v>

1813
01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:17.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to have trick </v>

1814
01:30:17.911 --> 01:30:19.470
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to cook the one six u,</v>

1815
01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:19.890
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1816
01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:24.660
<v Speaker 1>just how pork used to be a cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It secret the fats good.</v>

1817
01:30:24.661 --> 01:30:26.340
<v Speaker 1>The meat's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We Cook it down,</v>

1818
01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.070
<v Speaker 1>make all kinds of preparations with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cook down.</v>

1819
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:31.770
<v Speaker 1>My kids meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep a bunch of wild.</v>

1820
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:34.580
<v Speaker 1>They eat a bunch of mountain lion meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1821
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:35.483
<v Speaker 1>well cooked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of those things that </v>

1822
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.310
<v Speaker 1>we're not accustomed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're.</v>

1823
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:43.590
<v Speaker 1>We're fine with things we are accustomed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1824
01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:48.120
<v Speaker 1>If you showed a mountain lion dead on </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media and you're like,</v>

1825
01:30:48.121 --> 01:30:49.290
<v Speaker 1>can't wait to eat this,</v>

1826
01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.350
<v Speaker 2>people would go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:56.100
<v Speaker 2>When you saw that recent controversy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that woman who shot a goat invasive</v>

1828
01:30:56.110 --> 01:30:59.170
<v Speaker 2>species on an island off of Scotland to </v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal,</v>

1829
01:30:59.171 --> 01:31:01.690
<v Speaker 2>they have to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally have to hunt them if they</v>

1830
01:31:01.691 --> 01:31:02.524
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've never seen what a goat can do </v>

1831
01:31:03.311 --> 01:31:06.310
<v Speaker 2>to an environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just destroy everything.</v>

1832
01:31:06.311 --> 01:31:07.540
<v Speaker 2>They eat everything they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1833
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:09.220
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they caused erosion.</v>

1834
01:31:09.221 --> 01:31:09.540
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1835
01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:10.990
<v Speaker 2>they decimate</v>

1836
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:15.110
<v Speaker 1>all the local foliage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they weren't seeing that and I think</v>

1837
01:31:15.111 --> 01:31:18.590
<v Speaker 1>that they were like the people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about that.</v>

1838
01:31:18.591 --> 01:31:21.290
<v Speaker 1>We're really struggling to describe why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it upset them.</v>

1839
01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:22.333
<v Speaker 1>Even a politician to pointed out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person was wearing camouflage </v>

1840
01:31:25.131 --> 01:31:25.964
<v Speaker 1>because traditionally in Scotland you </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped with different clothes and there </v>

1841
01:31:28.251 --> 01:31:30.410
<v Speaker 1>was no secret that there's hunting going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on out there.</v>

1842
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No secret at all.</v>

1843
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000
<v Speaker 1>It was that it's an American that she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing camouflage.</v>

1844
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:40.700
<v Speaker 1>She's adorned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1845
01:31:40.701 --> 01:31:41.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like makeup.</v>

1846
01:31:41.901 --> 01:31:44.780
<v Speaker 1>And it was Kinda like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this beautiful image set up.</v>

1847
01:31:45.370 --> 01:31:46.203
<v Speaker 1>She had a high powered rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they're already using out there </v>

1848
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.153
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just a confusing idea in a </v>

1849
01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:52.124
<v Speaker 1>confusing image for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had to been some old Scottish dude with </v>

1850
01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.043
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his,</v>

1851
01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deerstalker outfit,</v>

1852
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.600
<v Speaker 4>but there's something where people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1853
01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why her and why here?</v>

1854
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it also</v>

1855
01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:09.080
<v Speaker 5>her description of it as a fun hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1856
01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:11.120
<v Speaker 5>people had a lot of problems with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>

1857
01:32:11.121 --> 01:32:15.650
<v Speaker 5>I think because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there wasn't anything else going on.</v>

1858
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.270
<v Speaker 5>She caught a cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1859
01:32:17.271 --> 01:32:18.170
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she just got,</v>

1860
01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:19.773
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was headed down the river and a </v>

1861
01:32:21.210 --> 01:32:24.920
<v Speaker 5>tributary opened up and she went right </v>
<v Speaker 5>into controversy bank.</v>

1862
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:25.833
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I think happened in the </v>

1863
01:32:26.631 --> 01:32:27.464
<v Speaker 5>people that were tweeting about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw Glenn Glenn Greenwald tweet about </v>

1864
01:32:30.861 --> 01:32:31.641
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1865
01:32:31.641 --> 01:32:32.474
<v Speaker 5>you're a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're an actual journalist to </v>

1866
01:32:34.791 --> 01:32:35.624
<v Speaker 5>respected journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should really do some research on </v>

1867
01:32:37.641 --> 01:32:40.880
<v Speaker 5>this because the way you're calling it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1868
01:32:40.881 --> 01:32:42.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Glenn Greenwald is a,</v>

1869
01:32:42.651 --> 01:32:45.050
<v Speaker 5>I believe he's some sort of an animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights activist.</v>

1870
01:32:45.051 --> 01:32:48.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he's a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he's a vegetarian,</v>

1871
01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:51.080
<v Speaker 5>but I know Ricky Gervais' isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not a vegetarian.</v>

1872
01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:52.460
<v Speaker 5>He's no.</v>

1873
01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1874
01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:55.790
<v Speaker 4>That's the weird part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1875
01:32:55.791 --> 01:32:57.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny man.</v>

1876
01:32:57.351 --> 01:32:58.580
<v Speaker 4>That I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know</v>

1877
01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:02.240
<v Speaker 5>the on a radio show about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He needs me.</v>

1878
01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:03.133
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about hunting and you </v>

1879
01:33:06.431 --> 01:33:07.264
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I brought it up because we were on the </v>

1880
01:33:07.941 --> 01:33:10.130
<v Speaker 5>radio show together on the opiod anthony</v>
<v Speaker 5>show and I said,</v>

1881
01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.193
<v Speaker 5>I shot bears and I eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat everything I kill and I hunt for </v>

1882
01:33:15.981 --> 01:33:16.814
<v Speaker 5>food and I prefer to get meat that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we discussed the fact that he eats </v>

1883
01:33:20.781 --> 01:33:21.614
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>

1884
01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.573
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1885
01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:25.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1886
01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:26.843
<v Speaker 5>Because it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a virtue signaling aspect of </v>

1887
01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:35.430
<v Speaker 5>shitting on hunters where you're always </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get some positive remarks about</v>

1888
01:33:35.431 --> 01:33:35.840
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1889
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:38.010
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's difficult for me.</v>

1890
01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:42.210
<v Speaker 4>It's not difficult for me for from </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who doesn't.</v>

1891
01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:45.720
<v Speaker 4>Who doesn't eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1892
01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.753
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

1893
01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a problem with it.</v>

1894
01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.640
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1895
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:51.150
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my brother said a bass like,</v>

1896
01:33:51.151 --> 01:33:51.984
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said maybe they have a point when </v>

1897
01:33:55.241 --> 01:33:56.074
<v Speaker 4>it's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who doesn't mean it winds up </v>

1898
01:33:57.090 --> 01:33:57.923
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate that they're trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to condemn hunters who are hunting </v>

1899
01:34:01.831 --> 01:34:04.550
<v Speaker 4>like a regulated resource.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Chicken Dem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1901
01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.420
<v Speaker 4>You're sort of acting like when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>condemn you sort of acting like,</v>

1902
01:34:09.421 --> 01:34:10.254
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I care about these issues and I want to </v>

1903
01:34:11.851 --> 01:34:14.670
<v Speaker 4>be out here and I want to be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulating a perspective and,</v>

1904
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:15.623
<v Speaker 4>and I know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you're like putting yourself </v>

1905
01:34:18.781 --> 01:34:20.730
<v Speaker 4>out as a person who has opinions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>

1906
01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:21.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

1907
01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.160
<v Speaker 4>just to like let your opinion be known.</v>

1908
01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:24.533
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where's the self examination </v>

1909
01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:31.830
<v Speaker 4>exactly where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're eating meat,</v>

1910
01:34:31.831 --> 01:34:34.290
<v Speaker 4>like you're contributing all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal death.</v>

1911
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:39.000
<v Speaker 4>Like what is your understanding of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>is your understanding of those lives and</v>

1912
01:34:39.001 --> 01:34:42.090
<v Speaker 4>those deaths?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is that not part of your reckoning?</v>

1913
01:34:42.630 --> 01:34:43.463
<v Speaker 4>If I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say I am happy that I got a bear </v>

1914
01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:50.970
<v Speaker 4>that I will eat with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say I am happy about it.</v>

1915
01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:52.403
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it better for you that you're kind </v>

1916
01:34:55.141 --> 01:34:57.000
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it better to be sad about it somehow?</v>

1917
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:57.853
<v Speaker 4>Is it better to be regretful or just </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignore the fact altogether or why is it </v>

1918
01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 4>not okay that I'm happy about what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat?</v>

1919
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:04.663
<v Speaker 4>I know the story of it really well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I understand the history of </v>

1920
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:09.794
<v Speaker 4>wildlife in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say better than anybody </v>

1921
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:13.250
<v Speaker 4>but damn sure better than most.</v>

1922
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 4>I know where we've been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a good sense of where we're going</v>

1923
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:19.123
<v Speaker 4>in terms of American wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the challenges are for American </v>

1924
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.753
<v Speaker 4>Wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1925
01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm involved in this stuff on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis.</v>

1926
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:28.280
<v Speaker 4>I can know all that and I can see my </v>
<v Speaker 4>place in it,</v>

1927
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:30.223
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see what my actions are and </v>

1928
01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.793
<v Speaker 4>whether my actions are helpful or </v>
<v Speaker 4>hurtful for something that I care a </v>

1929
01:35:36.651 --> 01:35:41.651
<v Speaker 4>great deal about and if I can know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>well and get a deer,</v>

1930
01:35:43.311 --> 01:35:44.144
<v Speaker 4>a bear or whatever and have it be food </v>
<v Speaker 4>and find that I'm like really happy to </v>

1931
01:35:47.121 --> 01:35:50.480
<v Speaker 4>be involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That somehow is off putting to people,</v>

1932
01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's okay to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's I'm blind to it,</v>

1933
01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I have this nagging sense of guilt about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it that I haven't reckoned with.</v>

1934
01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1935
01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.693
<v Speaker 4>and that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like an accessible position for </v>

1936
01:36:02.991 --> 01:36:03.824
<v Speaker 4>some people to have.</v>

1937
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:06.350
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard for me with people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1938
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.350
<v Speaker 4>that are contributing to animal death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

1939
01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:14.120
<v Speaker 4>who want to condemn those who are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to or for whatever reason,</v>

1940
01:36:14.121 --> 01:36:17.690
<v Speaker 4>willing to excited about taking part in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the process themselves.</v>

1941
01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:21.200
<v Speaker 4>I got to find a way to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta find a way to,</v>

1942
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:22.093
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to engage with it though and I need to </v>

1943
01:36:23.481 --> 01:36:25.250
<v Speaker 4>get a better understanding of it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1944
01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:27.020
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the debate isn't going away.</v>

1945
01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:27.973
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep brushing it off is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous that it doesn't warrant my </v>

1946
01:36:30.531 --> 01:36:34.490
<v Speaker 4>time because clearly it does warrant my </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to understand that perspective.</v>

1947
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:35.383
<v Speaker 4>I just haven't had anybody really give </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me in a good way to I have to say </v>

1948
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:38.211
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1949
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 4>but they were raised to be eaten.</v>

1950
01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:44.400
<v Speaker 5>That's a foolish perspective to me is </v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

1951
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:46.530
<v Speaker 5>way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So life condemned.</v>

1952
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:50.400
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather talk to Google of Glenn </v>
<v Speaker 5>Greenwald is a Vegan.</v>

1953
01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:54.090
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably rather talk to someone like</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ricky Gervais' about it because I.</v>

1954
01:36:54.090 --> 01:36:56.760
<v Speaker 5>I assume that he's articulate about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's articulate.</v>

1955
01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:59.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think his position is a nuanced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

1956
01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:00.563
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's some willful ignorance </v>

1957
01:37:01.771 --> 01:37:02.604
<v Speaker 5>that's a part of people that eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but condemn hunting a willful and the </v>

1958
01:37:06.601 --> 01:37:07.740
<v Speaker 5>fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

1959
01:37:07.741 --> 01:37:10.530
<v Speaker 5>they know that they're going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain reaction out of people when they</v>

1960
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.650
<v Speaker 5>tweet about it on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing,</v>

1961
01:37:13.651 --> 01:37:16.440
<v Speaker 5>if you're talking about someone who out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there shooting things and not eating it,</v>

1962
01:37:16.441 --> 01:37:17.460
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

1963
01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll see if some guy's just shooting an</v>

1964
01:37:19.891 --> 01:37:22.320
<v Speaker 5>elephant because he wants his tusks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on your side.</v>

1965
01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:25.860
<v Speaker 5>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if someone chooses to hunt,</v>

1966
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:28.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and an animal fill in the blank.</v>

1967
01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.153
<v Speaker 5>That might be a goat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>might be weird to you that they're </v>

1968
01:37:32.161 --> 01:37:34.530
<v Speaker 5>eating this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're shooting this.</v>

1969
01:37:34.531 --> 01:37:37.620
<v Speaker 5>It's an invasive species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually very delicious.</v>

1970
01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:41.250
<v Speaker 5>It's very edible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prized for its meat by some communities.</v>

1971
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.823
<v Speaker 5>You don't make any sense you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this because you know that other people </v>

1972
01:37:45.241 --> 01:37:46.074
<v Speaker 5>are ignorant about it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and either you're ignorant because </v>

1973
01:37:47.911 --> 01:37:48.744
<v Speaker 5>you've never bothered to look into it or</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've bothered to look into it and </v>

1974
01:37:51.271 --> 01:37:52.560
<v Speaker 5>you're ignoring the nuance.</v>

1975
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the case of the goat thing,</v>

1976
01:37:54.371 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 4>there's a little added thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an added</v>

1977
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.870
<v Speaker 1>element that our government on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal level is involved.</v>

1978
01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of state wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 1>management agencies that are involved in</v>

1979
01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:09.471
<v Speaker 1>trying to do a wild goat eradication </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects on islands.</v>

1980
01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that's ongoing all the</v>

1981
01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:15.860
<v Speaker 1>time in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many other places where were were.</v>

1982
01:38:15.861 --> 01:38:20.861
<v Speaker 1>We're like out helicopter gunning </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter gunning for invasive species.</v>

1983
01:38:22.561 --> 01:38:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Explain to people how those goats got </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and the first race,</v>

1984
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:28.130
<v Speaker 1>because this is also very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1985
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.990
<v Speaker 1>a variety of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of things were a lot of island</v>

1986
01:38:31.991 --> 01:38:32.824
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one way it happens where </v>

1987
01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 1>invasive on islands would be introduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>by seafarers,</v>

1988
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.273
<v Speaker 1>whalers who would want to establish food</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources along transoceanic routes so </v>

1989
01:38:50.071 --> 01:38:52.170
<v Speaker 1>that you could put something there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back and get it later,</v>

1990
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:55.590
<v Speaker 1>early way like way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to come out of the the,</v>

1991
01:38:55.591 --> 01:38:56.424
<v Speaker 1>the American Ne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all those famous whaling villages </v>

1992
01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 1>in New England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1993
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:06.150
<v Speaker 1>they would go down and stop in and stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and the Galapagos,</v>

1994
01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gather up tortoises that they could flip</v>

1995
01:39:08.701 --> 01:39:12.120
<v Speaker 1>over in the whole of a boat and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourists to stay alive for months on its</v>

1996
01:39:12.121 --> 01:39:12.810
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1997
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:13.643
<v Speaker 1>You'd have like a fresh meat resource </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as people came to understand scurvy </v>

1998
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:19.343
<v Speaker 1>and realizing that fresh meat gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough vitamin C to avoid scurvy that </v>

1999
01:39:25.891 --> 01:39:26.724
<v Speaker 1>you can get from dried meat because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the vitamin C behaves through the </v>

2000
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 1>cooking and drawing process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like fresh meat,</v>

2001
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:32.604
<v Speaker 1>you can keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having scurvy me became even more </v>

2002
01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:35.274
<v Speaker 1>important than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people would come in and cut some </v>

2003
01:39:37.201 --> 01:39:38.021
<v Speaker 1>sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loose cuts,</v>

2004
01:39:38.021 --> 01:39:42.150
<v Speaker 1>some bolts loose on an island and know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to breed and build up</v>

2005
01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 1>a big population and that can be like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

2006
01:39:43.951 --> 01:39:48.780
<v Speaker 1>You stop in and get food and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things get introduced in other ways.</v>

2007
01:39:48.781 --> 01:39:50.370
<v Speaker 1>And of course animals move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2008
01:39:50.371 --> 01:39:51.204
<v Speaker 1>so you have one island has close </v>
<v Speaker 1>proximity to another island they can </v>

2009
01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:54.900
<v Speaker 1>swim across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2010
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Bump over and it destroys native </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetation.</v>

2011
01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.453
<v Speaker 1>They trampled bird's nests and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have many cases where introductions of </v>

2012
01:40:04.890 --> 01:40:08.520
<v Speaker 1>non natives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly non native grazing animals,</v>

2013
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.413
<v Speaker 1>non native predators will wind up </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing like a lot of extinctions of </v>

2014
01:40:13.081 --> 01:40:15.480
<v Speaker 1>endemic species on islands and creates </v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of problems</v>

2015
01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.770
<v Speaker 5>and that's exactly what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about with this.</v>

2016
01:40:17.771 --> 01:40:21.250
<v Speaker 5>Go in that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is an animal that must be killed</v>

2017
01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:24.220
<v Speaker 5>if you want healthy wildlife on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>island,</v>

2018
01:40:24.221 --> 01:40:26.740
<v Speaker 5>the native wildlife and the native </v>
<v Speaker 5>fauna,</v>

2019
01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:29.740
<v Speaker 5>the flora,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this stuff that lives there.</v>

2020
01:40:29.741 --> 01:40:31.150
<v Speaker 5>All this stuff that's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2021
01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:33.670
<v Speaker 5>You got to kill the goats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise they'll eat everything.</v>

2022
01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.580
<v Speaker 1>But I think people look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people look and they,</v>

2023
01:40:36.581 --> 01:40:37.091
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2024
01:40:37.091 --> 01:40:37.590
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2025
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:39.770
<v Speaker 1>they look and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>

2026
01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.633
<v Speaker 1>That was the motivation of that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I care about his motivations of </v>

2027
01:40:43.941 --> 01:40:44.774
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right because when </v>

2028
01:40:46.071 --> 01:40:48.500
<v Speaker 1>California got rid of mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

2029
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:51.980
<v Speaker 1>they're still killing several hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions here a year.</v>

2030
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 1>People are comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the total</v>

2031
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.280
<v Speaker 4>lion kill didn't change much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are comfortable with estate agent</v>

2032
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 4>or someone being paid to go out and kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>lines.</v>

2033
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 4>They're not comfortable with some pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who wants to go</v>

2034
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:09.520
<v Speaker 2>do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they realize.</v>

2035
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:10.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they realize that state </v>
<v Speaker 2>agencies are killing as many mountain </v>

2036
01:41:12.221 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 2>lions in California as they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people understand that.</v>

2037
01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I think people do understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something gets put on the ballot,</v>

2038
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.850
<v Speaker 2>would you like to reintroduce mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion hunting?</v>

2039
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:24.190
<v Speaker 2>People would go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you do that?</v>

2040
01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Mountain lions are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're exciting.</v>

2041
01:41:26.231 --> 01:41:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these are people in Santa Monica,</v>

2042
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not people that are living,</v>

2043
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:33.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour outside of Bakersfield and they </v>

2044
01:41:35.451 --> 01:41:38.110
<v Speaker 2>got 16 mountain lions in their backyard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a year.</v>

2045
01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:40.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a different kind of world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2046
01:41:40.491 --> 01:41:44.620
<v Speaker 2>if they're in the tach p mountains out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you see mountain lions all the</v>

2047
01:41:44.621 --> 01:41:46.810
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of mountain lions.</v>

2048
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:47.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the real issue,</v>

2049
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:53.010
<v Speaker 4>and there was a problem too that I view </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is coming from there's a problem or</v>

2050
01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:55.173
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people have a very hard</v>
<v Speaker 4>time empathizing with people who might </v>

2051
01:42:01.121 --> 01:42:01.954
<v Speaker 4>be negatively impacted by wildlife as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well in the question of the lion issue </v>

2052
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:09.760
<v Speaker 4>where it's kind of like this idea like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you better suck it up,</v>

2053
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:11.263
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:14.440
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a rancher and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>running cattle and the area where you're</v>

2055
01:42:14.441 --> 01:42:18.820
<v Speaker 4>losing a lot of cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the walls and grizzlies people will look</v>

2056
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better suck it up,</v>

2057
01:42:20.621 --> 01:42:21.454
<v Speaker 4>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't really picture your </v>

2058
01:42:23.621 --> 01:42:26.980
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your complaints are not legitimate.</v>

2059
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 4>Well they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If someone were to cut a.</v>

2060
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:32.410
<v Speaker 4>If someone were to cut a grizzly Lewis </v>
<v Speaker 4>and golden gate state part,</v>

2061
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.350
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2062
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that people would have,</v>

2063
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:42.670
<v Speaker 4>would come to have a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective on that to put it mildly.</v>

2064
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it winds up being the.</v>

2065
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:45.403
<v Speaker 4>You look and people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't really want to hear about </v>

2066
01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:48.754
<v Speaker 4>other people's problems if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it doesn't jive with their </v>

2067
01:42:50.981 --> 01:42:51.814
<v Speaker 4>understanding of what problems are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the area where the issue </v>

2068
01:42:54.971 --> 01:42:58.620
<v Speaker 4>around grizzly bears and the delisting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

2069
01:42:58.621 --> 01:42:59.454
<v Speaker 4>they were delisted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were removed from the endangered </v>

2070
01:43:00.731 --> 01:43:04.750
<v Speaker 4>species act protection temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they had,</v>

2071
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:05.913
<v Speaker 4>had met all recovery goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when we look mostly recovered </v>

2072
01:43:08.770 --> 01:43:09.603
<v Speaker 4>population look like they mapped out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it would look like and we've </v>

2073
01:43:11.951 --> 01:43:14.830
<v Speaker 4>exceeded that for many years now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were delisted,</v>

2074
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:19.540
<v Speaker 4>but then a Wyoming and Idaho moved to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a very limited hunt on them.</v>

2075
01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.153
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they were a federal judge </v>

2076
01:43:23.351 --> 01:43:24.184
<v Speaker 4>blocked the listing and they went back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and listing it was the federal judges </v>

2077
01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:29.920
<v Speaker 4>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2078
01:43:30.190 --> 01:43:32.380
<v Speaker 4>you want to hope that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2079
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:34.183
<v Speaker 4>that they didn't have one you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to think that they were just </v>

2080
01:43:36.551 --> 01:43:37.740
<v Speaker 4>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2081
01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:38.613
<v Speaker 4>the details of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think there's a suspicion that </v>

2082
01:43:40.841 --> 01:43:45.520
<v Speaker 4>that person went into that knowing damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure what they were gonna do,</v>

2083
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:47.540
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2084
01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 4>but you don't really know a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguments around.</v>

2085
01:43:52.041 --> 01:43:54.380
<v Speaker 4>They'd come down to like technicalities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2086
01:43:54.650 --> 01:43:56.860
<v Speaker 4>No one's arguing that the populations </v>
<v Speaker 4>recovering</v>

2087
01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.930
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also the argument that the judge</v>

2088
01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:00.764
<v Speaker 2>is probably trying to protect his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation because the amount of blow </v>

2089
01:44:03.121 --> 01:44:03.954
<v Speaker 2>back that a judge would receive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing a hunt to go through is vastly </v>

2090
01:44:08.091 --> 01:44:10.110
<v Speaker 2>different than blocking a hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2091
01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:10.941
<v Speaker 2>blocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Hunt,</v>

2092
01:44:10.941 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna get that much blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2093
01:44:12.351 --> 01:44:13.184
<v Speaker 2>You'll get a few people that are upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hadn't been an established </v>

2094
01:44:15.141 --> 01:44:15.974
<v Speaker 2>resource.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only you're taking something away </v>

2095
01:44:16.731 --> 01:44:20.240
<v Speaker 2>from people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he allowed it pour the wildlife.</v>

2096
01:44:20.241 --> 01:44:21.920
<v Speaker 2>People would go fucking bananas on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2097
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2098
01:44:22.571 --> 01:44:23.404
<v Speaker 4>they tend to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't even call them and like I </v>

2099
01:44:25.341 --> 01:44:26.174
<v Speaker 4>don't call them environmentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who sued to block the delisting </v>

2100
01:44:29.981 --> 01:44:34.981
<v Speaker 4>of recovering species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the masquerade as ecologically conscious</v>

2101
01:44:36.611 --> 01:44:39.400
<v Speaker 4>environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're just people who it's,</v>

2102
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:42.220
<v Speaker 4>it's untenable to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't,</v>

2103
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.393
<v Speaker 4>they're never going to accept the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're going to have human </v>

2104
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:47.860
<v Speaker 4>exploitation of this resource.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2105
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:48.733
<v Speaker 4>Did they masquerade that they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have an environmental motivation </v>

2106
01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:51.534
<v Speaker 4>was not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's an animal rights </v>

2107
01:44:52.181 --> 01:44:55.780
<v Speaker 4>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a very,</v>

2108
01:44:56.050 --> 01:44:56.883
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a sensitive ear in a certain </v>

2109
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:01.290
<v Speaker 4>federal court,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2110
01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:02.163
<v Speaker 4>in Missoula,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you'll see a lot of these cases </v>

2111
01:45:03.341 --> 01:45:05.440
<v Speaker 4>around wolves and grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll get that.</v>

2112
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:10.210
<v Speaker 4>They want it done through that court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know their going to have a friendly</v>

2113
01:45:10.211 --> 01:45:11.650
<v Speaker 4>take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a real.</v>

2114
01:45:11.651 --> 01:45:14.110
<v Speaker 4>It was watching that happen and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been happening recently.</v>

2115
01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:19.110
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real travesty because there's a couple</v>

2116
01:45:19.511 --> 01:45:23.950
<v Speaker 4>of things that happen like culturally an</v>
<v Speaker 4>areas where you'll.</v>

2117
01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:25.373
<v Speaker 4>You create a lot of tension with people </v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's people that are living </v>

2118
01:45:29.321 --> 01:45:30.154
<v Speaker 4>amongst these things and they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some level of some level of relief </v>

2119
01:45:34.721 --> 01:45:35.554
<v Speaker 4>and they want to see it go to state </v>
<v Speaker 4>management and they might want to see </v>

2120
01:45:38.021 --> 01:45:38.854
<v Speaker 4>the state exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some control over where certain </v>

2121
01:45:41.441 --> 01:45:42.274
<v Speaker 4>populations of large predators are </v>
<v Speaker 4>spreading into and when it winds up </v>

2122
01:45:45.461 --> 01:45:47.590
<v Speaker 4>being that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their voices are not heard,</v>

2123
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.903
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they feel that people from far away </v>

2124
01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.130
<v Speaker 4>are really heavily influencing decisions</v>
<v Speaker 4>that affect them on a daily basis.</v>

2125
01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:55.173
<v Speaker 4>It winds up creating a lot of animosity </v>
<v Speaker 4>toward the species to where they think </v>

2126
01:45:58.991 --> 01:46:00.430
<v Speaker 4>about what happened with the spotted </v>
<v Speaker 4>owl,</v>

2127
01:46:00.431 --> 01:46:01.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The spotted owl.</v>

2128
01:46:02.050 --> 01:46:04.610
<v Speaker 4>No one can see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one perceives the spotted owl,</v>

2129
01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:05.493
<v Speaker 4>an owl anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The spotted owl is become like a symbol </v>

2130
01:46:07.751 --> 01:46:08.584
<v Speaker 4>of federal overreach and you'll find </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know wolves for awhile they </v>

2131
01:46:13.330 --> 01:46:14.163
<v Speaker 4>become like a symbol of a dispute and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people stopped liking the animals much </v>

2132
01:46:18.851 --> 01:46:22.570
<v Speaker 4>and it becomes like this contentious </v>
<v Speaker 4>creature and I think that we're going to</v>

2133
01:46:22.571 --> 01:46:23.404
<v Speaker 4>head that way if we keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we keep stepping in on wildlife </v>

2134
01:46:26.681 --> 01:46:27.514
<v Speaker 4>issues with the mentality that we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been approaching the wool from grizzly </v>

2135
01:46:30.311 --> 01:46:33.670
<v Speaker 4>issue in the northern Great Lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the northern rockies,</v>

2136
01:46:33.671 --> 01:46:36.070
<v Speaker 4>soon to be in the greater yellowstone </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecosystem.</v>

2137
01:46:36.071 --> 01:46:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Now I think you're dealing with low</v>

2138
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:39.860
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're dealing with national,</v>

2139
01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the local people are going to have an</v>

2140
01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:44.120
<v Speaker 2>issue with it because they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be impacted by it.</v>

2141
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.370
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be directly impacting </v>
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>

2142
01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Dogs are going to be killed while </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna</v>

2143
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:53.330
<v Speaker 5>take domestic cattle and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>

2144
01:46:53.331 --> 01:46:56.900
<v Speaker 5>You've got to have real issues with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that liked to go elk hunting.</v>

2145
01:46:56.901 --> 01:47:01.550
<v Speaker 5>The populations have diminished rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the rest of the country doesn't give</v>

2146
01:47:01.551 --> 01:47:03.500
<v Speaker 5>a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People in San Francisco,</v>

2147
01:47:03.501 --> 01:47:07.640
<v Speaker 5>they don't give a fuck about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People in Chicago aren't impacted by it,</v>

2148
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:09.163
<v Speaker 5>especially if they don't have anyone in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their family that haunts or anyone that </v>

2149
01:47:12.021 --> 01:47:12.854
<v Speaker 5>has a background in hunting and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have a background in it </v>

2150
01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:16.010
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't care.</v>

2151
01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People really don't.</v>

2152
01:47:17.311 --> 01:47:18.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2153
01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2154
01:47:20.110 --> 01:47:20.943
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2155
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 1>that I care about the availability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>been an abundance of deer,</v>

2156
01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moose,</v>

2157
01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Caribou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2158
01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care about the resource.</v>

2159
01:47:32.981 --> 01:47:35.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people who rely on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource,</v>

2160
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:38.710
<v Speaker 1>use the resource there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major economic drivers.</v>

2161
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely,</v>

2162
01:47:40.061 --> 01:47:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm anything but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2163
01:47:41.661 --> 01:47:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I regard myself as a pro wolf person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I regard myself as a pro grizzly person.</v>

2164
01:47:46.091 --> 01:47:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I cherish every interaction I have with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those animals.</v>

2165
01:47:49.410 --> 01:47:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you think to be around a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource.</v>

2166
01:47:52.570 --> 01:47:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with common </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource to people,</v>

2167
01:47:54.311 --> 01:47:56.860
<v Speaker 1>but people do have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling resource and um,</v>

2168
01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:57.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

2169
01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to,</v>

2170
01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.840
<v Speaker 1>in suitable habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to see them present.</v>

2171
01:48:01.841 --> 01:48:02.674
<v Speaker 1>I also like to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I also like to see them managing </v>

2172
01:48:06.191 --> 01:48:09.220
<v Speaker 1>the way that allows for a bond and wild </v>
<v Speaker 1>game resources.</v>

2173
01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:11.013
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>House passed the bill to drop legal </v>

2174
01:48:13.091 --> 01:48:15.550
<v Speaker 1>protections for gray wolves as past </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2175
01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:19.780
<v Speaker 1>or will this interesting was two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2176
01:48:19.781 --> 01:48:21.430
<v Speaker 1>so well roll down a little bit.</v>

2177
01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Republican controlled House passed a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bill on Friday to drop legal protections</v>

2178
01:48:28.601 --> 01:48:29.434
<v Speaker 5>or gray wolves across the lower 48 </v>
<v Speaker 5>states reopening a lengthy battle over </v>

2179
01:48:32.261 --> 01:48:35.590
<v Speaker 5>the Predator species,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long despised by farmers and ranchers.</v>

2180
01:48:35.591 --> 01:48:36.670
<v Speaker 5>Wolves were shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trap,</v>

2181
01:48:36.671 --> 01:48:39.790
<v Speaker 5>poisoned out of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and most of the u s in the Mid Twentieth</v>

2182
01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:40.623
<v Speaker 5>Century by the Mid Twentieth Century.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Since securing protection in the 19 </v>

2183
01:48:43.151 --> 01:48:44.650
<v Speaker 5>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves have bounced back.</v>

2184
01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.270
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not really excited what happened.</v>

2185
01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.493
<v Speaker 5>Great Lakes of Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Minnesota and Wisconsin as well in the </v>

2186
01:48:49.691 --> 01:48:52.380
<v Speaker 5>northern rockies and Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's SORTA,</v>

2187
01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.310
<v Speaker 5>but they're not talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reintroduction.</v>

2188
01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:55.900
<v Speaker 5>Reintroduction is the big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2189
01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.793
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's what people have great issue </v>

2190
01:48:58.451 --> 01:48:59.284
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

2191
01:48:59.400 --> 01:48:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

2192
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.010
<v Speaker 1>the reintroduction is only in one area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Great Lake,</v>

2193
01:49:02.011 --> 01:49:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the northern Great Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was not a reintroduction.</v>

2194
01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:05.573
<v Speaker 1>There was a sizable population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will movements of wolves coming down </v>

2195
01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:11.420
<v Speaker 1>from Canada and coming back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Ca,</v>

2196
01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 1>the court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern continental divide ecosystem.</v>

2197
01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Not a reintroduction famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2198
01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2199
01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.950
<v Speaker 1>The famous case of the famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduction,</v>

2200
01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Yellowstone National Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so viewed now.</v>

2201
01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It's widely viewed now that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have done that,</v>

2202
01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:29.430
<v Speaker 1>you would have had had you not done that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduction,</v>

2203
01:49:29.431 --> 01:49:33.180
<v Speaker 1>you'd have had a natural flow anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A natural flow from Canada.</v>

2204
01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:34.260
<v Speaker 1>You would have got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have,</v>

2205
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you would have eventually you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually have gotten there anyway.</v>

2206
01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:38.483
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But would they have gotten to the exact </v>

2207
01:49:39.931 --> 01:49:40.950
<v Speaker 1>same levels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2208
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:41.933
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this particular point right now as I </v>

2209
01:49:44.401 --> 01:49:47.010
<v Speaker 1>think that'd be like laughable to act as</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they'd be there now,</v>

2210
01:49:47.150 --> 01:49:47.681
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2211
01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>but people.</v>

2212
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.570
<v Speaker 4>There's no realization that you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have that without the reintroduction you</v>

2213
01:49:52.571 --> 01:49:54.010
<v Speaker 4>would've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through natural movement,</v>

2214
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:56.480
<v Speaker 4>have eventually gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2215
01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:57.720
<v Speaker 4>do you.</v>

2216
01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.080
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2217
01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:00.013
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that supports the idea of the </v>

2218
01:50:01.801 --> 01:50:02.634
<v Speaker 5>reintroduction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think the introduction was well </v>

2219
01:50:04.201 --> 01:50:05.034
<v Speaker 5>thought out.</v>

2220
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:06.371
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2221
01:50:06.371 --> 01:50:08.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to debate the merits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reintroduction.</v>

2222
01:50:08.141 --> 01:50:10.300
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my perspective on it.</v>

2223
01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:12.940
<v Speaker 4>It should be in a place where it </v>
<v Speaker 4>supports them.</v>

2224
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My perspective on it is I,</v>

2225
01:50:14.431 --> 01:50:15.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2226
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:20.650
<v Speaker 4>the idea of extinction and regional </v>
<v Speaker 4>extirpation sickens me,</v>

2227
01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:26.130
<v Speaker 4>I do not believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not believe that like as a people,</v>

2228
01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:28.954
<v Speaker 4>as a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can justify or afford to remove </v>

2229
01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:37.960
<v Speaker 4>species of wildlife from the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2230
01:50:38.050 --> 01:50:39.970
<v Speaker 4>native species of wild there from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape.</v>

2231
01:50:41.110 --> 01:50:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of sickens me,</v>

2232
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:44.580
<v Speaker 4>I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2233
01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:49.620
<v Speaker 4>I like to have all native wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>present on the landscape so</v>

2234
01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:58.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't oppose it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I oppose is a thing that's happened</v>

2235
01:50:58.381 --> 01:50:59.214
<v Speaker 4>now is getting where we have populations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we agree like what will recovery </v>

2236
01:51:05.011 --> 01:51:05.844
<v Speaker 4>look like and at what point when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how will we manage all the different </v>

2237
01:51:08.881 --> 01:51:12.330
<v Speaker 4>viewpoints that are coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different interests of all these</v>

2238
01:51:12.331 --> 01:51:15.180
<v Speaker 4>varied stakeholders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Net what point where we get in there and</v>

2239
01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.610
<v Speaker 4>manipulate the situation that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating.</v>

2240
01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.313
<v Speaker 4>I just would move that in a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction where I think that when that </v>

2241
01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:25.800
<v Speaker 4>recovered species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in this case,</v>

2242
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:27.240
<v Speaker 4>when we're talking about walls and </v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzlies,</v>

2243
01:51:27.570 --> 01:51:28.403
<v Speaker 4>I think that you should have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can do it in a sustainable way </v>

2244
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:32.303
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't have longterm deleterious </v>
<v Speaker 4>impacts on the population that they </v>

2245
01:51:34.891 --> 01:51:36.360
<v Speaker 4>should be managed as a renewable </v>
<v Speaker 4>resource.</v>

2246
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:38.203
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is where people are going to have </v>

2247
01:51:38.661 --> 01:51:39.740
<v Speaker 5>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any.</v>

2248
01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 5>Just even the term manage them as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>renewable resource.</v>

2249
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:47.240
<v Speaker 5>You mean shoot them and kill them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>use their.</v>

2250
01:51:47.241 --> 01:51:48.074
<v Speaker 5>For</v>

2251
01:51:49.090 --> 01:51:49.923
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

2252
01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:50.773
<v Speaker 4>I think that recovered bcs that I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you put something on the </v>

2253
01:51:52.931 --> 01:51:55.510
<v Speaker 4>endangered species act and it goes under</v>
<v Speaker 4>federal protection,</v>

2254
01:51:56.150 --> 01:51:56.983
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when it reaches recovery and </v>

2255
01:51:59.921 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 4>the US fish and wildlife service as it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>recovered,</v>

2256
01:52:02.111 --> 01:52:04.270
<v Speaker 4>it's time to hand it back to state </v>
<v Speaker 4>management.</v>

2257
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:07.600
<v Speaker 4>If a state then decides that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do some limited harvest,</v>

2258
01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:08.733
<v Speaker 4>particularly let's say they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if they're focusing on areas where </v>

2259
01:52:10.691 --> 01:52:11.524
<v Speaker 4>there's like very high prevalence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human animal conflict and the state </v>

2260
01:52:14.771 --> 01:52:15.604
<v Speaker 4>decides to do that in some like minor </v>
<v Speaker 4>way as a way to service the needs of </v>

2261
01:52:22.121 --> 01:52:24.730
<v Speaker 4>certain segments of their population </v>
<v Speaker 4>that wants something to happen.</v>

2262
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:25.743
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that then some like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>activist judge or or environmental </v>

2263
01:52:31.421 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 4>groups or animal rights groups should </v>
<v Speaker 4>come and be like,</v>

2264
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:34.383
<v Speaker 4>well nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to pretend that they're not </v>

2265
01:52:35.231 --> 01:52:36.064
<v Speaker 4>recovered now because we want to prevent</v>
<v Speaker 4>the state from doing something that we </v>

2266
01:52:38.261 --> 01:52:39.190
<v Speaker 4>think is unsavory.</v>

2267
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.903
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thought process behind the people </v>

2268
01:52:42.111 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 5>that support blocking the hunt is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you leave these</v>

2269
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:46.963
<v Speaker 2>animals alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally they're going to find balance </v>

2270
01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 2>and that the wolves will kill the elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until there's not enough elk for them to</v>

2271
01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:55.334
<v Speaker 2>sustain their populations and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers of their offspring will dwindle </v>

2272
01:52:58.190 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 2>and they'll get to some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable level.</v>

2273
01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we already.</v>

2274
01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:02.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we live in a.</v>

2275
01:53:02.890 --> 01:53:07.570
<v Speaker 4>We live in a heavily manipulated kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>land kind of manmade environment.</v>

2276
01:53:07.571 --> 01:53:08.404
<v Speaker 4>Now the idea that things are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would just let things run their </v>

2277
01:53:12.581 --> 01:53:15.760
<v Speaker 4>course and watch what happens isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to happen.</v>

2278
01:53:16.150 --> 01:53:19.060
<v Speaker 4>You're still going to have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzlies.</v>

2279
01:53:19.061 --> 01:53:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Every year are still going to get in </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble.</v>

2280
01:53:21.490 --> 01:53:24.010
<v Speaker 4>They're still going to get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're still going to have mortality.</v>

2281
01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:26.980
<v Speaker 4>You know you're going to have tons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzy mortality in tough areas,</v>

2282
01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:30.240
<v Speaker 4>but they're going to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are enacting and packs.</v>

2283
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.980
<v Speaker 4>That's how they kill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kill cattle and they come up.</v>

2284
01:53:33.010 --> 01:53:34.780
<v Speaker 4>They brought up against humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

2285
01:53:34.781 --> 01:53:35.614
<v Speaker 4>it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>

2286
01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Have some that you're not going to let </v>
<v Speaker 4>it run as a.</v>

2287
01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:40.060
<v Speaker 4>As a person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a hunter.</v>

2288
01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.313
<v Speaker 4>I also don't have a problem with and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually support as a hunter that we </v>

2289
01:53:45.461 --> 01:53:49.900
<v Speaker 4>would all while allowing wolves to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>present on the landscape,</v>

2290
01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:53.980
<v Speaker 4>that we would mitigate their impact on </v>
<v Speaker 4>big game.</v>

2291
01:53:53.981 --> 01:53:54.814
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind just coming out and saying </v>

2292
01:53:56.591 --> 01:53:57.424
<v Speaker 4>that I like to have high populations of </v>
<v Speaker 4>big game animals that are available to </v>

2293
01:54:01.421 --> 01:54:06.421
<v Speaker 4>hunters and also at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 4>sharing some of that resource there.</v>

2294
01:54:06.791 --> 01:54:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Having wolves on the ground doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see them gone.</v>

2295
01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.420
<v Speaker 4>Not Anti Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not anti grizzly.</v>

2296
01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:13.613
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because of wolf is so much like a </v>

2297
01:54:17.221 --> 01:54:20.850
<v Speaker 2>dog and because there's not a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of people eating.</v>

2298
01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I remember you telling me about one </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain men were.</v>

2299
01:54:22.771 --> 01:54:26.880
<v Speaker 2>His favorite food was wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stefansson is the Arctic explorer.</v>

2300
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.080
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy must've loved wolf meet.</v>

2301
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:33.160
<v Speaker 2>You ever tried it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2302
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:34.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2303
01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Levy in coyote.</v>

2304
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:36.043
<v Speaker 4>You Eaten Caio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've eaten that species and I've </v>

2305
01:54:37.710 --> 01:54:39.090
<v Speaker 4>never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never killed a wolf.</v>

2306
01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:41.760
<v Speaker 4>Never killed a grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just haven't.</v>

2307
01:54:41.761 --> 01:54:45.480
<v Speaker 4>Haven't eaten either of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won coyote.</v>

2308
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:47.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't aid it.</v>

2309
01:54:47.881 --> 01:54:50.340
<v Speaker 4>Didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Haven't messed with one sense.</v>

2310
01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said that was similar to divert duct</v>

2311
01:54:55.211 --> 01:54:56.010
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2312
01:54:56.010 --> 01:54:58.530
<v Speaker 4>That was Ramey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ramey felt that it tastes like bad.</v>

2313
01:54:58.531 --> 01:55:01.440
<v Speaker 4>Diver duck diver ducks and still eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>diver ducks.</v>

2314
01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:02.521
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>

2315
01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:03.354
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>

2316
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:05.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't done that anymore.</v>

2317
01:55:05.011 --> 01:55:05.844
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2318
01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:06.813
<v Speaker 4>haven't included any coyote recipes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no coyote recipes in the wild </v>

2319
01:55:09.751 --> 01:55:10.584
<v Speaker 4>game cookbook either wolf might be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate one that people are going to </v>

2320
01:55:12.981 --> 01:55:13.814
<v Speaker 4>have a problem with at the very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be where the rubber hits the </v>

2321
01:55:16.351 --> 01:55:17.101
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2322
01:55:17.101 --> 01:55:17.934
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some places become a moot point </v>

2323
01:55:20.431 --> 01:55:23.220
<v Speaker 4>because Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wyoming,</v>

2324
01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.800
<v Speaker 4>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all have state management of Walt's.</v>

2325
01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:29.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of the things that we're.</v>

2326
01:55:29.521 --> 01:55:30.354
<v Speaker 4>All these horrible things that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to happen when the state's resume </v>

2327
01:55:32.701 --> 01:55:35.580
<v Speaker 4>management of wolves didn't materialize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2328
01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:38.280
<v Speaker 4>But those places also have a rich </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of hunting.</v>

2329
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:40.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was,</v>

2330
01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:42.270
<v Speaker 4>it was going to be the end of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2331
01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 4>It hasn't in the first few</v>

2332
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:44.873
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first few years of the wool </v>

2333
01:55:45.931 --> 01:55:46.890
<v Speaker 1>seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually had.</v>

2334
01:55:46.930 --> 01:55:50.340
<v Speaker 1>He actually saw the populations go up so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to hunt them.</v>

2335
01:55:50.341 --> 01:55:51.174
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2336
01:55:51.650 --> 01:55:53.700
<v Speaker 1>it winds up being the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2337
01:55:54.330 --> 01:55:55.163
<v Speaker 1>putting that with that little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting pressure on them really changed </v>

2338
01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:01.073
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really changed their movements and </v>

2339
01:56:02.881 --> 01:56:03.714
<v Speaker 1>change the way they perceive human </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats and they adjust to it pretty </v>

2340
01:56:06.121 --> 01:56:08.400
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't led to,</v>

2341
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:09.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people look in those </v>

2342
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:15.480
<v Speaker 1>cases where it was pretty effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very effective to bring in,</v>

2343
01:56:15.481 --> 01:56:16.314
<v Speaker 1>to bring in limited regulated hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the desire to fact on how we're </v>

2344
01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:20.843
<v Speaker 1>using the landscape and in ways in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were interacting and info and </v>

2345
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:26.740
<v Speaker 1>avoiding humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have no doubt too,</v>

2346
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:27.593
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it'll the situation will probably </v>

2347
01:56:30.481 --> 01:56:33.150
<v Speaker 1>in the northern Great Lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had state management,</v>

2348
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:34.110
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state management,</v>

2349
01:56:34.111 --> 01:56:35.430
<v Speaker 1>like it bounces back and forth.</v>

2350
01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.080
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eventually,</v>

2351
01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:39.030
<v Speaker 1>let me kind of depends on how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political winds blow,</v>

2352
01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.073
<v Speaker 1>but you're eventually gonna wind up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it there and you're not going to see </v>

2353
01:56:42.361 --> 01:56:45.450
<v Speaker 1>wolves vanished from the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2354
01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If grizzly bears wind up doing it,</v>

2355
01:56:49.321 --> 01:56:50.101
<v Speaker 1>you're still gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2356
01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:50.934
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna see gradually expanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations of grizzly bears to fight </v>

2357
01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:54.083
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they're using </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited harvest to achieve certain </v>

2358
01:56:56.791 --> 01:57:00.390
<v Speaker 1>management objectives is not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the world that just not.</v>

2359
01:57:00.810 --> 01:57:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you and I think the grizzly</v>

2360
01:57:02.731 --> 01:57:03.564
<v Speaker 1>bear thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably have the same sort of </v>

2361
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:05.274
<v Speaker 1>situation where the grizzlies will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually think of people as a threat </v>

2362
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.570
<v Speaker 1>and it'd probably be safer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2363
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that people hope,</v>

2364
01:57:12.001 --> 01:57:12.834
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't really a lot of people </v>

2365
01:57:14.491 --> 01:57:15.630
<v Speaker 1>looking from the outside in.</v>

2366
01:57:15.630 --> 01:57:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sensitive to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2367
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:19.770
<v Speaker 1>To the idea of the way that which that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2368
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:22.530
<v Speaker 1>that this has impacted professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting guides,</v>

2369
01:57:22.531 --> 01:57:24.000
<v Speaker 1>hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are my people.</v>

2370
01:57:24.001 --> 01:57:26.250
<v Speaker 1>These are people that I care about and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about their needs.</v>

2371
01:57:26.730 --> 01:57:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an issue.</v>

2372
01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:32.580
<v Speaker 1>So time will tell where that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that winds up.</v>

2373
01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:33.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see an MBC where they've just taken </v>

2374
01:57:34.951 --> 01:57:35.784
<v Speaker 1>it away and they take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've taken it away in a very </v>

2375
01:57:37.741 --> 01:57:41.990
<v Speaker 1>irrational way because they have a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>population of grizzlies and pc.</v>

2376
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:45.610
<v Speaker 1>It's very large and for people that live</v>
<v Speaker 1>up there that,</v>

2377
01:57:45.650 --> 01:57:46.483
<v Speaker 1>that hunt them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of scaring the shit out of </v>

2378
01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:50.610
<v Speaker 1>them that all of a sudden you've taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>this away.</v>

2379
01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.473
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a source of income for a lot of </v>

2380
01:57:54.601 --> 01:57:58.530
<v Speaker 1>these people that would guide them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also a smart thing to control</v>

2381
01:57:58.531 --> 01:58:00.780
<v Speaker 1>the population and keep them away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

2382
01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Well that I watched that closely though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel it being another country,</v>

2383
01:58:08.761 --> 01:58:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that sense of um,</v>

2384
01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:13.790
<v Speaker 1>being that other countries don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense of the,</v>

2385
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:17.100
<v Speaker 1>of that you could influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2386
01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:17.993
<v Speaker 1>so it's Kinda like watching something </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in a distant way and you don't </v>

2387
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:21.923
<v Speaker 1>feel it as closely and I don't know all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the factors that play as well as I do </v>

2388
01:58:25.081 --> 01:58:26.430
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2389
01:58:26.610 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I have some friends that live up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Mike [inaudible],</v>

2390
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:34.040
<v Speaker 1>who's a guide up there and he told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror stories about grizzlies had shoot</v>

2391
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:38.930
<v Speaker 1>one trying to get into his cabin from </v>
<v Speaker 1>six feet away and you know,</v>

2392
01:58:39.050 --> 01:58:40.410
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their big fuckers,</v>

2393
01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.310
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them to death.</v>

2394
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.300
<v Speaker 1>They're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2395
01:58:43.301 --> 01:58:45.190
<v Speaker 1>it's cool that they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2396
01:58:45.191 --> 01:58:46.024
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a wild thing that there we have </v>

2397
01:58:49.331 --> 01:58:52.480
<v Speaker 1>this huge monster that lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>

2398
01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been charged by him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't change a thing,</v>

2399
01:58:54.761 --> 01:58:56.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were charged by.</v>

2400
01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like having.</v>

2401
01:58:57.551 --> 01:59:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I like every encounter in every mixup </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really,</v>

2402
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:06.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like deeply complicated stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 1>when talking about these things,</v>

2403
01:59:06.431 --> 01:59:11.431
<v Speaker 1>it's also they become like everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>they become a proxy were,</v>

2404
01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:12.793
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were we're engaged in a debate about </v>

2405
01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:16.030
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2406
01:59:16.031 --> 01:59:16.864
<v Speaker 1>we're engaged in debate about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicting views on wildlife and these </v>

2407
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:21.214
<v Speaker 1>animals step in to this debate and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate centers around them and it winds </v>

2408
01:59:26.441 --> 01:59:29.980
<v Speaker 1>up being bigger than a debate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies.</v>

2409
01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than it is a debate about bison </v>
<v Speaker 1>or buffalo,</v>

2410
01:59:34.001 --> 01:59:36.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than a debate about wolves.</v>

2411
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.863
<v Speaker 1>It's just that these animals step into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ongoing dialogue about what is our </v>

2412
01:59:40.781 --> 01:59:41.614
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the natural world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that relationship with </v>

2413
01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:44.614
<v Speaker 1>renewable resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that relationship with rural </v>

2414
01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:48.003
<v Speaker 1>versus urban perspectives on how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be around wildlife can be </v>

2415
01:59:51.041 --> 01:59:51.874
<v Speaker 1>impacted by wildlife and so it's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>through line of us trying to sort out </v>

2416
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:57.843
<v Speaker 1>how to be like good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible stewards of the landscape </v>

2417
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>and that debate always centers around </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2418
02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Like you could have a huge argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like in a lot of tension with </v>

2419
02:00:08.591 --> 02:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>your spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2420
02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:10.653
<v Speaker 1>And it springs up in a debate about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>best to load the dishwasher or who was </v>

2421
02:00:14.231 --> 02:00:16.900
<v Speaker 1>supposed to pick up the kid from school </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's always like,</v>

2422
02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>it always finds a place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2423
02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:21.123
<v Speaker 1>and right now we're like this argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>about American wildlife and what is our </v>

2424
02:00:25.991 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>relationship to it has found its place </v>
<v Speaker 1>live right now around large predators.</v>

2425
02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And in Scotland it's found its way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live around a feral goat on an island.</v>

2426
02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one case,</v>

2427
02:00:41.530 --> 02:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>all the traveling that you do and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunting trips you go on this,</v>

2428
02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>has it gotten to a point ever that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like a job?</v>

2429
02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As now that I have kids,</v>

2430
02:00:56.031 --> 02:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changed a little bit,</v>

2431
02:00:57.601 --> 02:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I view it a little bit differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2432
02:01:00.650 --> 02:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

2433
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:03.223
<v Speaker 1>I still really love it and I'm able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that I'm able to know that I'm </v>

2434
02:01:06.231 --> 02:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>missing my family while I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2435
02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to know that and feel that pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and still know that I love what I do and</v>

2436
02:01:18.291 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I love talking about the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about and,</v>

2437
02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I view it like as a,</v>

2438
02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's like this tremendous privilege</v>

2439
02:01:25.491 --> 02:01:26.324
<v Speaker 1>that you're able to,</v>

2440
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:27.743
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2441
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Kinda grow up to have to have this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense interest in the subject and this</v>

2442
02:01:33.590 --> 02:01:34.423
<v Speaker 1>intense stress and lifestyle and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the ability to like introduce </v>

2443
02:01:37.011 --> 02:01:39.910
<v Speaker 1>people to all these different ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2444
02:01:40.730 --> 02:01:41.563
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have those two things </v>

2445
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the kind of long to be home more but</v>

2446
02:01:47.751 --> 02:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>enjoying being out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if it would,</v>

2447
02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:53.173
<v Speaker 1>if the longing to be home more would </v>
<v Speaker 1>override that someday it might change </v>

2448
02:01:55.851 --> 02:01:56.684
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right now I'm,</v>

2449
02:01:57.640 --> 02:01:58.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just have seen so many things that </v>

2450
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to have seen and to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a future of not accumulating those</v>

2451
02:02:05.661 --> 02:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>experiences at the rapid rate that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated.</v>

2452
02:02:07.911 --> 02:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of bums me out a little bit.</v>

2453
02:02:10.090 --> 02:02:11.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've lived 100 lives,</v>

2454
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:13.383
<v Speaker 5>you know that the trip that you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about when you were in South </v>

2455
02:02:17.110 --> 02:02:20.080
<v Speaker 5>America and the jungle and you came </v>
<v Speaker 5>across those pictographs.</v>

2456
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:21.610
<v Speaker 5>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you call those things?</v>

2457
02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:23.080
<v Speaker 5>Petroglyphs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Petroglyphs,</v>

2458
02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:23.973
<v Speaker 5>petroglyphs on the rocks that no one had</v>
<v Speaker 5>any idea who made no one know why they </v>

2459
02:02:28.361 --> 02:02:29.194
<v Speaker 5>were just there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's not like a spot on a map that </v>

2460
02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:33.250
<v Speaker 5>tourists go to visit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2461
02:02:33.251 --> 02:02:34.870
<v Speaker 5>here's the petroglyphs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2462
02:02:34.871 --> 02:02:36.760
<v Speaker 5>they're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just there.</v>

2463
02:02:36.761 --> 02:02:37.990
<v Speaker 5>And the hunters like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2464
02:02:37.991 --> 02:02:40.090
<v Speaker 5>there they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ancient ones made these,</v>

2465
02:02:40.330 --> 02:02:41.350
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get the fish.</v>

2466
02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:42.480
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2467
02:02:42.570 --> 02:02:43.990
<v Speaker 5>they really don't give a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>

2468
02:02:44.050 --> 02:02:44.760
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2469
02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:49.330
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing who knows how old that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousand years old years old.</v>

2470
02:02:49.450 --> 02:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To run into stuff like that.</v>

2471
02:02:53.730 --> 02:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful experiences,</v>

2472
02:02:55.291 --> 02:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

2473
02:02:57.850 --> 02:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat the way I eat and live the way I,</v>

2474
02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:02.573
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2475
02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:05.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel fortunate in all the time.</v>

2476
02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.313
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're very important because </v>

2477
02:03:08.071 --> 02:03:12.300
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a real lack of well-read,</v>

2478
02:03:12.630 --> 02:03:17.370
<v Speaker 5>articulate people that support your </v>
<v Speaker 5>position that are in the media.</v>

2479
02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:20.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got a lot of these shows that are on</v>

2480
02:03:20.671 --> 02:03:25.671
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hunting networks that they appeal to</v>

2481
02:03:25.730 --> 02:03:30.450
<v Speaker 5>a very narrow bandwidth in this narrow </v>
<v Speaker 5>bandwidth is,</v>

2482
02:03:30.451 --> 02:03:32.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just uh,</v>

2483
02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:34.133
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2484
02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:40.360
<v Speaker 5>it's like your stereotypical idea of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what hunting is to a lot of people.</v>

2485
02:03:41.401 --> 02:03:44.580
<v Speaker 5>So they'll flip through the channels </v>
<v Speaker 5>that watched that for a few minutes.</v>

2486
02:03:44.581 --> 02:03:45.414
<v Speaker 5>You see someone hooting and hollering </v>
<v Speaker 5>after they shoot something and they get </v>

2487
02:03:49.501 --> 02:03:54.480
<v Speaker 5>this bad taste in their mouth about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas I tell people all the time,</v>

2488
02:03:54.481 --> 02:03:55.314
<v Speaker 5>if you really want to get an </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding about what hunting is </v>

2489
02:03:57.870 --> 02:03:58.703
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always recommend your show because </v>

2490
02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:01.613
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your narration and your reverence for </v>

2491
02:04:05.161 --> 02:04:07.500
<v Speaker 5>what you're doing and the animals and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2492
02:04:07.501 --> 02:04:08.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2493
02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:13.420
<v Speaker 5>your appreciation for how cool the </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience is and how wild it is,</v>

2494
02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for lack of a better term to just,</v>

2495
02:04:15.731 --> 02:04:19.800
<v Speaker 5>to be out there in nature and to be in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the pursuit of these things.</v>

2496
02:04:19.801 --> 02:04:21.330
<v Speaker 5>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take these things,</v>

2497
02:04:21.450 --> 02:04:25.410
<v Speaker 5>these wild creatures and feed your </v>
<v Speaker 5>family and have it become a part of your</v>

2498
02:04:25.411 --> 02:04:28.830
<v Speaker 5>life and to sustain yourself with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Primarily,</v>

2499
02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:30.960
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's you,</v>

2500
02:04:31.110 --> 02:04:35.910
<v Speaker 5>you're giving a perspective that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>think is available that I think is,</v>

2501
02:04:35.911 --> 02:04:39.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is important because it's just,</v>

2502
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.500
<v Speaker 5>there's so many people out that are out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there that are hunters,</v>

2503
02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:44.693
<v Speaker 5>that are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well read people that feel frustrated </v>

2504
02:04:48.670 --> 02:04:49.141
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

2505
02:04:49.141 --> 02:04:50.640
<v Speaker 5>I wish everybody could see it the way I </v>
<v Speaker 5>see it.</v>

2506
02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:51.491
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's poor.</v>

2507
02:04:51.491 --> 02:04:52.324
<v Speaker 4>And to point out that my love of hunting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fishing and of living like a hands </v>

2508
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:04.470
<v Speaker 4>on relationship with the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>living in close proximity to wildlife,</v>

2509
02:05:04.770 --> 02:05:07.920
<v Speaker 4>like my interest in that and desire to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

2510
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:10.703
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2511
02:05:10.930 --> 02:05:11.763
<v Speaker 4>predated by a long ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My ability to talk about why I think </v>

2512
02:05:16.781 --> 02:05:19.540
<v Speaker 4>that those things are important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was there.</v>

2513
02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:21.760
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like I didn't grow up around </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2514
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:22.833
<v Speaker 4>And then later started understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff and thinking about it and </v>

2515
02:05:25.901 --> 02:05:27.250
<v Speaker 4>then decided like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2516
02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:30.670
<v Speaker 4>the path for me then considering what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know now,</v>

2517
02:05:30.671 --> 02:05:32.620
<v Speaker 4>the path we then would do to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting.</v>

2518
02:05:32.621 --> 02:05:34.810
<v Speaker 4>It was like hunting was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved it,</v>

2519
02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I love it today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just had the luxury through what I</v>

2520
02:05:40.121 --> 02:05:42.790
<v Speaker 4>do for a living to spend a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about,</v>

2521
02:05:42.791 --> 02:05:43.624
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that the case if this feels like </v>

2522
02:05:45.370 --> 02:05:46.203
<v Speaker 4>harmonious to you and you can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>live in this and understand and see how </v>

2523
02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:52.740
<v Speaker 4>you fit into some greater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2524
02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:54.670
<v Speaker 4>ecological picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2525
02:05:54.970 --> 02:05:55.803
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it does feel that way and that seems </v>

2526
02:05:57.971 --> 02:06:00.640
<v Speaker 4>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is it that like why is that right?</v>

2527
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:01.623
<v Speaker 4>And it was pushing at those edges that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually developed a way in which I </v>

2528
02:06:04.751 --> 02:06:08.260
<v Speaker 4>talk about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I meet all kinds of people who live that</v>

2529
02:06:08.261 --> 02:06:11.920
<v Speaker 4>same lifestyle that I lived growing up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when I talked to him,</v>

2530
02:06:12.010 --> 02:06:13.660
<v Speaker 4>a thing that they appreciate is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2531
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:14.583
<v Speaker 4>that someone is articulating to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that they felt to be true and </v>

2532
02:06:18.281 --> 02:06:21.370
<v Speaker 4>knew to be true but just hadn't had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time or you know,</v>

2533
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:24.520
<v Speaker 4>didn't have the time or ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>really go out and express it.</v>

2534
02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:28.540
<v Speaker 4>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never want to act like,</v>

2535
02:06:28.541 --> 02:06:29.650
<v Speaker 4>like I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2536
02:06:29.651 --> 02:06:32.650
<v Speaker 4>I certainly have not invented some way </v>
<v Speaker 4>of thinking about it,</v>

2537
02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.220
<v Speaker 4>like elbow leopold in Theodore </v>
<v Speaker 4>Roosevelt,</v>

2538
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Gifford Pincho,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2539
02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:42.190
<v Speaker 4>throughout history like Jim Harrison and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom mcguane for contemporary writers.</v>

2540
02:06:42.191 --> 02:06:43.024
<v Speaker 4>There's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people have been saying and </v>

2541
02:06:43.991 --> 02:06:47.800
<v Speaker 4>talking about an experience in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>outdoors in a way like,</v>

2542
02:06:47.801 --> 02:06:49.930
<v Speaker 4>I haven't invented some new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

2543
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:51.183
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working toward like articulate and </v>

2544
02:06:53.381 --> 02:06:56.860
<v Speaker 4>expressing something that has been in </v>
<v Speaker 4>existence for a long time.</v>

2545
02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.353
<v Speaker 4>If people see negative stereotypes when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on youtube or see negative </v>

2546
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:05.440
<v Speaker 4>stereotypes on certain television shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that stuff is self feeding,</v>

2547
02:07:05.890 --> 02:07:08.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of that stuff gets created</v>

2548
02:07:08.291 --> 02:07:09.124
<v Speaker 4>because it does have a shock value to it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would think that that minus the </v>

2549
02:07:13.631 --> 02:07:14.464
<v Speaker 4>camera,</v>

2550
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:16.583
<v Speaker 4>a lot of minus the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of activities that people might </v>

2551
02:07:19.981 --> 02:07:24.330
<v Speaker 4>feel are abhorrent might not even be </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking place where there is a hamming it</v>

2552
02:07:24.331 --> 02:07:27.150
<v Speaker 4>up for the camera that goes on.</v>

2553
02:07:27.970 --> 02:07:29.710
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that there's like a sort of</v>

2554
02:07:29.711 --> 02:07:34.120
<v Speaker 5>a stereotypical pattern they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to fall into so they fall into</v>

2555
02:07:34.121 --> 02:07:37.300
<v Speaker 5>it when the camera's on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Dj Strip club voice?</v>

2556
02:07:37.530 --> 02:07:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the only thing that,</v>

2557
02:07:38.731 --> 02:07:39.960
<v Speaker 4>there's some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2558
02:07:39.961 --> 02:07:40.794
<v Speaker 4>I think there's some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's [inaudible] and there's </v>

2559
02:07:41.461 --> 02:07:45.060
<v Speaker 4>also lay people a thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>with people who feel under attack.</v>

2560
02:07:45.550 --> 02:07:47.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2561
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:49.560
<v Speaker 4>and in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2562
02:07:50.130 --> 02:07:52.860
<v Speaker 4>hunters are under attack and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways and a lot of places.</v>

2563
02:07:52.861 --> 02:07:55.050
<v Speaker 4>And I think that there's a way when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2564
02:07:55.051 --> 02:07:59.290
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you're being attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you're being pigeonholed,</v>

2565
02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:04.400
<v Speaker 4>stereotyped or response is to cram it </v>
<v Speaker 4>right back down someone else's throat.</v>

2566
02:08:06.230 --> 02:08:07.063
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2567
02:08:07.110 --> 02:08:08.010
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2568
02:08:08.011 --> 02:08:10.470
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's definitely that stuff.</v>

2569
02:08:10.471 --> 02:08:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Or like you fall into this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>us against them,</v>

2570
02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:14.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck down.</v>

2571
02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:16.620
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2572
02:08:16.621 --> 02:08:19.590
<v Speaker 4>I'll show them how we really are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2573
02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:20.424
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get into this kind of dialogue </v>

2574
02:08:22.171 --> 02:08:23.250
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot more pain.</v>

2575
02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:24.113
<v Speaker 4>It's more painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm maybe not more painful is </v>

2576
02:08:27.601 --> 02:08:29.130
<v Speaker 4>definitely more hard to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2577
02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:31.290
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about this for real.</v>

2578
02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:32.670
<v Speaker 4>This is really something we need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>discuss.</v>

2579
02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:33.504
<v Speaker 4>Let's dig in and discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that a lot of people feel </v>

2580
02:08:36.151 --> 02:08:39.300
<v Speaker 4>like I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That hunting feels like something that's</v>

2581
02:08:39.301 --> 02:08:40.134
<v Speaker 4>natural with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like to do it and they don't feel </v>

2582
02:08:41.971 --> 02:08:42.804
<v Speaker 4>the need to take the time to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when questioning when pressed to </v>

2583
02:08:45.181 --> 02:08:48.900
<v Speaker 4>explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they maybe kind of lash out,</v>

2584
02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:50.920
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2585
02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:55.090
<v Speaker 5>It may be lack the ability to look at it</v>
<v Speaker 5>from an outside perspective because it's</v>

2586
02:08:55.091 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 5>been a part of their life their whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and they don't want to justify it.</v>

2587
02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:01.570
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2588
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:02.413
<v Speaker 5>It's salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's also the weird thing that as </v>

2589
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:07.653
<v Speaker 5>much as you can appreciate hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>think of it as an ethical way to </v>

2590
02:09:11.651 --> 02:09:13.480
<v Speaker 5>acquire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meet everybody,</v>

2591
02:09:13.481 --> 02:09:16.060
<v Speaker 5>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got too many people.</v>

2592
02:09:16.061 --> 02:09:17.960
<v Speaker 5>It's untenable and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2593
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 5>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's no responsibility for you</v>

2594
02:09:21.131 --> 02:09:23.220
<v Speaker 5>to acknowledge that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2595
02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:27.910
<v Speaker 5>it's something that gets brought up when</v>
<v Speaker 5>people talk about the,</v>

2596
02:09:27.911 --> 02:09:32.911
<v Speaker 5>the how ethical acquisition of meat is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really like either hunting or you'd have</v>

2597
02:09:34.961 --> 02:09:39.740
<v Speaker 5>to raise something yourself and be </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely aware or get something from a</v>

2598
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:42.850
<v Speaker 5>farmer who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2599
02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:43.713
<v Speaker 5>completely ethical from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from birth to death and you have to be </v>

2600
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 5>comfortable with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the most ethical,</v>

2601
02:09:49.511 --> 02:09:52.060
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion is a hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then people always say,</v>

2602
02:09:52.061 --> 02:09:53.380
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everybody can hunt.</v>

2603
02:09:54.210 --> 02:09:55.540
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I can.</v>

2604
02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:56.653
<v Speaker 5>So if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do I do about the fact that </v>

2605
02:09:58.151 --> 02:09:58.984
<v Speaker 5>everybody can.</v>

2606
02:09:58.990 --> 02:10:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone could come in.</v>

2607
02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:04.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a moot point because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

2608
02:10:04.661 --> 02:10:06.810
<v Speaker 4>I guess they're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

2609
02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:11.590
<v Speaker 4>certainly everyone could enter into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting game,</v>

2610
02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:14.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could come in and hunt.</v>

2611
02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.273
<v Speaker 4>It would just mean that you had a much </v>
<v Speaker 4>larger pool of people after a limited </v>

2612
02:10:18.551 --> 02:10:23.551
<v Speaker 4>resource and that limited resource would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be allocated in a different way.</v>

2613
02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:24.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could have total participation and </v>

2614
02:10:27.581 --> 02:10:32.110
<v Speaker 4>it would just be that every person's </v>
<v Speaker 4>slice of the pie will be much smaller,</v>

2615
02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2616
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:37.120
<v Speaker 4>when we look at when a statement like </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks at like,</v>

2617
02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:37.963
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2618
02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:38.953
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

2619
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:42.340
<v Speaker 4>what's a Turkey harvest that our state </v>
<v Speaker 4>could support these,</v>

2620
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:44.180
<v Speaker 4>break the state up into a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different units.</v>

2621
02:10:44.181 --> 02:10:46.750
<v Speaker 4>They look at population trends and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>determine like,</v>

2622
02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:47.593
<v Speaker 4>how many Turk you can we afford to </v>
<v Speaker 4>harvest without impacting the Turkey </v>

2623
02:10:49.581 --> 02:10:50.270
<v Speaker 4>population?</v>

2624
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:51.103
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If everyone in the state wanted to </v>

2625
02:10:52.191 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 4>chance use the lined up with the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>number,</v>

2626
02:10:55.530 --> 02:10:57.980
<v Speaker 4>you'd wind up with the same number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Turkey's being killed.</v>

2627
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:00.470
<v Speaker 4>It would just be that you would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>less opportunity.</v>

2628
02:11:00.650 --> 02:11:02.660
<v Speaker 4>You have to wait longer to get your </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn.</v>

2629
02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:06.000
<v Speaker 4>So it's not that everybody can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2630
02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:06.993
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that,</v>

2631
02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.020
<v Speaker 4>but it's not even really point because </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody will not,</v>

2632
02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:11.330
<v Speaker 4>when I do the stuff that I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in,</v>

2633
02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.233
<v Speaker 4>in writing a wild game cookbook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing two things and running wild </v>

2634
02:11:15.361 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 4>game took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm doing the main thing that I feel</v>

2635
02:11:17.391 --> 02:11:18.224
<v Speaker 4>is the most important part of my job are</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most important part of what I am is </v>

2636
02:11:20.601 --> 02:11:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm like having a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who live this lifestyle,</v>

2637
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:28.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those are people that I relate to.</v>

2638
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.280
<v Speaker 4>I want to represent the world in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it enhances their lives,</v>

2639
02:11:34.761 --> 02:11:36.500
<v Speaker 4>provide education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2640
02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:40.250
<v Speaker 4>And share my experiences with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience of people that I recommend is a</v>

2641
02:11:40.251 --> 02:11:43.370
<v Speaker 4>tribe that I'm part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would be like American hunters and</v>

2642
02:11:43.371 --> 02:11:44.204
<v Speaker 4>anglers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm presenting them like doing a </v>

2643
02:11:45.471 --> 02:11:48.110
<v Speaker 4>cookbook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm presenting them like best practices,</v>

2644
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:49.123
<v Speaker 4>how to sort of like live the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of a wild game lifestyle that </v>

2645
02:11:51.831 --> 02:11:52.664
<v Speaker 4>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the way to think about and </v>

2646
02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:55.140
<v Speaker 4>approach wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2647
02:11:55.190 --> 02:11:56.023
<v Speaker 4>but also the secondary part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm doing is presenting a world to </v>

2648
02:11:58.791 --> 02:12:02.450
<v Speaker 4>people who might be unfamiliar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yes,</v>

2649
02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:06.740
<v Speaker 4>do I have the hope that people will like</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2650
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:10.640
<v Speaker 4>read this book and then be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2651
02:12:10.641 --> 02:12:11.474
<v Speaker 4>I want to participate in this lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 4>that could mean as much as I'm walking </v>

2652
02:12:14.961 --> 02:12:15.794
<v Speaker 4>down to the local river in their city </v>
<v Speaker 4>and flipping over rocks and picking up </v>

2653
02:12:18.081 --> 02:12:20.420
<v Speaker 4>crayfish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is introducing them,</v>

2654
02:12:20.421 --> 02:12:21.254
<v Speaker 4>bringing them into the natural world and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing them into engagement with </v>

2655
02:12:25.041 --> 02:12:28.070
<v Speaker 4>nature and I do view and hope that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will happen.</v>

2656
02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.173
<v Speaker 4>Will it happen in some grand scale where</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll have hundreds of millions of </v>

2657
02:12:32.031 --> 02:12:33.080
<v Speaker 4>hundreds in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now?</v>

2658
02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 4>That's not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do think that it is important that</v>

2659
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:41.501
<v Speaker 4>we do have more people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We in large measure,</v>

2660
02:12:42.650 --> 02:12:43.483
<v Speaker 4>we fund much of our wildlife work and </v>
<v Speaker 4>management from law enforcement disease </v>

2661
02:12:47.811 --> 02:12:48.644
<v Speaker 4>research on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We fund that stuff through hunting and </v>

2662
02:12:50.991 --> 02:12:55.220
<v Speaker 4>fishing licenses and through excise </v>
<v Speaker 4>taxes on sporting goods equipment.</v>

2663
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.150
<v Speaker 4>If the more people that are engaged with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this activity,</v>

2664
02:12:59.330 --> 02:13:02.300
<v Speaker 4>I think the better it winds up being for</v>
<v Speaker 4>American wildlife.</v>

2665
02:13:02.890 --> 02:13:03.723
<v Speaker 5>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea is that everyone can't do </v>

2666
02:13:07.211 --> 02:13:11.050
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that you're saying that this</v>

2667
02:13:11.051 --> 02:13:14.800
<v Speaker 5>is how you ethically acquire meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not a,</v>

2668
02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:17.440
<v Speaker 5>it's not a solution for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>

2669
02:13:17.730 --> 02:13:18.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2670
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:20.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't say that this is the only way </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying you.</v>

2671
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying this is one of the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people make.</v>

2672
02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:24.190
<v Speaker 5>If you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2673
02:13:24.370 --> 02:13:26.290
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hunt for my meat.</v>

2674
02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:28.630
<v Speaker 5>This is how I ethically acquire me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2675
02:13:28.631 --> 02:13:31.090
<v Speaker 5>everybody can't do that because there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not enough animals.</v>

2676
02:13:31.410 --> 02:13:32.310
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2677
02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:34.260
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody can't do that if,</v>

2678
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:37.230
<v Speaker 5>if even more people got involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not,</v>

2679
02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:38.073
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a solution for the entire </v>

2680
02:13:39.031 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 5>population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can say,</v>

2681
02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:42.690
<v Speaker 5>well that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The entire population is not going to do</v>

2682
02:13:42.691 --> 02:13:47.691
<v Speaker 5>it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a that gets into it.</v>

2683
02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:48.913
<v Speaker 5>It's a stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just the giant number of human </v>

2684
02:13:51.061 --> 02:13:52.860
<v Speaker 5>beings that need to be fed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2685
02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:57.690
<v Speaker 5>There's almost no other solution than </v>
<v Speaker 5>the solution that we're doing right now.</v>

2686
02:13:57.691 --> 02:13:58.524
<v Speaker 5>Unless they come up with some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lab created meat or whatever the fuck </v>

2687
02:14:02.491 --> 02:14:04.470
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna come up with next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they are.</v>

2688
02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Do your lips are curling as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>involuntary?</v>

2689
02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:10.173
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2690
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:13.090
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty happy with,</v>

2691
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:16.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty happy with my diet right now.</v>

2692
02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:17.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2693
02:14:17.201 --> 02:14:18.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2694
02:14:18.431 --> 02:14:18.791
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2695
02:14:18.791 --> 02:14:21.400
<v Speaker 4>I watched that kind of stuff and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>curious about it,</v>

2696
02:14:21.401 --> 02:14:22.234
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't take it as a personal insult by </v>

2697
02:14:23.561 --> 02:14:26.590
<v Speaker 4>any stretch now if everybody switched </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lab created meat,</v>

2698
02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:27.813
<v Speaker 4>but I still had the in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still had the ability to continue </v>

2699
02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:33.550
<v Speaker 4>eating how I live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how I live,</v>

2700
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:36.100
<v Speaker 4>like I don't view that as being a future</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

2701
02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:39.880
<v Speaker 5>Rocky Mountain Elk Federation is </v>
<v Speaker 5>reintroduced foundation.</v>

2702
02:14:39.881 --> 02:14:40.631
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I say,</v>

2703
02:14:40.631 --> 02:14:42.140
<v Speaker 5>Federation Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2704
02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:44.140
<v Speaker 5>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've introduced elk too,</v>

2705
02:14:44.141 --> 02:14:44.974
<v Speaker 5>a lot of different places and made </v>
<v Speaker 5>sustainable populations that are now </v>

2706
02:14:46.930 --> 02:14:49.860
<v Speaker 5>hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is me,</v>

2707
02:14:49.861 --> 02:14:50.694
<v Speaker 5>this is a beautiful thing and I'd hope </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they continue to spread and </v>

2708
02:14:53.171 --> 02:14:54.004
<v Speaker 5>continue to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's possible that other </v>

2709
02:14:56.381 --> 02:14:57.214
<v Speaker 5>game animals could be reintroduced to </v>
<v Speaker 5>places where they would develop such a </v>

2710
02:15:01.031 --> 02:15:01.864
<v Speaker 5>large population that we could sustain </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe even double the amount of hunters </v>

2711
02:15:05.050 --> 02:15:07.150
<v Speaker 5>that we have now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that possible?</v>

2712
02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it this way,</v>

2713
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:11.880
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2714
02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:12.873
<v Speaker 4>For Stars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2715
02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:16.360
<v Speaker 4>You know that you just pull up an </v>
<v Speaker 4>article about wolves united selling like</v>

2716
02:15:16.361 --> 02:15:20.830
<v Speaker 4>every article from mainstream news </v>
<v Speaker 4>sources to get that involves wolves.</v>

2717
02:15:20.831 --> 02:15:21.664
<v Speaker 4>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll kind of detect the bias of the </v>

2718
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:24.183
<v Speaker 4>individual writing it and they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>how walls have only been recovered </v>

2719
02:15:27.251 --> 02:15:30.130
<v Speaker 4>across 10 percent of their historic </v>
<v Speaker 4>range elk.</v>

2720
02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:33.470
<v Speaker 4>That's about the same for elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2721
02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.353
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elk are missing from 80 plus percent of </v>

2722
02:15:36.851 --> 02:15:39.520
<v Speaker 4>their historic range in the lower 48.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2723
02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:41.670
<v Speaker 4>But we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2724
02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:43.373
<v Speaker 4>at various times may have a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 4>million of them live in Colorado or you </v>

2725
02:15:46.871 --> 02:15:48.580
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some states got $100,000,</v>

2726
02:15:48.581 --> 02:15:51.160
<v Speaker 4>whatever you get now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps 20,000</v>

2727
02:15:51.161 --> 02:15:53.170
<v Speaker 4>living in Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those were all gone.</v>

2728
02:15:53.710 --> 02:15:57.100
<v Speaker 4>New Mexico at a point had zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2729
02:15:57.370 --> 02:15:58.500
<v Speaker 4>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>

2730
02:15:58.510 --> 02:15:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>

2731
02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:00.453
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero elk were gone from the unregulated </v>

2732
02:16:04.211 --> 02:16:06.880
<v Speaker 4>slaughter of the market hunting era when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people could shoot,</v>

2733
02:16:06.881 --> 02:16:10.750
<v Speaker 4>meet and sell it into urban meat </v>
<v Speaker 4>markets.</v>

2734
02:16:10.751 --> 02:16:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eliminate American wild game before</v>

2735
02:16:12.881 --> 02:16:15.430
<v Speaker 4>we figured out how to do what the word I</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep using all the time now,</v>

2736
02:16:15.431 --> 02:16:17.640
<v Speaker 4>which is regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>harvest,</v>

2737
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:18.410
<v Speaker 4>regulate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2738
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:19.620
<v Speaker 4>management.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2739
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:24.040
<v Speaker 4>so all that stuff was gone later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their estates where there was no,</v>

2740
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:25.383
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>states where there was no deer hunting </v>

2741
02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:28.510
<v Speaker 4>at the time of European contact.</v>

2742
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:29.343
<v Speaker 4>We had turkeys 39 states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It got whittled down to target in 19 </v>

2743
02:16:31.481 --> 02:16:34.540
<v Speaker 4>states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have Turkey hunting seasons in</v>

2744
02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:35.433
<v Speaker 4>49 states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've done a tremendous job of </v>

2745
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:40.083
<v Speaker 4>recovering wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly a tremendous job of to </v>

2746
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:45.963
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate like what happens to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal that hunters value and love and </v>

2747
02:16:49.331 --> 02:16:50.164
<v Speaker 4>are able to use as a renewable resource </v>
<v Speaker 4>is those species tend to really enjoy a </v>

2748
02:16:53.681 --> 02:16:54.514
<v Speaker 4>lot of protections and they thrive </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people are vested in their best </v>

2749
02:16:57.221 --> 02:16:58.300
<v Speaker 4>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2750
02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:02.590
<v Speaker 4>we've created Turkey hunting seasons in </v>
<v Speaker 4>30 states.</v>

2751
02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:06.760
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can recover what you can do things,</v>

2752
02:17:06.761 --> 02:17:07.594
<v Speaker 4>a wildlife and like create resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we now we used to argue </v>

2753
02:17:10.901 --> 02:17:13.570
<v Speaker 4>about what's gonna happen with dear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to let dr deer to extinction</v>

2754
02:17:13.571 --> 02:17:14.404
<v Speaker 4>in certain states or extra patients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certain states now are big argument is </v>

2755
02:17:16.901 --> 02:17:20.500
<v Speaker 4>what do we do with having so many deer </v>
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>

2756
02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:23.680
<v Speaker 4>It winds up being that you come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>against social tolerances.</v>

2757
02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.690
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to like when we fill in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>map on elk,</v>

2758
02:17:28.691 --> 02:17:31.510
<v Speaker 4>when Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation looks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and filling in the map on elk,</v>

2759
02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:33.293
<v Speaker 4>you got to sell people on the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to recover elk and there's </v>

2760
02:17:36.430 --> 02:17:37.263
<v Speaker 4>a lot of resistance to recovering </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife because a lot of so it's </v>

2761
02:17:39.761 --> 02:17:40.594
<v Speaker 4>inconvenient to have around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do a great job of brokering deals </v>

2762
02:17:43.301 --> 02:17:44.134
<v Speaker 4>with states and finding places where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know a state maybe has a patch of </v>

2763
02:17:47.051 --> 02:17:47.884
<v Speaker 4>habitat they think could support the </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals and providing the expertise and </v>

2764
02:17:50.951 --> 02:17:53.530
<v Speaker 4>financial support and all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like bringing in those things,</v>

2765
02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:54.753
<v Speaker 4>but generally you wind up where because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of settlement and cities and suburban </v>

2766
02:17:59.321 --> 02:18:00.154
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we wound up with fewer and fewer places </v>

2767
02:18:01.301 --> 02:18:04.580
<v Speaker 4>where we can go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to really fill in the map on,</v>

2768
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:08.050
<v Speaker 4>on recovering elk across all that range </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're supposed to be.</v>

2769
02:18:08.430 --> 02:18:10.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that we'll get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we've gotten there in a lot of other</v>

2770
02:18:10.811 --> 02:18:13.660
<v Speaker 4>stuff and it was like the wild sheep </v>
<v Speaker 4>foundation,</v>

2771
02:18:13.661 --> 02:18:14.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to do the same thing with</v>

2772
02:18:14.891 --> 02:18:18.970
<v Speaker 4>bighorn sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is not even social attitudes.</v>

2773
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 4>There winds up being disease like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>spent from domestic sheep.</v>

2774
02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their main,</v>

2775
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:26.103
<v Speaker 4>like the main problem preventing us from</v>
<v Speaker 4>recovering bighorn sheep is disease </v>

2776
02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:35.020
<v Speaker 4>types of pneumonia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The come from domestic sheep.</v>

2777
02:18:35.170 --> 02:18:37.360
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people you know,</v>

2778
02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:38.253
<v Speaker 4>to go in and say to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>running sheep on a mountain domestic </v>

2779
02:18:40.631 --> 02:18:42.280
<v Speaker 4>sheep on a mountain and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2780
02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:45.610
<v Speaker 4>no insult you and no insult to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2781
02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:50.640
<v Speaker 4>your forebears who've been sheep </v>
<v Speaker 4>ranchers here for 120 years or whatever.</v>

2782
02:18:50.651 --> 02:18:51.484
<v Speaker 4>But we would like to try to recover </v>
<v Speaker 4>American wildlife and bring big horns </v>

2783
02:18:53.861 --> 02:18:54.694
<v Speaker 4>back to this mountain range and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to require you moving these sheep </v>

2784
02:18:56.381 --> 02:18:56.680
<v Speaker 4>out of the way.</v>

2785
02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:57.513
<v Speaker 4>It's an insulting idea that people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a blocker there and every </v>

2786
02:19:02.351 --> 02:19:04.660
<v Speaker 4>animal has it's own type of problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turkeys.</v>

2787
02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:08.390
<v Speaker 4>It worked because people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get pissed about tr,</v>

2788
02:19:08.410 --> 02:19:11.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like having them around and then look at</v>

2789
02:19:11.111 --> 02:19:13.600
<v Speaker 4>what's going on with just allowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2790
02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:16.390
<v Speaker 4>allowing bison the walkout of </v>
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone national park.</v>

2791
02:19:16.770 --> 02:19:21.160
<v Speaker 4>It's been an issue for a quarter century</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2792
02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.253
<v Speaker 4>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not comfortable with you letting </v>

2793
02:19:24.671 --> 02:19:25.504
<v Speaker 4>these big ass things walk out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>park and roam around because of disease </v>

2794
02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:31.790
<v Speaker 4>grazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2795
02:19:31.791 --> 02:19:35.000
<v Speaker 4>There's like people don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>inconvenienced by wildlife.</v>

2796
02:19:35.001 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 4>These are places where I would be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that area.</v>

2797
02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:40.740
<v Speaker 4>I'd really like to see like when a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When a.</v>

2798
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:44.540
<v Speaker 4>When a bison leave the park,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he stops being a wild animal and becomes</v>

2799
02:19:44.541 --> 02:19:45.374
<v Speaker 4>livestock.</v>

2800
02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:49.270
<v Speaker 2>What's going on with that American </v>
<v Speaker 2>Savannah thing?</v>

2801
02:19:50.530 --> 02:19:51.310
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2802
02:19:51.310 --> 02:19:53.380
<v Speaker 2>that program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Apr?</v>

2803
02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:54.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they call them?</v>

2804
02:19:54.281 --> 02:19:55.960
<v Speaker 2>That again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The American prairie reserve.</v>

2805
02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is going on with that?</v>

2806
02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Explained what the fuck that is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

2807
02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:06.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's a long story too long.</v>

2808
02:20:06.430 --> 02:20:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna have.</v>

2809
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.970
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're working with having the.</v>

2810
02:20:09.010 --> 02:20:12.460
<v Speaker 4>It's too long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're working with having the founder on</v>

2811
02:20:12.461 --> 02:20:12.980
<v Speaker 4>our show.</v>

2812
02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To have a conversation.</v>

2813
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:15.343
<v Speaker 2>Prayer Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're essentially trying to do is </v>

2814
02:20:16.851 --> 02:20:21.260
<v Speaker 2>reintroduce a bunch of animals into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic chunk of land and they continue</v>

2815
02:20:21.261 --> 02:20:22.094
<v Speaker 2>to buy up more of this land and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't they running block management on </v>

2816
02:20:27.291 --> 02:20:28.540
<v Speaker 2>this as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2817
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:31.240
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot,</v>

2818
02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:32.293
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of suspicions and </v>

2819
02:20:34.601 --> 02:20:36.880
<v Speaker 4>controversy and it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2820
02:20:36.890 --> 02:20:40.180
<v Speaker 4>it's an idea that a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>uneasy with,</v>

2821
02:20:40.181 --> 02:20:42.370
<v Speaker 4>but the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the problem.</v>

2822
02:20:42.371 --> 02:20:44.300
<v Speaker 4>The thing is it's like people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2823
02:20:44.470 --> 02:20:46.000
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have uh,</v>

2824
02:20:46.090 --> 02:20:48.370
<v Speaker 4>they have funding and have a thing where</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2825
02:20:48.810 --> 02:20:49.643
<v Speaker 4>when land comes for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they buy it and the goal of buying up </v>

2826
02:20:51.911 --> 02:20:55.720
<v Speaker 4>the land is to turn it back into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2827
02:20:56.440 --> 02:21:00.730
<v Speaker 4>turn it back into wildlife habitat for </v>
<v Speaker 4>native wildlife and at wine.</v>

2828
02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:03.280
<v Speaker 4>It's contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the controversy around.</v>

2829
02:21:03.281 --> 02:21:04.114
<v Speaker 4>It stems from the fact that some people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like to see areas that were </v>

2830
02:21:08.290 --> 02:21:12.790
<v Speaker 4>supported like traditional economies in </v>
<v Speaker 4>rural areas like cattle ranching and,</v>

2831
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:13.783
<v Speaker 4>and to see these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see these areas returning to a wild </v>

2832
02:21:18.761 --> 02:21:19.594
<v Speaker 4>landscape is threatening to people from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hunter perspective is they're </v>

2833
02:21:24.761 --> 02:21:25.460
<v Speaker 4>allowing.</v>

2834
02:21:25.460 --> 02:21:26.293
<v Speaker 4>There's lot of places that people used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to hunt and the American </v>

2835
02:21:28.721 --> 02:21:29.554
<v Speaker 4>prairie reserve is allowing hunting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go on and people are coming in and </v>

2836
02:21:32.081 --> 02:21:32.441
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2837
02:21:32.441 --> 02:21:33.274
<v Speaker 4>they need to make sure that they need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>assure us that hunting will be allowed </v>

2838
02:21:36.071 --> 02:21:36.904
<v Speaker 4>here in perpetuity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because we're suspicious about </v>

2839
02:21:40.930 --> 02:21:42.790
<v Speaker 4>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a lot of,</v>

2840
02:21:42.791 --> 02:21:44.830
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear about it in so many ways,</v>

2841
02:21:44.831 --> 02:21:46.840
<v Speaker 4>but the core mission is something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>most people,</v>

2842
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:48.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at it,</v>

2843
02:21:48.461 --> 02:21:49.294
<v Speaker 4>the core mission,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that most people are going to </v>

2844
02:21:50.891 --> 02:21:52.330
<v Speaker 4>look at it and be pretty comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2845
02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:52.961
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2846
02:21:52.961 --> 02:21:55.300
<v Speaker 4>you're a guy or an organization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have money.</v>

2847
02:21:55.390 --> 02:21:58.360
<v Speaker 4>And when a ranch comes up for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you buy it on the open market.</v>

2848
02:21:59.170 --> 02:22:01.900
<v Speaker 4>Seller names is price.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You pay,</v>

2849
02:22:01.901 --> 02:22:06.130
<v Speaker 4>the price is now your land if you choose</v>
<v Speaker 4>to not run cattle.</v>

2850
02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:10.510
<v Speaker 4>But wanna have bison roam around on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why should I care?</v>

2851
02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:11.800
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2852
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:15.520
<v Speaker 4>But people do care because they look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>it as being like a value judgment.</v>

2853
02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:17.713
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at it as being like a value </v>

2854
02:22:19.241 --> 02:22:22.390
<v Speaker 4>judgment about rural economies and about</v>
<v Speaker 4>agriculture.</v>

2855
02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think</v>

2856
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:26.833
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a thousand more aspects of </v>

2857
02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:33.570
<v Speaker 4>this were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a rich subject.</v>

2858
02:22:33.571 --> 02:22:35.050
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to get into it more about it.</v>

2859
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:38.110
<v Speaker 4>Next time I come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2860
02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Next time you can take like an hour to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain the situation.</v>

2861
02:22:41.050 --> 02:22:45.100
<v Speaker 4>What is their long term plan like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long is this going on for?</v>

2862
02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:46.840
<v Speaker 4>It's been going on for quite a while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2863
02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:47.693
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the longterm play is that overtime you </v>

2864
02:22:50.921 --> 02:22:51.754
<v Speaker 4>would assemble a p,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chunk of the great plains that is far </v>

2865
02:22:54.821 --> 02:22:55.654
<v Speaker 4>bigger than yellowstone national park </v>
<v Speaker 4>that supports a thriving population of </v>

2866
02:23:01.090 --> 02:23:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Bison Wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly bears,</v>

2867
02:23:04.390 --> 02:23:06.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2868
02:23:06.190 --> 02:23:08.380
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a park like setting,</v>

2869
02:23:10.330 --> 02:23:13.590
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't come without a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2870
02:23:13.690 --> 02:23:15.820
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't come without its own bits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversy</v>

2871
02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:19.033
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

2872
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2873
02:23:20.921 --> 02:23:22.840
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's the thing that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>has opinions about there.</v>

2874
02:23:22.850 --> 02:23:25.470
<v Speaker 4>There was a version they don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about that.</v>

2875
02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:26.313
<v Speaker 4>There was a version of this called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo Commons that happened long ago </v>

2876
02:23:28.421 --> 02:23:30.590
<v Speaker 4>where a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2877
02:23:30.910 --> 02:23:31.743
<v Speaker 4>there was a social scientist named,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was frank popper by the last </v>

2878
02:23:35.501 --> 02:23:39.610
<v Speaker 4>name of popper and he was looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>demographic patterns on the Great Plains</v>

2879
02:23:39.850 --> 02:23:42.940
<v Speaker 4>and he was observing the ways in which </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2880
02:23:42.941 --> 02:23:46.930
<v Speaker 4>the gray areas on the great plains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the population was shrinking.</v>

2881
02:23:47.410 --> 02:23:48.243
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of counties and on the </v>

2882
02:23:51.550 --> 02:23:52.383
<v Speaker 4>Great Plains where through various like </v>
<v Speaker 4>longterm agricultural trends and other </v>

2883
02:23:56.021 --> 02:23:58.780
<v Speaker 4>issues where the human population is </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapidly shrinking,</v>

2884
02:23:58.840 --> 02:23:59.673
<v Speaker 4>rapidly declining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this sociologist brought up this </v>

2885
02:24:05.501 --> 02:24:06.334
<v Speaker 4>idea that if these trends continue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have this rare case in </v>

2886
02:24:10.151 --> 02:24:14.860
<v Speaker 4>which a landscape sort of accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 4>rewilding.</v>

2887
02:24:15.390 --> 02:24:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] where everyone left,</v>

2888
02:24:18.430 --> 02:24:21.250
<v Speaker 4>which is not a story we're familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we look at what happened.</v>

2889
02:24:21.250 --> 02:24:23.170
<v Speaker 4>So wildlands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2890
02:24:23.171 --> 02:24:24.040
<v Speaker 4>across the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2891
02:24:24.041 --> 02:24:26.500
<v Speaker 4>The general stories like people move in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and wildlife moves out.</v>

2892
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:29.770
<v Speaker 4>So this idea that became the Buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Commons.</v>

2893
02:24:29.890 --> 02:24:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

2894
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:35.380
<v Speaker 4>it just so happens that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that idea that this,</v>

2895
02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:38.290
<v Speaker 4>the idea kind of centered around this </v>
<v Speaker 4>area on Jordan,</v>

2896
02:24:38.291 --> 02:24:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2897
02:24:39.970 --> 02:24:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Because you have large tracks of </v>
<v Speaker 4>federally managed public land up there,</v>

2898
02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:45.093
<v Speaker 4>you had a lot of ag like ranch land that</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't that expensive and people could </v>

2899
02:24:49.811 --> 02:24:51.790
<v Speaker 4>buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was like the seed of the idea.</v>

2900
02:24:51.791 --> 02:24:52.624
<v Speaker 4>I think that now that was such an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unpopular notion because it had to do </v>

2901
02:24:55.031 --> 02:24:57.010
<v Speaker 4>with like economic decay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2902
02:24:57.011 --> 02:24:57.844
<v Speaker 4>And shrinking towns and reduced </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources for public education and all </v>

2903
02:25:01.021 --> 02:25:03.490
<v Speaker 4>that kinds of stuff that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 4>having an economy that is not thriving,</v>

2904
02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:09.540
<v Speaker 4>but over time that like Buffalo Commons </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea kind of segwayed into this American</v>

2905
02:25:10.631 --> 02:25:11.464
<v Speaker 4>prairie reserve idea and it happened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be sort of centered around the same </v>

2906
02:25:13.991 --> 02:25:16.630
<v Speaker 4>chunk of land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Kittridge,</v>

2907
02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:21.400
<v Speaker 4>a Western writer who deals with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape and environmental issues,</v>

2908
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:22.503
<v Speaker 4>was talking about a in the wake of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo Commons idea and poppers work </v>

2909
02:25:26.921 --> 02:25:27.754
<v Speaker 4>was talking about going to Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana and talking about the Buffalo </v>

2910
02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:35.620
<v Speaker 4>Commons is a great way to get your ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicked because it's this idea like if,</v>

2911
02:25:35.770 --> 02:25:36.603
<v Speaker 4>if culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the agricultural producers and </v>

2912
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:39.814
<v Speaker 4>ranchers were celebrated and they made a</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization out of the wilderness and </v>

2913
02:25:42.641 --> 02:25:46.180
<v Speaker 4>they brought an animals and created </v>
<v Speaker 4>economies and creative communities.</v>

2914
02:25:46.510 --> 02:25:48.510
<v Speaker 4>And for someone to now say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2915
02:25:48.610 --> 02:25:49.870
<v Speaker 4>thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no thanks bro.</v>

2916
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:52.063
<v Speaker 4>We'd rather go back and eliminate your </v>
<v Speaker 4>presence on this landscape and we don't </v>

2917
02:25:56.901 --> 02:26:00.140
<v Speaker 4>in fact value what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're going to try as hard as we can</v>

2918
02:26:00.141 --> 02:26:00.974
<v Speaker 4>to undo what you did because we now view</v>
<v Speaker 4>it as the you did the year people did </v>

2919
02:26:06.091 --> 02:26:08.040
<v Speaker 4>the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to correct that wrong.</v>

2920
02:26:08.430 --> 02:26:09.263
<v Speaker 4>And some like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people it's like this insulting </v>

2921
02:26:13.981 --> 02:26:17.100
<v Speaker 4>idea to a lot of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they celebrate it because they're like,</v>

2922
02:26:17.101 --> 02:26:19.230
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's for sale and I buy it,</v>

2923
02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>it's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see it from both perspectives.</v>

2924
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:23.410
<v Speaker 2>German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2925
02:26:23.410 --> 02:26:25.450
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very much like the hunting thing.</v>

2926
02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:28.330
<v Speaker 2>If you're a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a deep history in it.</v>

2927
02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:33.250
<v Speaker 2>You understand that your perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranching is from a rancher.</v>

2928
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:34.383
<v Speaker 2>Whereas people in the outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>conveniently can be ignorant about it </v>

2929
02:26:36.611 --> 02:26:37.021
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2930
02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:39.070
<v Speaker 2>fuck those ranchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the buffalo.</v>

2931
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2932
02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:42.110
<v Speaker 4>In my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my perspective on wildlife has been,</v>

2933
02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:44.820
<v Speaker 4>it's the thing that you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the thing that you care about,</v>

2934
02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:49.380
<v Speaker 4>your work to conserve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to have it on the landscape and</v>

2935
02:26:49.381 --> 02:26:50.510
<v Speaker 4>you also eat a lot of it out of it.</v>

2936
02:26:51.610 --> 02:26:53.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a foreign idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2937
02:26:53.390 --> 02:26:56.960
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that you can't sell wild game.</v>

2938
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that mark and hunting is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2939
02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:00.013
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would really love it if there was a </v>

2940
02:27:02.241 --> 02:27:07.241
<v Speaker 2>restaurant where you could go where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could buy like really well prepared wild</v>

2941
02:27:08.631 --> 02:27:12.320
<v Speaker 2>game dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really well prepared bear.</v>

2942
02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Really well prepared mountain lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well prepared,</v>

2943
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:18.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank with the animal.</v>

2944
02:27:18.470 --> 02:27:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I just think that would be a fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 2>place to eat,</v>

2945
02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:22.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe maybe if they could do </v>

2946
02:27:23.721 --> 02:27:24.554
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be that you could actually </v>

2947
02:27:25.941 --> 02:27:26.774
<v Speaker 2>sell the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there have to be some weird work </v>

2948
02:27:28.371 --> 02:27:29.204
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have to be like someone have to come to </v>

2949
02:27:33.290 --> 02:27:34.670
<v Speaker 2>one of my dinner parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have.</v>

2950
02:27:34.730 --> 02:27:35.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2951
02:27:35.781 --> 02:27:38.600
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would like it if there was a place</v>

2952
02:27:38.601 --> 02:27:41.750
<v Speaker 2>where the general public could </v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in it,</v>

2953
02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:43.003
<v Speaker 2>I think they'd get a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding and like I put up these </v>

2954
02:27:45.171 --> 02:27:48.110
<v Speaker 2>posts all the time of elk that I cook </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people like,</v>

2955
02:27:48.111 --> 02:27:49.430
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to eat some of that.</v>

2956
02:27:49.490 --> 02:27:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you eat that?</v>

2957
02:27:51.890 --> 02:27:53.480
<v Speaker 2>You got to go get one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2958
02:27:53.530 --> 02:27:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the only way you can eat that.</v>

2959
02:27:55.210 --> 02:27:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can buy.</v>

2960
02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:57.141
<v Speaker 2>Come to my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2961
02:27:57.141 --> 02:27:59.090
<v Speaker 2>you can go and buy the farm raised </v>
<v Speaker 2>version,</v>

2962
02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but then that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2963
02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Good luck getting a farm raised </v>
<v Speaker 2>blueberry,</v>

2964
02:28:05.511 --> 02:28:06.470
<v Speaker 2>black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2965
02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that case,</v>

2966
02:28:07.671 --> 02:28:08.504
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2967
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:09.950
<v Speaker 2>you could buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it's,</v>

2968
02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:12.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other conversation around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the captive service industry.</v>

2969
02:28:12.501 --> 02:28:13.460
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy,</v>

2970
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.910
<v Speaker 2>you can buy elk that are raised on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranch environment.</v>

2971
02:28:16.911 --> 02:28:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2972
02:28:17.901 --> 02:28:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean as long as you're getting it from</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand,</v>

2973
02:28:19.701 --> 02:28:20.534
<v Speaker 2>you're not dealing with cwd in lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other issues that they're dealing </v>

2974
02:28:22.431 --> 02:28:23.450
<v Speaker 2>with in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2975
02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:24.071
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2976
02:28:24.071 --> 02:28:25.610
<v Speaker 4>but I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2977
02:28:25.650 --> 02:28:30.610
<v Speaker 4>those places are tested in herds that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have cwd Nmr destroyed.</v>

2978
02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:32.470
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2979
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:34.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>

2980
02:28:34.470 --> 02:28:35.303
<v Speaker 2>Well the whole New Zealand thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an interesting thing that you </v>

2981
02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:39.290
<v Speaker 2>brought up on your podcast recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2982
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.273
<v Speaker 2>how New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been talks about actual </v>

2983
02:28:42.441 --> 02:28:46.220
<v Speaker 2>eradication and one of the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hunters always use is,</v>

2984
02:28:46.221 --> 02:28:47.870
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're controlling the population.</v>

2985
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:49.930
<v Speaker 2>This is a good service that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>providing.</v>

2986
02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:51.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the government comes along and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2987
02:28:51.711 --> 02:28:53.900
<v Speaker 2>well how about we take care of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's like,</v>

2988
02:28:53.901 --> 02:28:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well not so fast.</v>

2989
02:28:56.690 --> 02:29:00.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a that takes place in Australia and</v>

2990
02:29:00.931 --> 02:29:01.764
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand where they have these like </v>
<v Speaker 4>thriving very robust populations of non </v>

2991
02:29:05.821 --> 02:29:09.000
<v Speaker 4>native wildlife and the government has </v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

2992
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.863
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has always and does now do a lot of </v>

2993
02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:15.570
<v Speaker 4>calling of these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have predators,</v>

2994
02:29:15.630 --> 02:29:18.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have like extremely,</v>

2995
02:29:18.470 --> 02:29:19.303
<v Speaker 4>like they're very fecund,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely high reproductive rates and </v>

2996
02:29:21.361 --> 02:29:23.730
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government is actively engaged,</v>

2997
02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:24.733
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the clock gunning wildlife from </v>

2998
02:29:28.591 --> 02:29:29.424
<v Speaker 4>helicopters shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just letting it run and shoot and leave </v>

2999
02:29:31.471 --> 02:29:33.360
<v Speaker 4>it to rot because you have to because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying.</v>

3000
02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:34.813
<v Speaker 4>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they do that because they're trying </v>

3001
02:29:36.151 --> 02:29:36.984
<v Speaker 4>to protect certain ecosystems and keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of native plant species from </v>

3002
02:29:45.061 --> 02:29:48.150
<v Speaker 4>going extinct and fragile environments </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all kinds of reasons.</v>

3003
02:29:48.190 --> 02:29:49.500
<v Speaker 4>Like said there's no death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3004
02:29:49.501 --> 02:29:50.820
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no credit.</v>

3005
02:29:50.850 --> 02:29:52.830
<v Speaker 4>There's no Predator control on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is huge.</v>

3006
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:54.043
<v Speaker 4>And in a lot of places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just completely inadequate amount of </v>

3007
02:29:56.311 --> 02:29:59.640
<v Speaker 4>hunting and a thing that hunters have </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes been able to say in Australia.</v>

3008
02:29:59.650 --> 02:30:04.380
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand as they've been in a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>too with an a in a culture where,</v>

3009
02:30:04.650 --> 02:30:05.483
<v Speaker 4>particularly in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a culture that seems to be not as </v>

3010
02:30:07.351 --> 02:30:09.030
<v Speaker 4>friendly toward hunters as they are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

3011
02:30:09.870 --> 02:30:10.561
<v Speaker 4>You're able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3012
02:30:10.561 --> 02:30:12.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're participating in wildlife control.</v>

3013
02:30:13.410 --> 02:30:17.200
<v Speaker 4>And then later when people come up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they talk about,</v>

3014
02:30:17.201 --> 02:30:17.551
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3015
02:30:17.551 --> 02:30:18.384
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get serious about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to really actively with </v>

3016
02:30:22.771 --> 02:30:25.650
<v Speaker 4>a goal of like totally eliminating these</v>
<v Speaker 4>species.</v>

3017
02:30:26.370 --> 02:30:30.280
<v Speaker 4>People are justifiably made uneasy about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it because it's a,</v>

3018
02:30:30.281 --> 02:30:31.114
<v Speaker 4>it's a thing that they've come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate and rely on in a resource </v>

3019
02:30:33.781 --> 02:30:34.980
<v Speaker 4>that they want to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now they're like,</v>

3020
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.940
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

3021
02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill them all.</v>

3022
02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I do like them being here and it winds </v>
<v Speaker 4>up putting you in this weird.</v>

3023
02:30:41.221 --> 02:30:46.221
<v Speaker 4>Like it winds up putting you in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a weird rhetorical position.</v>

3024
02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:48.780
<v Speaker 4>But I understand where they're coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>from because if,</v>

3025
02:30:48.781 --> 02:30:49.614
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could live there and you could </v>

3026
02:30:50.490 --> 02:30:51.323
<v Speaker 4>agree that we're going to have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>small number of them on the landscape </v>

3027
02:30:53.341 --> 02:30:55.110
<v Speaker 4>and then we're going to use those and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to hunt those.</v>

3028
02:30:55.111 --> 02:30:56.320
<v Speaker 4>And eat those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3029
02:30:56.490 --> 02:30:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone said,</v>

3030
02:30:58.261 --> 02:30:59.220
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gone now,</v>

3031
02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:00.460
<v Speaker 4>I would be bummed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:01.860
<v Speaker 4>I Hunt Turkeys that I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>

3033
02:31:01.861 --> 02:31:04.500
<v Speaker 4>We had turkeys in 39 states at the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>of European contact.</v>

3034
02:31:04.501 --> 02:31:08.340
<v Speaker 4>We have turkeys and for United States </v>
<v Speaker 4>now I hunt Turkeys and a lot of those 10</v>

3035
02:31:08.341 --> 02:31:12.810
<v Speaker 4>states that didn't historically have </v>
<v Speaker 4>turkeys and that do now.</v>

3036
02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:13.793
<v Speaker 4>And I generally have a perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to preserve native wildlife and </v>

3037
02:31:16.081 --> 02:31:16.914
<v Speaker 4>trying to control non natives because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to wind up with sort of a </v>

3038
02:31:19.330 --> 02:31:20.163
<v Speaker 4>like monolithic wildlife pattern or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same super resilient adaptive species </v>

3039
02:31:24.091 --> 02:31:24.924
<v Speaker 4>such as Canada geese and rats and white </v>
<v Speaker 4>tail deer take over the entire country </v>

3040
02:31:28.470 --> 02:31:29.290
<v Speaker 4>and pigs.</v>

3041
02:31:29.290 --> 02:31:30.360
<v Speaker 4>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

3042
02:31:30.361 --> 02:31:32.760
<v Speaker 4>I want like the variety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm generally like,</v>

3043
02:31:32.850 --> 02:31:37.740
<v Speaker 4>antagonistic toward non natives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if someone came and said I'm okay,</v>

3044
02:31:37.741 --> 02:31:38.574
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to actually go in and kill </v>

3045
02:31:40.111 --> 02:31:40.944
<v Speaker 4>off all the turkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those 10 states that historically </v>

3046
02:31:42.751 --> 02:31:45.470
<v Speaker 4>didn't have turkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say like how,</v>

3047
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:46.343
<v Speaker 4>you know really because I've kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>grown to really like those turkeys and </v>

3048
02:31:50.671 --> 02:31:52.560
<v Speaker 4>they're not really causing a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3049
02:31:52.561 --> 02:31:54.100
<v Speaker 4>And I think that some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3050
02:31:54.101 --> 02:31:56.430
<v Speaker 4>if the New Zealand hunter and Australian</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunter,</v>

3051
02:31:57.140 --> 02:31:59.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anyone's arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there should be no control,</v>

3052
02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:02.070
<v Speaker 4>but I think that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's find a balance.</v>

3053
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.970
<v Speaker 4>I think we can find a balance with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some availability animals on the</v>

3054
02:32:05.971 --> 02:32:08.430
<v Speaker 4>landscape since they've been here since </v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of our,</v>

3055
02:32:08.730 --> 02:32:10.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience on this continent.</v>

3056
02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's some availability of animals,</v>

3057
02:32:13.801 --> 02:32:15.570
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a reasonable compromise here.</v>

3058
02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:18.180
<v Speaker 4>Well that was one of the discussions as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well about Hawaii,</v>

3059
02:32:18.270 --> 02:32:19.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3060
02:32:19.111 --> 02:32:21.600
<v Speaker 4>and some of the Hawaiian islands </v>
<v Speaker 4>eradicating the pigs.</v>

3061
02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:24.270
<v Speaker 4>And then the Hawaiians were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3062
02:32:24.540 --> 02:32:26.400
<v Speaker 4>they've been here as long as us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3063
02:32:26.401 --> 02:32:29.790
<v Speaker 4>we've both been here that our ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been here 1100 years.</v>

3064
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:33.630
<v Speaker 4>They brought the pig with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How am I a native Hawaiian?</v>

3065
02:32:34.330 --> 02:32:36.150
<v Speaker 4>And the pig has the go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>

3066
02:32:36.151 --> 02:32:37.280
<v Speaker 4>maybe you people ought to go.</v>

3067
02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:42.690
<v Speaker 4>I always like again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3068
02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:47.720
<v Speaker 4>I always instinctively when I hear stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>I instinctively lean in on.</v>

3069
02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:51.840
<v Speaker 4>I instinctively lean in from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective of,</v>

3070
02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:53.513
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instinctively lean in from the </v>

3071
02:32:54.061 --> 02:32:57.240
<v Speaker 4>perspective of the hunter and Angler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3072
02:32:57.241 --> 02:32:58.160
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3073
02:32:58.220 --> 02:32:59.053
<v Speaker 4>and I love all these little debates and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're all really helpful </v>

3074
02:33:03.631 --> 02:33:05.430
<v Speaker 4>and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3075
02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:06.773
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I can recognize their pain </v>

3076
02:33:08.430 --> 02:33:11.670
<v Speaker 4>and that can also look far away and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and laugh at the absurdity of it.</v>

3077
02:33:11.671 --> 02:33:12.504
<v Speaker 4>Like I even had a guy write me from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia and say this is a real bummer </v>

3078
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:20.030
<v Speaker 4>because it exposes us to the thing where</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to say like,</v>

3079
02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:21.181
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3080
02:33:21.181 --> 02:33:22.014
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't really just doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to help the ecosystem by </v>

3081
02:33:24.781 --> 02:33:27.660
<v Speaker 4>eliminating non natives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3082
02:33:27.690 --> 02:33:28.523
<v Speaker 4>I actually like having someone around </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I just got to come out and say </v>

3083
02:33:30.541 --> 02:33:31.380
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a bummer.</v>

3084
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:34.553
<v Speaker 4>I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do wish there was some sort of </v>

3085
02:33:35.791 --> 02:33:39.630
<v Speaker 4>a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there would be a great place for</v>

3086
02:33:39.631 --> 02:33:43.230
<v Speaker 4>people to get a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to do that though,</v>

3087
02:33:43.231 --> 02:33:43.891
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3088
02:33:43.891 --> 02:33:45.660
<v Speaker 4>but I know there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3089
02:33:45.661 --> 02:33:46.494
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not for all the things that you're </v>

3090
02:33:47.041 --> 02:33:49.740
<v Speaker 4>talking about now and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't look too,</v>

3091
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:51.063
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is talk of a lot of people are </v>

3092
02:33:54.811 --> 02:33:57.230
<v Speaker 4>looking to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

3093
02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:00.480
<v Speaker 4>are pushing for this idea that in areas </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have too many white tail deer,</v>

3094
02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:04.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people who are really pushing to</v>

3095
02:34:04.561 --> 02:34:05.394
<v Speaker 4>reopen up the sale of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of wild harvested dear as a solution to </v>

3096
02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:12.030
<v Speaker 4>dear overpopulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3097
02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:13.073
<v Speaker 4>but for me from the perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from my perspective and from the damage </v>

3098
02:34:16.921 --> 02:34:20.110
<v Speaker 4>that was caused by unregulated wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughter,</v>

3099
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:22.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very,</v>

3100
02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:23.403
<v Speaker 4>very uneasy with it and I do not picture</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself ever coming around and supported </v>

3101
02:34:27.821 --> 02:34:30.090
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we would start marketing </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3102
02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:33.130
<v Speaker 4>that we would start marketing wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>cervids</v>

3103
02:34:33.370 --> 02:34:34.203
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3104
02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:35.043
<v Speaker 2>And I think that just the sheer </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of fuckery and people </v>

3105
02:34:41.231 --> 02:34:43.880
<v Speaker 2>shooting them and coaching them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling them and it's just,</v>

3106
02:34:44.670 --> 02:34:45.650
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just,</v>

3107
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:48.090
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would increase the commodification of</v>

3108
02:34:48.091 --> 02:34:49.050
<v Speaker 4>wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3109
02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:49.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3110
02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:50.693
<v Speaker 4>and that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's something that I'm also just </v>

3111
02:34:54.990 --> 02:34:55.823
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable with in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the commodification of wildlife and I </v>

3112
02:34:57.841 --> 02:35:01.860
<v Speaker 4>think about resource availability for </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters.</v>

3113
02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:02.933
<v Speaker 4>And I think that a lot of people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy access to certain areas now to go </v>

3114
02:35:06.631 --> 02:35:07.464
<v Speaker 4>hunting to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like hunt for themselves and their </v>

3115
02:35:09.301 --> 02:35:10.134
<v Speaker 4>family that the minute you made it be </v>
<v Speaker 4>that those deer had a dollar value </v>

3116
02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:15.533
<v Speaker 4>attached to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'll be a lot less opportunity for </v>

3117
02:35:18.511 --> 02:35:19.344
<v Speaker 4>people who choose to hunt to feed </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves because it will all of a </v>

3118
02:35:23.011 --> 02:35:26.190
<v Speaker 4>sudden be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I let you come in or allow you</v>

3119
02:35:26.191 --> 02:35:27.024
<v Speaker 4>to come in and use a resource when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>just going to do my best now to collect </v>

3120
02:35:30.331 --> 02:35:32.820
<v Speaker 4>it up and sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3121
02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:36.600
<v Speaker 4>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for aesthetic reasons,</v>

3122
02:35:36.930 --> 02:35:40.530
<v Speaker 4>for what it would mean for hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for our,</v>

3123
02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:41.393
<v Speaker 4>our perception of our relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>our resources that I'm extremely </v>

3124
02:35:45.211 --> 02:35:46.044
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable with the ice cube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an idea that keeps popping up </v>

3125
02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:51.720
<v Speaker 4>because we have in some areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3126
02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:52.530
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I usually,</v>

3127
02:35:52.530 --> 02:35:54.570
<v Speaker 4>I hate to say that I hate top of ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too many deer.</v>

3128
02:35:54.571 --> 02:35:55.404
<v Speaker 4>There's too much this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much debt because like by WHO's </v>

3129
02:35:56.400 --> 02:35:58.320
<v Speaker 4>measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in some areas we really do,</v>

3130
02:35:58.770 --> 02:36:00.360
<v Speaker 4>especially when you start getting into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3131
02:36:00.410 --> 02:36:03.390
<v Speaker 4>to issues like lyme disease prevalence </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ticks.</v>

3132
02:36:03.410 --> 02:36:04.243
<v Speaker 4>And starvation and then just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility of other disease outbreaks </v>

3133
02:36:07.501 --> 02:36:09.210
<v Speaker 4>and the spread of certain wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>

3134
02:36:09.211 --> 02:36:12.180
<v Speaker 4>There's some areas that like by any </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable measurement.</v>

3135
02:36:12.181 --> 02:36:13.020
<v Speaker 4>We have too many deer.</v>

3136
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3137
02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:17.720
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already 1:00.</v>

3138
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how crazy is that?</v>

3139
02:36:20.330 --> 02:36:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Time flies in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your podcast is awesome.</v>

3140
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:27.110
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad to talk to you to doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and every chance I get,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

3143
02:36:31.970 --> 02:36:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I really do appreciate that you do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's,</v>

3144
02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:37.310
<v Speaker 2>it's my favorite podcast to recommend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that want,</v>

3145
02:36:37.370 --> 02:36:42.370
<v Speaker 2>if I want them to get an understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hunting without even watching it.</v>

3146
02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Just listening to you talk about because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has.</v>

3147
02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:49.610
<v Speaker 2>He have so many guests on where he might</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even be talking about hunting.</v>

3148
02:36:49.611 --> 02:36:52.700
<v Speaker 2>You might be talking about biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be talking about history.</v>

3149
02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:54.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

3153
02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:01.040

<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate it and I'm glad you talked </v>

3155
02:37:03.891 --> 02:37:07.700
<v Speaker 4>me to doing it has been a in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the things I do,</v>

3156
02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:13.720
<v Speaker 4>the TV writing is the thing that I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it the,</v>

3157
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:18.260
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot of things I enjoy having </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it more.</v>

3158
02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:19.243
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that I enjoy actually </v>

3159
02:37:20.811 --> 02:37:21.644
<v Speaker 4>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm deciding like a smile on my face </v>

3160
02:37:23.391 --> 02:37:24.720
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What year is such a great</v>

3161
02:37:24.780 --> 02:37:25.710
<v Speaker 5>talker?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3162
02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:28.980
<v Speaker 5>remember the first time you did my </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast even before mediator,</v>

3163
02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:30.690
<v Speaker 5>when you were just coming off of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wild.</v>

3164
02:37:30.691 --> 02:37:31.660
<v Speaker 5>Within.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

3165
02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:32.710
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3166
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:34.103
<v Speaker 5>and I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why does this guy have a fucking </v>

3167
02:37:35.851 --> 02:37:37.830
<v Speaker 5>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is how many years ago,</v>

3168
02:37:37.831 --> 02:37:39.180
<v Speaker 5>seven years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3169
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:41.600
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the first time I ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 4>the word podcast?</v>

3170
02:37:41.601 --> 02:37:42.710
<v Speaker 4>This is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is embarrassing.</v>

3171
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:43.663
<v Speaker 4>The first time I ever heard the word </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast was Helen Cho telling me that I </v>

3172
02:37:47.691 --> 02:37:50.420
<v Speaker 4>should go on Joe Rogan's podcast and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know what it meant.</v>

3173
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:52.650
<v Speaker 4>That's how early you were into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

3174
02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:56.190
<v Speaker 4>into this shit before I ever heard the </v>
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>

3175
02:37:56.250 --> 02:37:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Live near squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

3231
02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Very uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squirrel eaten,</v>

3232
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:26.480
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3233
02:40:26.490 --> 02:40:27.323
<v Speaker 1>and you know in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that got the disease means girl </v>

3234
02:40:29.661 --> 02:40:30.494
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3235
02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to do with scroll brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

3236
02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:34.340
<v Speaker 1>The article I sent you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:35.280
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he.</v>

3238
02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sent me that article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3239
02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:40.080
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no demonstrable correlations.</v>

3240
02:40:40.081 --> 02:40:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 peep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 Americans a year,</v>

3241
02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind up with that form of crumps felt 30</v>

3242
02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:48.473
<v Speaker 1>Americans wind up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just happens to be this dude's </v>

3243
02:40:50.271 --> 02:40:53.190
<v Speaker 1>sometime in his past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in some sort of.</v>

3244
02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:57.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a are prion disease and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing Hamza people,</v>

3245
02:40:57.661 --> 02:40:58.494
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the correlation between his </v>

3246
02:41:02.341 --> 02:41:05.010
<v Speaker 1>diet and what happened to him was </v>
<v Speaker 1>implied.</v>

3247
02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Implied put possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go read up on it,</v>

3248
02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:13.810
<v Speaker 1>it now seems like people are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>

3249
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:18.420
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no obvious relationship here.</v>

3250
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:19.583
<v Speaker 1>No obvious relationship between eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrel brains and getting a prion </v>

3251
02:41:22.111 --> 02:41:22.944
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3252
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:23.783
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people that get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing that haven't been eating </v>

3253
02:41:26.641 --> 02:41:27.590
<v Speaker 1>squirrel brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3254
02:41:28.410 --> 02:41:29.243
<v Speaker 1>So just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just looking at the unusual </v>

3255
02:41:30.151 --> 02:41:32.730
<v Speaker 1>aspects of his diet and pointing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3256
02:41:33.090 --> 02:41:34.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3257
02:41:34.711 --> 02:41:35.544
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the article got a lot more love when it </v>

3258
02:41:36.871 --> 02:41:37.704
<v Speaker 1>was at some squirrel hundred died from </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating squirrel brains than it did when </v>

3259
02:41:40.021 --> 02:41:42.270
<v Speaker 1>the later subsequent pieces came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wherever it is like,</v>

3260
02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:44.670
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3261
02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:49.380
<v Speaker 1>we don't really like girls are cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3262
02:41:49.980 --> 02:41:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I ate some squirrel with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the thing,</v>

3263
02:41:52.110 --> 02:41:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you've very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a person in the world.</v>

3264
02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:58.200
<v Speaker 1>You know what we have in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cookbook is we have um,</v>

3265
02:41:58.290 --> 02:42:00.300
<v Speaker 1>how to do buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buffalo wings,</v>

3266
02:42:00.301 --> 02:42:01.134
<v Speaker 1>hot wings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do hot legs with squirrels were </v>

3267
02:42:04.090 --> 02:42:05.550
<v Speaker 1>unit the Arni.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3268
02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:06.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just like you making rules on </v>

3269
02:42:07.801 --> 02:42:10.290
<v Speaker 1>shooting squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3270
02:42:10.291 --> 02:42:12.000
<v Speaker 1>they vary state by state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3271
02:42:12.001 --> 02:42:13.620
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in New York,</v>

3272
02:42:13.650 --> 02:42:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a season,</v>

3273
02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3274
02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:19.290
<v Speaker 1>squirrel season in most states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's either,</v>

3275
02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:20.193
<v Speaker 1>it's either one or the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either there's a season in a bag limit </v>

3276
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:26.700
<v Speaker 1>or the treated as a non game species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here in California there's a squirrel</v>

3277
02:42:26.701 --> 02:42:28.170
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bag of,</v>

3278
02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's for a day for four </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrels a day.</v>

3279
02:42:30.810 --> 02:42:32.070
<v Speaker 1>When's the season?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3280
02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:34.440
<v Speaker 1>seasons usually run from sometime in </v>
<v Speaker 1>August,</v>

3281
02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:38.160
<v Speaker 1>in September into winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into January,</v>

3282
02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:40.890
<v Speaker 1>February.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where I grew up September 15th,</v>

3283
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:45.330
<v Speaker 1>September eighth to January,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27th.</v>

3284
02:42:45.390 --> 02:42:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falconry only Jesus crest.</v>

3285
02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:50.300
<v Speaker 1>So archery and foul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foul Kinnari.</v>

3286
02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So August four for archery and falconry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falconry falcons.</v>

3287
02:42:54.511 --> 02:42:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to go to the tree squirrels</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone map,</v>

3288
02:42:56.730 --> 02:42:57.563
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in your estate Jack rabbits are </v>

3289
02:42:58.891 --> 02:42:59.790
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

3290
02:42:59.791 --> 02:43:02.400
<v Speaker 1>your State Jack Rabbits are managed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>non gaming.</v>

3291
02:43:02.401 --> 02:43:05.010
<v Speaker 1>There's no bag limit in open year round </v>
<v Speaker 1>snow,</v>

3292
02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:05.873
<v Speaker 1>like a cottontails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No issues have different management and </v>

3293
02:43:08.541 --> 02:43:10.530
<v Speaker 1>a lot of states pine squirrels are red </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrels,</v>

3294
02:43:10.531 --> 02:43:11.830
<v Speaker 1>which aren't commonly hunted,</v>

3295
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.010
<v Speaker 4>but they're more regarded as like things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that get into people's houses,</v>

3296
02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:18.790
<v Speaker 4>but they're not 100 for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be listed as a non game species,</v>

3297
02:43:18.791 --> 02:43:21.550
<v Speaker 4>but Fox girls and gray squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>v as game species.</v>

3298
02:43:21.551 --> 02:43:22.384
<v Speaker 4>So in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the bag limit when I was living </v>

3299
02:43:24.221 --> 02:43:28.540
<v Speaker 4>there was six per day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a possession limit of two bag limits.</v>

3300
02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Did you shoot any squirrels in Brooklyn </v>
<v Speaker 4>and need them?</v>

3301
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:31.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3302
02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:32.713
<v Speaker 4>when I caught some there and ate them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would hunt out of the city at my </v>

3303
02:43:36.851 --> 02:43:41.770
<v Speaker 4>buddy's farm and some other places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So where I was born in Michigan,</v>

3304
02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:42.813
<v Speaker 4>the squirrel season was September 15th </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it ran into a van to January five </v>

3305
02:43:47.801 --> 02:43:50.260
<v Speaker 4>squirrels a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Possession limit of two bag limits.</v>

3306
02:43:50.530 --> 02:43:55.120
<v Speaker 4>The state I live in now treat squirrels </v>
<v Speaker 4>as non game species.</v>

3307
02:43:55.121 --> 02:43:55.954
<v Speaker 4>So there's no close season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no bag limit because there's not really </v>

3308
02:43:58.931 --> 02:44:00.370
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a,</v>

3309
02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:03.340
<v Speaker 4>they're not widely distributed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not commonly haunted.</v>

3310
02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:07.000
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3311
02:44:07.170 --> 02:44:08.003
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most places they have them and they're </v>

3312
02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:10.703
<v Speaker 4>managed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you go out and buy a small game </v>

3313
02:44:11.551 --> 02:44:14.160
<v Speaker 4>license for 12 bucks or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get your hunter safety,</v>

3314
02:44:14.610 --> 02:44:15.443
<v Speaker 4>get yourself a 22 or a or a shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can become a squirrel man or a </v>

3315

<v Speaker 4>squirrel lady like you buddy.</v>

3317
02:44:25.231 --> 02:44:26.064
<v Speaker 4>This guy blows a horn in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 4>before every hunt to alert the animals </v>

02:44:31.381 --> 02:44:32.530
<v Speaker 4>that he's coming.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3320
02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:38.690
<v Speaker 4>He carries a cow horn around the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Jewish synagogue,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

3326
02:44:49.770 --> 02:44:51.320
<v Speaker 4>Called a chauffeur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you've blown the rams.</v>

3327
02:44:51.350 --> 02:44:52.880
<v Speaker 4>They below a Ram's horn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

3328
02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:54.530
<v Speaker 4>it's not a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cow harm.</v>

3329
02:44:54.531 --> 02:44:55.650
<v Speaker 4>It's ran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3330
02:44:55.651 --> 02:44:57.860
<v Speaker 4>the end of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3331
02:44:57.861 --> 02:45:00.160
<v Speaker 4>in the end have no country for old men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3332
02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:02.893
<v Speaker 4>Have we talked about this before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talks about his father riding out </v>

3333
02:45:06.561 --> 02:45:08.870
<v Speaker 4>ahead of him or the Horn of fire</v>

3334
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:12.320
<v Speaker 4>in the end when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he relates the dream.</v>

3335
02:45:12.321 --> 02:45:13.154
<v Speaker 4>It's in the book and it's in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the Tommy Lee Jones characters </v>

3336
02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:16.513
<v Speaker 4>describing a dream in which they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>riding through a snow storm and his </v>

3337
02:45:18.711 --> 02:45:19.544
<v Speaker 4>father rides ahead with a Horn of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was wondering how many people </v>

3338
02:45:22.251 --> 02:45:26.960
<v Speaker 4>heard that and had no idea what he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

3339
02:45:27.470 --> 02:45:32.120
<v Speaker 4>But what a common practice used to be as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take a horn buffalo horn,</v>

3340
02:45:32.121 --> 02:45:34.040
<v Speaker 4>cow horn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's hollow because,</v>

3341
02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:35.273
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it grows off of protrusion of the skull </v>

3342
02:45:37.430 --> 02:45:38.263
<v Speaker 4>called the horn core.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you pop the horn off and it's </v>

3343
02:45:40.161 --> 02:45:42.230
<v Speaker 4>hollow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what people will do is when you left</v>

3344
02:45:42.231 --> 02:45:46.790
<v Speaker 4>your campfire in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would fill that horn with embers and</v>

3345
02:45:46.791 --> 02:45:47.624
<v Speaker 4>cap it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there'd be a little pinhole in it </v>

3346
02:45:49.250 --> 02:45:52.130
<v Speaker 4>just to let a little bit of air and air </v>
<v Speaker 4>so it could continue to smolder.</v>

3347
02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:54.950
<v Speaker 4>And you carry that Horn all day full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>embers.</v>

3348
02:45:55.310 --> 02:45:59.540
<v Speaker 4>And at night to start a new fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would dump the horn out and rekindle</v>

3349
02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:02.150
<v Speaker 4>your fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when he talks about his father riding</v>

3350
02:46:02.151 --> 02:46:06.740
<v Speaker 4>out ahead of them with a Horn of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that's meant to say is that he knew</v>

3351
02:46:06.741 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 4>his father will be waiting out ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>with</v>

3352
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.990
<v Speaker 1>a fire burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3353
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Kevin Murray just blows it.</v>

3354
02:46:14.361 --> 02:46:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Let squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noise worries.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming,</v>
