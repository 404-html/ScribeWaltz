1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing you keep saying,</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>aim low enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a low enough bar.</v>

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Why do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you mean that?</v>

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you've got a kid and you want</v>

5
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>the kid to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't set them a bar that's so high</v>

6
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>that it's impossible for them to attain</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>You take a look at the kid and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

8
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid's got this range of skill.</v>

9
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's a challenge we can throw at him</v>
<v Speaker 1>or her that exceeds their current level</v>

10
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>of skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but gives them a reasonable probability</v>

11
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so like I'm saying it tongue and</v>

12
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>cheek to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's like,</v>

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>but if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm doing it as an aid to humility.</v>

14
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to start improving my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

16
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Someone might say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>

17
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not aiming low enough.</v>

18
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>There's something you could do that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are regarding as trivial that,</v>

19
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>that you could do that you would do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would result in an actual improvement,</v>

20
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a big enough improvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

21
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>So you won't lower yourself enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the opportunity.</v>

22
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Incremental steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

23
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>And so this is also what is achieved</v>
<v Speaker 1>through exercise.</v>

24
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Well what do you do when you go and lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>weights?</v>

26
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a bench press before</v>

27
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't put 400 pounds on the damn bar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dropped and dropped the bar through</v>

28
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>your skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

30
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>when I started working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

31
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was weighed about 130 pounds and I was</v>

32
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>six foot one was a thin kid and I smoked</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

33
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in good shape.</v>

34
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in good physical shape and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the gym and it was bloody</v>

35
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>when people would come over and help me</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the goddamn weights,</v>

37
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>here's how you're supposed to use this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it was humiliating and maybe I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressing 65 pounds or something at that</v>

39
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>but what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lift up 150 pounds and</v>

41
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>injure myself right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

42
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I had to go in there and strip down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put my skinny God damn self in front of</v>

43
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>the mirror and think son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these monsters in the gym</v>

44
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>would be lifting weights for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm struggling to get 50 pounds off</v>

45
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough luck for me,</v>

46
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>but I could lift 50 pounds and it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long until I could lift 75 and</v>

47
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>how it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

49
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>And I never injured myself when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight lifting and the reason for that</v>

50
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>was I never pushed myself past where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew I could go and I pushed myself a</v>

51
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I gained 35 pounds of muscle in about</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years in university.</v>

53
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I kind of had to quit because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating so God damn much.</v>

54
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stand it seeming like six</v>
<v Speaker 1>meals a day.</v>

55
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>It was just taken up too much time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a humility in determining</v>

56
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>what it is that the wretched creature</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are can actually manage.</v>

57
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Aim Low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean don't aim and I don't</v>

58
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:29.451
<v Speaker 1>mean don't aim up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to accept the fact that you</v>

59
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>can set yourself a goal that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>attain and there's not going to be much</v>

60
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>glory in it to begin with because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in very good shape,</v>

61
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>the goal that you could they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>attain tomorrow isn't very glorious,</v>

62
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>but it it's a hell of a lot better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing and it beats the hell out of</v>

63
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>bitterness and it's way better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>blaming someone else.</v>

64
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>It's way less dangerous and you could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and what's cool about it,</v>

65
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a statement in the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>

66
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>it's called the matthew principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and economists use it to describe how</v>

67
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>the economy in the world works to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have everything more will be given</v>

68
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>from those who have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be taken.</v>

69
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's very pessimistic in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense because it means that as you</v>

70
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>start to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fail more and more rapidly,</v>

71
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that as you start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeed,</v>

72
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>you succeed more and more rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you take an incremental step and</v>

73
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you can lift 55 pounds instead of 52</v>

74
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>point five pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

75
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

76
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's one step on a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>journey and so it's,</v>

77
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>and it starts to compound on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a small step today means puts you in</v>

78
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>a position to take a slightly bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>step the next day,</v>

79
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>and then that puts you in a position to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a slightly bigger step the next</v>

80
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

81
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And you do that for two or three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

82
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.531
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to stride everyone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting in these older leagues or if</v>

83
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if golden boy,</v>

84
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>if that's your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do like these,</v>

85
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>this master league,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone fighting that lead better.</v>

86
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Pray to the MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's Vituro Balfour does not enter that</v>

87
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juice to the gills.</v>

88
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen lately?</v>

89

<v Speaker 1>dudes at the same time.</v>

94
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's like butter and Jelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a different roads bro.</v>

98
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Like some people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

99
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>don't do well with Roy to get all red</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

102
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>All Tans teeth get wider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing straight testosterone.</v>

103
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>He's not mean when he was on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

104
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>We know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know absolutely 100 percent of</v>

106
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>the people have cheated and taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids and got away with it.</v>

107
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

108
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in fighting,</v>

109
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>especially when the weigh ins were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only day you had a pee and there was no</v>

110
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>randoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't just come by.</v>

111
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:50.311
<v Speaker 1>We know for a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you watch someone who's just</v>

112
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:55.771
<v Speaker 1>doing testosterone and what else is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with human growth hormone and</v>

113
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>fucking gigantic now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

114
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I love it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you get there,</v>

115
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing like for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vittorio,</v>

116
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.620
<v Speaker 1>like something happens with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you,</v>

117
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>when they allowed him to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like during the rockhold fight and</v>

118
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>bisping fight dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body,</v>

119
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>he ate it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of a different thing.</v>

120
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>

121
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:22.591
<v Speaker 1>I was always a happy kid but not really</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was always confused about the</v>

122
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.610
<v Speaker 1>death of my father so I'd always have</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

123
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but I always had the Catholic faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was raised Catholic.</v>

124
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I always believed he wasn't having that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in that box from my mom did the</v>

125
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these the pain a little bit.</v>

126
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:43.621
<v Speaker 1>Then my mother's death was just fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that broke the central nervous</v>

127
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:50.371
<v Speaker 1>system belief system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that broke your belief in the world.</v>

128
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>How can there be a god that takes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mugger away from a child</v>

129
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.190

<v Speaker 1>Your head does not a good result.</v>

130
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.140

<v Speaker 1>So how I lashed out was by robin you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>rob you.</v>

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.151
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

146
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Number two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other issue I had is I lost a child.</v>

147
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I loved the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not ready for that child at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love that little girl with all my</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

149

<v Speaker 1>but I was not ready for her at all.</v>

150
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>My intentions are good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the result was not going to be well.</v>

151
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:06.101
<v Speaker 1>I was not ready and because I lost that</v>
<v Speaker 1>child and I'm a no contact with that</v>

152
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me a better father than I am</v>

153
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:11.660

<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understand me?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>

162
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Like to that vest story man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happened.</v>

163
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I would get using cocaine at thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put on these different vests.</v>

165
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 2>How many did you buy it again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

166
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I spent too much on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would probably say</v>

167
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.360
<v Speaker 2>the price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

168
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 2>One I had was probably about 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10.</v>

169
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.330
<v Speaker 2>90.</v>

170
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would get fucked up and put</v>

171
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 2>these vests on and put on sunglasses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not let them know like Buffalo Bill</v>

172
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at least party and by myself,</v>

173
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one time I was making a smoothie,</v>

174
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

175
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:09.434
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

176
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I got like a new unknown what kind of or</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

177
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.530

181
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

182
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 2>I thought I heard something outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

183
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of weird to even think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a blender going,</v>

184
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll leave out of my apartment to go</v>

185

<v Speaker 2>in the hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lock myself out with the blender going</v>

186
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coked up out of my brain.</v>

187
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to go to my landlord dude who</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives right down the hall and tell him</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who's the baseball player who also had</v>

232
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 2>drug problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like 13 years sober.</v>

233
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.860
<v Speaker 2>And so it was this weird moment where</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

234

<v Speaker 2>I thought I was kind of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then here's a man who like,</v>

235
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I'd always in my head maybe somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

236
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's like a cokehead within here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He is eloquent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put together,</v>

238
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:10.470
<v Speaker 2>successful in here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even talk.</v>

239
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.240
<v Speaker 2>And I'm with two men that I admire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

242
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:17.490

<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

243
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making choices.</v>

244
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some unevenness here,</v>

245
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what did you do after the 2012</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so yeah.</v>

248
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.360
<v Speaker 2>So I've been in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then since then it has helped me out,</v>
