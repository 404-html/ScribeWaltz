1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down Twain,</v>

2
00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an orange watch.</v>

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>You are a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the orange thing?</v>

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I've always been attracted to orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Colorado,</v>

5
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>so the broncos orange is always been</v>
<v Speaker 1>around me.</v>

6
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the favorite uninjured hurdle at the</v>

7
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>time was Michelangelo with the orange</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a really no other fighters or</v>

8
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're using orange,</v>

9
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to make sure I did my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>That is your own point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>

11
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like I absolutely love</v>

12
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I see some orange at the store or a</v>

13
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>crowd of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what warrant.</v>

14
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:29.851
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

15
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I just goes boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

16
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>If there's a fruit bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an orange right next to a</v>

17
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orange grabbed the orange.</v>

18
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it like being around this guy?</v>

19
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's intense,</v>

20
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I limit,</v>

21
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life's full of energy.</v>

22
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be calm around him because</v>

23
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>he's got enough energy for both of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

24
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

25
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a mad man.</v>

26
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>We worked out today and he's in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of like training.</v>

27
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>He just gets excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hit this past year.</v>

28
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever have to do road work</v>

29
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>because of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

30
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean we hit Mitts for so long and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard that I'm in too good a shape</v>

31
00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

32
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the footwork drills and</v>

33
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really thought of that.</v>

34
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you probably don't have to do road</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

35
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I it'd be too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

36
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I do too much training as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'd started doing roadwork,</v>

37
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd overtrained myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

38
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you have to kind of regulate that,</v>

39
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.894
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

40
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard model that like a lot of</v>

41
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>fighters fall and roadwork is a big part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

42
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that with all the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do,</v>

43
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>if you did that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be too much.</v>

44
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>It'd be too many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many hours put into the day.</v>

45
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just too tired by the time I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

46
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Or I'd have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I could do it on the out of camp,</v>

47
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to keep my mind right and kind of</v>

48
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>get some zen going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But during campus too much I,</v>

49
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I train too much to be able to have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to run as well.</v>

50
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because everybody's got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different sort of way of doing it.</v>

51
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Like Jeremy Stevens was on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently and one of the things that he</v>

52
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>was saying is that he really ramped up</v>
<v Speaker 1>is running to the point where that,</v>

53
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying is that having like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this like long endurance base really</v>

54
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>helps him and fights because he knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he is always going to recover.</v>

55
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>You can always push further and harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

56
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>he seems like it kind of fighter that</v>
<v Speaker 1>does need to build on the cardio</v>

57
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel like each person's body is gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>react differently to training and I'm</v>

59
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>someone that has endless cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feels like when I'm fighting and</v>

60
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need to stay more,</v>

61
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>a little more fast twitch and I'm always</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting size on instead of losing it.</v>

62
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like Stevens has been trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drop weight and get smaller and it</v>

63
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>helped with his weight cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

64
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it helps with his weight cut her</v>

65
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Bra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think with him it's also like a</v>

66
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>mental thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants a break guys.</v>

67
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Like he's such an aggressive guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a big part of like it's</v>

68
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just being able to like have those</v>

69
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>extra gallons and the gas tank.</v>

70
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that's what,</v>

71
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to run because of my</v>

72
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So crazy though to like,</v>

73
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:38.844
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

74
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather hit mitts and be</v>

75
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too too aggressive of a person I</v>

76
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were talking before the podcast</v>

77
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>about our friend campaigns just ran 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles and we're like,</v>

78
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>that shit is not good for you to no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

79
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's not supposed to do that.</v>

80
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It might be good for his brain though</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's so fucking crazy.</v>

81
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs to know that he can do</v>

82
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>something like he ran for 78</v>

83
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I want to hunt with him.</v>

84
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know it's like my dad,</v>

85
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I grew up hunting,</v>

86
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 2>we'll go hike a hundred miles in a week</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>

87
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 2>go out the back country and have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>backpack and sleep out in the middle of</v>

88
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 2>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like that's how cameron</v>

89
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.511
<v Speaker 2>hanes would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 2>just as hard as possible just to just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

91
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Adam Green tree from Australia</v>

92
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 2>came over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flew over to America last week,</v>

93
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.920
<v Speaker 2>went to Montana and then hiked some</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy amount of miles into the</v>

94
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 2>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 2>camped out when in deeper and deeper</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he kept encountering wolves and</v>

96
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Grizzly bears camped out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot an elk.</v>

97
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.510
<v Speaker 2>And for the last four days has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>packing out this elk by himself.</v>

98
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four days.</v>

99
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 2>So if you've never shot an elk or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen an elk before,</v>

100
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 2>folks and elk could weigh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around 800 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably around 400 pounds of</v>

102
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>meat that he's packing out.</v>

103
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 2>So four days of a hundred pounds on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

104
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 2>When we are in your hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't carry it all.</v>

105
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 2>You got a quarter it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only say you hike five miles with</v>

106
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 2>some of your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to go back and get the rest of</v>

107
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:08.660
<v Speaker 2>the Elta height that five miles again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're hiking the same trail,</v>

108
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 2>a trail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.841
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

110
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 2>four times depending on how big Dell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you know when you're quartered</v>

111
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:13.691
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 2>And he's pretty sure he said he hiked 12</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

113
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 2>So that could easily be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many miles at high</v>
<v Speaker 2>altitude,</v>

115
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd imagine a puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's got a hundred pounds on his back</v>

116
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.100

<v Speaker 2>a friend of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hiked through the night to come and</v>

128
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.330

<v Speaker 2>on the third or fourth day.</v>

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got all these videos of him up</v>

130
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:03.320
<v Speaker 2>there in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an awesome picture.</v>

131
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

132
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 2>it's just so cool because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just out there survive.</v>

133
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking right now for folks at</v>

134
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 2>home listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at this tent that's</v>

135
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>covered in snow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grounds covered in snow and uh,</v>

136
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>this is where he's been living for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past week.</v>

137
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 2>And that is the high country because</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a public land,</v>

138
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>most countries don't or most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

139
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Most countries don't have the same sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of public land set up that we have in</v>

140
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can just go hike into the mountains</v>

141
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>and camp out and these national forests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

142
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:34.451
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

143
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took advantage of all that and he's up</v>

144
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

145
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 2>where's it savage Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

146
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

147
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is come to Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You buy a tag.</v>

149
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I think attack for an elk is 1000 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

150
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 2>he's up there with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pistol because there's bears up there.</v>

151
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 2>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

152
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his kill site,</v>

153
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 2>a bear came in on his kill site when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back.</v>

154
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>There was a grizzly there and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of grizzlies in Montana.</v>

155
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Mendez</v>

157
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>was just up in Alaska and got an awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mousse and a,</v>

158
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>his story's pretty cool too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

159
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>He got a real big moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then over the night and camp,</v>

160
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>a grizzly bear came in and tried to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>his moose off and took a big chunk out</v>

161
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:10.080
<v Speaker 1>of its neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>So it is his whole story of what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got going up there.</v>

163
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

164
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Went on an awesome hunt and she'll hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

165
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>So we're looking at Chad Mendez is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>says a 63 inch do it yourself.</v>

167
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Alaska Moose Hunt is now live on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel,</v>

168
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>63 inches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the width of the horns,</v>

169
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.120
<v Speaker 1>which is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

170
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.860
<v Speaker 1>That is an enormous animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if an elk is 800 pounds,</v>

171
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>that's probably like 1500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1600 pounds.</v>

172
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>That's an enormous animal.</v>

173
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And he goes through guided hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

174
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just guides.</v>

175
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He guides people.</v>

176
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.140
<v Speaker 2>That's his passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

177
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:48.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what he wants to transition to</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he's done fighting.</v>

178
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.420
<v Speaker 2>That's where his passions at and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely good at it.</v>

179
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:53.370
<v Speaker 2>So no reason not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

180
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a question.</v>

181
00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:58.170
<v Speaker 2>He got popped for some supplement thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the in a lot of people were</v>

182
00:06:58.171 --> 00:07:02.370
<v Speaker 2>getting popped for tainted supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you buy things in the store,</v>

183
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of supplements that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get like at any,</v>

184
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:08.320
<v Speaker 2>any nutrition store that have all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.940
<v Speaker 2>like if they're not steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're peptides.</v>

186
00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:15.000
<v Speaker 2>There are all these things that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your body produce more hormones</v>

187
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.700
<v Speaker 2>that are real legal by Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

188
00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:19.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got caught for that stuff apparently.</v>

189
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he got caught for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they proved it.</v>

190
00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:22.950
<v Speaker 2>That it was a supplement.</v>

191
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

192
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really asked them too much</v>

193
00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:26.490
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bummer.</v>

194
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this level you have to be made.</v>

195
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.050
<v Speaker 2>It would be mindful of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking into the body.</v>

196
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:33.390
<v Speaker 2>So especially with the new guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just part of following the</v>

197
00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't go in the Cajun.</v>

198
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I poked some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but go.</v>

199
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's so much going on with the</v>

200
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.990
<v Speaker 2>supplements now you have to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it in the research and</v>

201
00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:41.610
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking in your body.</v>

202
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I poke in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>febreeze over dooms eyeball?</v>

204
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even say anything in the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there for doom.</v>

205
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember seeing Verdomme Call</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hall.</v>

206
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.490

<v Speaker 2>the hand on his trainer like crazy.</v>

208
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without that fight there was cool.</v>

209
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:04.110
<v Speaker 2>It was a cool fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

210
00:08:04.111 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bomber to me to see Travis</v>

211
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:09.840
<v Speaker 2>fight like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I remember travis earlier in his</v>

212
00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:13.830
<v Speaker 2>career was just to look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is fucking insane.</v>

213
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Esther,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's hard to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

221
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.891
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>His finger has disappeared in the</v>

224
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 2>eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember him stopping or saying</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't remember either.</v>

226
00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Let's focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was a bad one earlier in the</v>

227
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.740
<v Speaker 2>night with Jimmy Rivera and a Uriah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That was a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jimmy Rivera after the fights that</v>

229
00:08:49.831 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he still couldn't see.</v>

230
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.770
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

231
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.970
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't tell what color things were</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of his right eye.</v>

232
00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking I blokes,</v>

233
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pride gloves,</v>

234
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the gloves.</v>

235
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of a car to turn there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that opened all the way.</v>

236
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:03.061
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

237
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:03.894
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>

239
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I obsessed about marshmallows to making</v>
<v Speaker 2>things better.</v>

240
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Someone's got to do something because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way things are going,</v>

241
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 2>we're just so many guys are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go so many guys getting damaged</v>

242
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 2>eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

243
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not worth it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like we're waiting for</v>

244
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 2>something terrible to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

245
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Like look at Michael Bisping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

246
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Bisping's came from a kick though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it might've come from</v>

247
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 2>vittores kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it that or was it in practice?</v>

248
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it was in practice?</v>

249
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I think he detached his retina a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

250
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's why it is the way it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

251
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I think he's heard it multiple times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of where it,</v>

252
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 2>because it's not completely fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they fixed it enough to where he</v>

253
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 2>can fight and then when he's done</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting they'll probably fix is I</v>

254
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 2>completed these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it seems like what they did is they</v>

255
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 2>stuck oil in his eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it,</v>

256
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.050
<v Speaker 2>but one of his eyeballs apparently has</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil in it that's protecting the retina.</v>

257
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's why one of his eyeballs is</v>
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

258
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.433
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

259
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering what was going on with</v>

260
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 2>designs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

261
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is black and one is his original</v>

262
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 2>ICO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm not sure what it is,</v>

263
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's very strange looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

264
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

265
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 2>he didn't even consider retiring.</v>

266
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.421
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

267
00:10:10.421 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick some oil in there.</v>

268
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's get going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't reckon do put an eyepatch on.</v>

269
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got To get back to the gym mate.</v>

270
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 2>He does push it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy comes to fight.</v>

271
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 2>He said Animal Michael Bisping is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middleweight champion of the world.</v>

272
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 2>And who saw that coming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

273
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.693
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

274
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I seen that opening and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

275
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 2>luke rockhold to instagram videos</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading up to the fight.</v>

276
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I seen the same thing his trainer saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

277
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was leading it back.</v>

278
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 2>He was telling me weeks before the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thinks he was doing,</v>

279
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 2>while he's hitting Mitts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping his right hand all the time</v>

280
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 2>with his left cross and kind of leaning</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and kind of shoulder roll and,</v>

281
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.810
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Duane called it out a couple of</v>

282
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.370
<v Speaker 2>weeks before the fight that he saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>openings.</v>

283
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:48.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't say he was gonna get knocked</v>

284
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 2>out with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he saw some openings there,</v>

285
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there,</v>

286
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty simple.</v>

287
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 2>We can see where the openings are on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one for sure.</v>

288
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember after bisbing caught him and</v>

289
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 2>his trainer point Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not quite sure what he said and</v>

290
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:00.790
<v Speaker 2>left him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was for sure saying like,</v>

291
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.441
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you,</v>

292
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I told you I like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

293
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:04.951
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

294
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:07.050
<v Speaker 2>He's a good boxing coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He understands the game.</v>

295
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I got respect for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

296
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's cool to see something you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained multiple times come out and</v>

297
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 2>actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when the fight and then the</v>

298
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:15.610
<v Speaker 2>title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

299
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>

300
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>That's rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And along the lines of like what we were</v>

301
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 2>talking about today when we were working</v>
<v Speaker 2>out is there's so much depth to this</v>

302
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many options and there's so</v>

303
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 2>many possibilities that to the outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>or people look at it,</v>

304
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>it looks brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that I poke and you're like,</v>

305
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sports should be illegal as much.</v>

306
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to a person who really understands</v>

307
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 2>and watches it and appreciates it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's so,</v>

308
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 2>it's like this crazy language that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to learn with all these different</v>

309
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 2>words and all these different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting together sentences.</v>

310
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 2>And I like to use the language analogy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'll give,</v>

311
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 2>you're talking to someone and they only</v>
<v Speaker 2>know a few words and want to yell at</v>

312
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're like some Sam Harris type</v>

313
00:11:56.111 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 2>dude who can just has an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>language and you're just so eloquent.</v>

314
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 2>He spin them up like a web and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really don't know what the fuck to</v>

315
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that also happens in a fight when a</v>

316
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.920
<v Speaker 2>guy has a very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real obvious game.</v>

317
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>He does a couple of things and he does</v>
<v Speaker 2>it well as long as you engage him in</v>

318
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 2>that same sort of simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious way.</v>

319
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 2>He's got a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you over flood,</v>

320
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne,</v>

321
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 2>this Duane was showing me this switch</v>
<v Speaker 2>series that he works on,</v>

322
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 2>which is really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

323
00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 2>really interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you sir.</v>

324
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things I noticed is while</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were demonstrated to me,</v>

325
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 2>because it's so unusual if forced my</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain to hiccup for a second ago.</v>

326
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

327
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.990
<v Speaker 2>And if that happens in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Foxville oh right.</v>

328
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% those little hiccups.</v>

329
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those little moments where your brain is</v>

330
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 2>overloaded because it's got to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just react because you're</v>

331
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 2>doing something unique</v>

332
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.970
<v Speaker 3>thinking inside the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get caught,</v>

333
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:52.470
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

334
00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:55.590
<v Speaker 3>you need to have a completely clear mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just kind of react to things.</v>

335
00:12:55.591 --> 00:12:57.840
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just been kind of having fun out</v>

336
00:12:57.841 --> 00:12:58.171
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

337
00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:00.360
<v Speaker 3>the more fun I have and the more loose I</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay,</v>

338
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.880
<v Speaker 3>the better I'm going to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I go in there with a game plan and</v>

339
00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:04.370
<v Speaker 3>thinking of what I want to throw in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to watch,</v>

340
00:13:04.371 --> 00:13:07.020
<v Speaker 3>watch out for what he's good at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's not good at,</v>

341
00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:08.790
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to be a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>slower.</v>

342
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

343
00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.490
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about your fight with</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominick Cruz that you seem so emotional</v>

344
00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:15.290
<v Speaker 2>like you want it to kill that dude like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>

345
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.240
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I definitely want to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it was so hot.</v>

346
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was obvious you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were head hunting as opposed to like</v>

347
00:13:23.691 --> 00:13:27.230
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I really enjoyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what your first and your second</v>

348
00:13:27.231 --> 00:13:29.930
<v Speaker 2>fight with Hanan Barao but your first</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with Hanan Barao was like,</v>

349
00:13:29.931 --> 00:13:32.840
<v Speaker 2>here you are fighting for the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

350
00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you're on a sparring session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were just so loose.</v>

351
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Like right away you can throw every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing and attention to what</v>

352
00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:41.870
<v Speaker 2>you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was like flowing and I was</v>

353
00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:44.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how well he's responding to the</v>

354
00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:45.690
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were having a great time out.</v>

355
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.953
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

356
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not thinking about it,</v>

357
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like you said with the Cruz thing,</v>

358
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:50.740
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to finish him.</v>

359
00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I want him to go out there and put a</v>
<v Speaker 3>point on it.</v>

360
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:53.190
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

361
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 3>things you learned from those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the small mistakes you learn</v>

362
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 3>from it and you change them up next time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

363
00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:59.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out there a little more level</v>

364
00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:00.440
<v Speaker 3>headed and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

365
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.170
<v Speaker 3>play his game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of like you were saying,</v>

366
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:02.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

367
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 3>he's a point fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

368
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 3>and if you go out there and let him</v>
<v Speaker 3>point fight you,</v>

369
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 3>then that's what he's going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

370
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to be able to react to how</v>

371
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 3>he fights it and change it up a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

372
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 3>And that's why each training camps a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit different.</v>

373
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>And you learn those</v>

374
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.440
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.440
<v Speaker 2>when you go and watch a fight after it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

376
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.600
<v Speaker 2>do you see openings and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

377
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's called regret.</v>

378
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:26.443
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

379
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.590
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll,</v>

380
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.580
<v Speaker 3>you'll see it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

381
00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:30.710
<v Speaker 3>you'll all get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll start sweating because I'm getting</v>

382
00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:32.300
<v Speaker 3>mad that I didn't do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

383
00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:33.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the end of the first round,</v>

384
00:14:33.951 --> 00:14:37.460
<v Speaker 3>I was watching the fight against Cruz</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had a double leg locked up so deep</v>

385
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.740
<v Speaker 3>and I just didn't finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that could have changed an entire,</v>

386
00:14:39.741 --> 00:14:41.590
<v Speaker 3>the entire fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just one take down the beat.</v>

387
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:43.580
<v Speaker 3>In the first shot I was all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep,</v>

388
00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:45.500
<v Speaker 3>hands under his butt perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stand,</v>

389
00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:47.930
<v Speaker 3>pinch my elbows to finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to lift him and he slid right</v>

390
00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:50.360
<v Speaker 3>through my arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One difference I had to make was</v>

391
00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:51.870
<v Speaker 3>pinching my elbows and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

392
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 2>changes it just one of those things in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

393
00:14:55.341 --> 00:15:00.341
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it fascinating how like you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to train perfectly and then you have to</v>

394
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 2>just let everything go automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

395
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

396
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 2>you hit the nail on the head is to train</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything perfectly.</v>

397
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Now it comes down to quality reps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then what's a quality rep hitting in</v>

398
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:13.870
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting here or getting them to take</v>

399
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting taken down,</v>

400
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:15.801
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

401
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 2>So now it comes to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of adapting to the athlete in</v>

402
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 2>the scenario and what's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again is making sure they have high</v>

403
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:26.450
<v Speaker 2>success with that technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that technique may be.</v>

404
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 2>So just putting in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in the time that reps till it</v>

405
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 2>comes out fluidly and there's no longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thought,</v>

406
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 2>but the instant reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and also having the right coaches</v>

407
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.530
<v Speaker 2>to give you that information and can</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you that high level technique</v>

408
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:42.440
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many people out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are talented people,</v>

409
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 2>but you see their game just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve.</v>

410
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 2>It just hits this level and it's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the level that their coaches are</v>

411
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:51.440
<v Speaker 2>capable of taking them to and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go any further.</v>

412
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 2>And in that code you have to believe in</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust and that coach will take you to</v>

413
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 2>that level of someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

414
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 2>someone can be telling you the exact</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you need to do,</v>

415
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.000
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't trust and believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

416
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 2>if he doesn't get it through your head</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right ways,</v>

417
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 2>then it's not going to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

418
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna do it cause you don't</v>

419
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:06.380
<v Speaker 2>believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

420
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's amazing what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now with MMA that people who are</v>

421
00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:12.720
<v Speaker 2>casual people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

422
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 2>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day I was at my daughter's</v>

423
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:20.351
<v Speaker 2>school and one of the dads came up to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this dude was just a new fan.</v>

424
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.460
<v Speaker 2>He'd only been watching mma for the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>year and he was just rapid firing</v>

425
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 2>questions at me and he was obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

426
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never into martial arts when I was</v>

427
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.360
<v Speaker 2>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a little bit of boxing and</v>

428
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man that UFC has just got me hooked.</v>

429
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I love about it</v>

430
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:39.590
<v Speaker 2>is how many different ways of fight can</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

431
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

432
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll,</v>

433
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:44.870
<v Speaker 2>you'll watch a fight and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden the guy's getting choked.</v>

434
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Just like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were going over this,</v>

435
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.441
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

436
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Speaker 2>And this guy was a real smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's like a hedge fund manager</v>

437
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:54.620
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was obsessed with all the</v>

438
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 2>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

439
00:16:56.361 --> 00:17:00.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think casual fans are starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand now that this is a very</v>

440
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 2>intellectual pursuit.</v>

441
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a strong mind and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have this full range of</v>

442
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Speaker 2>options and possibilities inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>octagon,</v>

443
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you're most likely limiting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>

444
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that.</v>

445
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Possibilities are nice when you change</v>

446
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:16.371
<v Speaker 2>things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

447
00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:18.140
<v Speaker 2>like we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confused the brain,</v>

448
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.450
<v Speaker 2>get them thinking about something else</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you do something else.</v>

449
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:23.930
<v Speaker 2>So that's always nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think right now we're seeing like,</v>

450
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

451
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

452
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 2>There's like the standard pack of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of athletes that are doing things in a</v>

453
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 2>certain way and then there's a few that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are moving away from the pack and</v>

454
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 2>they're expanding the potential of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're one of those people.</v>

455
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.621
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

456
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 2>And I think you for sure are one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those coaches and there's a few guys out</v>

457
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 2>there I know you don't like to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dominick Cruz is one of them.</v>

458
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:49.320
<v Speaker 2>He's also doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about him today that</v>

459
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>like his style</v>

460
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 1>is so fucking odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

461
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>like it's technically not sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

462
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he uses it the right ways.</v>

463
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.980
<v Speaker 1>He's got awesome timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 1>He's got great cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a great Chin and then you can</v>

465
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 1>get away with the bad things he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he does them for the right way for</v>

466
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

467
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think you can say</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's technically bad because he's so</v>

468
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:10.930
<v Speaker 1>fucking successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

469
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And he knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's not standard.</v>

470
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't like we're using Ramon</v>

471
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 1>dekkers as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does not throw kicks and punches like</v>

472
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Ramon dekkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he does do is he throws him</v>

473
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 1>like Dominick Cruz where he's moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pendulum back and forth and it's,</v>

474
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>footwork is so weird and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming your mind with</v>

475
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he doesn't do the same thing twice.</v>

476
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 1>He mixes things up so well that he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough nut to crack.</v>

477
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

478
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>he's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is trickier than I expected for sure.</v>

479
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.581
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

480
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:42.690
<v Speaker 1>a piece of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

481
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.170
<v Speaker 1>game planning is the talks up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight to get them emotionally invested</v>

482
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.750
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes a bit trickier to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the head.</v>

483
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the goal.</v>

484
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 1>When you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were leading up to the fight,</v>

485
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 1>he was talking so much yet and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell that you were getting so upset,</v>

486
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 1>but that is a big factor in fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

487
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Because fights are so emotional because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the only sports in the world</v>

488
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.690
<v Speaker 1>where your health is on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally like this the option,</v>

489
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you might get in a car</v>
<v Speaker 1>accident when you're racing cars that</v>

490
00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the goal of MMA is for you to fuck</v>

491
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:15.330
<v Speaker 1>up someone's body.</v>

492
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely man.</v>

493
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you had with him too</v>

494
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 1>that makes it pisses you off so much is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he'll attack anything and just talk</v>

495
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 1>about some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even make sense just to talk and</v>

496
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:27.450
<v Speaker 1>talk louder and faster and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a chance to talk.</v>

497
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like a high school girls just</v>
<v Speaker 1>bickering at each other.</v>

498
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what pisses you off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

499
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's not even actually making a</v>

500
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 1>great point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just making it and making it</v>

501
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 1>louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Voice.</v>

502
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

503
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It a good good analyst because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

504
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.100
<v Speaker 1>greed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my technique,</v>

505
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 1>if you get a chance to find him again</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the title,</v>

506
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I bet which you're in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

507
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

508
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.530
<v Speaker 1>well you lost a very close decision to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and then you beat hot felon,</v>

509
00:19:51.531 --> 00:19:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Sun's out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which in my opinion was a,</v>

510
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.480
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this today was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent example of how far you</v>

511
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 1>progressed because you guys had a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough fight the first time you fought.</v>

512
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It was a close fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fight was not closed.</v>

513
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:05.430
<v Speaker 1>He just ran away from him and he ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>away with the,</v>

514
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:06.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight rather,</v>

515
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.060
<v Speaker 1>not run away from him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rent.</v>

516
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.933
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were just,</v>

517
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>it was a clear victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like you're just were so much</v>

518
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 1>more technical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so many more options you were</v>

519
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 1>presenting to him and he was basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same fighter that he was back then.</v>

520
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe slightly better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're all way better fun.</v>

521
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate him and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've worked hard.</v>

522
00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 1>We've long hours where it's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

523
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy how the,</v>

524
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport works out how quick things can</v>

525
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:29.340
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

526
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I could be on 11 fight win streak right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and a split decision loss to have</v>

527
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 1>fail since sal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

528
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought I won that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very close fight with dominick Cruz</v>

529
00:20:37.981 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 1>that I felt I want as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two fights go my way.</v>

530
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm on 11 fight win streak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still have the belt,</v>

531
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>known as hopefully one of the greatest</v>

532
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:46.620
<v Speaker 1>comp pound fighters in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

533
00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>and we have stuff for sure.</v>

534
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting right now too is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>new rule,</v>

535
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 2>a set that's going to go into place in</v>
<v Speaker 2>January,</v>

536
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a where they've changed this whole thing</v>

537
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:00.260
<v Speaker 2>about down fighters like being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>attach it down.</v>

538
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good call.</v>

539
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 2>You have to have four points down now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

540
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put a hand down on the ground and</v>

541
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 2>someone kicks you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

542
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 2>that's totally legit now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I think it's long time coming.</v>

543
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bummed out that didn't give</v>

544
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 2>her of the 12 six elbow but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

545
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules cause that's really not going to</v>

546
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 2>hurt you anymore than me putting a shin</v>
<v Speaker 2>across your face,</v>

547
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:25.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like crazy or getting neat in the face</v>

548
00:21:25.171 --> 00:21:26.550
<v Speaker 2>and crushing your skull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

549
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.340
<v Speaker 2>That stuff happens all the time and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take away an elbow and</v>

550
00:21:29.341 --> 00:21:31.150
<v Speaker 2>you can't even really generate that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>force with,</v>

551
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel it's not more forest.</v>

552
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think there's way more forced</v>

553
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 2>than the elbow that comes down the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's more like a punch because</v>

554
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll get your whole shoulder torques</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

555
00:21:40.241 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Your shoulder dropping down is a weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

556
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's some guys like Anderson</v>

557
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Silva or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yachts and Cli or some badass tie</v>

558
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 2>fighters that can generate ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>power with that.</v>

559
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:53.050
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think it's any more than any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other kind of elbow.</v>

560
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

561
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just some of the rules I think are</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit archaic I think.</v>

562
00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I think we all agree though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the,</v>

563
00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gloves.</v>

564
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably like if there's going to be</v>

565
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:06.460
<v Speaker 2>like one thing that needs to be changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be really nice.</v>

566
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 2>We could all get together and figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way to make it so there's less high</v>

567
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Speaker 2>pokes and here's three experts in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>field right now.</v>

568
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:16.180
<v Speaker 2>We're all saying no pride style gloves</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be an example or like the shadow</v>

569
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anything that it doesn't allow the</v>

570
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:20.200
<v Speaker 2>hand to fully open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck they own pride.</v>

571
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Just use those goddamn gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the sweetest gloves too.</v>

572
00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I love the pride gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I collect all kinds of fight</v>

573
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 2>memorabilia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

574
00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm all over the place now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're dope man,</v>

575
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show everybody your,</v>

576
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.940
<v Speaker 2>your wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

577
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a boxing coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whitman who is by far the most technical</v>

578
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.060
<v Speaker 2>martial arts I've ever come across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took a,</v>

579
00:22:38.061 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>an old fight glove and a worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cameras are there.</v>

580
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Made me a wallet out of my glove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

581
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I saw it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So dope theft is nice.</v>

582
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:49.180
<v Speaker 2>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes all my,</v>

583
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:51.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my punch punishments but type has met my</v>

584
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.760
<v Speaker 2>belly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed my leg kick paths,</v>

585
00:22:52.761 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 2>might kick shield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm super impressed.</v>

586
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I was always impressed with trevor as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

587
00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Some get a picture so I'm going to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's just,</v>

588
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 2>he's just an engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'll take that same skill set and</v>

589
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:05.170
<v Speaker 2>put that into martial arts or to</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing technique or drills.</v>

590
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the same things that you did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>same information to running a successful</v>

591
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:10.760
<v Speaker 2>business or whatever it is you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

592
00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Detailed guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

593
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

594
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 2>it's just fun to see someone do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's unique,</v>

595
00:23:18.581 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So colors,</v>

596
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.680
<v Speaker 2>you guys are in Colorado now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You moved to Colorado full time,</v>

597
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much different is it live in there</v>

598
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:27.570
<v Speaker 2>and what is it like now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also your,</v>

599
00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 2>your training at altitude all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually made a huge difference</v>

600
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 2>that even taken to account when I first</v>
<v Speaker 2>went out there when I was cross training</v>

601
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 2>and I was going back and forth from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>camps going from Sacramento to Colorado</v>

602
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.480
<v Speaker 2>and always going back out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so tough and,</v>

603
00:23:40.481 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 2>and somebody will get affected by that</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do differently.</v>

604
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 2>You know some like Joseph Benevidez</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get affected by it at all.</v>

605
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that Mexicans,</v>

606
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.820
<v Speaker 3>he never gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mannequins don't get tired.</v>

607
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know some racist things to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a positive way.</v>

608
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 3>Tell you I'm the Mexicans have a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible gas tanks and Joseph will</v>

609
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 3>come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll be gone in Vegas,</v>

610
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 3>we'll come out and he'll train exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same for me,</v>

611
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 3>when I go to altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it messes with me big time,</v>

612
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:05.660
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I get the effects from</v>
<v Speaker 3>it long,</v>

613
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.250
<v Speaker 3>long term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm done with the camp,</v>

614
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 3>like I felt big differences when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>trained at w train at altitude,</v>

615
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.880
<v Speaker 3>when I'm done with my camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I've been up there for six weeks,</v>

616
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a camp and you come back down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sea level.</v>

617
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 3>When we first started hitting mitts that</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever we go,</v>

618
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 3>it just feels awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

619
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:20.990
<v Speaker 3>sea level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like a superman,</v>

620
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:21.441
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

621
00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy how much of a difference it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes.</v>

622
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>altitude tents,</v>

623
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 3>those things that people sleeping?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have tried it.</v>

624
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:29.280
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to sleep in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

625
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets hot in there and then it,</v>

626
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 3>and then your body doesn't recover as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

627
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're sleeping,</v>

628
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:36.650
<v Speaker 3>that's really high altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He mean anything higher than we're at.</v>

629
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:39.350
<v Speaker 3>If just even a real high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for your body to actually</v>

630
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 3>recover overnight when you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to recover.</v>

631
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

632
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 3>have your testosterone built up when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sleeping and oxygen getting to</v>

633
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 3>your muscles and recover over the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're sleeping at high altitude,</v>

634
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wake up more sore,</v>

635
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 3>you wake up more tired and it's hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>recover.</v>

636
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I had heard was that the best</v>

637
00:24:55.911 --> 00:25:00.911
<v Speaker 3>balance was training at sea level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sleeping and living at altitude.</v>

638
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I heard that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it wants to go back and</v>

639
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 3>forth all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I heard when I was in</v>

640
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I was a kinesiology major and I</v>

641
00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 3>was really into exercise physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said train low,</v>

642
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:11.400
<v Speaker 3>sleep high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

643
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 3>so that your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're sleeping and hanging out,</v>

644
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:14.960
<v Speaker 3>you're rebuilding all these red blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells,</v>

645
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.180
<v Speaker 3>but then your threshold or working out</v>
<v Speaker 3>at sea level,</v>

646
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 3>you can push it so much harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your body's used to go in that hard,</v>

647
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

648
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 3>you're training in lack oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't train as hard.</v>

649
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:27.190
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when sleeping in and out to do</v>

650
00:25:27.191 --> 00:25:30.350
<v Speaker 3>10 I feel like you can't recover until</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're acclimated.</v>

651
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Once you're acclimated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can recover because you have more</v>

652
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:36.200
<v Speaker 3>red blood cells in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But until then,</v>

653
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.920
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if anybody does it where like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live in San Bernardino and then</v>

654
00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:42.530
<v Speaker 3>train up in big bear and just keep going</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth</v>

655
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.770
<v Speaker 4>and then sleep Tito's thing for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lived up there though,</v>

656
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First Tito,</v>

657
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 4>you still live up there for his camps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was one of the first MMA fighters to</v>

658
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:51.680
<v Speaker 4>incorporate that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

659
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 4>boss Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boston,</v>

660
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Boston puffers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight title.</v>

661
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.760
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came to Colorado for his camp for its</v>

662
00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.310
<v Speaker 4>fight against Kevin Randleman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I sit there Rutan so,</v>

663
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.780
<v Speaker 4>cause uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a promoter in town that would</v>

664
00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 4>hold shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were called the lone wolf</v>

665
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:08.900
<v Speaker 4>invitational and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a couple shows and then I think</v>

666
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 4>it would be his third show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boss was there.</v>

667
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 4>He was just the special guest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then the shows after that,</v>

668
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:16.580
<v Speaker 4>we're now at the boss Rutten</v>
<v Speaker 4>invitationals but when he was there,</v>

669
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 4>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would be a special guests of the show</v>

670
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 4>and then he would do a seminar the next</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

671
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Then I'd fight on the show and then do</v>
<v Speaker 4>with seminars.</v>

672
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:23.984
<v Speaker 4>That's how we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

673
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.640
<v Speaker 4>came together and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

674
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 4>he noticed the effects of the altitude</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then sweet,</v>

675
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:29.150
<v Speaker 4>just his next camp there.</v>

676
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.890
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's a difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>

677
00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:37.891
<v Speaker 3>when I think when they're studying how</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes perform while they sleep at a</v>

678
00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:41.710
<v Speaker 3>high altitude and train at low altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's a difference between</v>

679
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 3>the intensity level that MMA</v>

680
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 1>requires and the amount of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a sport in the</v>

681
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 1>world that requires you to train as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as mma because there's so many different</v>

682
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 1>things you have to work on or as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we just share with a lot of nfl</v>

683
00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 1>players with Lauren then Dow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

684
00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.131
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Denver,</v>

685
00:26:59.131 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 1>he trains a lot of denver players and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of guys come for before they do</v>

686
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:03.780
<v Speaker 1>their combine and come and train with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

687
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And you just kind of realize like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much harder your shrink conditioning is</v>

688
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 1>and how much harder you have to push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just one workout,</v>

689
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they're going to do some</v>

690
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 1>football drills and whatnot and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to hit meds and do some grappling</v>

691
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:16.410
<v Speaker 1>and wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

692
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a very tough sport to get ready</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

693
00:27:18.171 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know if there's many that</v>

694
00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:20.850
<v Speaker 1>are as hard or harder.</v>

695
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

696
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

697
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of crazy when you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like the 10 minute rounds a pride</v>

698
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 1>had and how difficult five minute rounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

699
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely needed,</v>

700
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're a grappler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

701
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is going to beat Damien</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maia if ever rounds,</v>

702
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

703
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be worn out.</v>

704
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a backpack is such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so on another level right now.</v>

705
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good at one thing,</v>

706
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:45.684
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

707
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 1>but he's incredible at it that he can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with it.</v>

708
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Most guys can't get away with just being</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at one individual aspect of them</v>

709
00:27:51.641 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 1>and may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's one of those guys that he's</v>

710
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 1>just so dominant at Jujitsu that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with it.</v>

711
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory too,</v>

712
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:00.150
<v Speaker 1>or the concept is he's really good.</v>

713
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 1>They were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could choke while a few submissions</v>

714
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

715
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.460
<v Speaker 1>but let's say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just Ninja at the in.</v>

716
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 1>They could choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's your one technique.</v>

717
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone's aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got to do was just have different</v>

718
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:10.940
<v Speaker 1>entries for that rear naked choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

719
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 1>So different entries and then obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>you finished the submission.</v>

720
00:28:13.471 --> 00:28:16.770
<v Speaker 1>But as far as the striking concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same techniques or combination,</v>

721
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 1>just different entries in different</v>
<v Speaker 1>exits.</v>

722
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

723
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.140
<v Speaker 1>that same technique itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 1>There was a few guys who have just</v>
<v Speaker 1>really excelled at one particular</v>

725
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:28.080
<v Speaker 1>technique to the point where it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

726
00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Like remember cody Mckenzie was catching</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody with that.</v>

727
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Mckenzie [inaudible] callback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

728
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Ski Team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came and showed it at Alpha male</v>

729
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>

730
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 1>but you got to be built for it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like perfectly built for his arms</v>

731
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:39.590
<v Speaker 1>are long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinny.</v>

732
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

733
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 1>then there was Paul Sas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Paul says like the triangle 12</v>

734
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:46.710
<v Speaker 1>fights in a row by triangle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew it was coming.</v>

735
00:28:46.711 --> 00:28:48.760
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't do shit about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can get it.</v>

736
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use that to your advantage</v>

737
00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:53.120
<v Speaker 1>though as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was helping Matt Brown train from</v>

738
00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Maya and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like how he was approaching the</v>

739
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 1>fight that he was so worried about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to do.</v>

740
00:28:58.711 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to do these take downs,</v>

741
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take her back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do this.</v>

742
00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Like he was so entrenched in what Damien</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maia was going to do to him in the fight</v>

743
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:07.950
<v Speaker 1>rather than worrying about what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>should do,</v>

744
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.010
<v Speaker 1>what aspects He should take to the fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay away from his game instead of</v>

745
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:12.360
<v Speaker 1>really what he's going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

746
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use that to your advantage if</v>

747
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you're a fighter that's so strong at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

748
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.140
<v Speaker 1>confused someone and get them so worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what you're going to do,</v>

749
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that they're actually thinking inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight rather than reacting and just</v>

750
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:23.730
<v Speaker 1>doing what they're good at already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if Matt,</v>

751
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 1>if Matt would have fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the way he should have in</v>

752
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:28.740
<v Speaker 1>that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could've picked Damien Maia apart</v>

753
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.323
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

754
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

755
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.700
<v Speaker 1>he would've got fucking grapple fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>again maybe later on.</v>

756
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:36.570
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my hope and thought at least.</v>

757
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm a big map brown fan,</v>

758
00:29:38.131 --> 00:29:41.130
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a be Zoe and Maya fan as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it's,</v>

759
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>

760
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a fan of a lot of guys and</v>

761
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 2>these guys oftentimes fight each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like you just got to</v>

762
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:50.100
<v Speaker 2>appreciate the event and appreciate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

763
00:29:50.101 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate the sport.</v>

764
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.510
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the cool things about mma</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there are these outliers like</v>

765
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 2>this one trick pony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Damien Maia.</v>

766
00:29:57.401 --> 00:30:00.160
<v Speaker 2>But what a fucking trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

767
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean he can strike and Damien striking</v>
<v Speaker 2>has gotten leaps and bounds better.</v>

768
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why he's gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>so better at applying his Jujitsu is</v>

769
00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:11.050
<v Speaker 2>because he's so much more comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his standup is distance is very</v>

770
00:30:11.051 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we understand striking really well</v>

771
00:30:13.121 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that Jujitsu,</v>

772
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.040
<v Speaker 2>it's just so next level making it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

773
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.860
<v Speaker 2>So he runs through a guy like Carlos</v>
<v Speaker 2>condit like that.</v>

774
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or out graph was Gunnar Nelson grabbed</v>

775
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.870
<v Speaker 2>his gunner Nelson that easy and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>all them.</v>

776
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just Malden,</v>

777
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at another level.</v>

778
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also goes to show you how fucking</v>

779
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 2>good jake shields is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

780
00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People sleep on jake shields.</v>

781
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Jake shields beat him in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a grappling match,</v>

782
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people forget,</v>

783
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake shields was always a guy who kind</v>

784
00:30:41.121 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 2>of struggled with a standup because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't like a explosive guy who's just</v>

785
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.450
<v Speaker 2>sort of like comp awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His standup.</v>

786
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awkward.</v>

787
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he beat Tyron Woodley the fucking welter</v>

788
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 2>weight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world lead them in essentially a</v>

789
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:54.340
<v Speaker 2>standup file.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of Nate Marquardt.</v>

790
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll just smile with his grappling.</v>

791
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.550
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's coming out the muscle farm,</v>

792
00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:00.530
<v Speaker 2>worked out with us and showed some</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique and his top game is just so</v>

793
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.060
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and he's strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just all about is positioning the</v>

794
00:31:04.061 --> 00:31:05.100
<v Speaker 2>weighs on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

795
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it's so tough.</v>

796
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a chest mass freshman chess match</v>

797
00:31:08.441 --> 00:31:09.340
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

798
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>He gets slept on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting Fitch now.</v>

799
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fight in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>series of fighting.</v>

800
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

801
00:31:15.161 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 2>very interesting fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

802
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.790
<v Speaker 2>We have bought both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering about Fitch.</v>

803
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.810
<v Speaker 2>That's good to see him back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a fuck per wall.</v>

804
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when the last time he</v>

805
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 2>tested positive after he fought pal</v>
<v Speaker 2>horace.</v>

806
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he?</v>

807
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was knee got hurt a little</v>

808
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 2>bit of that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he tested positive for elevated</v>

809
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:32.770
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

810
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have that.</v>

811
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.360
<v Speaker 2>You got to follow the rules and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guidelines.</v>

812
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Rules to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

813
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.750
<v Speaker 2>But back to like styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

814
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 2>is it just so interesting that there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many different styles and there's so</v>

815
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:47.320
<v Speaker 2>many different people like wonder boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a one trick pony and the other</v>

816
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:48.520
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 2>just his fucking striking.</v>

818
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his style is like really a karate</v>

819
00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:56.830
<v Speaker 2>based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a sport karate style.</v>

820
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.380
<v Speaker 2>But it's incorporates the movement in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the operating for a longer distance and</v>

821
00:32:00.381 --> 00:32:03.190
<v Speaker 2>he likes to draw people in to get them</v>
<v Speaker 2>extended before he catches himself.</v>

822
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.840
<v Speaker 2>So he's like a Cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

823
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Is Movement like his back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>pivoting off the waist.</v>

824
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 2>But he also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does another thing that fucks with</v>

825
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:13.070
<v Speaker 2>people is that front leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

826
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 2>His front leg is so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep when he fought Hendrix,</v>

827
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.910
<v Speaker 2>he hit when a front lake side to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body and you could see Hendrix got leg</v>

828
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.280
<v Speaker 2>stuck by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a hard shot and you're like kind</v>

829
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 2>of acknowledged it and then he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>roundhouse kicked in the face with the</v>

830
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:32.290
<v Speaker 2>same foot like right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zohan in her face all the time.</v>

831
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 2>It just never stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny to me,</v>

832
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:40.600
<v Speaker 2>a dream fight is Damien Maia versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderboy.</v>

833
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 2>The complete opposite style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dream fight.</v>

834
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

835
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I feel like now what we're watching two</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Damien Maia is also,</v>

836
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 2>we're watching this master who's 38 Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

837
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:53.331
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:54.540
<v Speaker 2>He's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he's,</v>

839
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 2>he's up there for the competitive ages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he seems as healthy and it can</v>

840
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.200
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We said 38 me forever.</v>

841
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.930
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things where you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wonder like how much more sand is</v>

842
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:09.760
<v Speaker 2>left and that hourglass means it pulled</v>
<v Speaker 2>the radica tour trick just fine until</v>

843
00:33:09.761 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 2>he's 50 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fuck randy almost came out of</v>

844
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 2>retirement for fade or oh nine he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about fighting.</v>

845
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 2>What am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just as an old fight fan?</v>

846
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

847
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.820
<v Speaker 2>You got to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My other two being 38 and be able to</v>

848
00:33:21.821 --> 00:33:24.080
<v Speaker 2>push it that hard still is it his style</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fighting,</v>

849
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not getting hit very much.</v>

850
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Speaker 2>He's on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

851
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.520
<v Speaker 2>his training's probably that way as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

852
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.970
<v Speaker 2>and so he's able to go a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer rather than someone that's going</v>

853
00:33:30.971 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 2>to be in front of you and slug it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

854
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely taking less damage</v>

855
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:37.220
<v Speaker 2>striking wise over the years when Judas</v>
<v Speaker 2>stat on him,</v>

856
00:33:37.221 --> 00:33:40.250
<v Speaker 2>when we got hit 13 times over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>four fights.</v>

857
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:40.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

858
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.480
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the like it just,</v>

859
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 2>that's in most of them are the Matt</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown fight.</v>

860
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

861
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just fucking crazy how like</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical he is when it comes to his</v>

862
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

863
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you don't play Jujitsu.</v>

864
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got to punch him in the face</v>

865
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 2>while he kicks like nate Marquardt did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

866
00:33:57.711 --> 00:34:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Well nate caught him early in his career</v>
<v Speaker 2>too though.</v>

867
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Still striking up game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

868
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People sleep on nate Marquardt too,</v>

869
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:05.691
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

870
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 2>people forget how God damn good nate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in his prime.</v>

871
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.990
<v Speaker 2>And you watched that tyron Woodley fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you fought him in strikeforce.</v>

872
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 2>He looked really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have a nation that he hit him</v>

873
00:34:15.411 --> 00:34:17.610
<v Speaker 2>with was like fucking a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

874
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was sharp.</v>

875
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:20.750
<v Speaker 2>That's when he was working with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trevor Whitman.</v>

876
00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 2>He's back with trevor as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his name again,</v>

877
00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 2>trevor is by far the most technical</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed,</v>

878
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial artist instructor that I've come</v>

879
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:29.630
<v Speaker 2>across in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any field.</v>

880
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.530
<v Speaker 2>He really makes it breaks things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hear Shane Carwyn is making a</v>

881
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 2>comeback</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

882
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a free agent.</v>

883
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he can go wherever he wants.</v>

884
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonder where that's going to go.</v>

885
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice thing.</v>

886
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Is he training with trevor as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

887
00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually spend too much time</v>
<v Speaker 2>with trevor,</v>

888
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully if he's smart he should.</v>

889
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:49.390
<v Speaker 2>He will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he's really close with the</v>

890
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.440
<v Speaker 2>wrestling coach me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or bullying.</v>

891
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.450
<v Speaker 2>And I've been hearing it from the Easter</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

892
00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:56.970
<v Speaker 2>he's a free agent and looking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back into working out and seeing</v>

893
00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.480
<v Speaker 2>how his body holds up to see if you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he's going to push it and what's</v>

894
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.341
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

895
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:03.200
<v Speaker 2>He has some pretty significant back</v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>

896
00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.034
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

897
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.720
<v Speaker 2>It was his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

898
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.160
<v Speaker 2>you gotta think that guy played football</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a high level for a long time and all</v>

900
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:15.970
<v Speaker 2>that crashing big dudes smashing into</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

901
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are freaking nature's man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

902
00:35:19.611 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy to be able to be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>big and that fast 230 pounds is run into</v>

903
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:25.790
<v Speaker 2>somebody who's standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for you.</v>

904
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely not good for you.</v>

905
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.250
<v Speaker 2>You want to stay healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

906
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it goes back to uh,</v>

907
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.710
<v Speaker 2>keep keeping those same rules in line</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're training that the goal of</v>

908
00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 2>the training is to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

909
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Not to hurt each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just making</v>

910
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 1>sure you're taking care of your partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And learn to use this time to improve</v>

911
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.930
<v Speaker 1>and get better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the better you get and so on.</v>

912
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can get a good camp like that</v>

913
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 1>where everybody has their ego in check</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you all grow together,</v>

914
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:48.910
<v Speaker 1>that's mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

915
00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 1>no egos there to learn and get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>

916
00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I've had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously work on too because I'm so</v>

917
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:56.250
<v Speaker 1>competitive and I want to be the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

918
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the gym,</v>

919
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:59.190
<v Speaker 1>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like I'm pushing like I want to</v>

920
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 1>train harder than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be better than you.</v>

921
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something that we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

922
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 1>If I had to work with and I've always</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to work on it,</v>

923
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kinda got to,</v>

924
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:07.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay,</v>

925
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 1>stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control the fire.</v>

926
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 1>How do you control yourself when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to like the amount of work you do?</v>

927
00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you monitor your heart rate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you check?</v>

928
00:36:15.661 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Like do you have any sort of markers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you checked to make sure that</v>

929
00:36:18.661 --> 00:36:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not overtrained?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of guys do it off their</v>

930
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:22.080
<v Speaker 1>heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way to do it.</v>

931
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Am I just kind of off the field for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most?</v>

932
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So how am I waking up in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I feeling?</v>

933
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Am I eager to go train?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I eager?</v>

934
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Just still feeling like I'm the best in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world?</v>

935
00:36:29.251 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like my body lets me know</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally of what I should be doing,</v>

936
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 1>what I should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's taken a while to learn that I</v>

937
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 1>wish I would've known this during</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling cause I,</v>

938
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I messed up my wrestling</v>

939
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:41.670
<v Speaker 1>career in college by just pushing too</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard for too long and red lining my</v>

940
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

941
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's all just all feel now and I kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of lay out my,</v>

942
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 1>my whole camp that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I know what days I'm going to do three</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices,</v>

944
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 1>what day I'm going to do one and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of go off a feel,</v>

945
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I need to rest the whole weekend or</v>

946
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 1>just rest Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all if just my energy levels and</v>

947
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:57.300
<v Speaker 1>how much I'm willing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

948
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 1>do you have a nutritionist or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

949
00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfecting athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually teaming up with them now</v>

950
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 1>tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing programs for little kids and</v>

951
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:06.120
<v Speaker 1>for wrestlers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the wrestling,</v>

952
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.830
<v Speaker 1>the wrestling world does not know</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

953
00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've cut weight for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>longest amount of time,</v>

954
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:11.990
<v Speaker 1>but they just do it the wrong ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

955
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 1>perfecting athletes has helped me out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot with my career and they actually</v>

956
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 1>have been able to boost my hormones with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I eat.</v>

957
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how so,</v>

958
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my,</v>

959
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.110
<v Speaker 1>my a nutritionist Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she used to be a fertility doctor and</v>

960
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 1>she's real holistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's into acupuncture and doing all</v>

961
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:28.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

962
00:37:28.761 --> 00:37:29.594
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

963
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 1>the foods that they're feeding you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right things for your endocrine</v>

964
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:35.370
<v Speaker 1>system and boosting your testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making you just a healthier human</v>

965
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

966
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.370
<v Speaker 1>if you eat and live healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body is going to produce more</v>

967
00:37:38.371 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and live the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they'd done with me.</v>

968
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.770
<v Speaker 1>And what I've heard is that more fats</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eating more fats,</v>

969
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 1>good fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen it in a lot of different</v>

970
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:49.850
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially athletes it fall,</v>

971
00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:54.420
<v Speaker 1>start falling ketogenic diets that ramps</v>
<v Speaker 1>up their hormone production because fats</v>

972
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 1>are a precursor for hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of coconut oil,</v>

973
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fats from healthy meats,</v>

974
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 1>especially like grass fed meat.</v>

975
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you can't get enough of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

976
00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:08.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're working out as much as I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>during camp or even just working all the</v>

977
00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:09.150
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't get more,</v>

978
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 1>the good fats are one of the best things</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

979
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing to take into</v>

980
00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:16.350
<v Speaker 1>consideration when people talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes and people talk about people</v>

981
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:18.960
<v Speaker 1>that exercise and are fit and want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow a healthy diet.</v>

982
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.660
<v Speaker 1>There's such a different caloric</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement.</v>

983
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 1>For someone like you who's training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you train two or three times a</v>

984
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:27.030
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

985
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 1>two or three and just to switch it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'll do one j one harder line.</v>

986
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Just depends where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

987
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd say on average three times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your body is just a blast furnace.</v>

988
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.790
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to hold on to weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

989
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a try,</v>

990
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I got to try as hard as they can to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>my weight up.</v>

991
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm out of season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now I'm trying to lift his</v>

992
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 1>lift heavy and stay as big as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I get into camp,</v>

993
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change it up while I'm doing that.</v>

994
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 1>A lot of hypertrophy right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let of hypertrophy training,</v>

995
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll get closer to campus or doing more</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength training.</v>

996
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 1>And then when I get in camp like closer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my fight and do more power training.</v>

997
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 1>So when you say hypertrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of training?</v>

998
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like like dead lifts?</v>

999
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'll obviously I'll do delis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1001
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all depends on the reps you're doing</v>

1002
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 1>really and how much weight you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1003
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.190
<v Speaker 1>So if I wanted my approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have find a weight that's hard</v>

1004
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:13.780
<v Speaker 1>for me to do 10 to 12 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1005
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:17.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what's gonna make my muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>build them like higher reps and start</v>

1006
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:17.950
<v Speaker 1>building size.</v>

1007
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And then when I want to get strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start doing less reps,</v>

1008
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around like six and that's hard to do at</v>

1009
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 1>six and then that's when we started</v>
<v Speaker 1>building more strength.</v>

1010
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power is uh,</v>

1011
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three quick hard explosive,</v>

1012
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead lifts and cleans and stuff like</v>

1013
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:33.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breaks in between sets.</v>

1014
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all depends on the brakes as well too.</v>

1015
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're getting down to one 45 or</v>

1016
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:41.500
<v Speaker 1>one 35 rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how difficult is that for you?</v>

1017
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you walking around at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>during camp and walk around like one 50</v>

1018
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I usually show up five days before my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight at one 52 I usually train what I'm</v>

1019
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:53.440
<v Speaker 1>going to fight at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I walk into the cage one 51 53</v>

1020
00:39:53.441 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 1>probably I'm training like that my whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire camp five days before the fight</v>

1021
00:39:57.221 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 1>and Wayne one 15 and then I just lose it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all with waterway.</v>

1022
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

1023
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like a lot to poke people</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening probably,</v>

1024
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:09.520
<v Speaker 1>but we know guys who are losing 25 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is too much.</v>

1025
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's not healthy for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1026
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 1>That's too hard to recover hydration on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

1027
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought that if you didn't</v>

1028
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.760
<v Speaker 1>do the hypertrophy training and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do all the power training and you</v>

1029
00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 1>just did more robotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you might drop down to one 45</v>

1030
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:24.940
<v Speaker 1>naturally and then might be able to cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one 25 yeah.</v>

1031
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I thought I could make 25 I mean</v>

1032
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.470
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely wouldn't be fun and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really,</v>

1033
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't really want to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1034
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely something that I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1035
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1036
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi mouse needs a supervisor.</v>

1037
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.820
<v Speaker 1>He does man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a huge fan of the guy too.</v>

1038
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so good that I would love to fight</v>

1039
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:44.020
<v Speaker 1>him and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do feel I have a really good style for</v>

1040
00:40:44.021 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 1>mighty mouse too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1041
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.830
<v Speaker 1>cause I know he's talking about doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>superfight.</v>

1042
00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1043
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 1>he's in a interesting position because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really essentially cleared out his</v>

1044
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1045
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:57.100
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting Wilson Hayes and Wilson's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very tough fight.</v>

1046
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Fight the winner of the show that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of just,</v>

1047
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:03.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of me just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a wrapped up filming a show with</v>

1048
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1049
00:41:06.721 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do meet you supposed to fight the winner</v>

1050
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:09.850
<v Speaker 1>of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

1051
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 1>But what did I read too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way he was supposed to fight,</v>

1052
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>but he got hurt and pulled out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and now I think he's supposed to</v>

1053
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:18.220
<v Speaker 1>fight the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate fighting,</v>

1054
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.581
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1055
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I read something today.</v>

1056
00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I read something today about him</v>

1057
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:24.760
<v Speaker 1>fighting Wilson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it was just a,</v>

1058
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 1>an older article or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it was confused,</v>

1059
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you fight is the winner of the</v>

1060
00:41:31.931 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It good luck to those guys.</v>

1061
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good</v>

1062
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 2>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting a fucking human buzzsaw</v>

1063
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1064
00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:39.740
<v Speaker 2>He's on another level again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio punching from all angles.</v>

1065
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's good man.</v>

1066
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

1067
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 2>one of the best examples or the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>example ever of a guy who has so many</v>

1068
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:48.380
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His language,</v>

1069
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 2>the language of fighting his language</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the richest vocabulary of any</v>

1070
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:55.100
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the way he fucked so hutto up in</v>

1071
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:58.490
<v Speaker 2>a clinch with those knees to the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is it.</v>

1072
00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Who does it better than that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a guy did good break a</v>

1073
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 2>guy down better with needs to the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1074
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to go to Anderson versus rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>Franklin.</v>

1075
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good call.</v>

1076
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 2>But that was like almost like a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutality oriented thing.</v>

1077
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean when Anderson did it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab a hold of you and just rag doll you</v>

1078
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 2>with with when he was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when mighty mouse is doing,</v>

1079
00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was crazy to watch.</v>

1080
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like these things are coming there.</v>

1081
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 2>They're landing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vibe,</v>

1082
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 2>he's firing them off like with no</v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitation.</v>

1083
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.340
<v Speaker 2>There's no wind up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no exertion.</v>

1084
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Everything seems effortless and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1085
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he could do it all day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a real fucking problem</v>

1086
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:38.744
<v Speaker 2>when you're in there with them.</v>

1087
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.621
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the,</v>

1088
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:43.370
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm assuming make sense is Matt</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hume,</v>

1089
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.590
<v Speaker 4>his being his coach who's obviously the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wizard,</v>

1090
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:47.810
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very intelligent in the fight world,</v>

1091
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 4>but with the background of pseudo</v>
<v Speaker 4>missing weight,</v>

1092
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 4>so much attacking the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming that maybe he had a hard cut</v>

1093
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.810
<v Speaker 4>and maybe ate too much to drink too much</v>
<v Speaker 4>and attacking the body as far as the</v>

1094
00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:58.340
<v Speaker 4>game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was very smart of him.</v>

1095
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.200
<v Speaker 4>Then also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously he did it with the correct</v>

1096
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:01.930
<v Speaker 4>timing and accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1097
00:43:01.931 --> 00:43:04.620
<v Speaker 4>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who to really struggles to get done</v>

1098
00:43:04.621 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 4>in 25 that's what I hear you look big on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the show.</v>

1099
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.313
<v Speaker 4>I filmed a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1100
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.710
<v Speaker 4>I just did 25 huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1101
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find that,</v>

1102
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.520
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he may be,</v>

1103
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe like the exact example</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about with Tj like that</v>

1104
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe they were like very similar in</v>
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>

1105
00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Just decided to go down there and AH,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good call.</v>

1106
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't have the correct,</v>

1107
00:43:23.471 --> 00:43:25.450
<v Speaker 4>maybe not the correct path to actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it happen.</v>

1108
00:43:25.451 --> 00:43:27.160
<v Speaker 4>If he's actually missing weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they needed to get,</v>

1109
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what his deal is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lesson a long time.</v>

1110
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.750
<v Speaker 4>He did a few struggles in the past but</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1111
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 4>he missed a couple of the UFC weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1112
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:39.310
<v Speaker 4>And they made him fight at one 35 that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>spotify at one 35 and then the showed</v>

1114
00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:42.580
<v Speaker 4>them that he could make 25 again and did</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and then because he's going to be</v>

1115
00:43:42.581 --> 00:43:44.980
<v Speaker 4>fighting that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it'd beat us now and I'm not sure</v>

1116
00:43:44.981 --> 00:43:46.360
<v Speaker 4>when that fight is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe December,</v>

1117
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.670
<v Speaker 4>but the at me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is coming out to Colorado in about</v>

1118
00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:50.770
<v Speaker 4>one week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just texted me the other day and he</v>

1119
00:43:50.771 --> 00:43:53.860
<v Speaker 4>actually bought a condo in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Susan be training with us full time</v>

1120
00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:57.550
<v Speaker 4>until the fight and that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But maybe this is a very creative</v>

1121
00:43:57.551 --> 00:43:59.230
<v Speaker 4>martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We and him,</v>

1122
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:00.640
<v Speaker 4>when we train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we flow,</v>

1123
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.490
<v Speaker 4>we create a whole bunch of new rhythms</v>
<v Speaker 4>and paths and patterns.</v>

1124
00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:04.150
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

1125
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:08.350
<v Speaker 4>I love it as a martial artist finding</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next level of the game.</v>

1126
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.510
<v Speaker 4>It happens a lot with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also at Tj,</v>

1127
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.240
<v Speaker 4>it's fun to work with that level of</v>
<v Speaker 4>athlete just to play with the game</v>

1128
00:44:13.241 --> 00:44:14.260
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Overall,</v>

1129
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.610
<v Speaker 4>expanding the level of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where I'm,</v>

1130
00:44:16.611 --> 00:44:19.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by what's the next level?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are we at?</v>

1131
00:44:19.121 --> 00:44:19.954
<v Speaker 4>What can we create?</v>

1132
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benevidez is also one of those guys that</v>

1133
00:44:22.491 --> 00:44:25.250
<v Speaker 2>if you saw him like in a silhouette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you couldn't see who he was,</v>

1134
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.440
<v Speaker 2>if you couldn't see any detail but you</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw him move around,</v>

1135
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:28.610
<v Speaker 2>you would know it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.410
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he holds his hand,</v>

1137
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 2>the way he holds his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1138
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 4>everything cause you've got a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>distinct,</v>

1139
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's one of my favorite people in the</v>

1140
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:36.720
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1141
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 4>I love that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's such a character man.</v>

1142
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 4>We're really just spinning kicks and</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's made just for me to slow down and</v>

<v Speaker 4>make sure I take my time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's my main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's slow down and think I get so</v>

1148
00:44:53.281 --> 00:44:56.560
<v Speaker 4>wrapped up and just getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put myself into fight mode when I talk</v>

1149
00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:59.610
<v Speaker 4>and I just got to make sure I'm being</v>
<v Speaker 4>calm and being collective and making</v>

1150
00:44:59.611 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 4>sure I'm getting the points and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>messages across with with what I'm</v>

1151

<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because now obviously on the podcast,</v>

1152
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.420
<v Speaker 4>this podcast has helped change my life</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the years.</v>

1153
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:09.690
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure you get this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you'd literally help change people's</v>

1154
00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:10.470
<v Speaker 4>lives for the better.</v>

1155
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 4>And I thank you for that and thanks for</v>
<v Speaker 4>having me on.</v>

1156
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:14.500
<v Speaker 4>And for us it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1157
00:45:14.501 --> 00:45:15.760
<v Speaker 4>it's bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1158
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 4>to use this type of properly to help</v>
<v Speaker 4>influence others and not to try to tear</v>

1159
00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.410
<v Speaker 4>anybody's name down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to help uplift and inspiring and</v>

1160
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.190
<v Speaker 4>help people become better human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I felt my messages on this</v>

1161
00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:29.310
<v Speaker 4>earth is to help people become better in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my vehicle.</v>

1162
00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 4>My tool is martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I love it.</v>

1163
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Whether general fitness or training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest level Ninjas to compete for</v>

1164
00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:36.960
<v Speaker 4>the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my service back to the world to</v>

1165
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:38.550
<v Speaker 4>help make sure we're all together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1166
00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:41.580
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting to see you really</v>
<v Speaker 4>flourish as a coach too,</v>

1167
00:45:41.581 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 4>because very few fighters who I'm here</v>
<v Speaker 4>taken to it the way you have,</v>

1168
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.650
<v Speaker 4>where you're not only will you a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>good fighter and an excellent fighter,</v>

1169
00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:52.290
<v Speaker 4>but you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've surpassed that as a coach.</v>

1170
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 4>That's really rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel that.</v>

1171
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.520
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that.</v>

1172
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just put my time,</v>

1173
00:45:58.981 --> 00:46:01.770
<v Speaker 4>energy and my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my ocd ness in to developing others.</v>

1174
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Like that's literally what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm obsessed with it and there's only</v>

1175
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:06.780
<v Speaker 4>one way to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to be obsessive,</v>

1176
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then to have,</v>

1177
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fellow ninjas like Tj and Benevidez to</v>

1178
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:13.470
<v Speaker 4>play along with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this tool of martial arts to see</v>

1179
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:15.270
<v Speaker 4>what the next layer is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1180
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 4>You mean I need this level of dedication</v>
<v Speaker 4>and athleticism in order to do that?</v>

1181
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1182
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.300
<v Speaker 4>because of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm at the level that I'm at.</v>

1183
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:23.520
<v Speaker 4>So it's a win win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like every relationship should be,</v>

1184
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.870
<v Speaker 4>read the notes slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every relationship should be,</v>

1185
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:29.030
<v Speaker 4>it should be a willing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1186
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a one side of the path.</v>

1187
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:31.290
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1188
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:34.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not long ago Tj asks me why I'm always</v>

1189
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:36.140
<v Speaker 4>so hyper and excited and loving life.</v>

1190
00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:40.810
<v Speaker 4>It's because his goals are my goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of my dreams is to see him with</v>

1191
00:46:40.811 --> 00:46:42.870
<v Speaker 4>the belt again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's something that I obsess.</v>

1192
00:46:42.871 --> 00:46:44.400
<v Speaker 4>I was to make sure he's wearing the belt</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1193
00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:45.660
<v Speaker 4>It's in its proper place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1194
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.260
<v Speaker 4>and same thing for benevides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would absolutely love to have been a</v>

1195
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:49.830
<v Speaker 4>vsp wearing the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1196
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me to help others become better</v>

1197
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.480
<v Speaker 4>brings me a lot of joy in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I loved that.</v>

1198
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny that that passion and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that intensity and focus has a negative</v>

1199
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:01.080
<v Speaker 4>connotation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People call it OCD.</v>

1200
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.530
<v Speaker 4>We're weird with obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works for me.</v>

1202
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.390
<v Speaker 4>But it wouldn't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why,</v>

1203
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.940
<v Speaker 4>why is that like necessarily negative?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1204
00:47:08.941 --> 00:47:09.380
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For,</v>

1205
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:09.870
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1206
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.550
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I have so many things going on,</v>

1207
00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:13.530
<v Speaker 4>there's so many other elements</v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout the world with my wife,</v>

1208
00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 4>my family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my business.</v>

1209
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm lucky and I'm blessed that</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything in my circle,</v>

1210
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 4>my bubble works with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1211
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.420
<v Speaker 4>because I mean I take my kids to go and</v>
<v Speaker 4>train,</v>

1212
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:23.880
<v Speaker 4>my wife goes and trains people asking me</v>
<v Speaker 4>this quite a bit.</v>

1213
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.620
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to have your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your kids fight?</v>

1214
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to have the fight if they</v>

1215
00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:29.680
<v Speaker 4>choose to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will support their path,</v>

1216
00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 4>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever their passion is that it was a</v>

1217
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:35.650
<v Speaker 4>support that where they do have to train</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it look at it as a form of</v>

1218
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:37.420
<v Speaker 4>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not always going to be around to</v>

1219
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 4>protect them and want to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can handle potential confrontations</v>

1220
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 4>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can,</v>

1221
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 4>if they need to by either talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1222
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn to diffuse a situation or if it</v>

1223
00:47:46.481 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 4>does come to come to a physical</v>
<v Speaker 4>confrontation,</v>

1224
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 4>they can handle themselves properly.</v>

1225
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.400
<v Speaker 4>But just being healthy and happy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>confident with your walking your talk</v>

1226
00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:57.180
<v Speaker 4>and be able to help other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I make it.</v>

1227
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.050
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mandatory that my kids do train</v>

1228
00:47:59.051 --> 00:48:03.900
<v Speaker 4>martial arts and my wife as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>El Guapo just texted a sensei car.</v>

00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:49.791
<v Speaker 4>the baddest man that ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for coming.</v>

1244
00:48:49.901 --> 00:48:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Have a seat time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No seizures.</v>

1245
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I know Carter is going to fight just</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause how aggressive he is.</v>

1246
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.150
<v Speaker 4>I remember like the first time ever go</v>
<v Speaker 4>into Dwayne's house and watching his</v>

1247
00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:00.760
<v Speaker 4>little two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two year old pride stomp his dog.</v>

1248
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.900
<v Speaker 4>He knows what a pride stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1249
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 4>Price doubling the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have big,</v>

1250
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 4>big huge pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them was so a move but two year</v>

1251
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:13.240
<v Speaker 4>old kid stomping a pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what people have a misconception.</v>

1252
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Pimples being bad dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they are known in the past as nanny</v>

1253
00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 4>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My kids can actually physically rough up</v>

1254
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 4>my pit bulls and they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're big enough.</v>

1255
00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 4>They're strong if they're composed of</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're females.</v>

1256
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.380
<v Speaker 4>So they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just about it.</v>

1257
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 4>The female that does definitely helps</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1258
00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell them this story,</v>

<v Speaker 4>from your wife yesterday separating the</v>

1261
00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 4>pedals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1262
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1263
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.200
<v Speaker 4>the two dogs did you have two females?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two females.</v>

1264
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.010
<v Speaker 4>That's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.650
<v Speaker 4>So the story would prove your point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crack.</v>

1266
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm about to hop in the shower and my</v>

1267
00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:50.080
<v Speaker 4>wife tells me the dogs are fighting out</v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1268
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.890
<v Speaker 4>So I grabbed my towel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrapped around it.</v>

1269
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.030
<v Speaker 4>I run outside to separate the dogs cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll fight cause there's the</v>

1270
00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:57.960
<v Speaker 4>neighbor's dog barks and they'll bark at</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and the bark at each other.</v>

1271
00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.470
<v Speaker 4>Then they start arguing and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1272
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 4>So I anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went outside with my towel on to</v>

1273
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 4>get the dog separate them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I'm separate in the dogs,</v>

1274
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 4>the towel falls off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I still have to separate the dogs</v>

1275
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:10.300
<v Speaker 4>and the neighbors behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a show boom.</v>

1276
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:11.770
<v Speaker 4>And they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to get together</v>

1277
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.120
<v Speaker 4>back naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just rolling with the dog and separating</v>

1278
00:50:16.121 --> 00:50:18.650
<v Speaker 4>them and making sure everything is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1279
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what his wife looks at me</v>

1280
00:50:22.361 --> 00:50:25.780
<v Speaker 4>now and it's a little bit strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] she does it.</v>

1281
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.020
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1282
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 4>it's always nice to</v>

1283
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.800
<v Speaker 5>feel wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a sad scene.</v>

1284
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 5>Separating each are fighting pitfalls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's funny now he's flopping around this</v>

1285
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1286
00:50:36.321 --> 00:50:39.250
<v Speaker 5>That would have been good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although it's a joke now is I'll stay at</v>

1287
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.610
<v Speaker 5>the dogs fighting to go rip my shirt</v>
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

1288
00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:45.130
<v Speaker 5>Now's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had two females.</v>

1289
00:50:45.131 --> 00:50:46.730
<v Speaker 5>It fought to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1290
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:47.151
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:49.380
<v Speaker 5>I heard that mom was a dead dog in my</v>
<v Speaker 5>living room.</v>

1292
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.410
<v Speaker 5>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That is so true.</v>

1331
00:52:17.741 --> 00:52:19.600
<v Speaker 5>Women always want to tell you who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>sick,</v>

1332
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.300
<v Speaker 5>who's got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1334
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.880
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they read on the Internet.</v>

1335
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.721
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a headache.</v>

1336
00:52:26.721 --> 00:52:27.531
<v Speaker 6>And they read it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1337
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:28.364
<v Speaker 6>this could be cancer,</v>

1338
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1339
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.300
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My wife says it's good.</v>

1340
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.170
<v Speaker 5>My wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's on point with stuff.</v>

1341
00:52:35.171 --> 00:52:37.450
<v Speaker 5>She's good about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good positive stuff and last down and</v>

1342
00:52:37.451 --> 00:52:39.640
<v Speaker 5>take care of the family and she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's good.</v>

1343
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.940
<v Speaker 5>She's programmed herself wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel well they say that there's</v>

1344
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:47.560
<v Speaker 5>natural sort of evolutionary path that</v>
<v Speaker 5>women get together and talk a lot.</v>

1345
00:52:47.561 --> 00:52:51.190
<v Speaker 5>Like that's one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 5>gossip exists so much with women because</v>

1346
00:52:51.191 --> 00:52:55.690
<v Speaker 5>women would be gathering food and</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking and that was one of the ways</v>

1347
00:52:55.691 --> 00:52:58.020
<v Speaker 5>they figured out who was full of shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>and who wasn't.</v>

1348
00:52:58.021 --> 00:53:00.460
<v Speaker 5>They had where's the men would be out</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting and he'd be like,</v>

1349
00:53:00.461 --> 00:53:01.610
<v Speaker 5>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1350
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:03.660
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

1351
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:05.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why men value.</v>

1352
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.090
<v Speaker 5>We'll also why men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they value quiet men who know when to be</v>

1353
00:53:10.091 --> 00:53:11.290
<v Speaker 5>quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's important.</v>

1354
00:53:11.291 --> 00:53:15.430
<v Speaker 5>And also they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't value men who wear shiny shit</v>

1355
00:53:15.431 --> 00:53:19.000
<v Speaker 5>and are really loud and have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>junk on and stuff like that because</v>

1356
00:53:19.001 --> 00:53:20.230
<v Speaker 5>those assholes would get in trouble.</v>

1357
00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.570
<v Speaker 5>They would fuck up hunting parties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

1358
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1359
00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:26.640
<v Speaker 5>But it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read it.</v>

1360
00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:29.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Women are programmed to do more things</v>

1361
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:33.200
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they can really take care of</v>

1362
00:53:33.201 --> 00:53:34.230
<v Speaker 5>the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he can do anything.</v>

1363
00:53:34.231 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 5>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just have one focus and that's it.</v>

1364
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.950
<v Speaker 5>That's why I went to military and women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always think it's a dangerous thing.</v>

1365
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:43.770
<v Speaker 5>And the reason I'm saying in dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing is because the natural inclination</v>

1366
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 5>for a guy is to protect a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1367
00:53:46.741 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 5>So if something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody wants to automatically,</v>

1368
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:53.070
<v Speaker 5>that's an instinct that's built into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy to protect a woman,</v>

1369
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:55.830
<v Speaker 5>which could of course make a big trouble</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the integrate.</v>

1370
00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said [inaudible] to treating them</v>

1371
00:53:58.591 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 5>as an equal on the battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1372
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Protect them.</v>

1373
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe trading wool or take that</v>
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

1374
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they train like a guy,</v>

1375
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 5>then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1376
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.060
<v Speaker 5>my wife is down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So see,</v>

1377
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Show fight.</v>

1378
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.200
<v Speaker 5>She fought me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't</v>

1379
00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 5>play too rough with the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go see her looking at me watching over</v>

1380
00:54:21.751 --> 00:54:22.500
<v Speaker 5>across the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1381
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she'll come on,</v>

1382
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:26.660
<v Speaker 5>fuck me up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's,</v>

1383
00:54:26.661 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 5>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's awesome.</v>

1384
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:28.880
<v Speaker 5>But why was the keeper?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1385
00:54:28.881 --> 00:54:33.120
<v Speaker 5>it's strange times because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're asking women to take on a lot of</v>

1386
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:35.490
<v Speaker 5>the traits and characteristics of men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1387
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:35.970
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1388
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:37.500
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them want to,</v>

1389
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:38.820
<v Speaker 5>and I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some,</v>

1390
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:41.640
<v Speaker 5>for some they feel like they're required</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1391
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.640
<v Speaker 5>and I don't necessarily know if that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they want,</v>

1392
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

1393
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:48.150
<v Speaker 5>but I think society wants a woman to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>a breadwinner.</v>

1394
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.750
<v Speaker 5>They want women to contribute and</v>
<v Speaker 5>compete with men in the workplace.</v>

1395
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:53.570
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of ways in a lot of women want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do that tail.</v>

1396
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:54.300
<v Speaker 5>Lydia?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1397
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.360
<v Speaker 5>And then you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see that and then when it comes</v>

1398
00:54:57.361 --> 00:54:59.880
<v Speaker 5>to the military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult to say like,</v>

1399
00:54:59.881 --> 00:55:01.170
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women shouldn't be on the battlefield</v>

1400
00:55:01.171 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 5>because then all of a sudden you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1401
00:55:02.431 --> 00:55:03.770
<v Speaker 5>what are you sexist?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1402
00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not traditionally a female open</v>

1403
00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:07.824
<v Speaker 5>option.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1404
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.650
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's a path you want to go ahead</v>

1405
00:55:09.651 --> 00:55:10.790
<v Speaker 5>and go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to be made.</v>

1406
00:55:10.791 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 5>You'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will have fun.</v>

1407
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:13.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>

1408
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some women that I think would</v>

1409
00:55:14.841 --> 00:55:16.350
<v Speaker 5>probably gravitate towards killing</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1410
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:17.760
<v Speaker 5>They'd probably think it would be a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fun.</v>

1411
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:20.130
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a feminist then also when you</v>

1412
00:55:20.131 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 5>see a spider,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't let us get rid of the spider.</v>

1413
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 5>They all want to play power.</v>

1414
00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.370
<v Speaker 5>Power that there's some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1415
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:25.870
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1416
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:29.220
<v Speaker 5>I do everything myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1417
00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:32.220
<v Speaker 5>well that's your job right now as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1418
00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:34.350
<v Speaker 5>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why was the reason,</v>

1419
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 5>something about Arachnophobia where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>were thinking that Arachnophobia which</v>

1420
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 5>is a fear of spiders and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 5>different like snake phobias and much</v>

1421
00:55:41.851 --> 00:55:45.610
<v Speaker 5>different phobias might literally be the</v>
<v Speaker 5>memory of your ancestors.</v>

1422
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:49.380
<v Speaker 5>Like someone you know in like someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ancestors know,</v>

1423
00:55:49.381 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 5>died in front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got bit by a spider or they almost died</v>

1424
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.000
<v Speaker 5>and they got bit by a spider and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit is just hardwired into your DNA</v>

1425
00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.300
<v Speaker 5>that says some people see a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>spider and they can't move.</v>

1426
00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:02.310
<v Speaker 5>They freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1427
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 5>My daughter freaks out when a wasp comes</v>
<v Speaker 5>by.</v>

1428
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:05.100
<v Speaker 5>She'll just freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1429
00:56:05.101 --> 00:56:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to go pick her up or swap the for</v>

1430
00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:09.840
<v Speaker 5>the wasp away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have lost in our area so that Kinda</v>

1431
00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 5>makes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she just freezes out,</v>

1432
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.860
<v Speaker 5>fly around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know where they're going or</v>

1433
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:15.180
<v Speaker 5>what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My daughter's got good foot work.</v>

1434
00:56:15.181 --> 00:56:16.520
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever hear him say that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She does.</v>

1435
00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.690
<v Speaker 5>That makes a lot of noise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like meditating,</v>

1436
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 5>flying in front of Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you meditate</v>

1437
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.840
<v Speaker 6>they come and fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I look,</v>

1438
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 6>I opened my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy came back twice.</v>

1439
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.530
<v Speaker 6>What's up and he's right in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here he goes.</v>

1440
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:37.640
<v Speaker 6>Maybe sends to your ci for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three Mil.</v>

1441
00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.280
<v Speaker 6>Is that Sensei?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry,</v>

1442
00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.180
<v Speaker 6>is meditating in the yard?</v>

1443
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.880
<v Speaker 4>We're just talking about [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 4>before you arrived.</v>

1444
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 4>As far as um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to go back to this,</v>

1445
00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:53.110
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the first one that I was aware of</v>

1446
00:56:53.111 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 4>that actually did elevation training</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they came to Colorado.</v>

1447
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:58.450
<v Speaker 4>So I already said that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also with what he did is he took</v>

1448
00:56:58.451 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 4>combinations and then chunk them</v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1449
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 4>Hence numbers like four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you say four in the root and system</v>

1450
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:04.091
<v Speaker 4>is Jab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cross,</v>

1451
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 4>Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cross.</v>

1452
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that same idea of taking the</v>

1453
00:57:06.761 --> 00:57:09.340
<v Speaker 4>combination and checking it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if I would say jab,</v>

1454
00:57:09.341 --> 00:57:09.641
<v Speaker 4>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hook,</v>

1455
00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 4>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot more time than me just sing</v>

1456
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.920
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that concept is what it took to</v>

1457
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:17.660
<v Speaker 4>continue the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to develop the system and just the idea</v>

1458
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:21.580
<v Speaker 4>would be able to communicate with tj on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the paths are in the cage with limited</v>

1459
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just calling simple commands or</v>

1460
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:25.120
<v Speaker 4>combinations so we can actually make</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that the fight,</v>

1461
00:57:25.121 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 4>so taking place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not getting too sidetracked,</v>

1462
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:31.360
<v Speaker 4>he knows he's got a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>system is a Mark Henry Mark Henry Trains</v>

1463
00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:34.170
<v Speaker 4>Edson Barboza and Frankie Edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a fantastic trainer.</v>

1464
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the most underrated guys in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the business.</v>

1465
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rashad Evans told me that he will name</v>

1466
00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 4>combinations after his daughter like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rashad.</v>

1467
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.390
<v Speaker 4>I saw that like certain things and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>changes them with every camp,</v>

1468
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.580
<v Speaker 4>with every camp that change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the names change.</v>

1469
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:51.800
<v Speaker 4>So no one's ever gonna be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern you then never the other corners</v>

1470
00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:53.860
<v Speaker 4>not going to have any fucking idea what</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's calling out</v>

1471
00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.090
<v Speaker 6>Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He used to change the numbers all the</v>

1472
00:57:59.091 --> 00:58:01.490
<v Speaker 6>time because they would have a number</v>
<v Speaker 6>system,</v>

1473
00:58:01.491 --> 00:58:03.320
<v Speaker 6>but then every time he would change the</v>
<v Speaker 6>number.</v>

1474
00:58:03.321 --> 00:58:07.010
<v Speaker 6>So nobody could pick up</v>
<v Speaker 6>too much shit.</v>

1475
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.860
<v Speaker 6>If you change,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to chase you up or always</v>

1476
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:10.520
<v Speaker 6>having,</v>

1477
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 1>oh he's be so lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1478
00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.760
<v Speaker 1>always adding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a system.</v>

1479
00:58:14.761 --> 00:58:17.190
<v Speaker 1>We do an online system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do his own academy,</v>

1480
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.170
<v Speaker 1>which he teaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the basic stuff.</v>

1481
00:58:19.171 --> 00:58:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a boss Combo.</v>

1482
00:58:20.611 --> 00:58:21.750
<v Speaker 1>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1483
00:58:21.751 --> 00:58:23.160
<v Speaker 1>we got my combo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1484
00:58:23.161 --> 00:58:25.590
<v Speaker 1>We'll put it online and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then we always switch it up.</v>

1485
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.720
<v Speaker 1>So each camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my combo might be different,</v>

1486
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:29.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he completely switched all of it</v>

1487
00:58:29.611 --> 00:58:30.660
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be law.</v>

1488
00:58:30.661 --> 00:58:32.400
<v Speaker 1>We already do too much as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be lost.</v>

1489
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did the boss come today.</v>

1490
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to remember all these different</v>

1491
00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:40.200
<v Speaker 1>things and put them all like the Ramon</v>
<v Speaker 1>dekkers,</v>

1492
00:58:40.201 --> 00:58:41.520
<v Speaker 1>there's like 50 shot.</v>

1493
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:45.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1494
00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:49.120
<v Speaker 1>the decors like stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Tyson and the deckers.</v>

1495
00:58:49.121 --> 00:58:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Those things kind of tie together that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing things you're supposed to</v>

1496
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 1>do naturally anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1497
00:58:53.051 --> 00:58:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you're returning with the same punch in</v>
<v Speaker 1>slipping and then rolling into the body</v>

1498
00:58:56.261 --> 00:58:57.610
<v Speaker 1>and kicking inside than kicking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1499
00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Those are supposed to come together no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what.</v>

1500
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He's just making it a combo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you stop,</v>

1501
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:05.150
<v Speaker 1>stop thinking about the common way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just naturally start to do it and</v>

1502
00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.080
<v Speaker 1>putting in reps with the Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fallen the hooks up with coming to</v>

1503
00:59:08.081 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>the body and then the upper cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of stuff that ties together</v>

1504
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.720
<v Speaker 1>and it's a lot easier to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to flow,</v>

1505
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:16.150
<v Speaker 1>has to flow natural intuition boss</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you got here,</v>

1506
00:59:16.151 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about the level of mma</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1507
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 1>So fascinating because there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>depth and people are getting so much</v>

1508
00:59:22.311 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 1>better and there's so many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>styles and it just seems like such an</v>

1509
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:28.280
<v Speaker 1>exciting time right now for MMA.</v>

1510
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.430
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is really exciting for me.</v>

1511
00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.760
<v Speaker 7>The first big change that happened in</v>
<v Speaker 7>mma was that everybody knows in shape.</v>

1512
00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:36.670
<v Speaker 7>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you remember we had to all these guys</v>

1513
00:59:36.671 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 7>running out of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got it,</v>

1514
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:40.020
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like being a painter and half a</v>

1515
00:59:40.021 --> 00:59:42.720
<v Speaker 7>can of paint to a job or run out of</v>
<v Speaker 7>paint.</v>

1516
00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:44.730
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the dumbest thing.</v>

1517
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.680
<v Speaker 7>Go run a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One guy one time told me,</v>

1518
00:59:47.681 --> 00:59:48.640
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1519
00:59:48.641 --> 00:59:50.980
<v Speaker 7>but a heavyweight there shut gave</v>
<v Speaker 7>Valasquez and he goes,</v>

1520
00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:52.750
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he trains really hard</v>

1521
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:53.663
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Mexican.</v>

1522
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding?</v>

1523
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.010
<v Speaker 1>You're just giving the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just train really hard.</v>

1524
01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>And there's a science behind it now to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to train when the train</v>

1525
01:00:04.561 --> 01:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that hard and which ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know how to make your body</v>

1526
01:00:08.011 --> 01:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>bigger if you need to or faster if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need more endurance that train that way.</v>

1527
01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's just like all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports there is coming up real sport.</v>

1528
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:16.470

1539
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>he has a good cardio cause he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm down.</v>

1540

<v Speaker 1>If he shows up here early for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1565
01:01:37.511 --> 01:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Like give me some time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me read,</v>

1566
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.690
<v Speaker 1>let me read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1567
01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>good cause of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing your skillset and martial</v>

1568
01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>arts as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a purpose to it.</v>

1569
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about how interesting it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

1570
01:01:49.631 --> 01:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>how Dwayne has transitioned so well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to becoming a trainer,</v>

1571
01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that a challenge for you going from</v>

1572
01:01:54.821 --> 01:01:57.340
<v Speaker 1>being a great fighter to being a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer?</v>

1573
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.840
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1574
01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:02.500
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't for me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's always been like I'm riding</v>

1575
01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:03.400
<v Speaker 7>shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1576
01:02:03.401 --> 01:02:05.310
<v Speaker 7>each show or for Fritz what it meant to</v>
<v Speaker 7>be.</v>

1577
01:02:05.311 --> 01:02:07.240
<v Speaker 7>If we're talking about if a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if a student fights,</v>

1578
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:11.230
<v Speaker 7>I'm more nervous than the student at</v>
<v Speaker 7>that Modena would be when I would fight</v>

1579
01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:14.440
<v Speaker 7>for myself because then I'm in control.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So no,</v>

1580
01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's difficult if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the right student.</v>

1581
01:02:17.951 --> 01:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

1582
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>your student's not responding</v>

1583
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.330
<v Speaker 6>and they call.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1584
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 6>it's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a watch,</v>

1585
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:24.350
<v Speaker 6>you have dose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know it's,</v>

1586
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.380
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of them don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of these fighters don't listen to</v>

1587
01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:31.020
<v Speaker 6>their corners still til this day top</v>
<v Speaker 6>fighters.</v>

1588
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean you hit a corner constantly</v>
<v Speaker 6>screaming.</v>

1589
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.250
<v Speaker 6>They don't do what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They think they can see it better,</v>

1590
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:37.410
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But once there was a trust,</v>

1591
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:38.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and and,</v>

1592
01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:41.820
<v Speaker 6>and there was always a good trust</v>
<v Speaker 6>between Dwayne and myself and the same</v>

1593
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:45.060
<v Speaker 6>with him and Tj then he knows what</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're seeing.</v>

1594
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 6>That's probably going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1595
01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:48.330
<v Speaker 6>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he will do it.</v>

1596
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 6>Like if I would say four to Dwayne in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fight,</v>

1597
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.830
<v Speaker 6>it will come out less than a second</v>
<v Speaker 6>later.</v>

1598
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 6>I really just shout for Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Papa Echo mouth right away if you,</v>

1599
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 6>if you could enhance my voice when he's</v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting.</v>

1600
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.080
<v Speaker 6>It's a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He does.</v>

1601
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.590
<v Speaker 6>We need to get a bull horn listening,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get a bull horn.</v>

1602
01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:07.240
<v Speaker 6>The UFC shallot bullhorn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did that and UFC,</v>

1603
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.320
<v Speaker 6>I brought a mega phone because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 6>was screaming and they actually put it</v>

1604
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:17.010
<v Speaker 6>into contract after that that you could</v>
<v Speaker 6>watch my fight against go suck here.</v>

1605
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 6>Short combinations</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I figured in Japan they're quiet</v>

1606
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.490
<v Speaker 6>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's going to scream.</v>

1607
01:03:23.491 --> 01:03:24.660
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to hear them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So uh,</v>

1608
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 6>avi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Avi Rubin's the old owner of the Beverly</v>

1609
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.040
<v Speaker 6>Hills Jujitsu Club says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to bring a megaphone.</v>

1610
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1611
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.860
<v Speaker 6>that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a great,</v>

1612
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 6>what about just like a tube,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a roll of toilet paper or something</v>

1613
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:36.030
<v Speaker 6>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Up a piece of paper.</v>

1614
01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could that work?</v>

1615
01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 6>I'll try it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of those guards,</v>

1616
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:45.411
<v Speaker 6>cones I always go to when I seen him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason why I brought that up about a</v>

1617
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:49.290
<v Speaker 6>training fighters is because there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an interesting parallel between</v>

1618
01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 6>you two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>both great fighters and then both wind</v>

1619
01:03:51.451 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 6>up having great students.</v>

1620
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 6>You having Dwayne as a student and</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dwayne now having t j's is getting in a</v>

1621
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:57.181
<v Speaker 6>bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1622
01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:58.700
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot to that.</v>

1623
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 6>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1624
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:02.130
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's all connection and that's what</v>

1625
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 6>everything in life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1626
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:05.250
<v Speaker 6>once there is a connection that is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if people,</v>

1627
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

1628
01:04:06.101 --> 01:04:08.140
<v Speaker 6>if I don't care for him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1629
01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.960
<v Speaker 6>as he's not a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1630
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:12.570
<v Speaker 6>and that's what some fighters also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they come in to just work out,</v>

1631
01:04:12.571 --> 01:04:13.830
<v Speaker 6>they're gone again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1632
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 6>they don't build a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And once that happens it will,</v>

1633
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:18.000
<v Speaker 6>it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're fighting,</v>

1634
01:04:18.001 --> 01:04:19.260
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1635
01:04:19.261 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And for fighters it's really a problem</v>

1636
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:24.360
<v Speaker 6>when you build a relationship with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong trainer and then you've got to</v>

1637
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 6>leave that guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have this tight bond with someone</v>

1638
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 6>who doesn't really know enough.</v>

1639
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.240
<v Speaker 6>That's a hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1640
01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:33.930
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that many times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when they leave,</v>

1641
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:35.760
<v Speaker 6>people get super butthurt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets,</v>

1642
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.970
<v Speaker 6>it gets to be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But for,</v>

1643
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 6>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's real,</v>

1644
01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 6>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's always say,</v>

1645
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:42.510
<v Speaker 6>you know what I said to my daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

1646
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.490
<v Speaker 6>what do I tell the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just tell the truth.</v>

1647
01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:45.530
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't go wrong with it.</v>

1648
01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:46.364
<v Speaker 6>Truth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the guys.</v>

1649
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:47.190
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1650
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:50.280
<v Speaker 6>it says like on inside of him and me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say about a certified all he</v>

1651
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:52.510
<v Speaker 6>that kicks that sucked or this sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they say,</v>

1652
01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what if you're going to get him on</v>

1653
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:54.081
<v Speaker 6>the show?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I should,</v>

1654
01:04:54.081 --> 01:04:57.240
<v Speaker 6>I'll say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if he tells me that I'm wrong,</v>

1655
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.960
<v Speaker 6>he can't say because it did suck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1656
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.520
<v Speaker 6>you've got to just got to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing he can do.</v>

1657
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean they suck as a human</v>

1658
01:05:04.471 --> 01:05:07.260
<v Speaker 6>being.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not just means that in that moment that</v>

1659
01:05:07.261 --> 01:05:10.680
<v Speaker 6>was the wrong thing to do or they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>execute it properly or,</v>

1660
01:05:10.681 --> 01:05:11.290
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1661
01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:13.560
<v Speaker 6>And then I have to be on point too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as far as the trainer with the,</v>

1662
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.050
<v Speaker 6>with the fighters and coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I gotta make sure I'm calling the</v>

1663
01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 6>right commands at right time as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that</v>

1664
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 4>goes back to the relationship that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have and making sure you have that</v>

1665
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:21.570
<v Speaker 4>connection</v>

1666
01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:23.500
<v Speaker 6>when you also have to know your fighters</v>
<v Speaker 6>capability.</v>

1667
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you have a great race horse,</v>

1668
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'd be,</v>

1669
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 6>everything becomes so much more</v>
<v Speaker 6>interesting because you have all these</v>

1670
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:31.000
<v Speaker 6>options</v>

1671
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.020
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you're going to have so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental behind it too.</v>

1672
01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Like Twain knows how to coach me to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1673
01:05:36.451 --> 01:05:39.840
<v Speaker 3>like not everyone responds to negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

1674
01:05:39.841 --> 01:05:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Not some people will respond to negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>

1675
01:05:42.151 --> 01:05:43.200
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Danny Castillo,</v>

1676
01:05:43.201 --> 01:05:45.450
<v Speaker 3>you got to tell Danny could steal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're doing that like an idiot</v>

1677
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:47.400
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different things that you know,</v>

1678
01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:48.031
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1679
01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll do a better with me and Dwayne.</v>

1680
01:05:49.801 --> 01:05:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Someone where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1681
01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.370
<v Speaker 3>I've got to pump the guy up maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

1682
01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.300
<v Speaker 3>tell him what he's doing right instead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what he's doing wrong.</v>

1683
01:05:54.301 --> 01:05:56.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you gotta know how to coach each</v>

1684
01:05:56.101 --> 01:05:58.170
<v Speaker 3>fighter and once you build that</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>

1685
01:05:58.171 --> 01:06:00.270
<v Speaker 3>like bosses talking about and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it go.</v>

1686
01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very few things that are as</v>

1687
01:06:02.461 --> 01:06:04.190
<v Speaker 3>painful as listening to bad corner work.</v>

1688
01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:04.801
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1689
01:06:04.801 --> 01:06:05.461
<v Speaker 6>that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>around the corner,</v>

1691
01:06:08.341 --> 01:06:10.380
<v Speaker 6>cross blue cross.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

1692
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.500
<v Speaker 6>he just went.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want him to throw a right hand</v>

1693
01:06:13.501 --> 01:06:14.520
<v Speaker 6>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1694
01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:17.910
<v Speaker 6>let him keep that here so the liver is</v>
<v Speaker 6>protected and I go,</v>

1695
01:06:17.911 --> 01:06:18.990
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's an idiot.</v>

1696
01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.240
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who does that?</v>

1697
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.710
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 6>tight once he pulled me in a one time I</v>

<v Speaker 6>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has deep is a good guy.</v>

1714
01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:58.290
<v Speaker 6>When we were talking about his</v>
<v Speaker 6>composure.</v>

1715
01:06:58.410 --> 01:06:59.091
<v Speaker 6>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1716
01:06:59.091 --> 01:07:01.680
<v Speaker 6>So composed like in Brazil when he</v>
<v Speaker 6>fought for Breeshia,</v>

1717
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:04.830
<v Speaker 6>when he's wanting to stare down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's just dead faced.</v>

1718
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:08.070
<v Speaker 6>He's got his own dead face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like a fade or dead face or</v>

1719
01:07:08.071 --> 01:07:10.530
<v Speaker 6>cane dead face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got his own dead phase.</v>

1720
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.470
<v Speaker 6>But those guys that can just stay</v>
<v Speaker 6>completely calm,</v>

1721
01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in that incredible environment of being</v>

1722
01:07:16.381 --> 01:07:20.220

<v Speaker 6>45,000 plus people screaming for</v>

1723
01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.510
<v Speaker 6>Fabrizie over doom when he just shuts</v>
<v Speaker 6>his lights out</v>

<v Speaker 4>with our own or main battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1725

<v Speaker 4>It's being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to control ourselves and he's looks to</v>

1726
01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:31.760
<v Speaker 4>have mastered that ability to control</v>
<v Speaker 4>his own emotions and make sure he's</v>

1727
01:07:31.761 --> 01:07:34.130
<v Speaker 4>directing the energy and the right path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Steve Bay,</v>

<v Speaker 6>the way connor got into all those head.</v>

1731
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.500
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess that was a masterclass in</v>

1732
01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:48.870
<v Speaker 6>fucking with someone's head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

1733
01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:54.070
<v Speaker 6>Connor took Aldo completely out of his</v>
<v Speaker 6>element or he was just so frazzled by</v>

1734
01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:56.310
<v Speaker 6>the time they actually met each other</v>
<v Speaker 6>inside the octagon.</v>

1735
01:07:56.311 --> 01:07:58.680
<v Speaker 6>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we had the overeem and a steep,</v>

1736
01:07:58.681 --> 01:08:00.980
<v Speaker 6>it is just same as home and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and a Raji,</v>

1737
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:03.150
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rousey's intimidating.</v>

1738
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:03.870
<v Speaker 6>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>

1739
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:05.400
<v Speaker 6>the way she is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she,</v>

1740
01:08:05.401 --> 01:08:08.730
<v Speaker 6>when she started at the stare down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when she lost it because she</v>

1741
01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:11.450
<v Speaker 6>realized holly didn't care at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1742
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.500
<v Speaker 6>She was just there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to hurt you.</v>

1743
01:08:13.501 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 6>That was at as the same as everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 6>intimidated by</v>

1744
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 7>overeem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you should be because he's a</v>

1745
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 7>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think open could see in his face</v>

1746
01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:21.660
<v Speaker 7>already,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's,</v>

1747
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.170
<v Speaker 7>he's not intimidated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This guy has absolutely no,</v>

1748
01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 7>and then when you fight a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that that little voice starts playing in</v>

1749
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:29.720
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in your mind when it gets bad,</v>

1750
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:31.850
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's why maybe we saw these crazy</v>

1751
01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:33.500
<v Speaker 7>things of running away,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1752
01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:35.450
<v Speaker 7>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I say it's a good thing because I said</v>

1753
01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:37.220
<v Speaker 7>the same thing against conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

1754
01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:38.820
<v Speaker 7>for a big,</v>
<v Speaker 7>huge heavyweight,</v>

1755
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.490
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't look good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1756
01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:43.340
<v Speaker 7>and now you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you set yourself up more as a victim</v>

1757
01:08:43.341 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 7>because he's following you in tech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that all is an input in your,</v>

1758
01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:49.160
<v Speaker 7>in your own brain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because now you start telling yourself,</v>

1759
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:50.810
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know everybody thinks I'm a,</v>

1760
01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.480
<v Speaker 7>I'm hurt or that I'm afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Am I afraid?</v>

1761
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.880
<v Speaker 7>I'm even know there's the whole doubt</v>
<v Speaker 7>thing that goes on in the mind.</v>

1762
01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:59.230
<v Speaker 7>There's always these two voices.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I say the one voice wants to quit that</v>

1763
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 7>the other voice wants to go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1764
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a really bad situation.</v>

1765
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:03.321
<v Speaker 7>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1766
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:04.280
<v Speaker 7>call it quits.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gullah cuisine.</v>

1767
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:05.280
<v Speaker 7>And then some of the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1768
01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:05.790
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1769
01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:06.011
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wait,</v>

1770
01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:06.650
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait.</v>

1771
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:07.270
<v Speaker 7>We're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1772
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:07.791
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's just,</v>

1773
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 7>let's just see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1774
01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.420
<v Speaker 7>and then suddenly you come out of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>situation.</v>

1775
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.090
<v Speaker 7>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was about to tap in my second fight</v>

1776
01:09:14.091 --> 01:09:14.631
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

1777
01:09:14.631 --> 01:09:16.190
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then the audience started cheering</v>

1778
01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 7>for him and then my ego took over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

1779
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:20.750
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get out of the situation and then 30</v>

1780
01:09:20.751 --> 01:09:22.340
<v Speaker 7>seconds later and knocked him out to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>need to deliver,</v>

1781
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:23.263
<v Speaker 7>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1782
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:27.890
<v Speaker 7>this is the last time I'm going to think</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that because the bat boy stay away</v>

1783
01:09:27.891 --> 01:09:28.730
<v Speaker 7>from the bad voice.</v>

1784
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.680
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Focus on what you can control and that</v>

1785
01:09:30.681 --> 01:09:31.281
<v Speaker 7>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1786
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:33.530
<v Speaker 7>Do you ever use any psychological</v>
<v Speaker 7>training?</v>

1787
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:35.900
<v Speaker 7>Did you ever talk to a sports</v>
<v Speaker 7>psychologist or anything like that or is</v>

1788
01:09:35.901 --> 01:09:37.460
<v Speaker 7>they're all self taught?</v>
<v Speaker 7>All self taught,</v>

1789
01:09:37.461 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 7>but what I did a lot is talking to</v>
<v Speaker 7>myself and people might laugh about</v>

1790
01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:43.970
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm very honest to myself.</v>

1791
01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.620
<v Speaker 7>Like people say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh you nervous to fight?</v>

1792
01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:46.760
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1793
01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:47.540
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why not?</v>

1794
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 7>What can happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What can really happen?</v>

1795
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 7>He's got to knock me out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Matt's going to be hard because it never</v>

1796
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:53.900
<v Speaker 7>happened before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if it happens while I'm not going to</v>

1797
01:09:53.901 --> 01:09:55.760
<v Speaker 7>feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>apparently you know you're going to go</v>

1798
01:09:55.761 --> 01:09:57.650
<v Speaker 7>down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Submission is the submission.</v>

1799
01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.800
<v Speaker 7>Is that really so bad?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to tab so what is so really so</v>

1800
01:10:00.801 --> 01:10:01.251
<v Speaker 7>bad?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1801
01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:04.990
<v Speaker 7>the really bad thing is listening to all</v>
<v Speaker 7>the crap that older,</v>

1802
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 7>the not so good fats are going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 7>you afterwards is social media,</v>

1803
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:12.050
<v Speaker 7>but if you just scare you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>remember the last time I told the story</v>

1804
01:10:12.051 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 7>from in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you take a fighter and and who's</v>

1805
01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:16.790
<v Speaker 7>normally a nerve is final.</v>

1806
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:19.340
<v Speaker 7>This is what I tell my students who are</v>
<v Speaker 7>nervous when they have to compete.</v>

1807
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:20.151
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1808
01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:22.820
<v Speaker 7>imagine now the guys right here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We put you in the room,</v>

1809
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:25.130
<v Speaker 7>we locked the door.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody can go in there.</v>

1810
01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.900
<v Speaker 7>You guys fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when you come out,</v>

1811
01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 7>you're not allowed to say who want to</v>
<v Speaker 7>lose.</v>

1812
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.530
<v Speaker 7>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you really care if you,</v>

1813
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.030
<v Speaker 7>if you would lose it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He goes,</v>

1814
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:33.160
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because everybody can lose.</v>

1815
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:33.850
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1816
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 7>that's the mindset you should have when</v>
<v Speaker 7>you go into a fight.</v>

1817
01:10:36.051 --> 01:10:37.790
<v Speaker 7>That's my mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1818
01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:39.400
<v Speaker 7>winning or losing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm gonna win.</v>

1819
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:40.690
<v Speaker 7>I'm gonna do everything in my power to</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

1820
01:10:40.691 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 7>But if I lose,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so what?</v>

1821
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.730
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're human and we come out of it.</v>

1822
01:10:43.731 --> 01:10:45.890
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you make you overcomplicate things,</v>

1823
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.620
<v Speaker 7>certain combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I said it's a four and then I,</v>

1824
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:51.980
<v Speaker 7>I do four punches to the head and then I</v>
<v Speaker 7>say I'm going to,</v>

1825
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:53.840
<v Speaker 7>we stayed with this combination.</v>

1826
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.060
<v Speaker 7>The only thing we're going to change</v>
<v Speaker 7>either heights,</v>

1827
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.340
<v Speaker 7>so now I'm going to say for you to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>four points,</v>

1828
01:10:58.341 --> 01:10:59.480
<v Speaker 7>it's a left,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right straight,</v>

1829
01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:00.530
<v Speaker 7>left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right straight.</v>

1830
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.671
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to share.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1831
01:11:01.671 --> 01:11:03.010
<v Speaker 7>Body had had had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1832
01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 7>you're the first one has to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>body.</v>

1833
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 7>Had had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>had body,</v>

1834
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:07.340
<v Speaker 7>body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>had hat head,</v>

1835
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:08.060
<v Speaker 7>body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>head,</v>

1836
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.460
<v Speaker 7>body had buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean now you can make like 12</v>

1837
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.860
<v Speaker 7>combinations from just a four punch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1838
01:11:12.861 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 7>And but some people when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I tell it to my students sometimes</v>

1839
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:17.380
<v Speaker 7>they overthink it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They go to,</v>

1840
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 7>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said no,</v>

1841
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 7>just in body hat do the same</v>
<v Speaker 7>combination.</v>

1842
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 7>But they start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh that's the liver shot that no,</v>

1843
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.540
<v Speaker 7>that's not liver shot to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just,</v>

1844
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.740
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>keep it simple.</v>

1845
01:11:25.741 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 7>And once you can keep it simple,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's much easier to,</v>

1846
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:29.800
<v Speaker 7>to do.</v>

1847
01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that we were</v>

1848
01:11:30.821 --> 01:11:32.160
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the,</v>

1849
01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:37.180
<v Speaker 2>the amount of fighting that is mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the amount that is your attitude and</v>

1850
01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:41.770
<v Speaker 2>how you feel about things and how you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into things and just your enthusiasm.</v>

1851
01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Like Travis Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about Travis Browne,</v>

1852
01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:48.400
<v Speaker 2>who earlier in his career was this</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stone cold killer.</v>

1853
01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had all his crazy footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He throw a lot of kicks and memory.</v>

1854
01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Speaker 2>We knocked out Stephan's true that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Superman Punch,</v>

1855
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1856
01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so unpredictable and wild.</v>

1857
01:11:58.771 --> 01:12:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker's can be the</v>

1858
01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:02.090
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just give him out,</v>

1859
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:04.570
<v Speaker 2>give him some time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he moved to Jackson's is</v>

1860
01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:07.570
<v Speaker 2>training and a great camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just doesn't seem,</v>

1861
01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe as a few losses in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't seem to have that fire in</v>

1862
01:12:11.291 --> 01:12:11.570
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1863
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:15.620
<v Speaker 7>Did he lose when he was at objections?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He chased Kemp's,</v>

1864
01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.530
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Started losing after you change camps</v>

1865
01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.810
<v Speaker 7>most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that's what I tell people,</v>

1866
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 7>like my stretch routine and every time</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I say this they,</v>

1867
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:25.050
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they ask me what it's just routine.</v>

1868
01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:29.000
<v Speaker 7>I do the same stretch of team as I did</v>
<v Speaker 7>23 years ago when I started.</v>

1869
01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.240
<v Speaker 7>Same routine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the reason is it never got me an</v>

1870
01:12:32.241 --> 01:12:34.460
<v Speaker 7>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if it's a winning combination,</v>

1871
01:12:34.461 --> 01:12:36.110
<v Speaker 7>don't break it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's the same with your team.</v>

1872
01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.390
<v Speaker 7>If it's a winning combination,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do not break it.</v>

1873
01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:40.460
<v Speaker 7>Once you bring,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many fighters do you see changing</v>

1874
01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:44.630
<v Speaker 7>camp or firing as a trainer of firing</v>
<v Speaker 7>the manager or somebody who always</v>

1875
01:12:44.631 --> 01:12:47.030
<v Speaker 7>helped him and suddenly they started</v>
<v Speaker 7>losing you.</v>

1876
01:12:47.031 --> 01:12:49.250
<v Speaker 7>You broke the spell or whatever you want</v>
<v Speaker 7>to call it,</v>

1877
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.310
<v Speaker 7>the mystical thing that was going on</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was working.</v>

1878
01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:53.510
<v Speaker 7>Don't break it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why would you,</v>

1879
01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so rare that you find the</v>

1880
01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:58.620
<v Speaker 2>perfect person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're with Johnny mcfuck stick</v>

1881
01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.240
<v Speaker 2>in Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ohio,</v>

1882
01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:02.750
<v Speaker 2>and he's a shitty coach and you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them forever and you've got this</v>

1883
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.860
<v Speaker 2>weird bond with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for Rasa,</v>

1884
01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:06.090
<v Speaker 2>hobby wants to train you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1885
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 2>God damn.</v>

1886
01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:08.430
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what do you do?</v>

1887
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:11.280
<v Speaker 7>And everybody runs into bus route and</v>
<v Speaker 7>right off the bat,</v>

1888
01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 7>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all my students,</v>

1889
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.010
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>

1890
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.550
<v Speaker 7>I teach straight down two times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Go anywhere you want any gym.</v>

1891
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.130
<v Speaker 7>I don't mind guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You want a spar without a guide to go</v>

1892
01:13:20.131 --> 01:13:22.780
<v Speaker 7>anywhere you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the problem is if you have that guy</v>

1893
01:13:22.781 --> 01:13:24.510
<v Speaker 7>we were talking about it doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 7>anything,</v>

1894
01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.460
<v Speaker 7>he's going to be butthurt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's going to be okay.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You cannot go.</v>

1896
01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:31.070
<v Speaker 7>But a good coach will say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go just straight everywhere.</v>

1897
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 7>If he can find something better.</v>

1898
01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Perfect examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duke Roufus,</v>

1899
01:13:34.561 --> 01:13:38.940
<v Speaker 2>who's a great coach and Pedis Pedis</v>
<v Speaker 2>started training at Jackson.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You want a different things,</v>

1901
01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:42.870
<v Speaker 2>you want to mix things up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had some great times.</v>

1902
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he also cares about Anthony Pettis.</v>

<v Speaker 7>He wants him to grow,</v>

1904
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:48.901
<v Speaker 7>and so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:52.220
<v Speaker 7>please go do this new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every time I went up and trim,</v>

1906
01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:53.580
<v Speaker 7>if Rasa Tristar,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he loved it.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1909

<v Speaker 7>it's a new technique grow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1910

<v Speaker 7>Those are real friends.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a real people that care about you</v>

1911
01:13:59.761 --> 01:14:01.350
<v Speaker 7>and they want you to have the best thing</v>
<v Speaker 7>in your life.</v>

1912
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.800
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dwight [inaudible] cabs,</v>

1913
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.030
<v Speaker 7>she got show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

1914
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.923
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

1915
01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a small handful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a half a dozen or more of really</v>

1916
01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 2>truly</v>

1917
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 4>elite camps right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1918
01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:17.080
<v Speaker 4>there's American top team of course is</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a few that you could go over,</v>

1919
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.660
<v Speaker 4>but of places where you're really kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of can't go wrong,</v>

1920
01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:23.880
<v Speaker 4>it's really just a matter of finding the</v>
<v Speaker 4>right combination for you too.</v>

1921
01:14:23.881 --> 01:14:24.371
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1922
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:26.620
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some camps are more grappling heavy and</v>

1923
01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:29.590
<v Speaker 4>you might be back a more of a striker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've seen that happen to,</v>

1924
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:31.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys just kind of get the wrong</v>

1925
01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:33.160
<v Speaker 4>formula.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the thing,</v>

1926
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:36.540
<v Speaker 4>if you're a great striker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to a more grappling oriented camp.</v>

1927
01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 4>That's what I always say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to striking.</v>

1928
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 4>That's what I decided.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1929
01:14:40.691 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forget about striking three times a day</v>

1930
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:45.010
<v Speaker 4>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it never lost again.</v>

1931
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.060
<v Speaker 4>It's just doing what you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable at and do that a lot and</v>

1932
01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:50.890
<v Speaker 4>make sure you get comfortable at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that's it.</v>

1933
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 4>Wonderboy is great example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You started training with Weidman who</v>

1934
01:14:54.401 --> 01:14:58.240
<v Speaker 4>was a great wrestler and it just</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely changed his confidence and</v>

1935
01:14:58.241 --> 01:15:00.610
<v Speaker 4>his stand up and now he's so loose</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing up,</v>

1936
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.410
<v Speaker 4>you're getting to see the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderboy.</v>

1937
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.060
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like 57 and [inaudible]</v>

1938
01:15:05.061 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 4>was a kickboxer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing,</v>

1939
01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:09.610
<v Speaker 4>crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you see those skills now because</v>

1940
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.500
<v Speaker 4>good luck taking that guy down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1941
01:15:11.501 --> 01:15:11.951
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1942
01:15:11.951 --> 01:15:13.840
<v Speaker 4>he's getting mauled by Chris Weidman all</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1943
01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a big one,</v>

1944
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.630
<v Speaker 4>85 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1945
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:20.730
<v Speaker 4>there's so many levels to mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 4>arts,</v>

1946
01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.480
<v Speaker 4>so many areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we could obviously take the,</v>

1947
01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 4>the three easy ones with the striking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrestling and the grappling,</v>

1948
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:28.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with those now,</v>

1949
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 4>what's your style?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your skill set?</v>

1950
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.710
<v Speaker 4>And now with that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to make sure you're getting</v>

1951
01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:35.440
<v Speaker 4>with the best people in those three</v>
<v Speaker 4>areas or something that we could take in</v>

1952
01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:37.120
<v Speaker 4>the fourth account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which since I said earlier,</v>

1953
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 4>is the conditioning aspect now.</v>

1954
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:41.920
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can't just go to one guy,</v>

1955
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.670
<v Speaker 4>he can't just go to a boxing coach with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the boxing coach isn't really familiar</v>

1956
01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:48.490
<v Speaker 4>with mma because things are different as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you point out today with the distances,</v>

1957
01:15:48.491 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then using the switches because of</v>

1958
01:15:49.901 --> 01:15:52.360
<v Speaker 4>the further distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to make sure you have the</v>

1959
01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:54.730
<v Speaker 4>correct people that understand the mixed</v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts game.</v>

1960
01:15:54.731 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 4>Because if you go to an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cried the guy who doesn't understand</v>

1961
01:15:58.211 --> 01:15:59.740
<v Speaker 4>where me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to work no matter how</v>

1962
01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:01.540
<v Speaker 4>much you guys love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not gonna work.</v>

1963
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 4>You have to have mma in the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling coach doesn't know how to</v>

1964
01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 4>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1965
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to learn how to close the</v>
<v Speaker 4>distances with punches,</v>

1966
01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:09.180
<v Speaker 4>the build time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>time your takedowns,</v>

1967
01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.970
<v Speaker 4>he's going to want to grab a hold of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and move you around to shoot on you.</v>

1968
01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:12.760
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1969
01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.880
<v Speaker 4>we might also not understand where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in vulnerable positions for</v>

1970
01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:18.190
<v Speaker 4>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of wrestlers are still shoot</v>

1971
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:19.750
<v Speaker 4>that double with the neck on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside,</v>

1972
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean they just haven't figured the</v>

1973
01:16:22.571 --> 01:16:25.090
<v Speaker 4>distance out or the difference in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the technique out.</v>

1974
01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:25.871
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agreed.</v>

1975
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:27.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I love this,</v>

1976
01:16:27.011 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 4>this tree on this lineage because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking what since it has done as much as</v>

1977
01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:32.200
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then what I've done and then adding that</v>

1978
01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:35.050
<v Speaker 4>up and I'll pass it and Tj is way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a direct line of lineage of</v>

1979
01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:38.160
<v Speaker 4>martial arts information that's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>expedited and it's,</v>

1980
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:39.970
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's awesome to have an actual march</v>

1981
01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:42.520
<v Speaker 4>start family and just keep passing on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the knowledge.</v>

1982
01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.700
<v Speaker 4>It's fun for me as a martial art nerd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also interesting because Tj has</v>

1983
01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:49.090
<v Speaker 4>that wrestling background as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I think that's a big factor in</v>

1984
01:16:49.091 --> 01:16:52.810
<v Speaker 4>his success because he's incorporating</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of your techniques and your</v>

1985
01:16:52.811 --> 01:16:56.780
<v Speaker 4>techniques and then on top of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got that elite athleticism and</v>

1986
01:16:56.781 --> 01:16:59.860
<v Speaker 4>then the wrestling base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got awesome take down defense</v>

1987
01:16:59.861 --> 01:17:02.980
<v Speaker 4>and take downs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also I really firmly believe there's</v>

1988
01:17:02.981 --> 01:17:07.981
<v Speaker 4>something about wrestlers that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>grind of dieting and starving yourself</v>

1989
01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 4>and yourself and</v>

1990
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.600
<v Speaker 3>the mental toughness that breed that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1991
01:17:12.601 --> 01:17:15.620
<v Speaker 3>you get from certain wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's off the charts.</v>

1992
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I've still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never done anything harder than</v>

1993
01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:20.000
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with all the aspects of martial</v>

1994
01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:22.910
<v Speaker 3>arts and fighting like fighting to me is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a lot,</v>

1995
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.370
<v Speaker 3>lot easier than a grind of a wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>

1996
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:27.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rest of the cal state fullerton where</v>

1997
01:17:27.201 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 3>we started way too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Lik I said,</v>

1998
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I overworked myself and push through a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ninth month season.</v>

1999
01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Being completely strict on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Diet,</v>

2000
01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2001
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:37.940
<v Speaker 3>I can't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going out and having fun with my</v>

2002
01:17:37.941 --> 01:17:41.420
<v Speaker 3>friends because I'm wrestling and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling every weekend and just such a</v>

2003
01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:42.240
<v Speaker 3>hard practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2004
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.950
<v Speaker 3>still today we do two days a week like</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant practices.</v>

2005
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

2006
01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love wrestling.</v>

2007
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna have to go really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like man wrestling,</v>

2008
01:17:51.711 --> 01:17:52.140
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>

2009
01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tough man.</v>

2010
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:55.070
<v Speaker 3>And it definitely does breed mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>toughness.</v>

2011
01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:58.280
<v Speaker 3>And then you're learning how to compete</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your own every weekend.</v>

2012
01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.100
<v Speaker 3>When you're training a team elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you doing wrestling practice,</v>

2013
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 3>are you doing strictly wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you putting wrestling shoes on and</v>

2014
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:09.791
<v Speaker 3>you're doing like full on wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like a competition between your,</v>

2015
01:18:10.161 --> 01:18:12.860
<v Speaker 3>your teammates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing that of we do that as well</v>

2016
01:18:12.861 --> 01:18:14.120
<v Speaker 3>as we'll do it even may wrestling as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2017
01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different forms of it.</v>

2018
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:16.670
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go through my wrestling shoes on</v>

2019
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.110
<v Speaker 3>and we're doing matches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2020
01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:20.330
<v Speaker 3>it depends on where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll do situations and yeah,</v>

2021
01:18:20.331 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 3>we're doing full on real wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>practices.</v>

2022
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Is there a benefit to having wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes on though?</v>

2023
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Because you're not going to fight with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them on your defense will become way</v>

2024
01:18:28.401 --> 01:18:31.250
<v Speaker 3>better if you wear shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so much easier to get out of a</v>

2025
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:31.910
<v Speaker 3>take down without it.</v>

2026
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:35.010
<v Speaker 3>You can't like a single leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should not get taken down in a</v>

2027
01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:37.070
<v Speaker 3>single like anyone may.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do your,</v>

2028
01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's so easy to slide your leg</v>
<v Speaker 3>out on a single leg,</v>

2029
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 3>but with a wrestling shoe on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

2030
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.000
<v Speaker 3>I can't just go to that easy defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to use my hips,</v>

2031
01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:46.460
<v Speaker 3>have to cover his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to use all these positions that</v>

2032
01:18:46.461 --> 01:18:49.430
<v Speaker 3>have a better defense with my shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a difference between like</v>

2033
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:52.730
<v Speaker 3>grappling with g Nogi is or that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing.</v>

2034
01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

2035
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.150
<v Speaker 3>so in college I shot high singles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I shot at shoot a high</v>

2036
01:18:56.151 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 3>single and got tried to turn and kick</v>
<v Speaker 3>out catches shoe and then take us back</v>

2037
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:01.940
<v Speaker 3>and MMA guy turns and kicks out all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2038
01:19:01.941 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 3>So high single eggs not going to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2039
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.290
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like with,</v>

2040
01:19:05.291 --> 01:19:07.190
<v Speaker 3>with the G on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get away with certain things.</v>

2041
01:19:07.191 --> 01:19:09.580
<v Speaker 3>You can't just slip out of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a submission can just slip out of an arm</v>

2042
01:19:09.581 --> 01:19:12.020
<v Speaker 3>bar and roll out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You actually have to have the real</v>

2043
01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:15.230
<v Speaker 3>technique of getting out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this guy is so good at it,</v>

2044
01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:15.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

2045
01:19:15.961 --> 01:19:17.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's learning you to do the defense the</v>

2046
01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:19.220
<v Speaker 3>right way instead of using the cheat</v>
<v Speaker 3>moves.</v>

2047
01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:20.630
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

2048
01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:21.464
<v Speaker 3>Does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2049
01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.470
<v Speaker 3>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would it be okay if you did it with no</v>

2050
01:19:24.471 --> 01:19:27.980
<v Speaker 3>shoes on and your opponent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it with shoes on because that way</v>

2051
01:19:27.981 --> 01:19:32.390
<v Speaker 3>you would have the slipperiness of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>careful wrestling against the kid that I</v>

2052
01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:34.400
<v Speaker 3>knew it was coming in from like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>college and he's really good.</v>

2053
01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:37.130
<v Speaker 3>I am not wearing shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

2054
01:19:37.131 --> 01:19:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to wear it.</v>

2055
01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.520
<v Speaker 3>She was like Chad Mendez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the best wrestlers in the</v>

2056
01:19:40.521 --> 01:19:43.160
<v Speaker 3>world at practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll never ever wear shoes.</v>

2057
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Now he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his defense is ridiculous.</v>

2058
01:19:45.111 --> 01:19:48.620
<v Speaker 3>He just pushes you off his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the way he'll stand now too is</v>

2059
01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:51.140
<v Speaker 3>because he'll only let you shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 3>single day cause he knows how easy it is</v>

2060
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 3>to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2061
01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:54.500
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll never ever wear shoes again.</v>

2062
01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Wrestling ever since grappling though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think the,</v>

2063
01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the injuries,</v>

2064
01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:01.730
<v Speaker 3>the twisting niece come from shoes</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing shoes because a lot of guys,</v>

2065
01:20:01.731 --> 01:20:04.460
<v Speaker 3>they do it on the wrestling mat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's still okay because it might slip</v>

2066
01:20:04.461 --> 01:20:06.320
<v Speaker 3>a little bit about as soon as you step</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the judo mat,</v>

2067
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 3>which you're planting</v>

2068
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 6>your feet and then with upper body</v>
<v Speaker 6>motion rotation,</v>

2069
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.070
<v Speaker 6>something's going to twist because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 6>of injuries happened with wrestling,</v>

2070
01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2071
01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to get better.</v>

2072
01:20:15.331 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 3>You've got a bit of traction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you gotta know.</v>

2073
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:18.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to know what you're,</v>

2074
01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've wrestled my entire life positioning</v>

2075
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 3>with wrestling shoes on and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it creates better habits to</v>

2076
01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:27.210
<v Speaker 3>have your shoes on while wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2077
01:20:27.211 --> 01:20:28.700
<v Speaker 3>cause you're not going to be able to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>away with the,</v>

2078
01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 3>we call it a stinky lake where you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>whip your leg out.</v>

2079
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have a grip and it's what you want</v>

2080
01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:36.960
<v Speaker 3>is to grip above your knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as I get your grip below my</v>

2081
01:20:36.961 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 3>knee just by pushing it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>

2082
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm just sliding my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be a similar situation to</v>

2083
01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:41.851
<v Speaker 3>wearing gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2084
01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Like when trying to limp arm at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain positions you have and you kind</v>

2085
01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:46.170
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets,</v>

2086
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.770
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard to finish two clubs on</v>
<v Speaker 3>any kind of grappling we do at elevation</v>

2087
01:20:49.771 --> 01:20:51.030
<v Speaker 3>is with our gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2088
01:20:51.031 --> 01:20:52.800
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm catching certain moves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>risks.</v>

2089
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.900
<v Speaker 3>I can risk ride differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2090
01:20:54.901 --> 01:20:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I could chokes are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't cite it as easy behind your</v>

2091
01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:58.430
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to learn all those things with,</v>

2092
01:20:58.431 --> 01:20:59.340
<v Speaker 3>with gloves on as well.</v>

2093
01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:03.010
<v Speaker 6>Some people think that it would be a</v>
<v Speaker 6>safer sport without gloves.</v>

2094
01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:08.460
<v Speaker 6>Probably</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be less whole bloody lot more</v>

2095
01:21:08.921 --> 01:21:09.970
<v Speaker 6>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more grown up my bloody,</v>

2096
01:21:09.971 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guts and everything and to breaking</v>

2097
01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:13.930
<v Speaker 6>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2098
01:21:13.931 --> 01:21:16.840
<v Speaker 6>But you would learn a lot more effective</v>
<v Speaker 6>striking look,</v>

2099
01:21:16.841 --> 01:21:21.070
<v Speaker 6>you really couldn't just unload on a guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>and just hit anything.</v>

2100
01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:23.230
<v Speaker 3>Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was up training with Tristar.</v>

2101
01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:23.861
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2102
01:21:23.861 --> 01:21:27.280
<v Speaker 3>I recommend at least once a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once every other day hitting them back</v>

2103
01:21:27.281 --> 01:21:28.300
<v Speaker 3>with no gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2104
01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:30.250
<v Speaker 3>get that proper technique of no one had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hit,</v>

2105
01:21:30.251 --> 01:21:31.990
<v Speaker 3>something with no gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have that padding and</v>

2106
01:21:31.991 --> 01:21:34.210
<v Speaker 3>protecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I've got a 16 or a 10 ounce glove,</v>

2107
01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:36.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to just go away on my bag and</v>
<v Speaker 3>punching as hard as they want it.</v>

2108
01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2109
01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.450
<v Speaker 3>But if I don't have gloves on and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting that as hard as I can,</v>

2110
01:21:40.451 --> 01:21:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I have to hit it correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to have your right knuckle</v>

2111
01:21:42.161 --> 01:21:43.840
<v Speaker 3>policemen to put it on that bag.</v>

2112
01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:47.020
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's what a lot of karate and</v>
<v Speaker 6>traditional martial arts guys believe.</v>

2113
01:21:47.021 --> 01:21:50.140
<v Speaker 6>They believe that those gloves are</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually giving you the soul sort of</v>

2114
01:21:50.141 --> 01:21:52.390
<v Speaker 6>false sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of your abilities,</v>

2115
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause your,</v>

2116
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.600
<v Speaker 6>your risks are all wrapped up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your hands are all wrapped up.</v>

2117
01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:56.463
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get the question,</v>

2118
01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:58.690
<v Speaker 6>how many times did he break his hands in</v>
<v Speaker 6>a street fight?</v>

2119
01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:02.620
<v Speaker 6>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mitch blood green because they perfectly</v>

2120
01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.060
<v Speaker 6>tape his hands up and training and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he had to it has to hit without on</v>

2121
01:22:07.061 --> 01:22:07.871
<v Speaker 6>the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2122
01:22:07.871 --> 01:22:10.660
<v Speaker 6>hitting a bag and but because if you do</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wrong,</v>

2123
01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.850
<v Speaker 6>like if you're hitting a bag,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bare knuckle,</v>

2124
01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.960
<v Speaker 6>because I had a guy who told me my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my coach is really good coach because</v>

2125
01:22:16.961 --> 01:22:19.480
<v Speaker 6>she lets us hit the back until our hands</v>
<v Speaker 6>bleed.</v>

2126
01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.130
<v Speaker 6>I say you'll coach is an idiot.</v>

2127
01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.970
<v Speaker 6>That's what your coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because if this happens for weeks before</v>

2128
01:22:24.971 --> 01:22:26.800
<v Speaker 6>to fly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd guess what's going to happen every</v>

2129
01:22:26.801 --> 01:22:27.581
<v Speaker 6>single word,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

2130
01:22:27.581 --> 01:22:29.320
<v Speaker 6>when you hit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to reopen the cuts.</v>

2131
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.310
<v Speaker 6>It's going to hurt every first.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh for your workout,</v>

2132
01:22:33.311 --> 01:22:34.000
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2133
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.670
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you do it perfect and the impact of</v>

2134
01:22:36.671 --> 01:22:38.710
<v Speaker 6>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but as soon as she hit and you slide a</v>

2135
01:22:38.711 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 6>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you shave a knuckle love.</v>

2136
01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:43.810
<v Speaker 6>Well four weeks before the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not going to heal anymore because</v>

2137
01:22:43.811 --> 01:22:47.110
<v Speaker 6>you have reopen it every time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the interesting things about MMA</v>

2138
01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.460
<v Speaker 6>is how we're still kind of learning and</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no right approach for everybody.</v>

2139
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.610
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's approach is definitely the</v>
<v Speaker 6>approach for Damien Maia is going to be</v>

2140
01:22:54.611 --> 01:22:56.860
<v Speaker 6>different than the approach for</v>
<v Speaker 6>wonderboy is going to be different than</v>

2141
01:22:56.861 --> 01:22:58.600
<v Speaker 6>your approach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

2142
01:22:58.601 --> 01:23:00.880
<v Speaker 6>it's so difficult to figure out who's</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2143
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.460
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's really based on the success</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the past.</v>

2144
01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.770
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we take away the gloves and turn into</v>

2145
01:23:05.771 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 6>wonder</v>

2146
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.830
<v Speaker 5>boys kicking with Damien,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maia is grappling.</v>

2147
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.370
<v Speaker 5>If we take where the gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there'll be a lot more chill,</v>

2148
01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:14.770
<v Speaker 5>a lot more jokes and a lot more kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to take away the gloves.</v>

2149
01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:15.850
<v Speaker 5>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2150
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:17.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so much easier to sync.</v>

2151
01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:20.480
<v Speaker 5>Chokes in so much harder as defend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2152
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:23.680
<v Speaker 5>change up the commands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then now when it comes to like if</v>

2153
01:23:23.681 --> 01:23:27.700
<v Speaker 5>you look at football or baseball or any</v>
<v Speaker 5>professional sport,</v>

2154
01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:30.310
<v Speaker 5>they've pretty much have protocols that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are very similar.</v>

2155
01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:34.420
<v Speaker 5>Like most teams have pretty similar</v>
<v Speaker 5>protocols as far as like training and</v>

2156
01:23:34.421 --> 01:23:36.550
<v Speaker 5>how they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they prepare their athletes.</v>

2157
01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:40.510
<v Speaker 5>But with mma it's wildly different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in how,</v>

2158
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:41.081
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

2159
01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:42.790
<v Speaker 5>who decides?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like for you,</v>

2160
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:46.300
<v Speaker 5>who decides what when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>strength and conditioning,</v>

2161
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 5>when you're doing hill sprints,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're doing sparring,</v>

2162
01:23:48.881 --> 01:23:50.260
<v Speaker 5>like how do you guys work that out?</v>

2163
01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I find someone that I trust completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then uh,</v>

2164
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:57.360
<v Speaker 3>work together with him for my striking</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my mma with Dwayne.</v>

2165
01:23:57.361 --> 01:23:59.580
<v Speaker 3>It's something we team up together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of like,</v>

2166
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:00.810
<v Speaker 3>what if I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if I do that?</v>

2167
01:24:00.811 --> 01:24:02.550
<v Speaker 3>And it kind of make a perfect plan for</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

2168
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:04.440
<v Speaker 3>my strength conditioning coach learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Dow,</v>

2169
01:24:04.441 --> 01:24:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I believe in him completely of watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>him train athletes and peak in meet the</v>

2170
01:24:08.461 --> 01:24:10.830
<v Speaker 3>right way and how I feel personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all trial and error.</v>

2171
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know where I'm at right now.</v>

2172
01:24:12.931 --> 01:24:16.740
<v Speaker 3>I trust in every single coach that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>different aspects leaser bowling for my</v>

2173
01:24:16.741 --> 01:24:18.600
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been around the game for so long</v>

2174
01:24:18.601 --> 01:24:21.390
<v Speaker 3>and knows how fighting works that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to trust him and my wrestling</v>

2175
01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:23.070
<v Speaker 3>techniques and help him pick me apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2176
01:24:23.071 --> 01:24:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Elliot Marshall's meant Jujitsu coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believe in Colorado at</v>

2177
01:24:26.281 --> 01:24:29.310
<v Speaker 3>elevation fight team with me and Dwayne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really got got a pretty,</v>

2178
01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:31.980
<v Speaker 3>pretty good to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But someone's going to come in and have</v>

2179
01:24:31.981 --> 01:24:33.720
<v Speaker 3>a different mindset of what they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2180
01:24:33.721 --> 01:24:36.030
<v Speaker 3>And if it doesn't work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work for you.</v>

2181
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:37.301
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2182
01:24:37.301 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 5>it's the trial and error and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>learning as you go along.</v>

2183
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 5>It's so interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2184
01:24:42.401 --> 01:24:43.960
<v Speaker 5>you lose a fight and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2185
01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:45.160
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did we fuck up on?</v>

2186
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:46.410
<v Speaker 5>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do we need to do better?</v>

2187
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:47.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2188
01:24:47.441 --> 01:24:48.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>

2189
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get that Joe Silva call like,</v>

2190
01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Ready to take it?</v>

2193
01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 5>So Sylvia called me when I was up on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladder doing electrical work in the</v>

2194
01:24:57.251 --> 01:24:59.470
<v Speaker 5>mountains to fight in two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was again,</v>

2195
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.060
<v Speaker 5>Jonathan Goulay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2196
01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:02.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2197
01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:03.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2198
01:25:03.371 --> 01:25:06.230
<v Speaker 5>I take the fight and then I'd text boss</v>
<v Speaker 5>right away or I call him and say,</v>

2199
01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.001
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you train me?</v>

2200
01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:07.451
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2201
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:08.710
<v Speaker 5>His,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so go out for a week.</v>

2202
01:25:08.711 --> 01:25:10.850
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going back to the point where I worked</v>

2203
01:25:10.851 --> 01:25:13.180
<v Speaker 5>at West,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is Keto in history ever.</v>

2204
01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:13.911
<v Speaker 5>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2205
01:25:13.911 --> 01:25:16.540
<v Speaker 5>you got to fight for that money ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had a fight for that one.</v>

2206
01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mr Rogan,</v>

2207
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:21.790
<v Speaker 5>how many people were hating on him</v>
<v Speaker 5>having the fastest Kaylin history?</v>

2208
01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:26.791
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of fucking debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like the referee that it's wrong.</v>

2209
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.210
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a wrong call.</v>

2210
01:25:28.211 --> 01:25:30.160
<v Speaker 5>They were saying it was like 11 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>

2211
01:25:30.161 --> 01:25:31.540
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Bull Shit.</v>

2212
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:33.850
<v Speaker 5>That was six.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We played it over and over and over</v>

2213
01:25:33.851 --> 01:25:34.850
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fine.</v>

2214
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.310
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2215
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:38.710
<v Speaker 5>we were working on that exact technique</v>
<v Speaker 5>does point down the jab moving overhand</v>

2216
01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.140
<v Speaker 5>right in the back with Sensei and and</v>
<v Speaker 5>just just ripped it out,</v>

2217
01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:41.974
<v Speaker 5>ripped it out and</v>

2218
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:45.790
<v Speaker 7>it was so fun because I'm leaning over</v>
<v Speaker 7>the cage and I'm saying Dwayne is going</v>

2219
01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:48.610
<v Speaker 7>to come up straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want you to step to the side and just</v>

2220
01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:50.560
<v Speaker 7>knock them out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You will hear me say that,</v>

2221
01:25:50.561 --> 01:25:51.910
<v Speaker 7>repeating it over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>

2222
01:25:51.911 --> 01:25:54.580
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what because every time I</v>
<v Speaker 7>have that I have one time I said he's</v>

2223
01:25:54.581 --> 01:25:57.940
<v Speaker 7>opening for the right location and then</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guy over through the right log,</v>

2224
01:25:57.941 --> 01:25:59.050
<v Speaker 7>you get out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do you know what?</v>

2225
01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.310
<v Speaker 7>They have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every time it works with us or against</v>

2226
01:26:01.311 --> 01:26:02.410
<v Speaker 7>boulevard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we knocked him out.</v>

2227
01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 7>That combination.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We weren't</v>

2228
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.330
<v Speaker 5>get the dressing room before Bomani.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's all the time we'd Goulay for</v>

2229
01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 5>some reason I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got to come straight out.</v>

2230
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:12.910
<v Speaker 5>You just move out and just don't do</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

2231
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.500
<v Speaker 5>It's Kinda data chunking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've seen so many fights,</v>

2232
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:19.370
<v Speaker 5>so many people you have to see things</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you don't even know what you're</v>

2233
01:26:19.371 --> 01:26:20.210
<v Speaker 5>seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like,</v>

2234
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.270
<v Speaker 5>oh like you know how sometimes like</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll see a guy like I call it all the</v>

2235
01:26:23.271 --> 01:26:24.780
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll see a guy lifted his heel up and</v>

2236
01:26:24.781 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 5>when he said about throw right case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2237
01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.150
<v Speaker 5>like you just know for whatever reason</v>
<v Speaker 5>twist a little bit.</v>

2238
01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the funny part is when he does a</v>

2239
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.190
<v Speaker 5>backache,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine out of 10 times,</v>

2240
01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 5>the other one throws a backache.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I always thought I'm going to do this</v>

2241
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:40.520
<v Speaker 5>on purpose and hopefully when he makes</v>
<v Speaker 5>them on I'm going to catch it.</v>

2242
01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:45.130
<v Speaker 5>Then</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll go do this too.</v>

2243
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.930
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy when people throw back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2244
01:26:49.290 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the probably the most ill advised back</v>

2245
01:26:52.011 --> 01:26:54.820
<v Speaker 5>heck of all time was Chris Weidman</v>
<v Speaker 5>versus Luke Rocco.</v>

2246
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.710
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the most that called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called at the moment.</v>

2247
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:01.550
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean his corner?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Call it at the moment he called it,</v>

2248
01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.230
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe it's here's luke had been</v>
<v Speaker 5>knocked out by veto with a wheel kick.</v>

2249
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.100
<v Speaker 5>So maybe I'm just guessing that Chris</v>
<v Speaker 5>decided to throw a wheel kick,</v>

2250
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.770
<v Speaker 5>but it was like you could see it</v>
<v Speaker 5>comment,</v>

2251
01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.930
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't fast and if you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 5>100% how to cake,</v>

2252
01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:17.870
<v Speaker 5>I said don't kick and he shouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>done that.</v>

2253
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:20.060
<v Speaker 5>It was way too slow and they saw it</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming off.</v>

2254
01:27:20.061 --> 01:27:22.010
<v Speaker 5>A memory of that though when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2255
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:24.200
<v Speaker 5>be toward Belford did it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2256
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:27.950
<v Speaker 5>I think I remember correctly rockhold</v>
<v Speaker 5>was against the cage.</v>

2257
01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.450
<v Speaker 5>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's all circle off.</v>

2258
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.010
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was aware of the cage.</v>

2259
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:33.030
<v Speaker 5>Now weidman's back was against the</v>
<v Speaker 5>kitsch.</v>

2260
01:27:33.031 --> 01:27:35.870
<v Speaker 5>I thought he was close with the cage</v>
<v Speaker 5>then luke was in that fight.</v>

2261
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2262
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 5>I believe he was moving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a belief.</v>

2263
01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:41.130
<v Speaker 5>It was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was moving towards rockhold on,</v>

2264
01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:44.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember the talk them through it</v>

2265
01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 5>before and it was the first time I'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever seen him throw a wheel kick.</v>

2266
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 5>He threw it right before against</v>
<v Speaker 5>rockhold and missed and they threw it</v>

2267
01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:51.070
<v Speaker 5>again and landed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

2268
01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.720
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>TRT Tour.</v>

2269
01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Speaker 5>He told me before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2270
01:27:59.721 --> 01:28:01.800
<v Speaker 5>boss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my kicks should go to be getting a</v>

2271
01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:04.940
<v Speaker 5>really good right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody out with a spinning back kick</v>

2272
01:28:04.941 --> 01:28:05.661
<v Speaker 5>to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2273
01:28:05.661 --> 01:28:07.610
<v Speaker 5>go for it then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he knocked him out.</v>

2274
01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:12.410
<v Speaker 5>So Vito has had so many hand surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe he's had a sucker off for</v>

2275
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:15.440
<v Speaker 5>enhanced surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's broken his hand so many times that</v>

2276
01:28:15.441 --> 01:28:17.540
<v Speaker 5>I think he just started concentrating</v>
<v Speaker 5>more on kicks,</v>

2277
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:19.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just see that made a big difference.</v>

2278
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.970
<v Speaker 5>This is going back to a patterns and</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing people that the hill up,</v>

2279
01:28:22.971 --> 01:28:23.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna throw something.</v>

2280
01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.460
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out what they're going to do.</v>

2281
01:28:25.461 --> 01:28:29.030
<v Speaker 5>But then that same theory is paying</v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to what combinations and what</v>

2282
01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:31.580
<v Speaker 5>techniques actually land and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>chucking those together and making</v>

2283
01:28:31.581 --> 01:28:32.321
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the system.</v>

2284
01:28:32.321 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 5>So just being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having,</v>

2285
01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 5>going back to the language and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>vocabulary of high percentage</v>

2286
01:28:36.201 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 5>combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drill them and wrap them out.</v>

2287
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.770
<v Speaker 5>So just it's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:43.770
<v Speaker 5>And know how to really deliver a</v>
<v Speaker 5>technique before you attempt it.</v>

2289
01:28:43.771 --> 01:28:47.900
<v Speaker 5>Like the first time I ever saw Cain</v>
<v Speaker 5>Velasquez for a wheel kick ever was in</v>

2290
01:28:47.901 --> 01:28:50.090
<v Speaker 5>the Travis Brown fight and it looked</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking perfect.</v>

2291
01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:52.010
<v Speaker 5>Cause like what does this guy have been</v>
<v Speaker 5>hiding this forever?</v>

2292
01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:54.410
<v Speaker 5>Like he never threw a wheel kick and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden it's a perfect,</v>

2293
01:28:54.411 --> 01:28:56.390
<v Speaker 5>we'll kick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's probably because he had</v>

2294
01:28:56.391 --> 01:28:59.960
<v Speaker 5>practiced them this and drilled it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the point where he's got it down.</v>

2295
01:28:59.961 --> 01:29:01.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>time to the wheel kick.</v>

2296
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.030
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

2297
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:04.080
<v Speaker 6>had a lifeline.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has a lifelong martial artist in his</v>

2298
01:29:04.081 --> 01:29:05.120
<v Speaker 6>corner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>however you're going this.</v>

2299
01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:09.060
<v Speaker 6>So I'm sure he's seen a million back</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicks and can correct him on what to do</v>

2300
01:29:09.061 --> 01:29:10.680
<v Speaker 6>properly rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 6>than what he's doing wrong.</v>

2301
01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:12.241
<v Speaker 6>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

2302
01:29:12.241 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting when you see a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 6>out of nowhere.</v>

2303
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.080
<v Speaker 6>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hold technique that you've never seen</v>

2304
01:29:16.081 --> 01:29:16.710
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hi.</v>

2305
01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:18.600
<v Speaker 6>Hello athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can show tj anything.</v>

2306
01:29:18.601 --> 01:29:20.880
<v Speaker 6>Right or watch videos and see something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He could pull it off right away.</v>

2307
01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:22.890
<v Speaker 6>It's a great visual learner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a great visual learner.</v>

2308
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.650
<v Speaker 6>So sensei is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can learn by watching papes and</v>

2309
01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:27.870
<v Speaker 6>watching somebody do something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can just mimic it.</v>

2310
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:29.580
<v Speaker 6>So and Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so consensus.</v>

2311
01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:32.310
<v Speaker 6>It's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what the next technique that</v>

2312
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 6>we're going to see that we couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe someone's pulling off inside the</v>

2313
01:29:35.701 --> 01:29:36.190
<v Speaker 6>entre.</v>

2314
01:29:36.190 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it really close line with disclosure and</v>

2315
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:41.400
<v Speaker 6>elbows to the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the,</v>

2316
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:44.340
<v Speaker 6>to the collarbone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw some of the Atlanta close line</v>

2317
01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:45.630
<v Speaker 6>recently do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's fine.</v>

2318
01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:48.030
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw someone do that and I was thinking</v>

2319
01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:51.690
<v Speaker 6>of you because you've talked about that</v>
<v Speaker 6>so many times that like oh your bag.</v>

2320
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 6>They attached to a US both on to twitter</v>
<v Speaker 6>feed,</v>

2321
01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:55.470
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't turned to somebody.</v>

2322
01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.080
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it close side,</v>

2323
01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.400
<v Speaker 6>but the coolest nine if you really do</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2324
01:29:59.401 --> 01:30:01.730
<v Speaker 6>they can cover up with their hands but</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're still going to hit him.</v>

2325
01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.470
<v Speaker 6>You loop around and your rope around to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the back of the head,</v>

2326
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.030
<v Speaker 6>which still outside the Mohawk still</v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal pudge.</v>

2327
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.770
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know her feed is completed and Eagle,</v>

2328
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:10.800
<v Speaker 6>he moved his head and our didn't move</v>
<v Speaker 6>his head and it's his fault.</v>

2329
01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.090
<v Speaker 6>Well also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2330
01:30:12.091 --> 01:30:14.010
<v Speaker 6>Eddie Bravo and I had a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 6>about this,</v>

2331
01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:18.270
<v Speaker 6>like when you hit a guy with a head kick</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times is landing on the back of</v>

2332
01:30:18.271 --> 01:30:18.530
<v Speaker 6>the hat.</v>

2333
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:20.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of times the food,</v>

2334
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.440
<v Speaker 6>it's coming over the shoulder a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>times,</v>

2335
01:30:22.441 --> 01:30:24.570
<v Speaker 6>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the foot is impacting the instep is</v>

2336
01:30:24.571 --> 01:30:27.330
<v Speaker 6>hitting the back of the head before</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything and nobody's ready for that</v>

2337
01:30:27.331 --> 01:30:29.540
<v Speaker 6>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody in fact ready for the sites</v>

2338
01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:30.970
<v Speaker 6>and to the front,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2339
01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:31.800
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2340
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.360
<v Speaker 6>Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he hits hooks.</v>

2341
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:35.190
<v Speaker 6>He was always the smallest guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shortest guy.</v>

2342
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:37.840
<v Speaker 6>But he would hit his hook almost to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Becca,</v>

2343
01:30:37.841 --> 01:30:39.990
<v Speaker 6>a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's which was so short at that,</v>

2344
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2345
01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 6>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you know,</v>

2346
01:30:41.911 --> 01:30:43.620
<v Speaker 6>just hit yourself really gentle and to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be,</v>

2347
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:46.890
<v Speaker 6>but the palm and the back of your head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your brain is simply not ready for that.</v>

2348
01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm one of the best head kick Kaos I've</v>

2349
01:30:49.801 --> 01:30:51.570
<v Speaker 6>ever seen that came from the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>head.</v>

2350
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.790
<v Speaker 6>Was there Nesto who's versus Maury</v>
<v Speaker 6>Smith?</v>

2351
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:54.690
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You ever see that?</v>

2352
01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:55.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:57.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie find that because it's such a</v>

2354
01:30:57.811 --> 01:31:01.350
<v Speaker 6>crazy combination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The way host gets his leg up there in</v>

2355
01:31:01.351 --> 01:31:05.160
<v Speaker 6>the middle of a clinch and Maurice I</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe,</v>

2356
01:31:05.161 --> 01:31:10.161
<v Speaker 6>picks his knee up and host comes over</v>
<v Speaker 6>the top and down behind his head.</v>

2357
01:31:11.011 --> 01:31:13.770
<v Speaker 6>Sexual judge era style.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2358
01:31:13.771 --> 01:31:15.680
<v Speaker 6>He just did a seminar kicking over to</v>
<v Speaker 6>defense.</v>

2359
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:17.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right there and it's like what you say</v>

2360
01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:20.190
<v Speaker 6>before is say you take a punch it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>put it on the head.</v>

2361
01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:21.570
<v Speaker 6>You're going to let me just hit the</v>
<v Speaker 6>punishment.</v>

2362
01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.250
<v Speaker 6>Like if you have your hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes no sense.</v>

2363
01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.020
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Having your hands up.</v>

2364
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 6>You think the guys protected.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now don't punch him.</v>

2365
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:28.680
<v Speaker 6>Put your hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me punch you.</v>

2366
01:31:28.681 --> 01:31:29.750
<v Speaker 6>Let me touch your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

2367
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.130
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always got a kick blocked my kid.</v>

2368
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:34.650
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a misconception of people when they</v>

2369
01:31:34.651 --> 01:31:36.930
<v Speaker 6>put their hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this is what goes on.</v>

2370
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.670
<v Speaker 6>If I want to hitch Kikuyu into hat</v>
<v Speaker 6>today,</v>

2371
01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:41.670
<v Speaker 6>she put your hand up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A normal person automatically thinks the</v>

2372
01:31:41.671 --> 01:31:43.740
<v Speaker 6>power of the kick because he sees his</v>
<v Speaker 6>defendant,</v>

2373
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:47.690
<v Speaker 6>but if he just would not care and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>kick as hard as she can on the defense,</v>

2374
01:31:47.691 --> 01:31:49.240
<v Speaker 6>you will kick them out and it just got</v>
<v Speaker 6>to knock them out.</v>

2375
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.570
<v Speaker 6>Let this last weekend we saw a Yancey</v>
<v Speaker 6>Madeiros fraud.</v>

2376
01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:54.670
<v Speaker 6>Sean Spencer's Spencer blocked the kick</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he took it right to the,</v>

2377
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 6>to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Check this out real quick.</v>

2378
01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:00.180
<v Speaker 6>This is a Maury Smith versus Ernesto</v>

2379
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:02.490
<v Speaker 5>who's play it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>play the whole thing so he could see</v>

2380
01:32:02.491 --> 01:32:04.510
<v Speaker 5>that the combination seat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2381
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:10.130
<v Speaker 5>he does it in the clench with the knee</v>
<v Speaker 5>boone's add edesa rumbled,</v>

2382
01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:14.470
<v Speaker 5>deckers kind of style and I like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>push and the cake that ahead.</v>

2383
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:18.280
<v Speaker 5>He started with that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was able to bring it up in a round</v>

2384
01:32:18.281 --> 01:32:20.710
<v Speaker 5>like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy to realize he was in the</v>

2385
01:32:20.711 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 5>clinch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a block to shoulder,</v>

2386
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:23.370
<v Speaker 5>almost his hand down for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:24.640
<v Speaker 5>It kind of guides his hand out of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

2388
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:26.020
<v Speaker 5>So was kicks in to come up and lay me in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the head.</v>

2389
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:29.410
<v Speaker 5>That's also where like flexibility is so</v>
<v Speaker 5>critical,</v>

2390
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:33.490
<v Speaker 5>like there's no more important thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to kicking technique.</v>

2391
01:32:33.491 --> 01:32:35.800
<v Speaker 5>Then flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you don't have the</v>

2392
01:32:35.801 --> 01:32:37.960
<v Speaker 5>flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body's all stiff and it doesn't</v>

2393
01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:39.760
<v Speaker 5>move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right and you just can't.</v>

2394
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:42.150
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's going to do that unless it,</v>

2395
01:32:42.151 --> 01:32:42.940
<v Speaker 5>you're flexible.</v>

2396
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got a stretch.</v>

2397
01:32:43.841 --> 01:32:46.780
<v Speaker 5>Can I do the stretch your routine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was such a good guy.</v>

2398
01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:53.020
<v Speaker 5>This who is that one Croatian do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They kept knocking him out.</v>

2399
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:56.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That fucking guy hits</v>

2400
01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:01.530
<v Speaker 5>the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know his gay was the first gay porn</v>

2401
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.940
<v Speaker 5>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was announced.</v>

2402
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:04.370
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.830
<v Speaker 5>It's not the k.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knocked him out yesterday.</v>

2404
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:08.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his muscles also,</v>

2405
01:33:08.891 --> 01:33:10.960
<v Speaker 5>when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like different kind of muscle.</v>

2406
01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:14.590
<v Speaker 5>It almost looks like it is very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know there's some dudes like that.</v>

2407
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:17.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a long time for him to do to</v>

2408
01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:20.380
<v Speaker 5>break the ice with me at a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suddenly he came to me and he goes,</v>

2409
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.250
<v Speaker 5>you're a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if took like four times of meeting</v>

2410
01:33:24.251 --> 01:33:24.730
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

2411
01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:28.090
<v Speaker 5>he had no clue what to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a hard part of the world.</v>

2412
01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:32.010
<v Speaker 5>There is a hard part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll probably talk to relax.</v>

2413
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 5>You got to be on guard the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think to this day,</v>

2414
01:33:35.681 --> 01:33:40.120
<v Speaker 5>the greatest stare down of all time was</v>
<v Speaker 5>cro cop versus vandelay and vandelay</v>

2415
01:33:40.121 --> 01:33:42.100
<v Speaker 5>would mean mug everybody and it would</v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

2416
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.630
<v Speaker 5>He looked at Cro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cop and Cro.</v>

2417
01:33:43.631 --> 01:33:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Cop looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker,</v>

2418
01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:47.410
<v Speaker 5>I'll cut your head off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

2419
01:33:47.411 --> 01:33:49.600
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's dead.</v>

2420
01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.140
<v Speaker 5>The second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the second fight.</v>

2421
01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:56.170
<v Speaker 5>But in the first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you never saw the eyes of a</v>

2422
01:33:56.171 --> 01:33:58.930
<v Speaker 5>killer more than than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that one time.</v>

2423
01:33:58.931 --> 01:34:01.750
<v Speaker 5>Cause I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was ahead of an anti terrorist</v>

2424
01:34:01.751 --> 01:34:03.250
<v Speaker 5>squadron and Croatia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2425
01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:06.220
<v Speaker 5>but you see I go back again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was defended late,</v>

2426
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.700
<v Speaker 5>always intimidating somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now you have suddenly a guy who does</v>

2427
01:34:09.701 --> 01:34:11.020
<v Speaker 5>not care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not only that,</v>

2428
01:34:11.021 --> 01:34:14.500
<v Speaker 5>your strong suit is striking and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking on one of the most explosive</v>

2429
01:34:14.501 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 5>structures to ever compete in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a guy who,</v>

2430
01:34:17.171 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 5>you know was a legit k one level</v>
<v Speaker 5>striker.</v>

2431
01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:21.130
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he would say,</v>

2432
01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting how that,</v>

2433
01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:27.361
<v Speaker 5>that style really worked really well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like here it is likely the stare down,</v>

2434
01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.650
<v Speaker 5>look at Cro cop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get fuck it stared out.</v>

2435
01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:37.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's God damn terrifying and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm leaving and they're legit as fuck.</v>

2436
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.560
<v Speaker 5>He's not believing in vandelay very</v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

2437
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 5>But it's interesting because Cro cop was</v>
<v Speaker 5>successful in k one but he was never the</v>

2438
01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:48.010
<v Speaker 5>elite of the elite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But his style,</v>

2439
01:34:48.011 --> 01:34:52.570
<v Speaker 5>that explosive one shot style translated</v>
<v Speaker 5>so well to mma.</v>

2440
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:57.290
<v Speaker 5>Whereas maybe like Ernesto style would</v>
<v Speaker 5>not have translated that way because he</v>

2441
01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:58.310
<v Speaker 5>was more technical,</v>

2442
01:34:58.590 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 6>set things up more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I show,</v>

2443
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:01.850
<v Speaker 6>no single kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always say,</v>

2444
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 6>because they can be countered and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>always say,</v>

2445
01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.480
<v Speaker 6>are you kick like Mirko Cro Cop?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because if you then kick really hard on</v>

2446
01:35:08.481 --> 01:35:10.400
<v Speaker 6>the defense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're buying yourself a little bit more</v>

2447
01:35:10.401 --> 01:35:12.440
<v Speaker 6>time because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you force them to block it.</v>

2448
01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:14.360
<v Speaker 6>But some of these guys with the left</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicks,</v>

2449
01:35:14.361 --> 01:35:15.800
<v Speaker 6>if they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're the orthodox,</v>

2450
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:17.750
<v Speaker 6>they can't kick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I say take the cake,</v>

2451
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:19.140
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to give you a rashy.</v>

2452
01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:20.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's not going to do anything.</v>

2453
01:35:20.301 --> 01:35:22.550
<v Speaker 6>It's they're going to keep muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just counter the cake.</v>

2454
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:24.840
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when cro complicates of full blast Gig,</v>

2455
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be forced to block and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you can counter,</v>

2456
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.160
<v Speaker 6>which buys him a little bit of time to</v>
<v Speaker 6>get out of the way again,</v>

2457
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.750
<v Speaker 6>that tells tj and his last ride of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sensee.</v>

2458
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.550
<v Speaker 6>I'll just wait for the kick in step in</v>
<v Speaker 6>until the cross time him on the way in.</v>

2459
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:36.650
<v Speaker 6>There's levels to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

2460
01:35:36.651 --> 01:35:41.030
<v Speaker 6>and there's levels to kicking and Edson</v>
<v Speaker 6>Barboza switch kick is yes.</v>

2461
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:43.580
<v Speaker 6>That's one of those things where I</v>
<v Speaker 6>watched that and I go,</v>

2462
01:35:43.581 --> 01:35:46.750
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm never seen anybody switch kicked</v>

2463
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.480
<v Speaker 6>that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Quick,</v>

2464
01:35:48.650 --> 01:35:53.650
<v Speaker 6>which is inside leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He can win a whole fight with all benny.</v>

2465
01:35:54.471 --> 01:35:55.410
<v Speaker 6>The jet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a</v>

2466
01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.870
<v Speaker 6>spinning back kick to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2467
01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:02.300
<v Speaker 6>he's back into the body one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets Fujiwara.</v>

2468
01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.450
<v Speaker 6>I mean I saw it at the of his kings of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the square ring.</v>

2469
01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:08.540
<v Speaker 6>When you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can hear the impact on the bud.</v>

2470
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:11.210
<v Speaker 6>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see the guy crumble.</v>

2471
01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.130
<v Speaker 6>Benny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The jet was sad motherfucker.</v>

2472
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:16.070
<v Speaker 6>The best American kickbox forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2473
01:36:16.071 --> 01:36:18.710
<v Speaker 6>he's a bar without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of them told him and then I would</v>

2474
01:36:18.711 --> 01:36:20.670
<v Speaker 6>say Rick Rufus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>such a pioneer too.</v>

2475
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.740
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know shit.</v>

2476
01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:25.310
<v Speaker 6>He was doing that back when there was</v>
<v Speaker 6>really no one at that level.</v>

2477
01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean he was at such a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's such a while due to again Mexican,</v>

2478
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:31.880
<v Speaker 6>native American.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was dizzy.</v>

2479
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:34.910
<v Speaker 6>Oh is he?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or maybe a mix,</v>

2480
01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:36.610
<v Speaker 6>but I'm pretty soon cause he's a come</v>
<v Speaker 6>out with the headdress.</v>

2481
01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.740
<v Speaker 6>Blinky Rodriguez,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who was his brother in law was Mexican.</v>

2482
01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.260
<v Speaker 6>I saw him in Holland coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was fighting spotting.</v>

2483
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.520
<v Speaker 6>He wants Bong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a big bike guy.</v>

2484
01:36:46.521 --> 01:36:48.860
<v Speaker 6>Strong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>strong kickboxer and Ben,</v>

2485
01:36:48.861 --> 01:36:52.320
<v Speaker 6>he never fought with low kicks and</v>
<v Speaker 6>spying is murdering him.</v>

2486
01:36:52.330 --> 01:36:54.620
<v Speaker 6>And the first right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's for spying spine go wgu</v>

2487
01:36:54.621 --> 01:36:58.340
<v Speaker 6>going and he gets loci.</v>
<v Speaker 6>LOCI cause I don't know how he stayed in</v>

2488
01:36:58.341 --> 01:36:59.091
<v Speaker 6>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Benny,</v>

2489
01:36:59.091 --> 01:37:01.100
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The second five second route,</v>

2490
01:37:01.101 --> 01:37:03.180
<v Speaker 6>he starts coming in a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was five frauds.</v>

2491
01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:07.790
<v Speaker 6>Five to the time because Thai boxing and</v>
<v Speaker 6>a third two out and now better jeff</v>

2492
01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.410
<v Speaker 6>starts coming back and suddenly spunks</v>
<v Speaker 6>that spitting out his mouthpiece because</v>

2493
01:37:11.411 --> 01:37:13.340
<v Speaker 6>he needed an extra break and I need it</v>
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

2494
01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:16.400
<v Speaker 6>And it did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then it was like rocky versus Ivan</v>

2495
01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 6>Drago you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So literally the whole audience changed</v>

2496
01:37:18.891 --> 01:37:23.030
<v Speaker 6>from being for the Dutch guy to be for</v>
<v Speaker 6>betty to jet because they realized this</v>

2497
01:37:23.031 --> 01:37:26.060
<v Speaker 6>guy is so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he keeps hanging in there and then</v>

2498
01:37:26.061 --> 01:37:28.880
<v Speaker 6>betty jet stopped them into forthright.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was the craziest thing.</v>

2499
01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.540
<v Speaker 6>People were going nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you spit out as a mouthpiece,</v>

2500
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:33.620
<v Speaker 6>he wants spunk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody.</v>

2501
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:34.980
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2502
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:37.520
<v Speaker 6>he wasn't doing heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was the coolest thing I've ever seen.</v>

2503
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 6>Did you watch glory this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2504
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:41.820
<v Speaker 6>but I heard it was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2505
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:44.720
<v Speaker 6>And waste and wilderness knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 6>Simon Marcus.</v>

2506

<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Marcus was lighten them up early in</v>

<v Speaker 6>Mark has showed that though.</v>

2509
01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.050
<v Speaker 6>Three of them right now.</v>

2511
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.010
<v Speaker 2>fight where they went that extra round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And schilling knocked him out with a</v>

2512
01:37:59.011 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>right hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just,</v>

2513
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 2>it was an insane fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the tournament too.</v>

2514
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.500
<v Speaker 2>That was the first fight of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>tournament and Schilling for two more</v>

2515
01:38:07.501 --> 01:38:10.320
<v Speaker 2>times after that fucking crazy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2516
01:38:10.321 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wilderness fight,</v>

2517
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Simon markets was lightened him up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man with Moy Thai and wellness is more</v>

2518
01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:19.050
<v Speaker 2>of a boxer style and he was moving in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had some,</v>

2519
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.320
<v Speaker 2>some success with combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he caught him at the end of the</v>

2520
01:38:22.321 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 2>round a way that with a shot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon mark was kind of playing with them</v>

2521
01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:30.240
<v Speaker 2>and lowered his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was smiling and he got hit with a couple</v>

2522
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:33.030
<v Speaker 2>of shots and the referee gave him a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>questionable standing eight count.</v>

2523
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.260
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2524
01:38:34.261 --> 01:38:36.250
<v Speaker 2>the commentators are screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Valtellina,</v>

2525
01:38:36.251 --> 01:38:37.800
<v Speaker 2>he was screaming like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

2526
01:38:37.801 --> 01:38:39.180
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

2527
01:38:39.181 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 2>that's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eight counts.</v>

2528
01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 2>No good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't about to go down.</v>

2529
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 2>There's no standing eight count and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

2530
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Like why did they count them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're saying that the,</v>

2531
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:48.900
<v Speaker 2>the ropes held them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the next round wellness just</v>

2532
01:38:48.901 --> 01:38:52.600
<v Speaker 2>fucking dropped him legit and hurt him</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad and then dropped him again and then</v>

2533
01:38:52.601 --> 01:38:53.434
<v Speaker 2>finish them off</v>

2534
01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.600
<v Speaker 6>for Uber.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking forward to him fighting</v>

2535
01:38:55.601 --> 01:38:59.200
<v Speaker 6>Butler December 10th right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God Damn.</v>

2536
01:38:59.201 --> 01:39:01.690
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Badr Hari is one of the scariest</v>

2537
01:39:01.691 --> 01:39:03.820
<v Speaker 6>motherfuckers ever walked the face of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the planet.</v>

2538
01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:08.170
<v Speaker 6>I have no clue how he's still out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>jail.</v>

2539
01:39:08.171 --> 01:39:09.880
<v Speaker 6>Out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess he's got money.</v>

2540
01:39:11.130 --> 01:39:14.830
<v Speaker 6>It ain't cause they said it was maybe</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be in Morocco.</v>

2541
01:39:14.831 --> 01:39:16.210
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't do it in Morocco.</v>

2542
01:39:16.230 --> 01:39:18.580
<v Speaker 6>Do it because if you beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's got to be a problem,</v>

2543
01:39:18.581 --> 01:39:20.510
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2544
01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Didn't he rob a bank,</v>

2545
01:39:22.301 --> 01:39:23.270
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2546
01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:23.571
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2547
01:39:23.571 --> 01:39:25.230
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let him beat up</v>

2548
01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.030
<v Speaker 6>Morocco,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but okay.</v>

2549
01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:28.953
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

2550
01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:30.270
<v Speaker 6>Brass knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2551
01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:31.250
<v Speaker 6>my story is better</v>

2552
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:37.110
<v Speaker 2>beat some guy up at a nightclub where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomped his shin,</v>

2553
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they held a guy down and he's allegedly</v>

2554
01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.370
<v Speaker 2>stomped on his shin and snapped it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>

2555
01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not being a good person,</v>

2556
01:39:45.781 --> 01:39:48.630
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and like Tan and I think that's what he</v>

2557
01:39:48.631 --> 01:39:50.010
<v Speaker 6>was going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I don't think so.</v>

2558
01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.320
<v Speaker 6>Stories like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have many of them from him?</v>

2559
01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.570
<v Speaker 6>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Good.</v>

2560
01:39:57.650 --> 01:40:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm a huge fan of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Nima Amaze the most exciting</v>

2561
01:40:00.591 --> 01:40:03.860
<v Speaker 2>sport in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's some things that you see in</v>

2562
01:40:03.861 --> 01:40:07.460
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing that you just don't see in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma because there's no threat of the</v>

2563
01:40:07.461 --> 01:40:10.460
<v Speaker 2>tank down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see these wild technical</v>

2564
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:13.910
<v Speaker 2>exchanges and in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need more of that.</v>

2565
01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:15.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just is not enough.</v>

2566
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:17.840
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough eyes on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't think enough people are</v>

2567
01:40:17.841 --> 01:40:18.674
<v Speaker 2>paying attention.</v>

2568
01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:21.760
<v Speaker 6>Phenomenal show glory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is phenomenal now.</v>

2569
01:40:21.761 --> 01:40:24.760
<v Speaker 6>That's why I don't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 6>numbers have a why he's not,</v>

2570
01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:28.120
<v Speaker 6>not many more people watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And especially the guys who are</v>

2571
01:40:28.121 --> 01:40:31.190
<v Speaker 6>complaining about not understanding</v>
<v Speaker 6>mixed martial arts.</v>

2572
01:40:31.210 --> 01:40:32.590
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the punch you can gigging,</v>

2573
01:40:32.650 --> 01:40:36.970
<v Speaker 6>everybody can understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like 85 or 85% knockout ratio.</v>

2574
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:37.570
<v Speaker 6>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:38.403
<v Speaker 6>it's a great show.</v>

2576
01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I Love Glory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like lion fight better.</v>

2577
01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.970
<v Speaker 2>I like traditional ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like glory would be even</v>

2578
01:40:45.971 --> 01:40:48.220
<v Speaker 2>better if they just went more Thai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because why?</v>

2579
01:40:48.221 --> 01:40:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Why take away elbows when widen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why no elbows?</v>

2580
01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big fan elvis just because of</v>

2581
01:40:52.511 --> 01:40:53.690
<v Speaker 2>the cuts cuts too easy.</v>

2582
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.770
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then also limiting the clinch time</v>

2583
01:40:56.771 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 5>cause the crunch time can be boring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2584
01:40:58.301 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 5>So I think like the k one rules are</v>
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>

2585
01:41:00.551 --> 01:41:03.010
<v Speaker 5>I liked the Cuban roles or Gloria rules</v>
<v Speaker 5>better for that aspect.</v>

2586
01:41:03.011 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 5>For the handpiece fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but or just a in the clinch keep abos</v>

2587
01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.350
<v Speaker 5>but in the clinch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a don't allow them to play around,</v>

2588
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 5>play around as long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2589
01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.830
<v Speaker 5>I understand what you're saying about</v>
<v Speaker 5>elbows,</v>

2590
01:41:11.831 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 5>but part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2591
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:17.920
<v Speaker 5>it's a striking contest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you eliminate one of the best</v>

2592
01:41:17.921 --> 01:41:21.070
<v Speaker 5>weapons in striking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is elbows and lion fight has</v>

2593
01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:21.851
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2594
01:41:21.851 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get caught up like for sure.</v>

2595
01:41:23.591 --> 01:41:26.230
<v Speaker 5>Like do you see Gaston Balano since on</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of his face Ninja,</v>

2596
01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 5>he gets cut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His opponents cut the fuck up.</v>

2597
01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:31.840
<v Speaker 5>They're blasting each other with</v>
<v Speaker 5>spinning elbows.</v>

2598
01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:34.700
<v Speaker 5>But it's fun as hell to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2599
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:36.970
<v Speaker 5>definitely fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to be in there anymore at</v>

2600
01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:37.804
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

2601
01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:43.840
<v Speaker 5>Much easier just to quit coaching Tj and</v>
<v Speaker 5>coaching the guys and teach them martial</v>

2602
01:41:43.841 --> 01:41:45.670
<v Speaker 5>arts and evening what I want and hanging</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2603
01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.650
<v Speaker 5>I totally respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think like as a person who</v>

2604
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:55.390
<v Speaker 5>appreciates the purity of the art,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like there's no reason to</v>

2605
01:41:55.391 --> 01:41:58.600
<v Speaker 5>take out those clinch battles and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no reason to take out those</v>

2606
01:41:58.601 --> 01:42:01.210
<v Speaker 5>elbows because the guys who are good at</v>
<v Speaker 5>those clinch battles,</v>

2607
01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just start fucking blasting each</v>

2608
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:07.570
<v Speaker 5>other with knees to the body and it has</v>
<v Speaker 5>a significant tall and then the elbow</v>

2609
01:42:07.571 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 5>battles that they have inside the</v>
<v Speaker 5>clinch.</v>

2610
01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:12.010
<v Speaker 5>It to me it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a really important part of the</v>

2611
01:42:12.011 --> 01:42:13.330
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stand up striking.</v>

2612
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.410
<v Speaker 5>I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes sir.</v>

2613
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.210
<v Speaker 5>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had a,</v>

2614
01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:17.830
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>600 euro.</v>

2615
01:42:17.831 --> 01:42:21.220
<v Speaker 5>He just did a seminar at my academy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he showed us really cool clinch elbow</v>

2616
01:42:21.221 --> 01:42:21.850
<v Speaker 5>knee techniques.</v>

2617
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:26.850
<v Speaker 5>It was nice to get it from an actual</v>
<v Speaker 5>pure Muay Thai fighter to see his look</v>

2618
01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 5>and his perspective of what can happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the clinch knot.</v>

2619
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:30.940
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was eye opening.</v>

2620
01:42:30.941 --> 01:42:32.200
<v Speaker 5>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>we wouldn't know that we will.</v>

2622
01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:39.520

<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 6>There's a picture of him on his</v>

<v Speaker 6>instagram page is like fifties pucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>very talented guy.</v>

2643
01:43:15.491 --> 01:43:17.560
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had so many fights,</v>

2644
01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:18.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a young man.</v>

2645
01:43:18.671 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's only 24,</v>

2646
01:43:19.931 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 6>25 and he retired.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2647
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:24.370
<v Speaker 6>That's what I tell everybody this</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they start competing too young.</v>

2648
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:26.680
<v Speaker 6>He competed when he was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 6>16 years old.</v>

2649
01:43:26.681 --> 01:43:28.090
<v Speaker 6>They have to lie about his age.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2650
01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.950
<v Speaker 6>you're going to burn out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You shouldn't do that.</v>

2651
01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.340
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's asking me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd met this a girl now in a Phi Zalea</v>

2652
01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:34.540
<v Speaker 6>12 year old Jenna.</v>

2653
01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.100
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it started the following year.</v>

2654
01:43:36.101 --> 01:43:37.660
<v Speaker 6>I sent us to a whole bunch of gear and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>

2655
01:43:37.661 --> 01:43:38.141
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2656
01:43:38.141 --> 01:43:39.490
<v Speaker 6>because she says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>watch me,</v>

2657
01:43:39.491 --> 01:43:41.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be the next Ronda Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I go,</v>

2658
01:43:41.221 --> 01:43:42.280
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to say that,</v>

2659
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:43.660
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2660
01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:44.860
<v Speaker 6>it's the training.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's uh,</v>

2661
01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.680
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I told her start sparring maybe when</v>

2662
01:43:47.681 --> 01:43:49.720
<v Speaker 6>you're 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait with that,</v>

2663
01:43:49.721 --> 01:43:52.460
<v Speaker 6>because your brain is still everything</v>
<v Speaker 6>through your nerves,</v>

2664
01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at that age.</v>

2665
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:56.420
<v Speaker 6>And it stops at 14.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just give it two more years,</v>

2666
01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.070
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>till all the connections are there.</v>

2667
01:43:58.071 --> 01:44:00.020
<v Speaker 6>And that may be start sparring by</v>
<v Speaker 6>competing.</v>

2668
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 6>I would just wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait for competing.</v>

2669
01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 6>Don't go in this early,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do Jujitsu,</v>

2670
01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 6>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do all that.</v>

2671
01:44:06.231 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 6>But striking to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they should wait with that.</v>

2672
01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 6>Even even doing those things at a young</v>
<v Speaker 6>age and you make sure they're fun.</v>

2673
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:12.920
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I almost got burnt out in wrestling</v>

2674
01:44:12.921 --> 01:44:14.360
<v Speaker 6>in eighth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to quit.</v>

2675
01:44:14.361 --> 01:44:15.800
<v Speaker 6>I want to be done with the rest of this</v>
<v Speaker 6>too much.</v>

2676
01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.690
<v Speaker 6>It was just because every weekend I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>competing in that.</v>

2677
01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:20.600
<v Speaker 6>I'm so nervous as a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm putting so much pressure on myself.</v>

2678
01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.020
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to win this term.</v>

2679
01:44:22.021 --> 01:44:24.050
<v Speaker 6>I got to do good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like my dad was my coach.</v>

2680
01:44:24.051 --> 01:44:25.310
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to impress him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All this stuff,</v>

2681
01:44:25.311 --> 01:44:26.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like eighth grade.</v>

2682
01:44:26.901 --> 01:44:28.410
<v Speaker 6>I was almost just gave it up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2683
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:30.860
<v Speaker 6>But you got to learn to learn to have</v>
<v Speaker 6>fun with everything.</v>

2684
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:33.320
<v Speaker 6>As long as everything's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you can compete,</v>

2685
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:35.560
<v Speaker 6>do all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean obviously kickboxing's little bit</v>

2686
01:44:35.561 --> 01:44:37.850
<v Speaker 6>different because you're going to go in</v>
<v Speaker 6>through some a brain trauma.</v>

2687
01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:39.670
<v Speaker 6>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even with the wrestling and Jujitsu,</v>

2688
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 6>make sure it's fine if you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 6>little kid that wants to do and a or a</v>

2689
01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:44.330
<v Speaker 6>little kid that wants to get involved in</v>
<v Speaker 6>grappling and wrestling.</v>

2690
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:45.890
<v Speaker 6>Make sure it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2691
01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:48.830
<v Speaker 6>go in and practice playing some games,</v>
<v Speaker 6>news and things as well as learning</v>

2692
01:44:48.831 --> 01:44:52.100
<v Speaker 6>technique and cause little kids will get</v>
<v Speaker 6>burned out way too fast</v>

2693
01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.730
<v Speaker 6>because we hit it as striking a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2694
01:44:55.731 --> 01:44:58.190
<v Speaker 6>Aka to let striking to get injuries and</v>
<v Speaker 6>injuries down.</v>

2695
01:44:58.230 --> 01:45:00.410
<v Speaker 6>How many times should we spar whispbar</v>
<v Speaker 6>two times a day.</v>

2696
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:05.450
<v Speaker 6>Do we ever get injured</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we go,</v>

2697
01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.950
<v Speaker 6>if people watch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they go to go,</v>

2698
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:08.120
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these guys are crazy,</v>

2699
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.340
<v Speaker 6>but we know exactly what we hit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where we kick it.</v>

2700
01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:13.150
<v Speaker 6>It's all about sparring partners.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now if you decide to your great part,</v>

2701
01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.980
<v Speaker 6>sparring partner doesn't show up and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>get somebody from the club somewhere.</v>

2702
01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:17.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who has this?</v>

2703
01:45:17.121 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 6>We at you doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not as professional.</v>

2704
01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get injured,</v>

2705
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:23.610
<v Speaker 6>but I never been injured.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Inspiring and we</v>

2706
01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.960
<v Speaker 6>give bus route and settled down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But same with you.</v>

2707
01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:33.020
<v Speaker 6>You'll never get an engine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We will explore.</v>

2708
01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:36.680
<v Speaker 6>What did you think about cowboys?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Serone deciding no more sparring.</v>

2709
01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:38.270
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't spar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just does drills.</v>

2710
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:40.970
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about that and look</v>
<v Speaker 6>sensational.</v>

2711
01:45:40.971 --> 01:45:42.950
<v Speaker 6>In his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He looks at a station will,</v>

2712
01:45:42.951 --> 01:45:44.520
<v Speaker 6>because he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2713
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:47.720
<v Speaker 6>he still was sparring before that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2714
01:45:47.721 --> 01:45:49.220
<v Speaker 6>it's closer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the fruit of your stairway,</v>

2715
01:45:49.221 --> 01:45:51.500
<v Speaker 6>it's like a lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said he never spotted.</v>

2716
01:45:51.501 --> 01:45:53.690
<v Speaker 6>Finally he started sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He started sparring.</v>

2717
01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.150
<v Speaker 6>Any became much better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

2718
01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:57.460
<v Speaker 6>I look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think your reflects his knee.</v>

2719
01:45:57.630 --> 01:46:00.860
<v Speaker 6>Reflexes need to be tested all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're going to fight,</v>

2720
01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:03.800
<v Speaker 6>well then you're going to have to fight</v>
<v Speaker 6>in training because that's what's got to</v>

2721
01:46:03.801 --> 01:46:05.570
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unexpected things,</v>

2722
01:46:05.571 --> 01:46:06.830
<v Speaker 6>unexpected techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2723
01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:09.080
<v Speaker 6>you need to be prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you just spar,</v>

2724
01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.460
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what I'm going to throw</v>
<v Speaker 6>at you.</v>

2725
01:46:10.610 --> 01:46:12.980
<v Speaker 6>You get three show lies a counter on my</v>
<v Speaker 6>right straight.</v>

2726
01:46:12.981 --> 01:46:15.530
<v Speaker 6>Well what if I set it up as a one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two instead of just the right straight?</v>

2727
01:46:15.850 --> 01:46:16.683
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2728
01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 4>With that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2729
01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2730
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:21.800
<v Speaker 4>is if we're talking about sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not just full on fight</v>

2731
01:46:21.801 --> 01:46:23.630
<v Speaker 4>sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a whole level of sparring</v>

2732
01:46:23.631 --> 01:46:25.600
<v Speaker 4>drills that you can play with the mimics</v>
<v Speaker 4>scenarios.</v>

2733
01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:26.810
<v Speaker 4>Going back to the patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2735
01:46:29.171 --> 01:46:32.420
<v Speaker 4>there were low kick learning how to deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with those things in the motion.</v>

2736
01:46:32.421 --> 01:46:33.530
<v Speaker 4>But while you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joel,</v>

2737
01:46:33.531 --> 01:46:35.210
<v Speaker 4>yet to had the clear mind like you're in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight,</v>

2738
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:37.750
<v Speaker 4>but know that you're going to be here to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be countering the jab.</v>

2739
01:46:37.751 --> 01:46:40.730
<v Speaker 4>You're sending somebody up with a jab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not just going in finding guys,</v>

2740
01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:43.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't want this to be misled where</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's just fighting and sparring</v>

2741
01:46:43.191 --> 01:46:45.710
<v Speaker 4>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to do actual sparring drills because</v>

2742
01:46:45.711 --> 01:46:48.860
<v Speaker 4>there's a full path between hitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>myths and actual sparring and then</v>

2743
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 4>that's the web of the sparring drills.</v>

2744
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think cowboy also had an issue with</v>

2745
01:46:53.001 --> 01:46:54.330
<v Speaker 3>cutting the weight too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>

2746
01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Then he looks cut 70 cutting weight was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just too much for him at one seven he's</v>

2747
01:46:57.921 --> 01:47:00.610
<v Speaker 3>a fucking assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we're so good at the one</v>

2748
01:47:00.611 --> 01:47:02.630
<v Speaker 3>seven and there's a lot less pressure on</v>
<v Speaker 3>me at first too.</v>

2749
01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:04.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to go into a fight with just</v>

2750
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:08.000
<v Speaker 3>having fun and not thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm supposed to win this fight for him</v>

2751
01:47:08.001 --> 01:47:09.340
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to a complete different</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight class.</v>

2752
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:10.760
<v Speaker 3>What is there to lose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2753
01:47:11.210 --> 01:47:12.680
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that's what's helped him</v>
<v Speaker 3>out a lot too.</v>

2754
01:47:12.681 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 3>And I think he's kind of catching his</v>
<v Speaker 3>groove.</v>

2755
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:15.670
<v Speaker 3>He looked awesome that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2756
01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.880
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The body left Duke,</v>

2757
01:47:16.881 --> 01:47:17.510
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I kick,</v>

2758
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:19.580
<v Speaker 6>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyone all full hits.</v>

2759
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:21.830
<v Speaker 6>If you sought a body shot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I dug in there.</v>

2760
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:23.960
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then wrap it up at the high kick.</v>

2761
01:47:23.961 --> 01:47:25.700
<v Speaker 6>I love the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the technique,</v>

2762
01:47:25.701 --> 01:47:28.670
<v Speaker 6>that technical aspect that was so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was no wind up.</v>

2763
01:47:28.671 --> 01:47:33.200
<v Speaker 6>There's no fucking no muscle behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything's just perfect crack head</v>

2764
01:47:33.201 --> 01:47:34.760
<v Speaker 6>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just God damn</v>

2765
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:38.400
<v Speaker 4>as far as developing somebody a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to help him out when he was first</v>

2766
01:47:38.401 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 4>training in Colorado and he was so</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrapped up into his own style.</v>

2767
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:42.661
<v Speaker 4>I would try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2768
01:47:42.661 --> 01:47:44.040
<v Speaker 4>do this and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I realized,</v>

2769
01:47:44.041 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he even everyone needs to be their own</v>

2770
01:47:45.721 --> 01:47:46.261
<v Speaker 4>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2771
01:47:46.261 --> 01:47:47.490
<v Speaker 4>you got to do what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's good for you.</v>

2772
01:47:47.491 --> 01:47:48.450
<v Speaker 4>It feels natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead.</v>

2773
01:47:48.451 --> 01:47:50.440
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he's just a prime example of</v>

2774
01:47:50.441 --> 01:47:52.530
<v Speaker 4>someone you'd have to allow to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

2775
01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just kind of guide a little bit here</v>

2776
01:47:54.721 --> 01:47:55.680
<v Speaker 4>and there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2777
01:47:55.681 --> 01:47:57.300
<v Speaker 4>he went down to Jackson's and liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done.</v>

2778
01:47:57.301 --> 01:47:58.134

<v Speaker 4>he's amazing.</v>

2779

<v Speaker 4>He's such an individual trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all are.</v>

2780
01:48:00.601 --> 01:48:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cowboy and some other boxes.</v>

2781
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:05.040
<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking wild man.</v>

2782
01:48:05.530 --> 01:48:07.500
<v Speaker 4>W have yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's the weirdest guy you've ever</v>

2783

<v Speaker 4>worked with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where you like,</v>

2784
01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:09.450
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

<v Speaker 6>favor.</v>

2788
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:19.450
<v Speaker 3>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's not going to try to learn new</v>

2789
01:48:19.451 --> 01:48:19.840
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2790

<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2793
01:48:23.651 --> 01:48:25.570

<v Speaker 4>Now look at the results.</v>

2794
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:27.820
<v Speaker 4>The game has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to change along with it.</v>

2795
01:48:28.090 --> 01:48:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Like the definition of insanity is doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing,</v>

2796
01:48:29.981 --> 01:48:31.990
<v Speaker 4>expecting different results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to evolve.</v>

2797
01:48:31.991 --> 01:48:36.400
<v Speaker 4>We have to let the ego go and continue</v>
<v Speaker 4>to develop and train and learn.</v>

2798
01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:39.700
<v Speaker 4>The has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you guys had personality conflicts</v>

2799

<v Speaker 4>it was a great time when we were</v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2803
01:48:44.861 --> 01:48:45.581
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look what happened.</v>

<v Speaker 4>martial art instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to work with all the</v>

2809
01:48:52.301 --> 01:48:54.670
<v Speaker 4>everybody rose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was a good time as good wind when</v>

2810
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:57.460
<v Speaker 4>it worked out for me to go home and do</v>
<v Speaker 4>my own thing and uh,</v>

01:48:59.470 --> 01:49:03.310

<v Speaker 6>a good coach and the reason of that is</v>

2813
01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.140
<v Speaker 6>what I already mentioned with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>training.</v>

<v Speaker 6>ethic he took to be a coach.</v>

2816
01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:15.970
<v Speaker 6>He will always be there with the guys</v>
<v Speaker 6>cutting way to doing everything.</v>

2817

<v Speaker 6>three o'clock in the middle of the</v>

<v Speaker 6>focused on one thing and he just put</v>

2822
01:49:30.161 --> 01:49:31.440

<v Speaker 2>your method though is so uniquely Duane</v>

2863
01:50:55.231 --> 01:50:58.350
<v Speaker 2>and I really love your system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's so critical,</v>

2864
01:50:58.530 --> 01:51:02.010
<v Speaker 2>is that you've taken all your stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've written it out and you put it</v>

2865
01:51:02.011 --> 01:51:05.430
<v Speaker 2>into like this system where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>really learn.</v>

2866
01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that I learned from</v>
<v Speaker 2>rob came into the Cayman tapes who's</v>

2867
01:51:09.901 --> 01:51:12.810
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a system and it's one of the</v>

2868
01:51:12.811 --> 01:51:14.550
<v Speaker 2>things that I learned when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was training with him,</v>

2869
01:51:14.551 --> 01:51:19.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like this guy has this system the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way a lot of Jujitsu guys have a</v>

2870
01:51:19.051 --> 01:51:20.160
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2871
01:51:20.161 --> 01:51:23.550
<v Speaker 2>and it's like his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his system of breaking things down and</v>

2872
01:51:23.551 --> 01:51:27.020
<v Speaker 2>movement and strikes that it's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2873
01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.320
<v Speaker 2>it's all uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a pattern to us and you can</v>

2874
01:51:31.321 --> 01:51:33.510
<v Speaker 2>follow this pattern as a progression to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2875
01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:36.670
<v Speaker 2>And with the way the world is today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn it all from him online.</v>

2876
01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:39.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's so good at breaking things</v>

2877
01:51:39.271 --> 01:51:41.640
<v Speaker 2>down and build a to film it and show it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people that I can,</v>

2878
01:51:41.670 --> 01:51:44.490
<v Speaker 2>you can go on as online academy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn exactly what I'm doing.</v>

2879
01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you need is a willing yeah.</v>

2880
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Participants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to train with you is going to</v>

2881
01:51:48.111 --> 01:51:49.840
<v Speaker 2>do the same amount of work that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It gives me thrive and passion and a</v>

2885
01:51:55.491 --> 01:51:56.091
<v Speaker 2>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2886
01:51:56.091 --> 01:51:59.480
<v Speaker 2>to put energy in to other humans and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch them flourish and grow.</v>

2887
01:51:59.481 --> 01:52:01.430
<v Speaker 2>And get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a feedback for me.</v>

2888
01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.710
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be just doing it for myself,</v>

2889
01:52:03.711 --> 01:52:05.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good service back first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2890

2896
01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:21.120
<v Speaker 7>last time yet though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I heard you.</v>

2897
01:52:21.121 --> 01:52:24.150
<v Speaker 7>When I'm on a broadcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2898
01:52:24.151 --> 01:52:26.490

<v Speaker 7>levels of knocked down.</v>

2901
01:52:30.901 --> 01:52:32.760
<v Speaker 7>levels of a nug down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2902
01:52:32.761 --> 01:52:34.740
<v Speaker 7>once you start staggering when she full</v>
<v Speaker 7>back,</v>

2903
01:52:34.741 --> 01:52:36.810
<v Speaker 7>when she crawled away,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's all different sites,</v>

2904
01:52:36.811 --> 01:52:37.740
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think that,</v>

2905
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:40.230
<v Speaker 7>I love those compensation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2906
01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:42.690
<v Speaker 7>the round table,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sit down with some professionals and</v>

2907
01:52:42.691 --> 01:52:45.740
<v Speaker 7>talk about problems that we have right</v>
<v Speaker 7>now and then figuring it out.</v>

2908
01:52:45.741 --> 01:52:46.210
<v Speaker 7>And I</v>

2909
01:52:46.210 --> 01:52:47.330
<v Speaker 6>love that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the show all,</v>

2910
01:52:47.331 --> 01:52:50.450
<v Speaker 6>she was great that she knew talent when</v>
<v Speaker 6>I called them mcgregor in the beginning</v>

2911
01:52:50.451 --> 01:52:51.980
<v Speaker 6>we had him on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2912
01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:56.390
<v Speaker 6>so we see these guys come on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but also once a while we guys are Mark</v>

2913
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:57.890
<v Speaker 6>Coleman or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or don fry.</v>

2914
01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:59.630
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see my old buddies again.</v>

2915
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.590
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just a fun show pass.</v>

2916
01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:03.920
<v Speaker 6>Before you got here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were talking about Ipos and we showed</v>

2917
01:53:03.921 --> 01:53:06.290
<v Speaker 6>the Fabricio Werdum Travis Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I poked.</v>

2918
01:53:06.291 --> 01:53:07.400
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen it?</v>

2919
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:08.151
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard about it.</v>

2920
01:53:08.151 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking crazy.</v>

2921
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:13.550
<v Speaker 6>Like knuckle deep into different ratios.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I what do you think could help that?</v>

2922
01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:16.250
<v Speaker 6>What do you think could fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think penalties.</v>

2923
01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:18.770
<v Speaker 6>I truly believe so because if you look</v>
<v Speaker 6>at pancreas,</v>

2924
01:53:18.771 --> 01:53:21.440
<v Speaker 6>which was open and striking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we never stabbed each other in the eye.</v>

2925
01:53:21.810 --> 01:53:24.470
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] how is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2926
01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:28.100
<v Speaker 6>So now because we are cha hands</v>
<v Speaker 6>backwards because we want to hit with</v>

2927
01:53:28.101 --> 01:53:30.590
<v Speaker 6>the palm and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's just a fact when it happens,</v>

2928
01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.170
<v Speaker 6>it won't happen in training.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2929
01:53:33.171 --> 01:53:33.710
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2930
01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:35.600
<v Speaker 6>and especially not at that cap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>

2931
01:53:35.601 --> 01:53:37.000
<v Speaker 6>not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course we've got a,</v>

2932
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:38.630
<v Speaker 6>if they come from Greg Jackson winkle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>John,</v>

2933
01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 6>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well my Greg John lost an eye,</v>

2934
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

2935
01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.550
<v Speaker 6>w with a neil it wetter as it was a foot</v>
<v Speaker 6>neil.</v>

2936
01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:45.510
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tonio but,</v>

2937
01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.580
<v Speaker 6>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2938
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:49.890
<v Speaker 6>pads for some money holding paths.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens.</v>

2939
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:50.810
<v Speaker 6>Very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2940
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:52.430
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think once you say,</v>

2941
01:53:52.431 --> 01:53:55.430
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're known to do that,</v>

2942
01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.620
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did it happened with you in the past?</v>

2943
01:53:57.650 --> 01:53:59.660
<v Speaker 6>Referee should be allowed to go before</v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2944
01:53:59.661 --> 01:54:00.230
<v Speaker 6>He say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

2945
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:01.760
<v Speaker 6>when I poke I'm going to give you a red</v>
<v Speaker 6>card.</v>

2946
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:04.880
<v Speaker 6>And I think that will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that will stop it because people are</v>

2947
01:54:04.881 --> 01:54:06.830
<v Speaker 6>going to get more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>become more careful.</v>

2948
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:09.400
<v Speaker 6>We Red card,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which in pride with costs you a 10% of</v>

2949
01:54:09.401 --> 01:54:10.840
<v Speaker 6>year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>10% perse.</v>

2950
01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:14.840
<v Speaker 6>I think the point deduction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think one point every time I think,</v>

2951
01:54:14.841 --> 01:54:15.321
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2952
01:54:15.321 --> 01:54:17.780
<v Speaker 6>no warnings for an ipod because you</v>
<v Speaker 6>take,</v>

2953
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:20.120
<v Speaker 6>I think the gloves too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think that if you,</v>

2954
01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.370
<v Speaker 6>even if you take a point away from a</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy,</v>

2955
01:54:22.371 --> 01:54:27.371
<v Speaker 6>like if you warn them like that person</v>
<v Speaker 6>you poked in the eye is still damaged by</v>

2956
01:54:27.951 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so even if he says it's an accident,</v>

2957
01:54:30.381 --> 01:54:32.160
<v Speaker 6>like it doesn't matter one point either</v>
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

2958
01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:33.710
<v Speaker 6>even though it's an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I'm saying,</v>

2959
01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:37.430
<v Speaker 6>even if it's obviously an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if your fingers go in someone's eye and</v>

2960
01:54:37.431 --> 01:54:39.920
<v Speaker 6>you know it's going to cause a point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone is going to curl their knuckles</v>

2961
01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:41.570
<v Speaker 6>back even more accountable for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2962
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:42.890
<v Speaker 6>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see that.</v>

2963
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The gloves,</v>

2964
01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:46.050
<v Speaker 6>gloves and a penalties or a beating.</v>

2965
01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 6>I hate to believe anybody's doing it on</v>
<v Speaker 6>purpose,</v>

2966
01:54:51.381 --> 01:54:56.210
<v Speaker 6>but someone must be doing it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some I feel are kind of aware of that.</v>

2967
01:54:56.211 --> 01:54:58.190
<v Speaker 6>There are some tactics for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2968
01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:59.840
<v Speaker 6>does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean how often is that happening in</v>

2969
01:54:59.841 --> 01:55:00.710
<v Speaker 6>training?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2970
01:55:00.711 --> 01:55:02.030
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2971
01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.510
<v Speaker 6>some of them do look deliberate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's that kicks into pills.</v>

2972
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:09.380
<v Speaker 6>Crystal Sisinsky what's one time</v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting and he got kicked six times,</v>

2973
01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:10.640
<v Speaker 6>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might even be seven.</v>

2974
01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:12.620
<v Speaker 6>And it feels,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he goes back to the colon or the</v>

2975
01:55:12.621 --> 01:55:16.430
<v Speaker 6>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Liz and I go kick him back.</v>

2976
01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:17.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's my answer.</v>

2977
01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:21.290
<v Speaker 6>I said he's not getting a warning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so do it back then.</v>

2978
01:55:21.291 --> 01:55:23.870
<v Speaker 6>He knows how it feels and it hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's going to stop.</v>

2979
01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:26.510
<v Speaker 6>But Chris of is too nice of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't do it.</v>

2980
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:28.580
<v Speaker 6>There's a few fights where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

2981
01:55:28.581 --> 01:55:29.560
<v Speaker 6>I got to wonder why not.</v>

2982
01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.610
<v Speaker 6>If that's purpose on purpose rather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2983
01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:33.860
<v Speaker 6>did you see a check Congo versus Cro</v>
<v Speaker 6>cop?</v>

2984
01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Waylay them in the sack.</v>

2985
01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:38.840
<v Speaker 6>Wham.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like more than once.</v>

2986
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:41.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was several,</v>
<v Speaker 6>several good blows.</v>

2987
01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:45.420
<v Speaker 6>Most of the time it's bad technique most</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the times with the lead leg and they</v>

2988
01:55:45.421 --> 01:55:48.210
<v Speaker 6>don't step open to right foot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the angle cannot go,</v>

2989
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:50.430
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a 90 degree angle into the muscle</v>

2990
01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:52.050
<v Speaker 6>and it gets straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be,</v>

2991
01:55:52.051 --> 01:55:52.530
<v Speaker 6>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2992
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:53.820
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if everybody who gets kicked to the</v>

2993
01:55:53.821 --> 01:55:55.500
<v Speaker 6>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you the leg that they're</v>

2994
01:55:55.501 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 6>standing on the toes are pointing</v>
<v Speaker 6>forward.</v>

2995
01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 6>If they will point to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it will be okay.</v>

2996
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:02.880
<v Speaker 6>Well with check.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe it was knees in the clinch.</v>

2997
01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.140
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

2998
01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:06.510
<v Speaker 6>I think it was just right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2999
01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.740
<v Speaker 6>A Thai boxer shoot noted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never need anybody to build.</v>

3000
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:11.820
<v Speaker 6>I did once actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that was on purpose.</v>

3001
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:14.720
<v Speaker 6>I guess renee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rosie,</v>

3002
01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:18.270
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I could fight video from that,</v>

3003
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:21.000
<v Speaker 6>that is the best dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I fight where they,</v>

3004
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:21.990
<v Speaker 6>Rosie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you heard about that,</v>

3005
01:56:21.991 --> 01:56:23.400
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The tall guy from all a total</v>

3006
01:56:23.401 --> 01:56:24.300
<v Speaker 6>psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they say.</v>

3007
01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:27.600
<v Speaker 6>And it does always illegal things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're fighting him and I'm the first</v>

3008
01:56:27.601 --> 01:56:29.160
<v Speaker 6>ride.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I beat the crap out of him in a second</v>

3009
01:56:29.161 --> 01:56:33.180
<v Speaker 6>ride would come out and be a clinching</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he bites in my ear and I'm shouting,</v>

3010
01:56:33.210 --> 01:56:34.590
<v Speaker 6>let go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let go,</v>

3011
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:37.110
<v Speaker 6>let go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you see my knee going all the</v>

3012
01:56:37.111 --> 01:56:38.670
<v Speaker 6>way back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then I need him.</v>

3013
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:41.550
<v Speaker 6>He comes loose from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's how I knew him in the bill.</v>

3014
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:44.520
<v Speaker 6>He goes down and I wanted to attack him</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the ground,</v>

3015
01:56:44.521 --> 01:56:47.850
<v Speaker 6>but they pulled me off and then a core</v>
<v Speaker 6>habits was in my corner.</v>

3016
01:56:47.851 --> 01:56:49.720
<v Speaker 6>Now he brought all his friends who was</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3017
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:51.660
<v Speaker 6>he had hell's angels with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3018
01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 6>and I had all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my boss was friends with me and they all</v>

3019
01:56:54.601 --> 01:56:55.890
<v Speaker 6>started fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They throw us,</v>

3020
01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.640
<v Speaker 6>they threw a chair into the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If bounce off core hammers says beck at</v>

3021
01:56:59.641 --> 01:57:01.710
<v Speaker 6>leds behind me.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I see the chair,</v>

3024
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:07.560
<v Speaker 6>I sit in the chair while I watched</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody.</v>

3025
01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:13.020
<v Speaker 6>And that later they cleared everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's throw it down because the</v>

<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

3028
01:57:15.091 --> 01:57:17.430
<v Speaker 6>look at my ear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it was a hole straight through my</v>

3029
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:18.840
<v Speaker 6>air.</v>

3030
01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:21.090

<v Speaker 6>announced to everybody and other,</v>

<v Speaker 6>And then everybody calm down.</v>

3040
01:57:38.931 --> 01:57:42.050
<v Speaker 5>hit a guy in the back of the head.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It gets up.</v>

3079
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.210
<v Speaker 5>It looks steps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3080
01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:14.120
<v Speaker 5>That's my head</v>
<v Speaker 5>world combat champion.</v>

3081
01:59:14.590 --> 01:59:15.840
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the state.</v>

3082
01:59:15.850 --> 01:59:17.020
<v Speaker 5>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He helps him up.</v>

3083
01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roll over on his head.</v>

3084
01:59:18.941 --> 01:59:20.460
<v Speaker 5>We're pals now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People as well.</v>

3085
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:23.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He beat the fuck out of that dude was a</v>

3086
01:59:23.231 --> 01:59:25.900
<v Speaker 5>good one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was I think the same event where</v>

3087
01:59:25.901 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 5>Marillo bustamonte fought Tom Erickson</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they fought.</v>

3088
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:33.700
<v Speaker 5>They fought for like fucking 90 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was one of those crazy fight.</v>

3089
01:59:33.701 --> 01:59:35.290
<v Speaker 5>It was like a 45 minute fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was.</v>

3090
01:59:35.291 --> 01:59:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a crazy fight because they didn't</v>

3091
01:59:37.631 --> 01:59:40.000
<v Speaker 5>have like an ending to those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't,</v>

3092
01:59:40.001 --> 01:59:42.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just fought 90 minutes for suck up at</v>

3093
01:59:42.581 --> 01:59:45.170
<v Speaker 5>Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 5>drowns.</v>

3094
01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:47.650
<v Speaker 5>They did rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Marillo in Erickson did</v>

3095
01:59:47.651 --> 01:59:49.100
<v Speaker 5>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was just one long er,</v>

3096
01:59:49.150 --> 01:59:49.983
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

3097
01:59:50.050 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 5>But I remember like Ericsson at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

3098
01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:56.320
<v Speaker 5>he's like the forgotten heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when he was in his prime,</v>

3099
01:59:56.321 --> 02:00:01.321
<v Speaker 5>he was fucking terrifying cause he was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural 300 pound go real low and</v>

3100
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:06.160
<v Speaker 5>enormous wrestler and he could hit so</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking hard.</v>

3101
02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.110
<v Speaker 5>I remember he knocked out Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 5>Randleman,</v>

3102
02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:10.600
<v Speaker 5>he hit Kevin random and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh left hook and knocked him out.</v>

3103
02:00:10.601 --> 02:00:14.290
<v Speaker 5>But it was like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was one of the scariest guys for his</v>

3104
02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:16.600
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just like kind of missed the window,</v>

3105
02:00:16.630 --> 02:00:19.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he was really scary in the early</v>

3106
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:23.470
<v Speaker 5>days of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wanted to fight him a month ago.</v>

3107
02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:26.110
<v Speaker 5>Super tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a great guy.</v>

3108
02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:31.160
<v Speaker 5>And we tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt Lindland like nothing happened.</v>

3109
02:00:31.331 --> 02:00:33.820
<v Speaker 5>I didn't tap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they believe that a big John</v>

3110
02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.270
<v Speaker 5>talked about that on our show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

3111
02:00:37.271 --> 02:00:37.851
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3112
02:00:37.851 --> 02:00:39.960
<v Speaker 5>that was a bad one for me because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3113
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.073
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see it.</v>

3114
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:43.720
<v Speaker 5>And that's what people should understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>at home.</v>

3115
02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:44.760
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dee dee,</v>

3116
02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.840
<v Speaker 5>same as the referees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with Dina and big John just</v>

3117
02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:50.890
<v Speaker 5>show invested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They loved the sports so much.</v>

3118
02:00:50.891 --> 02:00:53.650
<v Speaker 5>There's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>therefore the foot of fighters,</v>

3119
02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.340
<v Speaker 5>so when they make a bad call,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it hurts them as well,</v>

3120
02:00:57.341 --> 02:00:59.080
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then to get the avalanche,</v>

3121
02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:01.420
<v Speaker 5>avalanche of older people on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>

3122
02:01:01.421 --> 02:01:02.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

3123
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:04.420
<v Speaker 5>everybody's human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people were talking about I believe</v>

3124
02:01:05.050 --> 02:01:07.780
<v Speaker 5>four Colt or three Kohl's that they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

3125
02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:09.910
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her with herb dean,</v>

3126
02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.100

<v Speaker 5>thousand matches.</v>

3127
02:01:12.101 --> 02:01:12.701
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3128
02:01:12.701 --> 02:01:15.950

<v Speaker 5>I like those off cody for mistakes in</v>

3129
02:01:15.951 --> 02:01:18.580
<v Speaker 5>seven and a half thousand matches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're doing a good job of both of those</v>

3130
02:01:18.581 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 5>guys are the gold standard and John</v>
<v Speaker 5>McCarthy,</v>

3131
02:01:21.521 --> 02:01:23.170
<v Speaker 5>that's the gold standard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody,</v>

3132
02:01:23.171 --> 02:01:24.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know who was really good before he</v>

3133
02:01:24.821 --> 02:01:25.870
<v Speaker 5>went away for selling weed.</v>

3134
02:01:26.650 --> 02:01:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Josh Rosen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did my last fight.</v>

3135
02:01:28.331 --> 02:01:30.400
<v Speaker 5>He's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very good.</v>

3136
02:01:30.401 --> 02:01:31.950
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Went away for something like that.</v>

3137
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:32.920
<v Speaker 5>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3138
02:01:32.921 --> 02:01:35.320
<v Speaker 5>you want to wait for selling weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he had a kind of little bit of an</v>

3139
02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:37.880
<v Speaker 5>arsenal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal Rahama,</v>

3140
02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:44.270
<v Speaker 5>a little only 12 acres of wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They will have nothing wrong with that.</v>

3141
02:01:44.350 --> 02:01:48.560
<v Speaker 5>It's just helping the world and the real</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem was I believe guns were involved</v>

3142
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:49.700
<v Speaker 5>and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when things,</v>

3143
02:01:49.701 --> 02:01:50.271
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3144
02:01:50.271 --> 02:01:52.820
<v Speaker 5>you're going to sell weed illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to be their protected.</v>

3145
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.190
<v Speaker 5>It's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is unfortunate,</v>

3146
02:01:55.191 --> 02:01:57.380
<v Speaker 5>but he was a very good referee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3147
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:59.360
<v Speaker 5>Very good referee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very good martial artist too.</v>

3148
02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He always tried and I sat and I respect</v>

3149
02:02:01.311 --> 02:02:04.340
<v Speaker 5>that obviously to having people in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>field who if you're going to work in the</v>

3150
02:02:04.341 --> 02:02:05.860
<v Speaker 5>field,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he should actually train in the fields.</v>

3151
02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:06.740
<v Speaker 5>You should have just gone one day.</v>

3152
02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:09.980
<v Speaker 5>I to bring up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did you think about the Travis</v>

3153
02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:10.470
<v Speaker 5>Browne?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fabrizio Breeshia.</v>

3154
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:12.920
<v Speaker 5>We're doing five where we're travis</v>
<v Speaker 5>called time.</v>

3155
02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:16.960
<v Speaker 5>He got his finger jammed for Breeshia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>threw a punch and travis is,</v>

3156
02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:20.960
<v Speaker 5>travis has finger apparently broke and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some photos of it now online.</v>

3157
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:22.610
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking nasty.</v>

3158
02:02:22.611 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 5>Like shows you how tough travis is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he continued with his finger was smashed</v>

3159
02:02:27.381 --> 02:02:30.650
<v Speaker 5>and it was a compound fracture with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bone broke through the skin.</v>

3160
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.170
<v Speaker 5>That's one picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's some even better ones that</v>

3161
02:02:33.171 --> 02:02:34.340
<v Speaker 5>he released today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3162
02:02:34.341 --> 02:02:35.430
<v Speaker 5>you could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3163
02:02:35.431 --> 02:02:38.090
<v Speaker 5>after the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a nasty break,</v>

3164
02:02:38.091 --> 02:02:42.410
<v Speaker 5>but so it was a weird thing where</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] through this punch and he</v>

3165
02:02:42.411 --> 02:02:46.130
<v Speaker 5>threw like one of those chocolate dell</v>
<v Speaker 5>style over hands that come over the top</v>

3166
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:50.330
<v Speaker 5>and it landed on the fingers of Travis</v>
<v Speaker 5>and snapped one of his finger.</v>

3167
02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:53.780
<v Speaker 5>So Travis calls time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you really can't do.</v>

3168
02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:54.930
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my fingers fucked up.</v>

3169
02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.950
<v Speaker 5>He calls time like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3170
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:58.370
<v Speaker 5>scroll up though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you see it.</v>

3171
02:02:58.371 --> 02:02:59.480
<v Speaker 5>The actual opening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3172
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:01.940
<v Speaker 5>Here comes the boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says timeout.</v>

3173
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.540
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Given James said he cannot do that.</v>

3174
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:07.430
<v Speaker 5>I Guess Marie Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they stop?</v>

3175
02:03:07.650 --> 02:03:09.740
<v Speaker 5>Did they go ahead and give me time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

3176
02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:11.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

3181
02:03:17.481 --> 02:03:19.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kicked him in the head and then I got</v>

3182
02:03:19.731 --> 02:03:21.440
<v Speaker 5>excited and wanted to give him another</v>
<v Speaker 5>kick in the head,</v>

02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:24.470
<v Speaker 5>but I slip and a fall and to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then Maurice wants to jump on top of me</v>

3184

<v Speaker 5>and I put my head up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So he turns around the fucking guy.</v>

3218
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:56.040
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to corner Tj in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

02:04:56.041 --> 02:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

3220

<v Speaker 1>fight and we couldn't find the fucking</v>

3221
02:04:59.881 --> 02:05:01.100
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And Master town's nowhere to be found.</v>

3223
02:05:04.621 --> 02:05:05.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

3224
02:05:05.311 --> 02:05:07.530

<v Speaker 1>Where's the master Tong and in,</v>

3225
02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:09.990

<v Speaker 1>fight I get back.</v>

3226
02:05:09.991 --> 02:05:10.824
<v Speaker 1>You messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go smoke way up in the rafters.</v>

3229
02:05:14.671 --> 02:05:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So supposedly he says he went up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rafters,</v>

3230
02:05:16.321 --> 02:05:19.590
<v Speaker 1>this smoke his cigarette and he was too</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared to get down so he couldn't come</v>

3231
02:05:19.591 --> 02:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>down to come corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great reason.</v>

3232
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the room like the next day and I</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just so cold.</v>

3236
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Good fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy is so talented.</v>

3239
02:05:37.561 --> 02:05:38.580
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish she,</v>

3240
02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:40.800

<v Speaker 1>that Dwayne head,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I Dunno man.</v>

3244
02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:49.500
<v Speaker 1>He's such a freak though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would see him in the corner with a tank</v>

3245
02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>top on and the gold,</v>

<v Speaker 1>camera for the decisions.</v>

3251
02:06:04.381 --> 02:06:08.010
<v Speaker 1>He's like position himself so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see him like he wants to be a superstar,</v>

3252
02:06:08.011 --> 02:06:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there like an issue with him</v>

3253
02:06:09.631 --> 02:06:12.930
<v Speaker 1>gambling against one of your fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>against her favor?</v>

3254
02:06:12.931 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Apparently so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3255
02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:15.210

3259

<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3260
02:06:25.701 --> 02:06:26.534
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3261
02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:29.760

<v Speaker 4>he gambled on borow to beat Faber and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's cornering faber.</v>

3269
02:06:47.281 --> 02:06:49.140
<v Speaker 4>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm leaving the hotel to go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>gambling and not budgeting his shit.</v>

3275

<v Speaker 1>he makes you do it on the mits without</v>

3307
02:08:08.321 --> 02:08:10.480
<v Speaker 1>even you knowing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes you do things you're supposed</v>

3308
02:08:10.481 --> 02:08:13.500
<v Speaker 1>to do the right way just by holding him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having a very limited,</v>

3309
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:14.730
<v Speaker 1>limited vocabulary.</v>

3310
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:15.820
<v Speaker 1>TJ A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3311
02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>here's my first trainer and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked up on a stand up very quick</v>

3312
02:08:18.791 --> 02:08:21.130
<v Speaker 1>with him and I think he's a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer.</v>

3313
02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:24.180
<v Speaker 1>He's just an addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got nasty Moitai tall dude.</v>

3314
02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.033
<v Speaker 1>He's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3315
02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:26.830
<v Speaker 1>very good tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He's good.</v>

3316
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:27.933
<v Speaker 1>I love the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3317
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people would get that gambling</v>

3318
02:08:30.491 --> 02:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>bug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a scary book.</v>

3319
02:08:31.930 --> 02:08:35.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the first Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never did a good bug.</v>

3320
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you got a trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this betting against you,</v>

3321
02:08:37.181 --> 02:08:42.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm as bad as it gets confirmed though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So master talking was coaching out in</v>

3322
02:08:42.821 --> 02:08:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's at a gym in Texas and that's when</v>

3323
02:08:44.801 --> 02:08:45.820
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Dwayne first got here,</v>

3324
02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>so masterone was kind of with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of mad and just kind of laughed</v>

3325
02:08:48.621 --> 02:08:49.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we needed a new coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3326
02:08:49.961 --> 02:08:50.950
<v Speaker 1>that's why I brought Duane in.</v>

3327
02:08:51.310 --> 02:08:55.180
<v Speaker 1>And then when favor was going to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Braley brought it back for eight weeks</v>

3328
02:08:55.181 --> 02:08:57.250
<v Speaker 1>for his camp and he's out here training</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3329
02:08:58.210 --> 02:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Favorite went in that fight with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>herd.</v>

3330
02:08:59.311 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Hamstring and message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chung knew that as well.</v>

3331
02:09:00.821 --> 02:09:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Like he tore his hamstring a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and went into the fight,</v>

3332
02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:05.230
<v Speaker 1>little injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when my strong went back to</v>

3333
02:09:05.231 --> 02:09:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was bragging that he made $5,000</v>

3334
02:09:07.541 --> 02:09:10.660
<v Speaker 1>cause you bet all this money that favor</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to win the fight and then</v>

3335
02:09:10.661 --> 02:09:13.780
<v Speaker 1>it got back to favor because favor new</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the trainer out in Texas.</v>

3336
02:09:13.781 --> 02:09:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And so it came back to when we found out</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and you know,</v>

3337
02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 1>allegedly who knows if it's really true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but message was bragging about it,</v>

3338
02:09:20.021 --> 02:09:20.854
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hurts.</v>

3339
02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Well that's awesome guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3340
02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love the guy,</v>

3341
02:09:24.041 --> 02:09:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I would come to find out,</v>

3342
02:09:25.121 --> 02:09:26.080
<v Speaker 1>he bet against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3343
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.840
<v Speaker 1>that's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what if we gave you four</v>

3344
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:33.160
<v Speaker 1>one five and give you four but like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's supposed to do.</v>

3345
02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Listen dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3346
02:09:35.141 --> 02:09:37.300
<v Speaker 1>and I know that you came into that fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little fucked up.</v>

3347
02:09:37.301 --> 02:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>So like here's a taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3348
02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:41.600
<v Speaker 1>given the majority of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3349
02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Not even half most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he still won 1000 bucks.</v>

3350
02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:46.900
<v Speaker 1>People Gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>product problem.</v>

3351
02:09:46.901 --> 02:09:47.734
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3352
02:09:50.710 --> 02:09:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause he had nothing to show for it</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

3353
02:09:52.181 --> 02:09:54.280
<v Speaker 1>He guarantee went and gambled it</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>

3354
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3355
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:58.120
<v Speaker 1>when he was coaching it off from in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning before it ain't got there.</v>

3356
02:09:58.121 --> 02:09:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's making good money,</v>

3357
02:09:59.111 --> 02:09:59.944
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's,</v>

3358
02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:03.730
<v Speaker 1>he supports his family and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he should have had been a lot more</v>

3359
02:10:03.731 --> 02:10:04.660
<v Speaker 1>well off than he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3360
02:10:04.661 --> 02:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>But he's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an addict.</v>

3361
02:10:05.881 --> 02:10:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3362
02:10:06.941 --> 02:10:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like you wouldn't have actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it's probably,</v>

3363
02:10:10.001 --> 02:10:11.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a serious problem.</v>

3364
02:10:11.081 --> 02:10:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Goes back what I was telling my guys I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing for myself.</v>

3365
02:10:12.941 --> 02:10:14.920
<v Speaker 1>You're going to create habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them be good habits and I got that</v>

3366
02:10:14.921 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 1>from Sensei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good habits,</v>

3367
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:17.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3368
02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Your habit is train like a motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 1>and teach like a motherfucker and get</v>

3369
02:10:21.341 --> 02:10:23.920
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get obsessed with Black Jack.</v>

3370
02:10:24.410 --> 02:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I invest in other humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3371
02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it's weird once you gamble because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need it.</v>

3372
02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 1>You always lose trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy gambling fights.</v>

3373
02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I used</v>

3374
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:36.290
<v Speaker 5>to do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I first started working for the</v>

3375
02:10:36.291 --> 02:10:38.420
<v Speaker 5>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would gamble on fights and then I was</v>

3376
02:10:38.421 --> 02:10:39.770
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can I get in trouble for this?</v>

3377
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:41.540
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't sure.</v>

3378
02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:42.380
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

3379
02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:43.610
<v Speaker 5>can't affect the outcome.</v>

3380
02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:46.150
<v Speaker 7>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You should mention it before to fight.</v>

3381
02:10:46.151 --> 02:10:46.984
<v Speaker 7>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I put my</v>

3382
02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:49.720
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking more enticing.</v>

3383
02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:52.600
<v Speaker 5>People get mad at me though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck bro?</v>

3384
02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:54.520
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3385
02:10:54.521 --> 02:10:59.521
<v Speaker 5>but what the fuck bro?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best is one of the time when Diego</v>

3386
02:10:59.570 --> 02:11:03.340
<v Speaker 5>see you dig,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh Sanchez when a fight and then at the</v>

3387
02:11:03.341 --> 02:11:04.570
<v Speaker 5>time here you're going to interview him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3388
02:11:04.571 --> 02:11:06.010
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you told me all this weird before and</v>

3389
02:11:06.011 --> 02:11:06.850
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3390
02:11:06.851 --> 02:11:07.720
<v Speaker 5>you're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he was like,</v>

3391
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.090
<v Speaker 5>just got quiet because he tried to call</v>
<v Speaker 5>you out,</v>

3392
02:11:10.091 --> 02:11:10.670
<v Speaker 5>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3393
02:11:10.670 --> 02:11:14.390
<v Speaker 5>that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3394
02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Have I seen this view before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He fought Joe Lowe's on and you will see</v>

3395
02:11:18.131 --> 02:11:22.690
<v Speaker 5>200 he was doing an interview before Joe</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lozan had like this whole like hadn't</v>

3396
02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:25.000
<v Speaker 5>been planned out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was almost like a freestyle rap and</v>

3397
02:11:25.001 --> 02:11:28.320
<v Speaker 5>put it on his instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is one of the funniest interviews I,</v>

3398
02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:33.940
<v Speaker 5>I wish I remember exactly who did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's so odd but awesome.</v>

3399
02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:34.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

3400
02:11:34.930 --> 02:11:38.560
<v Speaker 7>And a good thing about him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a long time ago dish before the ultimate</v>

3401
02:11:38.561 --> 02:11:41.440
<v Speaker 7>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy would send me video tapes from</v>

3402
02:11:41.441 --> 02:11:43.870
<v Speaker 7>the East Coast and we did a note and he</v>
<v Speaker 7>says,</v>

3405
02:11:47.381 --> 02:11:49.570
<v Speaker 7>I have to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I would write everything down and</v>

3406
02:11:49.571 --> 02:11:51.280
<v Speaker 7>send it back to him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I show him on the ultimate</v>

3407
02:11:51.281 --> 02:11:54.070
<v Speaker 7>fighter and the later I met him in an in</v>
<v Speaker 7>an elevator,</v>

02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:54.940
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>

<v Speaker 7>But you see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really appreciated about a guy like</v>

02:11:59.501 --> 02:11:59.900
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

3413

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3416
02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:09.740
<v Speaker 5>Diego Sanchez is a fucking warrior and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy who's one more third rounds</v>

3417
02:12:10.011 --> 02:12:13.250
<v Speaker 5>of fights where he lost the first two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Martin Kampmann fight.</v>

3418
02:12:13.251 --> 02:12:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget his face was hanging</v>
<v Speaker 5>off of his skull and he's chasing</v>

3419
02:12:17.961 --> 02:12:19.200
<v Speaker 5>Martin,</v>

02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.270
<v Speaker 5>And daigo is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just run it out of a mask of blood</v>

3422
02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:29.360
<v Speaker 5>date of the Jake ellenberger fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The end of the fight.</v>

3423
02:12:29.361 --> 02:12:31.470
<v Speaker 5>He's on Ellen burgers back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beaten the shit out of them.</v>

3424
02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:33.350
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lost the first two rounds.</v>

3425
02:12:33.351 --> 02:12:35.180
<v Speaker 5>Comes back in the third like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>savage.</v>

3426
02:12:35.210 --> 02:12:37.070
<v Speaker 5>If every fight was a hundred rounds</v>
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>

3427
02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:39.350
<v Speaker 5>Diego Sanchez might be undefeated</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexican.</v>

3428
02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:44.360
<v Speaker 5>Fantastic insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He always had a crazy car.</v>

3429
02:12:44.370 --> 02:12:49.070
<v Speaker 5>Do Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good alone.</v>

3430
02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:52.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean think about who had more</v>
<v Speaker 5>endurance and Julio Cesar Chavez,</v>

3431
02:12:52.641 --> 02:12:53.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>

3432
02:12:53.570 --> 02:12:56.540
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then people fail to mention that he</v>

3433
02:12:56.541 --> 02:12:58.830
<v Speaker 5>trained a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was in Mexico City or it's 7,000 feet</v>

3434
02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:00.080
<v Speaker 5>elevation people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't,</v>

3435
02:13:00.081 --> 02:13:03.410
<v Speaker 5>don't take wine and his fights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of his fights were there as well.</v>

3436
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good point because a lot of</v>

3437
02:13:04.701 --> 02:13:07.800
<v Speaker 5>people don't realize how high Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 5>City is.</v>

3438
02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:09.620
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know until the first time I</v>
<v Speaker 5>went there.</v>

3439
02:13:09.621 --> 02:13:11.720
<v Speaker 5>I just did a fucking elliptical machine</v>
<v Speaker 5>there and I was like,</v>

3440
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:12.860
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3441
02:13:13.290 --> 02:13:15.570
<v Speaker 7>I said it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said it to convalesce cause it'll know</v>

3442
02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:19.380
<v Speaker 7>show are you going to go out like three</v>
<v Speaker 7>weeks ahead because of the elevation?</v>

3443
02:13:19.381 --> 02:13:20.191
<v Speaker 7>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3444
02:13:20.191 --> 02:13:21.024
<v Speaker 7>we will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3445
02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:25.300
<v Speaker 7>do you think that's a smart idea?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because you should be training there.</v>

3446
02:13:25.890 --> 02:13:28.440
<v Speaker 7>When I trained for the rental and fight</v>
<v Speaker 7>at the Colorado,</v>

3447
02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:31.500
<v Speaker 7>Colorado did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but my first week days,</v>

3448
02:13:31.501 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 7>nine days were</v>

3449
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.720
<v Speaker 6>really not nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were not fun.</v>

3450
02:13:33.721 --> 02:13:35.820
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I got tired so fast.</v>

3451
02:13:35.821 --> 02:13:38.550
<v Speaker 6>It took really a while for me to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>into it.</v>

3452
02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.200
<v Speaker 5>And Colorado is 2000 feet below Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 5>City,</v>

3453
02:13:42.201 --> 02:13:45.560
<v Speaker 5>which is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A title fight there.</v>

3454
02:13:46.190 --> 02:13:48.440
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember the second shoot?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the second shoe of seed there</v>

3455
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:50.460
<v Speaker 6>with everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When everybody ran out of gas?</v>

3456
02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the first two U of c's were in</v>

3457
02:13:54.051 --> 02:13:54.741
<v Speaker 5>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3458
02:13:54.741 --> 02:13:57.050
<v Speaker 5>the first one to make nichols.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then uh,</v>

3459
02:13:57.380 --> 02:13:58.820
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3460
02:13:59.330 --> 02:14:01.010
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other arena downtown.</v>

3461
02:14:01.011 --> 02:14:05.270
<v Speaker 5>I forgot what she said with Joe and Mark</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hunt in Colorado.</v>

3462
02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:05.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes sir.</v>

3463
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:07.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost died.</v>

3464
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:11.840
<v Speaker 5>They both almost died though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's only one way to prepare for</v>

3465
02:14:11.841 --> 02:14:13.520
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to be in that Lma because</v>

3466
02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:16.430
<v Speaker 5>you literally have less red blood cells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Period.</v>

3467
02:14:16.570 --> 02:14:20.000
<v Speaker 5>Does that Taco guy who's an endurance</v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete who lives in boulder and he told</v>

3468
02:14:20.001 --> 02:14:21.770
<v Speaker 5>me you have to live there for three</v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

3469
02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:24.500
<v Speaker 5>He said to get to reach the full</v>
<v Speaker 5>potential.</v>

3470
02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.350
<v Speaker 5>He's like for free with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For you when you were talking about</v>

3471
02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:30.050
<v Speaker 5>bikers like or triathletes or something</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

3472
02:14:30.230 --> 02:14:33.440
<v Speaker 5>like for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every last second is in,</v>

3473
02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:35.990
<v Speaker 5>because you're doing the same activity</v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over and over again.</v>

3474
02:14:35.991 --> 02:14:38.150
<v Speaker 5>It's not like fighting where your</v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity,</v>

3475
02:14:38.151 --> 02:14:39.970
<v Speaker 5>your explosiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different things come coming</v>

3476
02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:42.110
<v Speaker 5>in a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just biking.</v>

3477
02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:43.340
<v Speaker 5>You're just biking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just running.</v>

3478
02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:44.300
<v Speaker 5>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just swimming.</v>

3479
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:47.180
<v Speaker 5>These are the things you're doing and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>every little second,</v>

3480
02:14:47.210 --> 02:14:51.110
<v Speaker 5>every little ounce of extra endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the optimize everything in that</v>

3481
02:14:51.111 --> 02:14:53.090
<v Speaker 5>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was saying to really hit your</v>

3482
02:14:53.091 --> 02:14:55.700
<v Speaker 5>full potential,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need to live at altitude and train an</v>

3483
02:14:55.701 --> 02:14:57.170
<v Speaker 5>altitude for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3484
02:14:57.171 --> 02:14:58.430
<v Speaker 5>so lifted trains are nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3485
02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:00.380
<v Speaker 5>I see that three years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3486
02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:04.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well full potential go from the 99% that</v>

3487
02:15:04.131 --> 02:15:08.300
<v Speaker 6>you had at one year at to said that</v>
<v Speaker 6>after three years,</v>

3488
02:15:08.301 --> 02:15:09.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could be like that as well.</v>

3489
02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:11.390
<v Speaker 6>But I understand what he's spending</v>
<v Speaker 6>threshold.</v>

3490
02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:15.110
<v Speaker 6>If you have like only 10 days or two</v>
<v Speaker 6>weeks to train high altitude,</v>

3491
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:19.500
<v Speaker 6>I almost would say don't do it because</v>
<v Speaker 6>she'll first week it's going to be the</v>

3492
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:20.510
<v Speaker 6>worst week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't think straight.</v>

3493
02:15:20.511 --> 02:15:21.051
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3494
02:15:21.051 --> 02:15:22.340
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's better to just stay.</v>

3495
02:15:22.341 --> 02:15:23.900
<v Speaker 6>But if you have to fight at high</v>
<v Speaker 6>altitude,</v>

3496
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:26.780
<v Speaker 6>always go there beforehand man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you three,</v>

3497
02:15:26.781 --> 02:15:27.800
<v Speaker 6>four weeks at least.</v>

3498
02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:28.701
<v Speaker 5>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3499
02:15:28.701 --> 02:15:31.130
<v Speaker 5>the first bank center,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is right by my academy that a</v>

3500
02:15:31.131 --> 02:15:34.100
<v Speaker 5>couple of UFC is there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you walk out of the dressing room,</v>

3501
02:15:34.101 --> 02:15:36.290
<v Speaker 5>there's a big metal sign on the wall and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says,</v>

3502
02:15:36.610 --> 02:15:37.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extreme elevation.</v>

3503
02:15:37.851 --> 02:15:40.160
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you feel light headedness or dizzy,</v>

3504
02:15:40.161 --> 02:15:42.950
<v Speaker 5>please rest to drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's what like the fighters see as</v>

3505
02:15:42.951 --> 02:15:45.130
<v Speaker 5>you're walking out to the cage to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>biggest fucking science.</v>

3506
02:15:45.131 --> 02:15:46.270
<v Speaker 5>So it's my fault there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3507
02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:47.730
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3508
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:50.830
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy for people who don't live</v>
<v Speaker 5>there to take fights at altitude.</v>

3509
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:51.703
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3510
02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:54.200
<v Speaker 5>Especially with fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fighters can't afford,</v>

3511
02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.170
<v Speaker 5>like if you're training for a fight in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexico City,</v>

3512
02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:58.320
<v Speaker 5>you can't afford to go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you,</v>

3513
02:15:58.610 --> 02:16:01.970
<v Speaker 5>if you're on the undercard you making,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what's like the lowest paid</v>

3514
02:16:01.971 --> 02:16:04.910
<v Speaker 5>guys in the UFC males is eight eight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

3515
02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.910
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy that I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to get on the o two trainer,</v>

3516
02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:09.150
<v Speaker 5>they get those lungs</v>

3517
02:16:09.150 --> 02:16:11.450
<v Speaker 6>then that will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that will help them a little strengthen</v>

3518
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.030
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes sir.</v>

3519
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.601
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3520
02:16:12.601 --> 02:16:14.250
<v Speaker 6>Because a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh this part of that,</v>

3521
02:16:14.251 --> 02:16:15.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it mimics high altitude can't,</v>

3522
02:16:16.170 --> 02:16:17.760
<v Speaker 6>you cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't do you.</v>

3523
02:16:17.761 --> 02:16:19.380
<v Speaker 6>Oh you have to wear it like eight hours</v>
<v Speaker 6>a day,</v>

3524
02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but otherwise it won't.</v>

3525
02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:23.610
<v Speaker 6>But it makes your holy spirit towards</v>
<v Speaker 6>schist system much stronger and it's</v>

3526
02:16:23.611 --> 02:16:24.510
<v Speaker 6>easier for you to pull in</v>

3527
02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:27.310
<v Speaker 5>when you're talking about your own</v>
<v Speaker 5>personal o two trainer where you put it</v>

3528
02:16:27.311 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 5>in your mouth and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have like different on to write</v>

3529
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:31.030
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3530
02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.980
<v Speaker 7>The stronger with a guy who was a</v>
<v Speaker 7>trainer,</v>

3531
02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:38.430
<v Speaker 7>the scientist behind to Usain Bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three out of gold medalists on track.</v>

3532
02:16:38.431 --> 02:16:39.780
<v Speaker 7>I feel to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3533
02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:43.770
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dominick Cruz as well as training there.</v>

3534
02:16:43.980 --> 02:16:48.240
<v Speaker 7>This guy's a higher Iq and then freaking</v>
<v Speaker 7>Einstein hat he has like over 25 medical</v>

3535
02:16:48.241 --> 02:16:52.420
<v Speaker 7>journals that were very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it's proven that only inspiratory</v>

3536
02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:53.950
<v Speaker 7>training works.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what,</v>

3537
02:16:53.951 --> 02:16:55.150
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what happened was he,</v>

3538
02:16:55.151 --> 02:16:57.350
<v Speaker 7>he did and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3539
02:16:58.020 --> 02:16:59.700
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>review of,</v>

3540
02:16:59.701 --> 02:17:01.470
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of my competition and</v>

3541
02:17:01.550 --> 02:17:04.240
<v Speaker 2>that was not explained what this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to people that are listening that</v>

3542
02:17:04.241 --> 02:17:04.830
<v Speaker 2>don't know</v>

3543
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:06.790
<v Speaker 7>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a device that I invented because I</v>

3544
02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:09.210
<v Speaker 7>was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was an asthma patient and I realized</v>

3545
02:17:09.211 --> 02:17:12.120
<v Speaker 7>that after an asthma attack for like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>weekend better eight days in bed,</v>

3546
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:13.860
<v Speaker 7>I would resume my track and field and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>would,</v>

3547
02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:16.700
<v Speaker 7>I would break my running times and it</v>
<v Speaker 7>always bought,</v>

3548
02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:18.810
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it puzzled me why,</v>

3549
02:17:18.811 --> 02:17:21.110
<v Speaker 7>why am I stronger after an attack?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is crazy.</v>

3550
02:17:21.130 --> 02:17:23.850
<v Speaker 7>The medicine medication.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I realized when I saw,</v>

3551
02:17:23.930 --> 02:17:27.310
<v Speaker 7>I went to the doctor's office and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 7>a poster on the,</v>

3552
02:17:27.350 --> 02:17:29.520
<v Speaker 7>on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a pair of lungs on there and it</v>

3553
02:17:29.521 --> 02:17:31.540
<v Speaker 7>showed where it's inflamed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3554
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:33.200
<v Speaker 7>when you have bronchitis and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

3555
02:17:33.201 --> 02:17:36.450
<v Speaker 7>and what happens is you think as a kid</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's effected in the lungs,</v>

3556
02:17:36.451 --> 02:17:38.490
<v Speaker 7>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's in the air pipes that go to the</v>

3557
02:17:38.491 --> 02:17:40.530
<v Speaker 7>lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that was my Aha moment.</v>

3558
02:17:40.531 --> 02:17:41.580
<v Speaker 7>I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3559
02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:45.300
<v Speaker 7>I've been working out in my lungs</v>
<v Speaker 7>unknowingly because I'd been pulling air</v>

3560
02:17:45.301 --> 02:17:46.740
<v Speaker 7>through that infected hole.</v>

3561
02:17:46.850 --> 02:17:49.890
<v Speaker 7>So unknowingly I made my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my whole lung system,</v>

3562
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.830
<v Speaker 7>my inspiratory system stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So why don't I come up with something</v>

3563
02:17:52.831 --> 02:17:55.200
<v Speaker 7>that controls the air intake and that</v>
<v Speaker 7>was it.</v>

3564
02:17:55.230 --> 02:17:57.120
<v Speaker 7>And then finally I started though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got it.</v>

3565
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:59.850
<v Speaker 7>I started making it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's a very simple device.</v>

3566
02:17:59.851 --> 02:18:02.130
<v Speaker 7>It starts with a whole of 15 millimeter</v>
<v Speaker 7>millimeter.</v>

3567
02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:05.850
<v Speaker 7>You start training with it and once you</v>
<v Speaker 7>feel that you get the same air as you</v>

3568
02:18:05.851 --> 02:18:07.950
<v Speaker 7>did before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you go to 14 millimeter.</v>

3569
02:18:08.310 --> 02:18:10.410
<v Speaker 7>And now with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what this guy does with it.</v>

3570
02:18:10.411 --> 02:18:13.320
<v Speaker 7>Because when my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my lawyer called me and he said,</v>

3571
02:18:13.321 --> 02:18:14.820
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did you read that review about our</v>

3572
02:18:14.821 --> 02:18:15.930
<v Speaker 7>competition?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's horrible.</v>

3573
02:18:15.931 --> 02:18:16.560
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

3574
02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:18.180
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they slammed this.</v>

3575
02:18:18.310 --> 02:18:20.070
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know because they control the area in</v>

3576
02:18:20.071 --> 02:18:21.570
<v Speaker 7>and out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a good way to do it.</v>

3577
02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:23.100
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>contact that guy,</v>

3578
02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:24.540
<v Speaker 7>I want to send them a note to a trainer.</v>

3579
02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:27.870
<v Speaker 7>And when he contacted him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said boss would do a he bus route</v>

3580
02:18:27.871 --> 02:18:28.800
<v Speaker 7>from the o two trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3581
02:18:28.801 --> 02:18:30.420
<v Speaker 7>we already using it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Conspiratory trains.</v>

3582
02:18:30.630 --> 02:18:32.670
<v Speaker 7>I love the product.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what is the difference?</v>

3583
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:35.400
<v Speaker 7>The differences when you control the air</v>
<v Speaker 7>out as well,</v>

3584
02:18:35.430 --> 02:18:37.790
<v Speaker 7>you cannot completely empty your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'll,</v>

3585
02:18:38.130 --> 02:18:41.520
<v Speaker 7>you'll do it with resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if you complete an air out is all</v>

3586
02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:44.220
<v Speaker 7>with force.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all done by your core and your</v>

3587
02:18:44.221 --> 02:18:46.530
<v Speaker 7>diaphragm and your intercostal muscles</v>
<v Speaker 7>here and your rips.</v>

3588
02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:48.570
<v Speaker 7>But breathing in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's also done with that.</v>

3589
02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:52.770
<v Speaker 7>It's much harder to breathe in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But as soon as I start stopping the</v>

3590
02:18:52.771 --> 02:18:56.200
<v Speaker 7>airflow out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I cannot completely exhale anymore</v>

3591
02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:59.040
<v Speaker 7>before I take a new breath.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what I started with.</v>

3592
02:18:59.041 --> 02:19:01.380
<v Speaker 7>So now when we going to come out with</v>
<v Speaker 7>all these medical journals,</v>

3593
02:19:01.650 --> 02:19:04.590
<v Speaker 7>with Usain Bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all these people that he trains all do</v>

3594
02:19:04.591 --> 02:19:05.820
<v Speaker 7>inspiratory muscle training.</v>

3595
02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:08.180
<v Speaker 2>So they all use that kind of a device</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

3596
02:19:08.190 --> 02:19:10.240
<v Speaker 2>all use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3597
02:19:10.241 --> 02:19:13.750
<v Speaker 2>So like those masks that you wear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that control in and out,</v>

3598
02:19:13.751 --> 02:19:14.830
<v Speaker 2>those that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3599
02:19:14.831 --> 02:19:17.990
<v Speaker 2>that was the cause of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the competition yet.</v>

3600
02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:21.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's just something that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>controls in and then you can breathe out</v>

3601
02:19:21.281 --> 02:19:24.790
<v Speaker 2>with your own mouth like so you breathe</v>
<v Speaker 2>in through it and then when you breathe</v>

3602
02:19:24.791 --> 02:19:25.151
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

3603
02:19:25.151 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 2>how does it work when you breathe out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freely does that work comes out</v>

3604
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:31.070
<v Speaker 7>because it's got two holes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one site as to where they have the holes</v>

3605
02:19:31.071 --> 02:19:34.010
<v Speaker 7>on a and on the other side you have a</v>
<v Speaker 7>flap.</v>

3606
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:35.160
<v Speaker 7>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I breathe in,</v>

3607
02:19:35.161 --> 02:19:38.540
<v Speaker 7>the flap closes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Brilliant.</v>

3608
02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:40.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it uh,</v>

3609
02:19:40.290 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 7>and then worked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the only thing that this the</v>

3610
02:19:42.231 --> 02:19:43.430
<v Speaker 7>scientist said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>

3611
02:19:43.431 --> 02:19:46.910
<v Speaker 7>well you could use it like you did boss</v>
<v Speaker 7>with training because a cure me for my</v>

3612
02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:51.010
<v Speaker 7>asthma on my website you will read a lot</v>
<v Speaker 7>of people cure for the asthma.</v>

3613
02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:54.140
<v Speaker 7>I don't use an inhaler and more and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>used an inhaler my entire life.</v>

3614
02:19:54.141 --> 02:19:57.900
<v Speaker 7>Even before world title fights always</v>
<v Speaker 7>had an inhaler with me because if it</v>

3615
02:19:57.901 --> 02:19:59.330
<v Speaker 7>would be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for instance,</v>

3616
02:19:59.331 --> 02:20:02.150
<v Speaker 7>very aggressively,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three times my lungs would close.</v>

3617
02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:05.570
<v Speaker 7>I have to open them up with an inhaler.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven't used an inhaler for two and a</v>

3618
02:20:05.571 --> 02:20:06.620
<v Speaker 7>half,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three years now anymore.</v>

3619
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:08.450
<v Speaker 7>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it works with everything.</v>

3620
02:20:08.451 --> 02:20:10.020
<v Speaker 7>We were actually looking for an FDA</v>
<v Speaker 7>approval.</v>

3621
02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:13.250
<v Speaker 7>Everything is going to happen now</v>
<v Speaker 7>because the results are just crazy.</v>

3622
02:20:13.251 --> 02:20:14.810
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's fascinating.</v>

3623
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:15.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh and what he said,</v>

3624
02:20:15.891 --> 02:20:19.190
<v Speaker 7>what I wanted to say is what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he lets them in the morning,</v>

3625
02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:23.690
<v Speaker 7>do 30 repetitions to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to take a smaller tiny hole and you lean</v>

3626
02:20:23.691 --> 02:20:25.690
<v Speaker 7>over with the o two trainer and once</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

3627
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:29.060
<v Speaker 7>you breathe out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you every bit of air goes out of your</v>

3628
02:20:29.061 --> 02:20:30.980
<v Speaker 7>lungs and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>while you're breathing in,</v>

3629
02:20:30.981 --> 02:20:35.090
<v Speaker 7>you're sitting straight up and then</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll breathe everything out against</v>

3630
02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:36.740
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do so many repetitions in the morning.</v>

3631
02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 7>That's for you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for your insight.</v>

3632
02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:40.610
<v Speaker 7>So that's all you're doing is just 30</v>
<v Speaker 7>repetitions.</v>

3633
02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:42.020
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that will build you up.</v>

3634
02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:45.110
<v Speaker 7>If you go for six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>two times a day,</v>

3635
02:20:45.111 --> 02:20:47.000
<v Speaker 7>30 minutes and earth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>30 repetitions.</v>

3636
02:20:47.001 --> 02:20:50.300
<v Speaker 7>And after that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just one time a day to increase,</v>

3637
02:20:50.301 --> 02:20:52.400
<v Speaker 7>you're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you could not to have any elected assets</v>

3638
02:20:52.401 --> 02:20:54.740
<v Speaker 7>in your core,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which by the way is the most important</v>

3639
02:20:54.741 --> 02:20:55.280
<v Speaker 7>thing if fighting.</v>

3640
02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:59.140
<v Speaker 7>That's why everybody gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always say because their muscles</v>

3641
02:20:59.170 --> 02:21:00.500
<v Speaker 7>stopped pumping,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3642
02:21:00.501 --> 02:21:02.630
<v Speaker 7>just like your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your biceps are pumping and they start</v>

3643
02:21:02.631 --> 02:21:05.540
<v Speaker 7>pushing your lungs backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So now you've launched cannot freely</v>

3644
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:07.490
<v Speaker 7>inhale anymore because you're pushing</v>
<v Speaker 7>them back,</v>

3645
02:21:07.491 --> 02:21:08.390
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which your core.</v>

3646
02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:11.210
<v Speaker 7>And that's the reason when you see guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3647
02:21:11.211 --> 02:21:13.850
<v Speaker 7>that's why I used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I actually set that at an a at the</v>

3648
02:21:13.851 --> 02:21:17.420
<v Speaker 7>seminar last Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said that's why would you before a</v>

3649
02:21:17.421 --> 02:21:19.910
<v Speaker 7>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would do a lot of apps but constant</v>

3650
02:21:19.911 --> 02:21:21.800
<v Speaker 7>stretching apps,</v>
<v Speaker 7>apps,</v>

3651
02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:22.940
<v Speaker 7>stretches,</v>
<v Speaker 7>apps,</v>

3652
02:21:22.970 --> 02:21:25.070
<v Speaker 7>stretching and I was for that reason</v>
<v Speaker 7>because you know,</v>

3653
02:21:25.071 --> 02:21:26.930
<v Speaker 7>if this gets tight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your core gets tight.</v>

3654
02:21:27.290 --> 02:21:28.460
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everything goes down hill.</v>

3655
02:21:28.461 --> 02:21:29.750
<v Speaker 7>That's why the guys in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 7>with,</v>

3656
02:21:29.751 --> 02:21:31.490
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with the steroid a while at the</v>

3657
02:21:31.491 --> 02:21:32.750
<v Speaker 7>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's still doing apparently,</v>

3658
02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:34.280
<v Speaker 7>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you saw guys,</v>

3659
02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:36.380
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because if you use steroids,</v>

3660
02:21:36.381 --> 02:21:37.850
<v Speaker 7>you pump much harder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3661
02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:40.910
<v Speaker 7>So they're very strong until the core</v>
<v Speaker 7>build software,</v>

3662
02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:44.510
<v Speaker 7>elected acid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now the lung skin breathe in anymore.</v>

3663
02:21:44.810 --> 02:21:46.190
<v Speaker 7>And that's why you see them going</v>
<v Speaker 7>strong,</v>

3664
02:21:46.191 --> 02:21:46.551
<v Speaker 7>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 7>strong,</v>

3665
02:21:46.551 --> 02:21:47.090
<v Speaker 7>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 7>strong.</v>

3666
02:21:47.090 --> 02:21:49.850
<v Speaker 7>And then suddenly they drop and it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>over with them.</v>

3667
02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:53.930
<v Speaker 7>That's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So your protocol for this o two trainer</v>

3668
02:21:53.931 --> 02:21:56.660
<v Speaker 7>is you do it 30 times,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like 30 breaths,</v>

3669
02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.820
<v Speaker 7>30 breaths in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>30 in the evening.</v>

3670
02:21:58.850 --> 02:22:01.670
<v Speaker 7>After six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you increase your Holy Spirit.</v>

3671
02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:05.180
<v Speaker 7>They say you got 15 to 20% you will</v>
<v Speaker 7>gain.</v>

3672
02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:06.530
<v Speaker 7>It's in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's incredible.</v>

3673
02:22:06.531 --> 02:22:09.050
<v Speaker 7>You can do in how,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in how long?</v>

3674
02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:12.410
<v Speaker 7>How much time does it was six weeks</v>
