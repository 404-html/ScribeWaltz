00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to tell the stories in a neutral way,</v>

75
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:21.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like,</v>

77
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.081

<v Speaker 1>I had my opinions on all these stories and all that,</v>

79
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.870

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

87
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.011
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

88
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:38.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

89
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

90
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:41.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer gets kind of tired of that and leads the rebellion and all that.</v>

104
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.001
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

105
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:51.361
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

106
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>just keep saying it.</v>

108
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.711
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

109
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:53.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting tired of it.</v>

110
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

111
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

112
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.951
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

113
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

114
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>I keep saying it because it's an eternity of saying that to the gate.</v>

115
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

116
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

117
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

118
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm really tired.</v>

119
00:01:58.591 --> 00:01:59.221
<v Speaker 1>I want to sit down.</v>

120
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like now you know how Lucifer out of it.</v>

121
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.471
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

122
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>so she's got this great,</v>

123
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>she's just great song,</v>

124
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>which goes basically,</v>

125
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer was raw hide.</v>

126
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer was right.</v>

127
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>why the songs,</v>

129
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just waiting.</v>

130
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:12.511
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

131
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>in Canada there's some homeschooling,</v>

132
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of and schooling what we were doing,</v>

133
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them are,</v>

134
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.041
<v Speaker 1>are Christians,</v>

135
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:17.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

136
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to at some point be around a bunch of Christian kids and she's</v>

137
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>going to break into this song.</v>

138
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking forward to that moment of,</v>

139
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to explain that,</v>

140
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe she's referring to a Beatles song.</v>

142
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I completely bailed on her at that point.</v>

143
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where she gets us.</v>

144
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

145
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>the real issue is you're going to have to mingle with those Christian parents.</v>

146
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>The real issue when you have children,</v>

147
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>besides raising the children,</v>

149
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>which is of course the primary one,</v>

150
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>teaching them and everything is dealing with these other parents and seeing</v>

151
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

152
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird when I see people with their kids,</v>

153
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>see how little they interact with their kids,</v>

155
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>see how like non appreciative they are of their kids,</v>

156
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>how they're always distracted or the ring of cell phones around the playground,</v>

157
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>like it to throw your cell phone,</v>

159
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>go play,</v>

160
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>go into stupid Mcdonald's tubes and go play with your kids.</v>

161
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I know a woman who's a psychologist and she picks up her kid and she's on her</v>

162
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.010
<v Speaker 2>phone while she's picking the kid up,</v>

163
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 2>the kid trying to talk to her about school and she's like,</v>

164
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>uh Huh.</v>

165
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

166
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

167
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And she's texting.</v>

168
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

169
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean you just,</v>

171
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 2>the kid was gone for five hours and when you pick them up you're texting.</v>

172
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.231
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

174
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:18.461
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

175
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:19.294
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

176
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it's so attractive to us though.</v>

177
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>So easy to do.</v>

178
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to ignore.</v>

179
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>We get so used to,</v>

180
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.900
<v Speaker 2>the kid being around and we get so used to our own free time.</v>

182
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh my daughter's really good at that.</v>

183
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to drive it.</v>

184
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>She's great.</v>

185
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.031
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

186
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>like I'm trying to teach your eye contact,</v>

187
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:32.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

188
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.604
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

189
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.271
<v Speaker 1>when she's a kid,</v>

190
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:34.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they can't focus when they look at you,</v>

192
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but that tell stories like they're just watching the biggest disco light show on</v>

193
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>the planet and you're just like some leaf or something.</v>

194
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

195
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I tried to remind her,</v>

196
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:44.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:45.110
<v Speaker 1>eye contact number,</v>

198
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.431
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

199
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.001
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

200
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:46.834
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

201
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>So the other day of course,</v>

202
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

203
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>

205
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh gel,</v>

206
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:50.261
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>

207
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:50.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:50.831
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

209
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:51.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then like I get donations,</v>

211
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>my whole show is just donations,</v>

212
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:53.951
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

213
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:54.784
<v Speaker 1>No ads or anything.</v>

214
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.730
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

215
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>when a donation comes in it's like,</v>

217
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.401
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

218
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>kibble.</v>

219
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

220
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:58.301
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>

221
00:03:58.301 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the rat with the pellet,</v>

222
00:03:59.501 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.230
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

224
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.761
<v Speaker 1>what did they get?</v>

225
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And I got this little kitchen noise that comes in cause I'm for anyway,</v>

226
00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

227
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>the kitchen noise come in.</v>

228
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:08.990
<v Speaker 1>My daughter was telling me something really important for her and all that and,</v>

229
00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:09.551
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

230
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:10.091
<v Speaker 1>she's great.</v>

231
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.721
<v Speaker 1>She's like four,</v>

232
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:10.961
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

233
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:11.794
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

234
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't act like you're absolutely right.</v>

235
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:16.031
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

236
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>How rude that was of me.</v>

237
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:17.430
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>

238
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

239
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

240
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.360
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to watch their little brains develop,</v>

241
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

242
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Then watch the way they interacted each other and how they see the world and</v>

243
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 2>realize like that this is how a person is shaped.</v>

244
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.380
<v Speaker 2>And this is the number one problem that we have as a race is that we don't</v>

245
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 2>respect this process and that we also don't respect this process in strangers,</v>

246
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>especially people that we know are fucked.</v>

247
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 2>People in bad neighborhoods,</v>

248
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 2>people in bad circumstances,</v>

249
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 2>people in a abusive families.</v>

250
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 2>We know they're fucked and we don't,</v>

251
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 2>we don't do anything to stop it.</v>

252
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.140
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I keep harping on is that if we have a resource,</v>

253
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 2>whether it's oil or gold bean,</v>

254
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 2>we protect that resource and,</v>

255
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 2>and you know we,</v>

256
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.660
<v Speaker 2>we set up laws and we attach a value to it,</v>

257
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.540
<v Speaker 2>but our number one resource for sure is human beings.</v>

258
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.490
<v Speaker 2>We have created all that you see,</v>

259
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:04.770
<v Speaker 2>whether it's laptops or buildings or cars,</v>

260
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>that's all from a human being.</v>

261
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>The best way to ensure that that continues to go on is to have less losers in</v>

262
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:11.910
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

263
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>The best way to have less losers is help out kids,</v>

264
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.810
<v Speaker 2>educate kids,</v>

265
00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 2>get on the ball with them very early and do something as a society to protect</v>

266
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 2>them primary before we go into wars,</v>

267
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.170
<v Speaker 2>before we go into all this stupid shit that we do to spying on people's fucking</v>

268
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 2>emails and looking into their cell phone record.</v>

269
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Before you do any of that,</v>

270
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Speaker 2>how about you protect kids first?</v>

271
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.420
<v Speaker 2>That should be of primary importance and it should be like one of those things</v>

272
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 2>where your kid,</v>

273
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.251
<v Speaker 2>wants to go out and play.</v>

275
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Like do have you done your homework?</v>

276
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.380
<v Speaker 2>You haven't done your homework,</v>

277
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:40.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't play.</v>

278
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It's that fucking simple.</v>

279
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't have your wars unless you fixed the kids.</v>

280
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

281
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

282
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:46.650
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

283
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.650
<v Speaker 1>they're so smart.</v>

284
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.161
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

285
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:49.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:50.061
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

287
00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the humans had a whole bunch of experts,</v>

288
00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:53.000
<v Speaker 1>a on my show,</v>

289
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.651
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

290
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>which is who talk about the native intelligence of,</v>

291
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 1>of kids.</v>

292
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Like kids can start doing mathematical reasoning at seven or eight months of</v>

293
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

294
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.301
<v Speaker 1>They can start,</v>

295
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>do using empathy at 14 months.</v>

296
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>And my daughter at the age of,</v>

297
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

298
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.583
<v Speaker 1>a four,</v>

299
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>we started playing a game called subjective versus objective.</v>

300
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

301
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>like is this something subjective?</v>

302
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Like I like ice cream or is this something objective like ice cream is made from</v>

303
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>

304
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.951
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

305
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.220
<v Speaker 1>we'd pointed staff as they subject.</v>

306
00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:17.871
<v Speaker 1>There were objective,</v>

307
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I liked jazz,</v>

309
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>subjective or objective and she's like,</v>

310
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.811
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

311
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:21.644
<v Speaker 1>rattling them off.</v>

312
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>The other day she was saying to me,</v>

313
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

314
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.471
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot.</v>

316
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>She's always asking me about the show.</v>

317
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

318
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I should've been taking notes because she's asked me all about you,</v>

319
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

320
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>what's going to be the topic?</v>

321
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.001
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

322
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:32.834
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

323
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.003
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

324
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I know it's gonna be interesting to chat with Joe,</v>

325
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>no idea what we're going to talk about.</v>

326
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And that was the best conversation.</v>

327
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

328
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:39.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

329
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:40.374
<v Speaker 1>She's asked all about,</v>

330
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>where you're from and what you do and she's awesome.</v>

332
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>They did buy mixed martial arts and all that kind of stuff.</v>

333
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.213
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

334
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

335
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>and so she's going to ask me all the time and I do some shows on economics and</v>

336
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>so we talked a little bit about that,</v>

337
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:52.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>get money and all that.</v>

339
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:54.700
<v Speaker 1>And I diagram stuff out for her to,</v>

340
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:55.800
<v Speaker 1>and she gets it really.</v>

341
00:06:55.801 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 1>We've gone through the whole history of the Second World War the other day.</v>

342
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:58.461
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

343
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:58.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:06:58.641 --> 00:06:59.474
<v Speaker 1>my Daddy,</v>

345
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I've decided why I want to do,</v>

346
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I think when I get bigger,</v>

347
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I think I just like to work at it.</v>

348
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to be the government.</v>

349
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to be the government because I just,</v>

350
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to type whatever I wanted to my bank account.</v>

351
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.790
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like,</v>

352
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

353
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>you just nailed the Federal Reserve.</v>

354
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Like right there in a nutshell,</v>

355
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever I want into my bank account.</v>

356
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] your old logic but perfect.</v>

357
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.603
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is.</v>

358
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>They can print their own money.</v>

359
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.661
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

361
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:27.494
<v Speaker 1>Great system.</v>

362
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.951
<v Speaker 1>No and I and I,</v>

364
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I come out of the sort of libertarian world,</v>

365
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:31.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

366
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>So I mean I'm an anarchist but I come out of the libertarian world and</v>

367
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians very much as we talked about non aggression principle and so on,</v>

368
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>and I've been fighting this,</v>

369
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>this battle in the libertarian world and in other worlds as well around,</v>

370
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.230
<v Speaker 1>things is to me is basic a spanking,</v>

372
00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:45.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

373
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure,</v>

374
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean we touched on this,</v>

375
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.993
<v Speaker 1>we</v>

376
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>just throw a few stats for the audience who hasn't seen it before.</v>

377
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 1>More than 90% of parents of toddlers say they smacked their child.</v>

378
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.093
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers,</v>

379
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 1>60 61% of moms,</v>

380
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>three to five year olds have spank their child.</v>

381
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>In the past week.</v>

382
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Boys is spanked a lot more than girls.</v>

383
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Boys are also diagnosed with Adhd,</v>

384
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the symptoms of spanking a lot more than girls.</v>

385
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Spanking can continue into the adolescent years.</v>

386
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.990
<v Speaker 1>30 to 40% of people in junior high,</v>

387
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:15.824
<v Speaker 1>kids in junior high.</v>

388
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I still being spanked.</v>

389
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Moms do spank children a lot more than fathers do.</v>

390
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Even controlling for time spent with kids and all of that kind of stuff.</v>

391
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:22.821
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

392
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 1>economic status doesn't have a huge amount to do with spanking,</v>

393
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:26.811
<v Speaker 1>but culture does.</v>

394
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>So African Americans a do a do a lot more corporate punishment.</v>

395
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

396
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>religious conservative fundamentalists do a lot more corporal punishment and so</v>

397
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

398
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>And this to me is such a fundamental thing.</v>

399
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm very much for philosophy that you can do philosophy,</v>

400
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.210
<v Speaker 1>that you can act on values that you can do.</v>

401
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

402
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the Federal Reserve.</v>

403
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I think central banking is a monstrous cancer in the eyeball of society,</v>

404
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>but I can't really do much about it other than rant and rave about it.</v>

405
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.901
<v Speaker 1>But we kept,</v>

406
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:51.621
<v Speaker 1>what we can do is,</v>

407
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:51.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>do some basics like stop hitting kids.</v>

409
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:53.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

410
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:55.160
<v Speaker 1>that to me it's a very fundamental,</v>

411
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>and in the libertarian community that's a challenge lot.</v>

412
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:58.883
<v Speaker 1>A lot of um,</v>

413
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 1>religious conservatives in the libertarian community as you know,</v>

414
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.274
<v Speaker 1>like on the,</v>

415
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 1>on the right or wrong republicans,</v>

416
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:05.530
<v Speaker 1>there tend to be more religious people on the left,</v>

417
00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 1>a secularist less religious people but more socialists and so on.</v>

418
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>And it is really tough,</v>

419
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:10.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>to just get that basic thing across.</v>

421
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>We tell kids not to hit each other and we hit kids and we've all,</v>

422
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you out there,</v>

423
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.420
<v Speaker 1>you see bad parenting sometimes when you're out and you act,</v>

424
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.341
<v Speaker 1>you actually,</v>

425
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>and I'll usually say something to the parents because I don't mind my,</v>

426
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.620
<v Speaker 1>my Aa,</v>

427
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the right thing to do.</v>

428
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my daughter to see me be all about the ethics and then not talk to</v>

429
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:28.651
<v Speaker 1>people doing something wrong.</v>

430
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>But you can see parents hit kids saying don't hit your sister.</v>

431
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And that the fact that they can do that without their heads exploding from this</v>

432
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 1>wormhole contradiction of Pretzel logic is just astounding.</v>

433
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.441
<v Speaker 1>But it is something,</v>

434
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 1>we still have a long way to go in.</v>

435
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I think we're kind of slowly getting there,</v>

436
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 1>but we have a long way to go and just let's not hit kids.</v>

437
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

438
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I think how much of the world would change if we didn't do that?</v>

439
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I think we would be virtually unrecognizable as a culture.</v>

440
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>

441
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:54.841
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

442
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I read this article recently on my message board.</v>

443
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

444
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't have it in front of me,</v>

445
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 2>so I apologize to whoever posted it,</v>

446
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 2>but it was about a man who got stuck in the financial system of divorce and it</v>

447
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 2>was from his perspective,</v>

448
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 2>he committed suicide,</v>

449
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 2>lit himself on fire.</v>

450
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:13.730
<v Speaker 2>I started reading his perspective and they came to his house and he had his</v>

451
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 2>initial issue because he slapped his daughter in the mouse so hard that her</v>

452
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 2>mouth was bleeding.</v>

453
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 2>And he did it because she was licking his hand.</v>

454
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Speaker 2>She kept licking his hands,</v>

455
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:24.750
<v Speaker 2>so he slapped her in the mouth til her mouth was,</v>

456
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.150
<v Speaker 2>and then everything I,</v>

457
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:26.261
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

458
00:10:26.261 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I stopped reading right there.</v>

459
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:27.931
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

460
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know this guy.</v>

461
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

462
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.291
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

463
00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad that he was so fucked up that he committed suicide.</v>

464
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 2>But if I saw a guy slap his daughter in the face because she was licking his</v>

465
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>

466
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I would have to really suppress my urge to strangle him.</v>

467
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

468
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

469
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 2>that's violence.</v>

470
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.590
<v Speaker 2>That's violence to someone who cannot defend themselves leaf.</v>

471
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.563
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

472
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.910
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

473
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

474
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.340
<v Speaker 2>it's fundamentally the most fucked up kind of violence because you're doing it</v>

475
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 2>to a developing human being who you allegedly love.</v>

476
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 2>You're teaching them the violence is a part of life by the people that they</v>

477
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 2>respect the most,</v>

478
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 2>and that it can be done to you at any time when you don't agree with whatever</v>

479
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 2>fucking guidelines and rules they've set up,</v>

480
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 2>like licking your hand.</v>

481
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 2>And my daughter was licking my hand.</v>

482
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd be laughing my ass off.</v>

483
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:12.691
<v Speaker 2>I would think.</v>

484
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny I do that.</v>

485
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd smack her in the mouth.</v>

486
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.920
<v Speaker 2>It just fucking insane.</v>

487
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.993
<v Speaker 2>But people,</v>

488
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.390
<v Speaker 2>they fall into this pattern and they don't know.</v>

489
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Don't realize that violence is violence just because you're not going to hurt</v>

490
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:24.971
<v Speaker 2>the kid that bad.</v>

491
00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to spank him and you think it's no big deal.</v>

492
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:27.691
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

493
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal because that kid,</v>

494
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrific situation.</v>

495
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something that they can't control.</v>

496
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Your holding their arm,</v>

497
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.110
<v Speaker 2>they're moving their body and then this big hand comes in slaps their ass and</v>

498
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>they feel pain and they feel confused cause you've acted out against them.</v>

499
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>You've not only acted out against him,</v>

500
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 2>you've done it aggressively yelling at slapping and it's a terrible,</v>

501
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible precedent to set a terrible idea to plant in a child's mind and</v>

502
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 2>it's unnecessary.</v>

503
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 2>It's just not necessary for you to tell me that you can't sit down and reason</v>

504
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.270
<v Speaker 2>with your child and do it with love and the,</v>

505
00:11:59.271 --> 00:11:59.471
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

506
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 2>they're going to freak out and fucking flail.</v>

507
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they get mad and yell and that's because they're a fucking child.</v>

508
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 2>You piece of Shit,</v>

509
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 2>you don't smack them.</v>

510
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:08.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

511
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 2>you just need someone for being short,</v>

512
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.231
<v Speaker 2>pitting your friends.</v>

513
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like hitting your for I don't be,</v>

514
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.660
<v Speaker 2>don't hit anybody man.</v>

515
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

516
00:12:14.251 --> 00:12:14.640

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.570

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:15.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:19.650
<v Speaker 1>the moral concentration of like black hearted nastiness,</v>

520
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.143
<v Speaker 1>you hit your wife,</v>

522
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

523
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.710
<v Speaker 1>she got to date you.</v>

524
00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:23.371
<v Speaker 1>She got to,</v>

525
00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you had an engagement.</v>

527
00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:25.231
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

530
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.570
<v Speaker 1>she chose you and you chose her,</v>

531
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.070
<v Speaker 1>but if you hit your wife,</v>

532
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:31.250
<v Speaker 1>she at least had to do you get to test drive you shit,</v>

533
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:31.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

534
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.050
<v Speaker 1>and then she can leave at anytime.</v>

535
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.901
<v Speaker 1>She's an adult,</v>

536
00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>she's got shelters,</v>

537
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:35.850
<v Speaker 1>she's got whatever.</v>

538
00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:36.690
<v Speaker 1>People will help her,</v>

539
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:37.520
<v Speaker 1>hopefully.</v>

540
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.930
<v Speaker 1>But kids that didn't choose you as parents,</v>

541
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.380

543
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.191
<v Speaker 1>And I say this,</v>

544
00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:44.611

<v Speaker 1>I know you're not here by choice.</v>

550

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

551
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.610

552
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:50.851
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

553
00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:51.900
<v Speaker 1>you didn't choose me as a dad.</v>

554
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 1>The way I have to parent is I want to parent.</v>

555
00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:55.081
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

556
00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:58.440
<v Speaker 1>if my daughter did have a choice of any doubt in the world that she would choose</v>

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.950
<v Speaker 1>How could they have been better?</v>

584
00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:29.761
<v Speaker 1>What did I do that,</v>

585
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:30.301
<v Speaker 1>that you liked?</v>

586
00:13:30.301 --> 00:13:31.590
<v Speaker 1>What did I do that you didn't like?</v>

587
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:32.011
<v Speaker 1>And all that.</v>

588
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Get that kind of feedback.</v>

589
00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

590
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird that we don't even think of doing that.</v>

591
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:36.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

592
00:13:36.931 --> 00:13:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I think your perspective is very unique in the fact that you are a stay at home</v>

593
00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:43.320
<v Speaker 2>dad and you do have the resources to be able to do that.</v>

594
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

595
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

596
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.540
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard for a lot of people.</v>

597
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:46.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's while you were talking about before,</v>

598
00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:48.030
<v Speaker 2>that number's pretty crazy.</v>

599
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.320
<v Speaker 2>The 20 minutes a week.</v>

600
00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that it was that low,</v>

601
00:13:50.641 --> 00:13:52.320
<v Speaker 2>but honestly,</v>

602
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.490
<v Speaker 2>not shocked.</v>

603
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a regular life,</v>

604
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:56.340
<v Speaker 2>but I've dabbled in regular life,</v>

605
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:56.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I've had like jobs that take me away for a long period of time during the day</v>

607
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.460
<v Speaker 2>and I could only imagine what kind of energy you have to devote to a kid.</v>

608
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.301
<v Speaker 2>If the mother,</v>

609
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:09.900
<v Speaker 2>both the mother and the father both leave the house all day long,</v>

610
00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:11.550
<v Speaker 2>work an eight hour day and then come home.</v>

611
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.413
<v Speaker 2>How much is left?</v>

612
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.580
<v Speaker 2>There's not even much time the kid's going to be awake.</v>

613
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

614
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.470
<v Speaker 2>How much energy do you have left?</v>

615
00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:18.690
<v Speaker 2>How much focus or you're putting on that kid during the day</v>

616
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.121
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

617
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:19.970
<v Speaker 1>and we have this,</v>

618
00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a couple more stats.</v>

619
00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:22.064
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

620
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.750
<v Speaker 1>we have this idea that the moms have to be there and the dads can be there.</v>

621
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.370
<v Speaker 1>But a study conducted by Dr. Kyle Pruitt found that infants between seven and 30</v>

622
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.100
<v Speaker 1>months respond more favorably to being picked up by their fathers.</v>

623
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.820
<v Speaker 1>He also found a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical,</v>

624
00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:40.730
<v Speaker 1>cognitive and emotional and behavioral development.</v>

625
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Mothers tend to reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers</v>

626
00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:45.620
<v Speaker 1>encouraged them to manage their frustration.</v>

627
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And my daughter's like this,</v>

628
00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:48.530
<v Speaker 1>so she's learning to do all these things and,</v>

629
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.150
<v Speaker 1>and most of her friends are older cause you know,</v>

630
00:14:50.151 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>we're not the youngest on the block.</v>

631
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.740
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of her friends can do stuff better than she can.</v>

632
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:57.680
<v Speaker 1>She gets frustrated and me helping her talk it through that frustration and</v>

633
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>reminding her that I didn't know how to do this stuff and you know,</v>

634
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 1>she's trying to do racket sports and I remember took me years to become good at</v>

635
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:04.280
<v Speaker 1>racket sports.</v>

636
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

637
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

638
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>so that's important for,</v>

639
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 1>for kids as well.</v>

640
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

641
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 1>it's really important to remember,</v>

642
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

643
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

644
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>the mom and the kid,</v>

645
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>they used to be the same freaking person,</v>

646
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 1>like she grew her,</v>

648
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:15.790
<v Speaker 1>they were like this,</v>

649
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like my arm,</v>

650
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:17.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a separate thing.</v>

652
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Whereas they had to have a little bit more objectivity around that.</v>

653
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>A longer term study that this guy did to prove that a father's active</v>

654
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 1>involvement with his kids from birth to adolescence promotes greater emotional</v>

655
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:27.411
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>

656
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:28.490
<v Speaker 1>stronger curiosity,</v>

657
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 1>a stronger sense of self assurance,</v>

658
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 1>additional studies during the first five years of a child's life.</v>

659
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 1>The father's role is more influential than the mothers in how the child learns</v>

660
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 1>to manage his or her body,</v>

661
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>navigate social,</v>

662
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:39.571
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

663
00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.030
<v Speaker 1>social circumstances in play.</v>

664
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.710
<v Speaker 1>And the last one is this.</v>

665
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 1>The 1996 study that I was referring to before by Mcgill University.</v>

666
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

667
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 1>the single most important childhood factor in developing empathy is paternal</v>

668
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 1>involvement in childcare.</v>

669
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 1>The study further concluded that children who spend time alone binding but the</v>

670
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 1>children more than twice per week brought up the most compassionate adults.</v>

671
00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

672
00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.730
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

673
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.570
<v Speaker 2>how do they measure that?</v>

674
00:16:00.571 --> 00:16:01.620
<v Speaker 2>How's that quantifiable?</v>

675
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

676
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.570
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a weird,</v>

677
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.400
<v Speaker 2>all of those statistics seemed very odd.</v>

678
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like how do you know what caused the person to have more empathy?</v>

679
00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:11.730
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what caused the person to be able to move better?</v>

680
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:12.780
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

681
00:16:12.781 --> 00:16:13.141
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

682
00:16:13.141 --> 00:16:13.690
<v Speaker 2>how do you work</v>

683
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:13.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

684
00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:14.830
<v Speaker 1>what they proved that,</v>

685
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.280
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

686
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.870
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a many to many relationships.</v>

687
00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So they asked the father is,</v>

688
00:16:18.671 --> 00:16:18.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

689
00:16:18.881 --> 00:16:20.080
<v Speaker 1>how often were you involved in,</v>

690
00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:22.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe they even measured them if it's sort of a life study and then they</v>

691
00:16:22.931 --> 00:16:25.900
<v Speaker 1>measured the compassion and then they measure a whole bunch of other things.</v>

692
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And if the other things don't change the compassion measure,</v>

693
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.700
<v Speaker 1>but then the parental involvement is what moves the needle,</v>

694
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.710
<v Speaker 1>then they assume that that's close to causal.</v>

695
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.380
<v Speaker 2>But isn't the issue also the parental involvement?</v>

696
00:16:35.381 --> 00:16:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Like say if a father is involved a lot in the kid's life,</v>

697
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:42.100
<v Speaker 2>he's also probably likely involved in the relationship with the wife and maybe</v>

698
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.960
<v Speaker 2>their wife would be more happy.</v>

699
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>The father and the wife would be more happy and because of that they would both</v>

700
00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:48.580
<v Speaker 2>be better parents.</v>

701
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.833
<v Speaker 2>So it could,</v>

702
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>it might not just be that the impact of having a man around does all these</v>

703
00:16:53.381 --> 00:16:54.520
<v Speaker 2>things and creates an empathy.</v>

704
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:57.340
<v Speaker 2>It might be the impact of having a successful family as well.</v>

705
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

706
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

707
00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And that certainly is true.</v>

708
00:16:59.391 --> 00:16:59.751
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

709
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't run the studies.</v>

710
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I assume that they've tried,</v>

711
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 1>like whenever you questioned this,</v>

712
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>always tried to tease it out this way or that way,</v>

713
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

714
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 1>they to try to find that answer.</v>

715
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

716
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that compassion,</v>

717
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.710
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

718
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

719
00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:13.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

720
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:13.501
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

721
00:17:13.501 --> 00:17:14.061
<v Speaker 1>your marriage,</v>

722
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:14.420
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

723
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you've got kids floating around and all that and floating,</v>

724
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.973
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>

725
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>but they were floating at one point and then they came out through the magic</v>

726
00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:22.814
<v Speaker 1>chamber.</v>

727
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.121
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

728
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:23.421
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

729
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:23.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

730
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:24.111
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

731
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:24.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

733
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:27.590
<v Speaker 1>my wife's skills as a parent are fantastic and,</v>

734
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

735
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

736
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but there are some differences between us,</v>

737
00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:30.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know whether it's biological or whether it's just the way we were</v>

739
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:33.531
<v Speaker 1>raised or whatever,</v>

740
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:33.801
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

741
00:17:33.801 --> 00:17:34.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

742
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I encourage more risk taking a,</v>

744
00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

745
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.671
<v Speaker 1>I encourage,</v>

746
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 1>if you fall off the horse,</v>

748
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>get back up and again,</v>

749
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

750
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's just sort of,</v>

751
00:17:42.051 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of a natural kind of difference.</v>

752
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:43.661
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

753
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:44.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

754
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm also more encouraging of,</v>

755
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 1>my daughter is like crazy frenzy.</v>

757
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I keep thinking she's going to go up to someone sometimes an unfriendly world,</v>

758
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 1>like a cheese up to a greater,</v>

759
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:53.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

760
00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>we're just kind of get shredded because,</v>

761
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:54.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

762
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 1>we go places and she just goes up to kids and says,</v>

763
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:56.821
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

764
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>would you like to be friends?</v>

765
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.780
<v Speaker 1>And I was cool.</v>

766
00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.613
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

767
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

768
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>the old people up a little,</v>

769
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

770
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:02.401
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

771
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:02.821
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

772
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:03.211
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be,</v>

773
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>everybody was on ecstasy.</v>

774
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:05.900
<v Speaker 1>That's how we would interact with each other.</v>

775
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
