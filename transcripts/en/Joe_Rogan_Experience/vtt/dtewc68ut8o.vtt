00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters just helps your brain flow.</v>

58
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of controversial science behind all this.</v>

59
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I use it and I use it because it's effective and I've been using it for years.</v>

60
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 5>I started using it and I'll give another plug to him because he's gonna be on</v>

61
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 5>the podcast eventually Bill Roman asked his neuro one was the first neutral pick</v>

62
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 5>that I ever tried and he concocted this combination of nutrients to help himself</v>

63
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 5>after he had he developed a few concussions from football.</v>

64
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 6>I know he's actually said if he didn't see stars he didn't think he was hit</v>

<v Speaker 7>You're real aware of.</v>

70
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 8>I was in Denver and we were doing some big comedy central Romanesque he was.</v>

72
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 8>interview Romanesque ask is said no you know I said I do like and I go in and</v>

73
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 8>lunch.</v>

74
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 8>He's sitting there at a table of eight alone the rest of the place is packed.</v>

75
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.513
<v Speaker 8>Whoa yeah.</v>

78
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 10>I mean I but I am curious to know how scary.</v>

79
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.090
<v Speaker 10>It's like now that fucking guy by himself.</v>

80
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 6>He was the one that spit in the guy's face on Monday night football and then</v>

81
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.480
<v Speaker 6>they said it was a racial thing.</v>

82
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.730
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking no it's not a racial thing.</v>

83
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.593
<v Speaker 6>He's just a nut.</v>

84
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah he wasn't doing anything.</v>

85
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.610
<v Speaker 5>He's just a fucking gangster on a grid of his stuff.</v>

86
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.010
<v Speaker 5>Neuro one is the first nootropics I've ever tried.</v>

87
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.710
<v Speaker 5>If you're in shit now for brain go to on it Doc comments.</v>

88
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh and I t use the code name Rogan and save yourself 10 percent of any and all</v>

89
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.260
<v Speaker 5>orders.</v>

90
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 5>We also have kettle bells.</v>

91
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 5>And finally and they are the best quality kettle bells that we could find there.</v>

92
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 5>Made by York and we're selling them as cheap as we can sell them.</v>

93
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.773
<v Speaker 5>They're excellent.</v>

94
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.790
<v Speaker 5>You only need to buy them once for an entire lifetime's worth of use and they're</v>

95
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.643
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion.</v>

96
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 5>They're my favorite workout piece of equipment.</v>

97
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't hardly do anything other than I do some bench press stuff.</v>

98
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.050
<v Speaker 5>I do some a lot of chin ups and bodyweight squats and stuff like that but almost</v>

99
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 5>everything else I do is kettle bells because it's just such an effective</v>

100
00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:58.154
<v Speaker 5>workout.</v>

101
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.400
<v Speaker 5>For like real body functional strength.</v>

102
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.760
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of videos that are available on how to use kettle bells will</v>

103
00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.640
<v Speaker 5>eventually probably sell them on on our site too.</v>

104
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.650
<v Speaker 5>We'll probably see if maybe we can buy some from Steve Maxwell because I think</v>

105
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.260
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion he's like one of the greatest kettlebell instructors alive.</v>

106
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.610
<v Speaker 5>And I've had the good pleasure of being trained by him a couple of times so I</v>

107
00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 5>can vouch for his staff.</v>

108
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.090
<v Speaker 5>All of his videos are excellent.</v>

109
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.020
<v Speaker 5>They're awesome.</v>

110
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.130
<v Speaker 5>You can find them from Amazon and a bunch of different places but any Steve</v>

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 11>Well you know what.</v>

141
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 11>I don't think men are represented fairly in the media.</v>

142
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.030
<v Speaker 11>I don't think there's enough actual you know guys that are telling you what's</v>

143
00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:43.440
<v Speaker 11>what's really going on from their honest perspective.</v>

144
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 11>As someone that you can relate to.</v>

145
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 11>You know I think a lot of people are full of shit and I think a lot of men could</v>

146
00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:50.480
<v Speaker 11>use a martial arts training.</v>

147
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 11>It's good for you.</v>

148
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.140
<v Speaker 6>I think martial arts and comedy is a great great mix.</v>

149
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.070
<v Speaker 6>It does work.</v>

150
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 11>Yeah it seems like it wouldn't but it really does work.</v>

151
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 11>You know when I was when I was a martial arts guy only and I got into comedy I</v>

152
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 11>was almost embarrassed of being like having something to do with martial arts</v>

153
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 11>cause it seemed so do she.</v>

154
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 11>It doesn't seem like that would like that would be funny at all.</v>

155
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.110
<v Speaker 6>Joe even people that beat the shit that other people want to have a laugh</v>

156
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 6>they want to relax.</v>

157
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.913
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

158
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

159
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.600
<v Speaker 5>Comedy is great for your martial arts.</v>

160
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Great for you everybody and it's beautiful when I hear it stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Somebody is always great.</v>

162
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 6>I got such a kick out of it.</v>

163
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 6>I mean it happened every night.</v>

164
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 6>Every night.</v>

165
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.740

169
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 11>I get people sending me pictures of their kale shakes that drink kale shakes</v>

170
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.324
<v Speaker 11>every morning.</v>

171
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 11>So I got a lot of people doing this.</v>

172
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 11>Kevin James got me on know Kevin James lost 80 pounds for this movie where he</v>

173
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 11>played an Indian a fighter.</v>

174
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.860
<v Speaker 11>Yeah and looked fuckin fantastic his fucking face became thin.</v>

175
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 11>We always told me how strong he was.</v>

176
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.243
<v Speaker 11>He's an animal.</v>

177
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 11>Kevin James loves to eat.</v>

178
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 11>He eats like a motherfucker.</v>

179
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 11>But physically that guy is a he's a bear dude.</v>

180
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.000
<v Speaker 11>He's a big boned head.</v>

181
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 11>He hits hard.</v>

182
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 11>He's a big scary motherfucker and he you know he really could have been a</v>

183
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 11>fighter if he ever chose to go down that path.</v>

184
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 11>He has like serious power like especially in his hands.</v>

185
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 11>But he he hit mitts with Mark Dela granny and I was watch him hit them.</v>

186
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.710
<v Speaker 11>It's like he's like a real athlete even though he's a guy.</v>

187
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 11>So he lost all this weight and he looks so good I was so blown away I was like</v>

188
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 11>What the fuck did you do.</v>

189
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 11>And he said the most important thing is everything I switch to an all vegetable</v>

190
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:25.274
<v Speaker 11>diet.</v>

191
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 11>Everything was vegetables.</v>

192
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 11>Everyday he didn't eat any animal products at all.</v>

193
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.540
<v Speaker 11>And he did this for a long time.</v>

194
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 11>He went back to it eventually but he would have a kale shake every morning.</v>

195
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 11>And the idea was you you have this thing called a Vita makes you throw Kale</v>

196
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:45.041
<v Speaker 11>Cucumber celery pears and then I throw ginger and garlic in there and borrow it</v>

197
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 11>and it tastes like ass.</v>

198
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 11>I mean it's barely eatable.</v>

199
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 11>You just sort of.</v>

200
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.350
<v Speaker 11>Every time I do it it's like a little victory like there.</v>

201
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.303
<v Speaker 11>I just get it.</v>

202
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 11>I got to that next.</v>

203
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 11>The next day I win again.</v>

204
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 11>You know every time I do it I feel like I win.</v>

205
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.830
<v Speaker 11>But we had that good but I was just saying.</v>

206
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.640
<v Speaker 11>But nutrient wise it's like incredibly dense.</v>

207
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 11>It opens up your bowels your shit comes out like like it's just a lubed up in on</v>

208
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 11>a right.</v>

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.170
<v Speaker 9>Kevin was in a great mood talking lamp and as soon as the food came he was going</v>

235
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.360
<v Speaker 9>to make him fucking look up by going his last meal.</v>

236
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.210
<v Speaker 11>Well that's when Kevin had gotten back to eating again.</v>

237
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.080
<v Speaker 11>And that was because he had really like Christine he's all in and nothing.</v>

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.420
<v Speaker 11>He's like Yeah he's kind of like me in a lot of ways.</v>

239
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.660
<v Speaker 11>He's we're very similar and one of the ways is that we do crazy about things.</v>

240
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.690
<v Speaker 11>You know he'll get crazy about golf and he's like FUCK HIM want to play golf all</v>

241
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:24.470
<v Speaker 11>day every year.</v>

242
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 11>Well that's yeah you're like that in pool.</v>

243
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

244
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.570
<v Speaker 4>And I got a real problem and starting a bottom up after three hours.</v>

245
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.890
<v Speaker 4>Joe I'm tired.</v>

246
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.150
<v Speaker 7>I played a woman the other day and we only played a race to five.</v>

247
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.260
<v Speaker 7>It was I kind of was such a tease I wasn't even warmed up yet it was how I can</v>

248
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.830
<v Speaker 7>for me pool is like three or four hour experiment experience.</v>

249
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.240
<v Speaker 6>You have that long time.</v>

250
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.100
<v Speaker 6>Like I said I said Do you have the marathon runner and I have a sprinter</v>

251
00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:52.730
<v Speaker 6>mentality like when I'm on stage if I'm doing really well I can't wait to get</v>

252
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:54.680
<v Speaker 6>the fuck out because I'm doing really well.</v>

253
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.140
<v Speaker 6>I went for 45 minutes I'm out of there.</v>

254
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 6>Bing bang boom.</v>

255
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 6>But like you love to be up there for a couple hours Yeah and it's great.</v>

256
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 11>I mean I think only if I can maintain that energy and I've never seen you not.</v>

257
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 11>Well I think it's also you have to factor in the audience's energy so I don't do</v>

258
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 11>shows as long as I used to do.</v>

259
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 11>I've done some stupid like two and a half hour shows.</v>

260
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 11>And the problem often is people don't want to hear you talk for two and a half</v>

261
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 11>hours after a while they're bored.</v>

262
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 11>It's like and then the end of it it was always it always came like this.</v>

263
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.360
<v Speaker 11>Question and answer section right.</v>

264
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.950
<v Speaker 11>And if that felt to me like what I was doing was I was having this killer hour</v>

265
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 11>and 10 minutes a comedy and then I was ending it with like an hour of mediocrity</v>

266
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 11>and I was like This is like the question answered sometimes would be awesome but</v>

267
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 11>sometimes it would just sort of become a and yell fast.</v>

268
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.330
<v Speaker 6>People yelling shit and just become gross and well some of that you know the</v>

269
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 6>Dave Dave Chappelle thing with the five hours.</v>

270
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

271
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.890
<v Speaker 6>I said to the I think it was up to seven.</v>

272
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 6>Okay whatever but some ridiculous and I said to the booker of the club I said</v>

273
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 6>that he did material.</v>

274
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.820
<v Speaker 6>She goes it was all new material.</v>

275
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.140
<v Speaker 6>This isn't one I don't believe that.</v>

276
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 6>So I asked the staff that go for material.</v>

277
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 6>He asked one guy where it was from three times the guy says I'm still from</v>

278
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:04.674
<v Speaker 6>Pittsburgh.</v>

279
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

280
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 7>Well you know if people are willing to just sit there and you just sit around</v>

281
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:16.791
<v Speaker 7>talking heads that still stand up you know it's like your standup is your You're</v>

282
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 7>a craftsman.</v>

283
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 7>When you go up there you've got jokes you got punch lines you got setups you</v>

284
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 7>got.</v>

285
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 7>You can't wait to get to them because they're killer.</v>

286
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 6>But I have no idea how to write I swear to God.</v>

287
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm true.</v>

288
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't I don't have any idea how to write a joke because it has to come out.</v>

289
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 6>In its own way.</v>

290
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how to like mathematically you remember Rita Rudner.</v>

291
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 6>People like that are like joke technicians right.</v>

292
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 6>And I know you do know how to write a joke or you just say funny thing.</v>

293
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 11>I just write what I do as I write and I write blogs like blog entries and then</v>

294
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.210
<v Speaker 11>in the in writing about something since there's no pressure to be funny.</v>

295
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.600
<v Speaker 11>Then I get the ideas for jokes out of that or I have ideas and I'll slowly work</v>

296
00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:00.720
<v Speaker 11>them out on stage.</v>

297
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.920
<v Speaker 11>I do a bunch of different ways.</v>

298
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.630
<v Speaker 11>Sometimes I don't have anything written.</v>

299
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.470
<v Speaker 11>It's just this idea that's been fucking with me and then I go on stage and I try</v>

300
00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:10.740
<v Speaker 11>it one way and then I say well it was that that idea was misinterpreted and I'll</v>

301
00:12:10.741 --> 00:12:13.320
<v Speaker 11>try it another way the next time until eventually I get it.</v>

302
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.300
<v Speaker 6>I had dreams last two weeks of shit that was killing and my dream</v>

303
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.110
<v Speaker 6>that we playing pool.</v>

304
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:21.920
<v Speaker 16>Oh yeah.</v>

305
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.150
<v Speaker 16>That's another one since then.</v>

306
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.500
<v Speaker 6>But I was having this dream about organic alcohol.</v>

307
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.940
<v Speaker 6>What was the one that you told me we were playing pool our relief pitcher.</v>

308
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.660
<v Speaker 17>Yes yes.</v>

309
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.900
<v Speaker 17>I had this dream like and fucking 70000 people.</v>

310
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.280
<v Speaker 17>And what's up with relief pitchers.</v>

311
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 17>I mean you know it's a relief if they get off.</v>

312
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.570
<v Speaker 17>And I was like like such stupid non joke I know I'm fucking like it was a part</v>

313
00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 17>of me that I think I knew I was asleep and I thought I can't wait to wake up to</v>

314
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.220
<v Speaker 17>write this down oh no it's nothing it's nothing it was funny it was so funny</v>

315
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.280
<v Speaker 17>it's funny and you were killing me.</v>

316
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.700
<v Speaker 16>It was real out of my fucking thought throngs of people I know I've done that</v>

317
00:12:56.701 --> 00:12:57.110
<v Speaker 16>before.</v>

318
00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.900
<v Speaker 18>I know I've had dreams where I was killing on stage I could remember God is the</v>

319
00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:04.380
<v Speaker 18>best stuff I've ever written and I couldn't wait to write it down and I woke up</v>

320
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 18>like were you talking do you ever wake up laughing Joe.</v>

321
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:12.020
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes yeah I had a dream when I was first moved to New York and my dream was</v>

322
00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:16.680
<v Speaker 6>I had a job and was involved I had to sit and shoot to see how long scientists</v>

323
00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:20.490
<v Speaker 6>would stand around with these charts see how long it took soup to cool and it</v>

324
00:13:20.491 --> 00:13:22.350
<v Speaker 6>was chicken gumbo soup right.</v>

325
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.520
<v Speaker 6>And I remember sitting in the soup was like fuck I.</v>

326
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.990
<v Speaker 6>And then I sit down and I turn to the camera.</v>

327
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.110
<v Speaker 6>There's a camera in my dream and I go 8 eight dollars an hour sitting in soup</v>

328
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.010
<v Speaker 6>out bag and a big.</v>

329
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.750
<v Speaker 6>Then I moved to New York and then the rest is history.</v>

330
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.300
<v Speaker 11>That's hilarious.</v>

331
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.240
<v Speaker 11>I think if you laugh a lot and you used to laugh in a line it's more likely to</v>

332
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.740
<v Speaker 11>get a laugh in dreams.</v>

333
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah I would have bought Chrysler just sits there and laugh like nonstop in his</v>

334
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 3>dream.</v>

335
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why.</v>

336
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Is a happy motherfucker right now.</v>

337
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:55.110
<v Speaker 5>That guy is that guy I've never met anybody who's like more thankful for like</v>

338
00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:58.560
<v Speaker 5>his success in life things that are going well in his life and so happy.</v>

339
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.270
<v Speaker 5>He's such a happy nice guy.</v>

340
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.660
<v Speaker 6>I always wondered about guys who were always depressed like Marc Maron.</v>

341
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah I got a love more but Marc was one of those guys that was always so</v>

342
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:08.370
<v Speaker 6>depressed.</v>

343
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.150
<v Speaker 19>Now he's successful and he's got a really nice girlfriend goes it's bother you</v>

344
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.870
<v Speaker 19>guys I don't know what to do what my feelings because I'm so used these so used</v>

345
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:16.704
<v Speaker 19>to be miserable.</v>

346
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.870
<v Speaker 7>It's gonna be careful man because all that is really bad for you all the years</v>

347
00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:25.020
<v Speaker 7>of and that's not like woo woo that's like that's real.</v>

348
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 7>New Years of harboring resentment and bad feelings and selfishness like that.</v>

349
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:34.140
<v Speaker 7>All that negativity that fucks with you and keeps you from sleeping seems better</v>

350
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.520
<v Speaker 7>to me though I'm sure it is.</v>

351
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure he is I mean he's a smart guy he knows.</v>

352
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.830
<v Speaker 7>I mean he's been one of the things is he doing a podcast where you read it very.</v>

353
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.310
<v Speaker 7>Very openly bare your soul.</v>

354
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.090
<v Speaker 14>Yeah I mean he like when he does these like monologues where he talks about</v>

355
00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:55.650
<v Speaker 14>things in the beginning of his know his podcast he's being he's very honest</v>

356
00:14:55.651 --> 00:15:00.651
<v Speaker 14>about all of his transgressions and thoughts about him in the past and all sorts</v>

357
00:15:01.591 --> 00:15:02.370
<v Speaker 14>of different things.</v>

358
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.880
<v Speaker 14>So I think it's like super therapeutic in a way to do something like that.</v>

359
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.940
<v Speaker 14>Like you can really get over your shit when you broadcast it.</v>

360
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.680
<v Speaker 14>Yeah you know and I I think I think we all have a tendency.</v>

361
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.930
<v Speaker 14>It's so easy to go towards the negative.</v>

362
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.650
<v Speaker 14>It's just so dangerous.</v>

363
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.300
<v Speaker 14>It's so dangerous to think that that's the more profound way to think it's so</v>

364
00:15:21.301 --> 00:15:22.770
<v Speaker 14>it's so fucking stupid for you.</v>

365
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.520
<v Speaker 6>I never really let somebody else's success diminish me.</v>

366
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.350
<v Speaker 11>I just thought you never have.</v>

367
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.750
<v Speaker 11>You've never been a jealous guy ever get anybody.</v>

368
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.800
<v Speaker 6>Somebody said one time about Eddie Murphy.</v>

<v Speaker 18>What why is that.</v>

407
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.740
<v Speaker 18>What is that weird free shot that's you know that's a bizarre thing.</v>

408
00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:57.150
<v Speaker 6>Sportswriters who couldn't make their grade school football teams are critiquing</v>

409
00:16:57.151 --> 00:17:00.780
<v Speaker 6>guys like Roman Polanski critiquing guys that were great players you never</v>

410
00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:04.150
<v Speaker 6>played they never played anything well I'd critique fighters on there.</v>

411
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 7>My fight kickboxing and taekwondo but I'm never following them I may fight.</v>

412
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.830
<v Speaker 7>All I do is yeah but you wouldn't believe you if it came up when you were coming</v>

413
00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:12.210
<v Speaker 7>up it would have you would have fought them.</v>

414
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:17.330
<v Speaker 7>Yeah I would have and I'd probably be a pig probably a mess right now.</v>

415
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.590
<v Speaker 7>Right about now physically on there.</v>

416
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.100
<v Speaker 6>Forget the fight that I came to see you and the mother and the sister would sit</v>

417
00:17:23.101 --> 00:17:27.030
<v Speaker 6>next to me they're gonna get knocked down that's when reality hits you.</v>

418
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.620
<v Speaker 6>When you sit next to the relatives.</v>

419
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah well especially if they get badly cowed and so there's a visceral fear that</v>

420
00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:36.990
<v Speaker 7>comes from people getting badly killed because it looks like they're done.</v>

421
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 7>Guy gets head kicked or something.</v>

422
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.270
<v Speaker 7>You remember with that fight in Vegas and the guy got hit and the ref caught him</v>

423
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.020
<v Speaker 7>too.</v>

424
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.450
<v Speaker 7>He was so light you remember it was Felix Trinidad.</v>

425
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:46.230
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>

426

<v Speaker 7>Yeah yeah.</v>

427
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.910
<v Speaker 7>We saw Felix Trinidad I forget who was fighting but it was when Trinidad was</v>

428
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 7>really coming up.</v>

429
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 7>It was when he was like I think it was a welterweight fight.</v>

430
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

431
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 7>Caught him on the left hook bam dropped him.</v>

432
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 6>Felix Trinidad had a wicked left and the ref caught up to one the ref called the</v>

433
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.810
<v Speaker 6>guy before he hit the ground up to lead the back of his head.</v>

434
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.220
<v Speaker 6>Then just the front of his head was.</v>

435
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah we saw a couple great fights in Vegas.</v>

436
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember who else we saw fight there but I mean we saw a couple good</v>

437
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:14.424
<v Speaker 7>fights there.</v>

438
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 7>Boxing live is weird like you know I'm used to it at the UFC because I'm the</v>

439
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:19.390
<v Speaker 7>voice of it.</v>

440
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 7>Yeah it's weird when you're sitting there and you don't hear any commentary.</v>

441
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 7>Yes watching guys just fucking get the shit kicked out of each other.</v>

442
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

443

452
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:48.540

<v Speaker 6>year old stud because he's the star.</v>

588
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.790
<v Speaker 6>They had been big gathering up evidence and it's really interesting.</v>

589
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.590
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's we were doing like roleplaying and trying to see what Sandusky would</v>

590
00:23:04.591 --> 00:23:05.520
<v Speaker 6>stay if he took the stand.</v>

591
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.720
<v Speaker 6>His wife's on the stand today.</v>

592
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.153

<v Speaker 9>Oh my God.</v>

595
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:14.240
<v Speaker 9>And like we're doing things like why would 10 kids you know embarrassed</v>

596
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:15.420
<v Speaker 9>themselves that come out.</v>

597
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.680
<v Speaker 9>Well I don't know.</v>

598
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.270
<v Speaker 9>Maybe they misremembered it.</v>

599
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.760
<v Speaker 9>I love that misremember what bullshit.</v>

600
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.570
<v Speaker 7>But it's so scary.</v>

601
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.020
<v Speaker 7>The whole story is so scary because they protected him.</v>

602
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah they protected that guy.</v>

603
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 7>You know when when people freaked out when everybody went on a goddamn rampage</v>

604
00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Speaker 7>cause Joe Paterno got fired.</v>

605
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.730
<v Speaker 7>I wonder what information they had.</v>

606
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.300
<v Speaker 6>You know I mean Joe when you just go to the cops.</v>

607
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.033
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

608

<v Speaker 6>Well why would you go for the chain of command what is this Nazi Germany.</v>

609
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.450
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand.</v>

610
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.010
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand what coming down.</v>

611
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.350
<v Speaker 6>I understand what happened and what why.</v>

612
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.730
<v Speaker 6>What they said happened was he went to and another assistant coach went to his</v>

613
00:23:53.731 --> 00:23:56.850
<v Speaker 6>father and then they went to paternal paternal somebody else.</v>

614
00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.940
<v Speaker 6>I would've gone to the cops right away if I see somebody hurting a kid.</v>

615
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:00.923
<v Speaker 6>Bam.</v>

616
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.290
<v Speaker 7>And then how do you not beat him to death right there on the spot.</v>

617
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:04.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

618
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.820
<v Speaker 7>You know that's gotta be an instinct too much.</v>

619
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.580
<v Speaker 7>Who'd want to beat him to death.</v>

620
00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.220
<v Speaker 7>That guy's raping a boy.</v>

621
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.550
<v Speaker 7>The whole thing is just so creepy if it really happened the way they're saying</v>

622
00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:15.360
<v Speaker 7>it happened.</v>

623
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.630
<v Speaker 7>I mean I'm assuming at this point in time that he's he's guilty.</v>

624
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I just know that I not.</v>

625
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Why would all these kids come in.</v>

626
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah you're right.</v>

627
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.330
<v Speaker 4>No we have simply they didn't come from the same.</v>

628
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.020
<v Speaker 7>I'm not I would certainly not argue and I just you know for the sake of being</v>

629
00:24:28.021 --> 00:24:30.210
<v Speaker 7>fair the whole thing is fucking horrifying.</v>

630
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 7>It's so terrifying it's so terrifying that they had this monster and protected.</v>

631
00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.580
<v Speaker 7>Then they if that's really the case.</v>

632
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah that's so scary to me as well.</v>

633
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.510
<v Speaker 7>Catholic Catholic Church type stuff.</v>

634
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.050
<v Speaker 7>How else could they not know.</v>

635
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.080
<v Speaker 7>I mean how could they not know.</v>

636
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.650
<v Speaker 6>The Catholic Church type stuff is fucking horrifying.</v>

637
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.700
<v Speaker 6>We used to have a priest that molested us when I was a summer in summer camp.</v>

638
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.170
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

639
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.010
<v Speaker 6>You never got me because I was such a nut.</v>

640
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.310
<v Speaker 6>I was always a light sleeper and afraid of the dark like a real man I would have</v>

641
00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:02.800
<v Speaker 6>a flashlight on under my under my sheets.</v>

642
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.230
<v Speaker 6>So every night I slept real late you know.</v>

643
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.123
<v Speaker 6>But he.</v>

644
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.220
<v Speaker 6>And we knew about it and nobody said anything because he was a priest.</v>

645
00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.140
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

646
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.220
<v Speaker 6>And then they just had a whole thing about him.</v>

647
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 6>Even though he's dead they condemned his actions and stuff.</v>

648
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.050
<v Speaker 6>And the Philly papers recently.</v>

649
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.250
<v Speaker 6>What did he d to do.</v>

650
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.910
<v Speaker 6>He would just like you know jerk off kids in their sleep or wouldn't play with</v>

651
00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:22.744
<v Speaker 6>them or whatever.</v>

652
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.990
<v Speaker 6>God I don't think he.</v>

653
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he did any of the Sandusky type level stuff because it was mostly</v>

654
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:28.234
<v Speaker 6>a sleep thing.</v>

655
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.090
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing when you find out how many of them.</v>

656
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:31.990

<v Speaker 7>Get him.</v>

823
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.960
<v Speaker 7>He's a genius man.</v>

824
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.870
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing that a guy like Sandusky is still alive.</v>

825
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.450
<v Speaker 7>You know what all the negative show has done.</v>

826
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.430
<v Speaker 7>How is his body still holding up.</v>

827
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.293
<v Speaker 7>How is this though.</v>

828
00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.760
<v Speaker 6>How about when he waves to people like he's running for office.</v>

829
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:00.210
<v Speaker 6>He gets it.</v>

830
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.370
<v Speaker 6>He's smiling and shit.</v>

831
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.090
<v Speaker 6>I could see a psychotic he is.</v>

832
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean if anybody else accused if you're innocent or accused of all this you'd</v>

833
00:32:07.261 --> 00:32:08.430
<v Speaker 6>be out of your fucking mind.</v>

834
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 7>It's so weird to even think about it since it's so sick and gross.</v>

835
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:21.110
<v Speaker 7>This is so few things in life that disturb people more than someone taking</v>

836
00:32:21.991 --> 00:32:22.890
<v Speaker 7>advantage of children.</v>

837
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.880
<v Speaker 7>Oh I know that the whole futures that kids futures fuck you poising that kid's</v>

838
00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:27.270
<v Speaker 7>mind.</v>

839
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.440
<v Speaker 7>That's the one thing in prison.</v>

840
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.660
<v Speaker 7>They say that child molesters get their ass kicked.</v>

841
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah of course because a lot of people out there a lot of people to torture</v>

842
00:32:34.051 --> 00:32:39.051
<v Speaker 7>victims you know as children they can they said I love when people go I hope</v>

843
00:32:39.421 --> 00:32:41.740
<v Speaker 7>they do that to him in jail but it's gonna to fuck him.</v>

844
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.010
<v Speaker 6>They look at stretched out Grace.</v>

845
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.173
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

846
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.960
<v Speaker 7>I think they're going to kill him if he goes in general population.</v>

847
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.320
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

848
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.230
<v Speaker 7>They beat him to death.</v>

849
00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.490
<v Speaker 7>Sixty nine now right.</v>

850
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.180
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

851
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:52.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

852
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.300
<v Speaker 7>And then they put him if they put him in you know silent solitary in isolation.</v>

853
00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.160
<v Speaker 7>I mean it seems like they're just going to convict him.</v>

854
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.130
<v Speaker 7>I mean it just it seems like the evidence is pretty overwhelming.</v>

855
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.800
<v Speaker 6>I mean really the problem is with these kind of trials it has to be a hundred</v>

856
00:33:04.801 --> 00:33:05.634
<v Speaker 6>percent.</v>

857
00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.750
<v Speaker 6>It can't be a hung jury if one person is not sure then they have to do a</v>

858
00:33:09.751 --> 00:33:10.320
<v Speaker 6>retrial.</v>

859
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.970
<v Speaker 7>This one seems so crazy though it almost knee requires a second case it requires</v>

860
00:33:14.971 --> 00:33:19.320
<v Speaker 7>him to be guilty and then you to go back to the whole school and everyone</v>

861
00:33:19.321 --> 00:33:22.600
<v Speaker 7>involved you fucked in you see well that's gonna come down after this.</v>

862
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.280
<v Speaker 6>The president the guys who resign are gonna.</v>

863
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

864
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.060
<v Speaker 6>They have their day in court.</v>

865
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.930
<v Speaker 6>Most paternal is dead right.</v>

866
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:29.340

867
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

868
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.403
<v Speaker 6>He died.</v>

869
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 6>That killed them too.</v>

870
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean he had cancer but I mean he would have he would have fought it.</v>

871
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.150
<v Speaker 6>He just was of course a beaten man.</v>

872
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean what a terrible position to be in.</v>

873
00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:43.140
<v Speaker 6>You know I didn't have it all those years at an incredible success and he was</v>

874
00:33:43.141 --> 00:33:47.730
<v Speaker 6>king of Nittany Valley you know Penn State and then boom fuck man.</v>

875
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.160
<v Speaker 6>It just shows you the Santa fucking movie.</v>

<v Speaker 7>And movie.</v>

877
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.640
<v Speaker 7>This world is strange it operates it's fucking strange and you know they're</v>

878
00:33:56.671 --> 00:33:58.140
<v Speaker 7>famous for their linebackers.</v>

879
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.530
<v Speaker 6>They call the linebacker you and he you know who was the coach the linebackers.</v>

880
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 6>Sandusky asking.</v>

881
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.840
<v Speaker 6>You know he was a nice.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He was an aura of revered revered revered revered</v>

883
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:10.640
<v Speaker 6>coach.</v>

884
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.600
<v Speaker 6>Don't let him turn into Irwin Corey remember.</v>

885
00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.060
<v Speaker 7>I feel he was rabid.</v>

886
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:17.400
<v Speaker 7>Wow that's nuts.</v>

887
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.540
<v Speaker 7>Well there's a lot of guys who do really good at coaching because they really</v>

888
00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:22.374
<v Speaker 7>like men.</v>

889
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.550
<v Speaker 7>Makes sense right.</v>

890
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.863
<v Speaker 7>Yeah well.</v>

891
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.030
<v Speaker 7>Well you know he's really looking out for him.</v>

892
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

893
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.910
<v Speaker 6>People put themselves in situations like that's what's scary about it.</v>

894
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:33.960
<v Speaker 6>Some people really do love kids and they love to see them successful.</v>

895
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.710
<v Speaker 6>I mean I was a great fourth grade teacher because I fucking love the kids.</v>

896
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.230
<v Speaker 6>I told them my son I don't care.</v>

897
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.290
<v Speaker 6>I just do it you know.</v>

898
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.730
<v Speaker 6>I want you to be happy.</v>

900
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.700
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

901
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.260
<v Speaker 6>I said but let me tell you you're never gonna be in this.</v>

902
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.380
<v Speaker 6>Some of this math is such bullshit.</v>

903
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.590
<v Speaker 9>I said you're not going to be in a bind go Man if I only knew the Pythagorean</v>

904
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:56.310
<v Speaker 9>theorem I get that it is charming and it's better they have they're happy right.</v>

905
00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.000
<v Speaker 9>You know I just learned it's past marks because I don't wanna get in trouble.</v>

906
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.750
<v Speaker 9>But basically I want you to go to the gym.</v>

907
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.603
<v Speaker 9>Have fun in life.</v>

908
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:03.953
<v Speaker 9>You know.</v>

909
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:05.663
<v Speaker 18>A good teacher.</v>

910
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.990
<v Speaker 18>That's a great advice if you don't want be mathematicians for the rest of this</v>

911
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 18>year.</v>

912
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.330
<v Speaker 18>Mastery issues are going to come out anyway.</v>

913
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.500
<v Speaker 18>Kids that are a eggheads who are brilliant at it you know you just shouldn't</v>

914
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:19.090
<v Speaker 18>force kids like that like me who had nothing.</v>

915
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.170
<v Speaker 18>Is it possible to teach really complex things that just make it fun.</v>

916
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah yeah.</v>

917
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.470
<v Speaker 6>The only thing they couldn't understand.</v>

918
00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.890
<v Speaker 6>I could never get through to the kids was the relativity of up and down.</v>

919
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:33.060
<v Speaker 6>Now there's no absolute up or down it's relative to a point because we're in the</v>

920
00:35:33.061 --> 00:35:33.450
<v Speaker 6>universe.</v>

921
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

922
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.600
<v Speaker 6>I mean like you know we're you know like people go Well that's it.</v>

923
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 6>They don't understand how people in Australia are not upside down.</v>

924
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.410
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

925
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:40.680
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

926
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 6>And I could never explain that.</v>

927
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 6>It was from a relative point but they're only nine 10 years old.</v>

928
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

929
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 21>Well it is hard to grasp the whole organic spaceship thing.</v>

930
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:50.690
<v Speaker 21>Oh yeah.</v>

931
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:54.450
<v Speaker 21>That we were all floating in here and we will we're looking for land looking for</v>

932
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:57.890
<v Speaker 21>property Dom looking to settle down put a house down in this primary.</v>

933
00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.350
<v Speaker 21>Now there's nothing permanent stupid.</v>

934
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.080
<v Speaker 21>The whole earth is a convertible.</v>

935
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.720
<v Speaker 21>Yeah it's flying through the universe or a convertible that can be easily hit by</v>

936
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 21>another convertible.</v>

937
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.610
<v Speaker 21>Yeah.</v>

938
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 21>They and it happens.</v>

939
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.900
<v Speaker 21>That's the whole theory about the moon's creation.</v>

940
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:15.170
<v Speaker 21>The most recent theory is that there was earth one and Earth one was like a</v>

941
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.470
<v Speaker 21>fiery fuckin ball of flame or whatever the fuck it was different.</v>

942
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 21>I don't what it was about it was different than Earth 2 but it got hit by</v>

943
00:36:22.591 --> 00:36:23.424
<v Speaker 21>another planet.</v>

944
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 21>And that created the moon and changed the whole orbit of Earth and changed the</v>

945
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:30.030
<v Speaker 21>atmosphere and that's the reason why everything exists today.</v>

946
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:35.060
<v Speaker 21>I mean the reason why we're able to sustain life because our temperature is</v>

947
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:40.020
<v Speaker 21>remarkably consistent because of the fact that we have a moon you know is it.</v>

948
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 21>Yeah.</v>

949
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.580
<v Speaker 21>I don't know how it stays within a couple degrees.</v>

950
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.110
<v Speaker 21>Yeah.</v>

951
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 21>That's part of it.</v>

952
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.120
<v Speaker 21>Part of it is the moon.</v>

953
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.500
<v Speaker 21>The moon keeps our orbit really steady somewhere or another like its gravity</v>

954
00:36:49.501 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 21>interactions.</v>

955
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:50.970
<v Speaker 21>I don't understand it.</v>

956
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 18>I don't understand gravity I mean we're supposed to understand what makes things</v>

957
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:58.000
<v Speaker 18>float in space what makes things stick to those things.</v>

958
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 18>I used to have a fear when I went to the beach that I would be sucked up into</v>

959
00:37:01.111 --> 00:37:03.940
<v Speaker 18>the air and gravity wouldn't work just for me.</v>

960
00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 16>I saw it just that day.</v>

961
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.290
<v Speaker 16>All of a sudden I'm going Fuck gravity.</v>

962
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.153
<v Speaker 16>Thanks a lot.</v>

963
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.233
<v Speaker 16>I can't get there.</v>

964
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 7>Gravity is a crazy thing to wrap your head around that there's stuff floating</v>

965
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 7>when you get outside of the gravity of the Earth so you pass a certain distance</v>

966
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:20.540
<v Speaker 7>from the earth where it no longer pulls on you you can float.</v>

967
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.410
<v Speaker 7>Yeah like the earth has not that far.</v>

968
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.230
<v Speaker 7>Not that far.</v>

969
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.310
<v Speaker 7>So a few hundred miles right.</v>

970
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.770
<v Speaker 7>I mean I mean I mean 30 miles or something.</v>

971
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.810
<v Speaker 7>Yeah I think it's yeah just as soon as you get out of there.</v>

972
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.970
<v Speaker 7>How many miles is making things up there.</v>

973
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 7>Three hundred miles is like space shuttle.</v>

974
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 7>That's like that's what the space.</v>

975
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.000
<v Speaker 7>Oh it's the space shuttle.</v>

976
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.950
<v Speaker 7>They go to like 250 300 miles.</v>

977
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.610
<v Speaker 7>They go like somewhere around one man's crazy and then they you know obviously</v>

978
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.060
<v Speaker 7>that's where the space station is you can float around up there but I don't know</v>

979
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.250
<v Speaker 7>like at what height you can start floating.</v>

980
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:54.740
<v Speaker 4>When you come crashing to your death and what high can you just float around</v>

981
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:55.623
<v Speaker 4>that causes.</v>

982
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.280
<v Speaker 4>That's a real fine line man.</v>

983
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.310
<v Speaker 6>I was doing a roast with who's the first man on the moon Neil Armstrong.</v>

984
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.600
<v Speaker 6>Armstrong I think was the owner of Jones was one of those guys.</v>

985
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.170
<v Speaker 6>Buzz Buzz Aldrin Buzz Aldrin.</v>

986
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.030
<v Speaker 6>I was a member of the Friars Club.</v>

987
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:13.040
<v Speaker 6>Really I did a roast and I remember saying like What the fuck could scare you.</v>

988
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.840
<v Speaker 6>You've been to the moon right.</v>

989
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:19.590
<v Speaker 6>And I imagined sitting in a ship going boys were off to the moon today.</v>

990
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:24.740
<v Speaker 6>If you really went to the moon to do it a second was it a Disney film.</v>

991
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.520
<v Speaker 6>Joe are you telling us that nobody ever really went to the moon.</v>

992
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.040
<v Speaker 7>I think it's very possible that people went to the moon.</v>

993
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.230
<v Speaker 7>It's also very possible they faked the whole thing.</v>

994
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.920
<v Speaker 7>Well if they did it was like a best orgasm ever.</v>

995
00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.270
<v Speaker 7>They did a good job.</v>

996
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.800
<v Speaker 7>They got us all excited.</v>

997
00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.070
<v Speaker 7>People think I'm retarded for taking this in their right I am retarded it's not</v>

1261
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.250
<v Speaker 16>What happened to you.</v>

1262
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.270
<v Speaker 16>I don't wanna talk about it.</v>

1263
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.570
<v Speaker 7>Oh shit.</v>

1264
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.280
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ.</v>

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:10.510
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.940
<v Speaker 9>But you're right about having the wife and you know a husband and wife and when</v>

1267
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.030
<v Speaker 9>one of them does porn and the other doesn't and both the US weird is weird.</v>

1268
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.160
<v Speaker 7>So this dude took me to the set and these girls were doing it and it was Jill</v>

1269
00:49:24.101 --> 00:49:29.101
<v Speaker 7>Kelley and Janine sadly did say you know who both the fan.</v>

1270
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 7>They're both beautiful Janine is really yeah.</v>

1271
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.310
<v Speaker 7>And this was back in the day.</v>

1272
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 7>She only had no she had any tattoos.</v>

1273
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 7>Maybe she had a couple but now she's like fully sleeved and shit.</v>

1274
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.330
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah I know.</v>

1275
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.160
<v Speaker 7>Yeah it's weird but.</v>

1276
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:43.780
<v Speaker 7>And they were just two girls like each other out.</v>

1277
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 7>So I was like this is just so strange it feels so that the music and the whole</v>

1278
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:52.420
<v Speaker 7>the whole thing while watching the camera you know circle them and seeing the</v>

1279
00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:54.470
<v Speaker 7>lights and the guy with the boom mike.</v>

1280
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.320
<v Speaker 7>I was like This is so odd.</v>

1281
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.880
<v Speaker 7>It just seems so strange.</v>

1282
00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.230
<v Speaker 7>Anybody got the gum.</v>

1283
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.590
<v Speaker 7>It was just real close.</v>

1284
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.600
<v Speaker 7>Well it's almost like clinical or something yeah.</v>

1285
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 7>Of course it didn't seem like you know like if these are two girls and they</v>

1286
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 7>would just sit on the couch and all a sudden one girl just started eating the</v>

1287
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:11.944
<v Speaker 7>girls acid below.</v>

1288
00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.840
<v Speaker 7>Well what the fuck.</v>

1289
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.580
<v Speaker 7>Like you'd be nervous right.</v>

1290
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.270
<v Speaker 7>Like what is happening here.</v>

1291
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.440
<v Speaker 7>This is crazy.</v>

1292
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.360
<v Speaker 7>But to watch it like to go and like it's sort of orchestrated an action.</v>

1293
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 7>OK.</v>

1294
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.610
<v Speaker 7>You know I want two fingers now.</v>

1295
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.040
<v Speaker 7>OK.</v>

1296
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.873
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1298
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.300
<v Speaker 7>Spit on it spit on.</v>

1299
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.230
<v Speaker 6>Player s.</v>

1300
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 6>Frazier.</v>

1301
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 6>I was at the I was at the magic castle and a friend of mine and this one of the</v>

1302
00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:37.680
<v Speaker 6>dancers from the shirt tour came in who I knew four years ago.</v>

1303
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.420
<v Speaker 9>So I can just say that because there's so many of them and we go back to my</v>

1304
00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:43.490
<v Speaker 9>house and we're by the pool table.</v>

1305
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.880
<v Speaker 9>And Kristie you know my old girlfriend comes out and I shouldn't say her name.</v>

1306
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.700
<v Speaker 9>Well it doesn't matter it's not her last name.</v>

1307
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:51.703
<v Speaker 9>Still love you.</v>

1308
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:57.590
<v Speaker 9>And she has puke breast and she took her bra off and just had a T-shirt on there</v>

1309
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 9>sticking straight out and the girl just casually walks over to her lips and</v>

1310
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.003
<v Speaker 9>starts sucking it.</v>

1311
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 19>Oh and me and my friend Ali would just like they're like holy shit.</v>

1312
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 19>And you know.</v>

1313
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:11.103
<v Speaker 19>I mean.</v>

1314
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.110
<v Speaker 6>Russell Peters always does that joke about like acting like he's gonna jerk you</v>

1315
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:15.970
<v Speaker 6>up as a joke.</v>

1316
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:18.470
<v Speaker 6>We say we take care you date tough guy.</v>

1317
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.200
<v Speaker 6>And I mean that is just so odd.</v>

1318
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 6>And it was sexy to a point and then one of the girls wanted to go down the other</v>

1319
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:26.720
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>

1320
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.670
<v Speaker 6>That's right Julie line.</v>

1321
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 7>Imagine if there was so as many like really openly bisexual men as there were</v>

1322
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.150
<v Speaker 7>openly bisexual just different it's different.</v>

1323
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:38.210
<v Speaker 7>Well it's different because it's bullshit because a lot of them aren't really</v>

1324
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:38.900
<v Speaker 7>bisexual.</v>

1325
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:39.460
<v Speaker 7>Some of them are.</v>

1326
00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.440
<v Speaker 12>For sure you are just a lot of women a..</v>

1327
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 12>I'm saying they're fake and not an act for us now.</v>

1328
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 7>Zee Don't break my family and there's no stigma attached to it.</v>

1329
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 7>No social stigma.</v>

1330
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:53.630
<v Speaker 7>You know some girls genuinely like girls of course but there's a lot of fake</v>

1331
00:51:53.631 --> 00:51:54.500
<v Speaker 7>lesbians out there.</v>

1332
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.340

1333
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I know the girls are in the porn that our girls are all real.</v>
