<v Speaker 2>We've got to quit.</v>

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 2>That was as good as we've ever done.</v>

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 2>What we should do right now.</v>

16
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's move to Seattle.</v>

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 2>We should move to the Wilderness area where they filmed the very first twilight.</v>

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.193
<v Speaker 2>Be</v>

19
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

20
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.421
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you though.</v>

21
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 2>As far as how as the fair,</v>

22
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that was good though.</v>

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>

24
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we've heard that about a podcast.</v>

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.323
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

26
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I know we were fucked up,</v>

28
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 2>but I think that,</v>

29
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I think people are going to say that was,</v>

30
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 2>it was really good.</v>

31
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Was there one moment where you felt like this was the wrong thing to do?</v>

32
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.673
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

33
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.221
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

34
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>

35
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

36
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.050
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

37
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 2>it was fun.</v>

38
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 2>That was the damn perfect ride down the side of a mountain</v>

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.133
<v Speaker 2>sledding.</v>

40
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Million miles an hour off.</v>

41
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I might be as good as we're capable of those.</v>

42
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 2>We might go towards higher.</v>

43
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:49.911
<v Speaker 2>We may have to just do that once a week and we might have to go skiing for God.</v>

44
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 2>That was like the most,</v>

45
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.253
<v Speaker 2>I think you were,</v>

46
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.783
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

47
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

48
00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.611
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

49
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>

50
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>you're like some existential apart from talks or her people who shouldn't even</v>

51
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 2>fucking know what existentialism is.</v>

52
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

53
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 2>don't I always explain the way you know some of them,</v>

54
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>like they get deep enough.</v>

55
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So let me explain myself.</v>

56
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.911
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

57
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:14.744
<v Speaker 2>I'm the,</v>

58
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm the bridge between the meatheads and upon.</v>

59
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly my bread.</v>

60
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

61
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 2>people out there,</v>

62
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 2>your audience understands that we're doing shit in a different way and you're</v>

63
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:26.384
<v Speaker 2>doing shit.</v>

64
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.680
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking awesome.</v>

65
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to Munster off to do the fucking fight.</v>

66
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.900
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time you here doing fucking podcast.</v>

67
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Talk to me about how the fuck no one's ever done that before.</v>

68
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe no one's ever done it before in the history of frumpy media.</v>

69
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

70
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:43.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because it wasn't there.</v>

71
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's been there.</v>

72
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Why did they,</v>

73
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.224
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's been there.</v>

74
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I honestly believe that closure of the exposure two information gets broader and</v>

75
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.710
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to get swept into this sort of wave of information and wave of</v>

76
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>exposure to information.</v>

77
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:11.191
<v Speaker 2>I think concentrating on where the information is being tuned into or where it's</v>

78
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>being drawn,</v>

79
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.380
<v Speaker 2>cast is not</v>

80
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing.</v>

81
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing has never been done.</v>

82
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>

83
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't never be done,</v>

84
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 2>but you know you've never had four g internet before.</v>

85
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that boy who is doing what you're doing,</v>

86
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.383
<v Speaker 2>it has never been.</v>

87
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

88
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's fucking fantastic.</v>

89
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

90
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.181
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

91
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

92
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>It's all we're doing is letting me know shit that's happening.</v>

93
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Do it was not as,</v>

94
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of doing because it's never been done and it's fantastic.</v>

95
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

96
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I said that the last podcast.</v>

97
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't say it then.</v>

98
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.743
<v Speaker 2>That'd be it.</v>

99
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.150
<v Speaker 2>But what you're doing is that it's fine.</v>

100
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

101
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 2>we're lucky that we're in a position to do it,</v>

102
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's with what anybody would do.</v>

103
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.460
<v Speaker 2>They logically look to the situation and realize this or</v>

104
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

105
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a man.</v>

106
00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing has never been done.</v>

107
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

108
00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:14.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because it's that hard or it's that is.</v>

109
00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 2>There's no resistance to doing Brian,</v>

110
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.290
<v Speaker 2>here's the reality,</v>

111
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:18.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel any resistance to doing this this way.</v>

113
00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you know</v>

114

118
00:04:30.351 --> 00:04:31.184
<v Speaker 1>Never been done?</v>

119
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.841
<v Speaker 1>Look at Howard Stern.</v>

00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Howard stern used to be the uncensored king of all media.</v>

121
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.153

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.300
<v Speaker 2>You actually go out there and you put people on your fucking podcast as fucking</v>

158
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:47.390
<v Speaker 2>important is fucking important.</v>

159
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

160
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I know we've talked about this.</v>

161
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what you say.</v>

162
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking important when you're doing,</v>

163
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.830
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

164
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.880
<v Speaker 2>do you have a huge audience,</v>

165
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking,</v>

166
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 2>and what we're talking about a lot of it's weird,</v>

167
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it is we're talking about shit to no one knows I'm talking about,</v>

168
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.040
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

169
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

170
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

171
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.793
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

172
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.450
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

173
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

174
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.451
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

175
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.284
<v Speaker 2>I did fine,</v>

176
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

177
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>it looked as a lot of people that did it before me.</v>

178
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 2>All I did was pick up the ball and let everybody know that.</v>

179
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you can,</v>

180
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.320
<v Speaker 2>if you can justify your position or your reasoning for looking at things,</v>

181
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:28.631
<v Speaker 2>if you can talk to a group of strangers and manic and be honest about where</v>

182
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 2>you're coming from,</v>

183
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.070
<v Speaker 2>that it's important to do well.</v>

184
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important just to have a point of view that,</v>

185
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:36.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

186
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:36.601
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

187
00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:41.601
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense with the information you've been allowed to have access to.</v>

188
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 2>But if you've been allowed to have access to a lot of shit and you kind of made</v>

189
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.480
<v Speaker 2>mistakes or they fucked up and you see people making the same mistakes,</v>

190
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.160
<v Speaker 2>it's really important to step up and look,</v>

191
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.143
<v Speaker 2>where are you?</v>

192
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

193
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry to,</v>

194
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.760
<v Speaker 2>we're just fucking trying to just say we're fucking regular again.</v>

195
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to have a bunch of,</v>

196
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

197
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking dude.</v>

198
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 2>You made your shit.</v>

199
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You fucking hit your fucking thing.</v>

200
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 2>But still you're,</v>

201
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.620
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

202
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you're doing these podcasts and by the way,</v>

203
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.993
<v Speaker 2>every time</v>

204
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 2>the fewer of positivity that comes up,</v>

205
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.893
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say this,</v>

206
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.280
<v Speaker 2>we talked about a lot of fucked up shit and these people are like,</v>

207
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.383
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

208
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.280
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking at least your tone.</v>

209
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 2>The partners who might be wasted,</v>

210
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>we might be fucked up movie talking crazy shit,</v>

211
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 2>but in fact they're saying you don't want your fucking gentleman the truth,</v>

212
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to say this,</v>

213
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.813
<v Speaker 2>that's important.</v>

214
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking important.</v>

215
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

216
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important whenever people express the ideas of a sort of universal</v>

217
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 2>French people who follow,</v>

218
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:49.094
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

219
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 2>are the people we need because what they're doing,</v>

220
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid they curved or fortune.</v>

221
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 2>People are saying,</v>

222
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 2>fuck everything called the bullshit.</v>

223
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a more positive reaction.</v>

224
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Anything I've ever done</v>

225
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.253
<v Speaker 2>this fucking</v>

226
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

227
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 2>But it's bizarre.</v>

228
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre.</v>

229
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.483
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

230
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 2>It is great,</v>

231
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>but is also bizarre.</v>

232
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.210
<v Speaker 2>It's great in the fact that it's a how about how you have the full MMA guys are</v>

233
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:29.110
<v Speaker 2>the freest thinkers we have out there.</v>

234
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 2>You would think that that's unusual,</v>

235
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 2>but me as a guy who's done martial arts or whole life,</v>

236
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

237
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's a,</v>

238
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 2>that's how it's supposed to be,</v>

239
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.400
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's not a mistake and not a coincidence that the very best guys at</v>

240
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:50.050
<v Speaker 2>the top of the heat or also what I would consider martial artists like Anderson</v>

241
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.243
<v Speaker 2>Silva beforehand,</v>

242
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.200

<v Speaker 2>Because I think what we have to do,</v>

292
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 2>what our job is,</v>

293
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Speaker 2>when we do escape surf,</v>

294
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.540
<v Speaker 2>we took core and we did with the PDF</v>

295
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>and indeed we're doing it now with the soccer.</v>

296
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.791
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

297
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:19.510
<v Speaker 2>we take core core MMA fans of the craziest fans,</v>

298
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.800
<v Speaker 2>but we have to take it to crossover,</v>

299
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

300
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 2>To take it to cross over to other people and what you are,</v>

301
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 2>you're the best crossover guy in the fucking world.</v>

302
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're saying I'm an MMA guy but I'm actually smarter than no shit.</v>

303
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 2>And if I could talk about the fucking philosophy,</v>

304
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.121
<v Speaker 2>my advice.</v>

305
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:36.954
<v Speaker 2>Ready?</v>

306
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

307
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Forget it all.</v>

308
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.813
<v Speaker 2>Ignore it.</v>

309
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Do it to like put it on what you're like,</v>

310
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 2>forget all the bullshit.</v>

311
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 2>But whatever it shows,</v>

312
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.500
<v Speaker 2>they either you're interested in any conversation here and I'd love to do is</v>

313
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 2>take it from that of MMA and bring it up to the crossover and say,</v>

314
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 2>this isn't fucking just these guys.</v>

315
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you look at John Jones and you say,</v>

316
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.023
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

317
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a fucking ease,</v>

318
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad Ali,</v>

319
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.630
<v Speaker 2>he's the,</v>

320
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.030
<v Speaker 2>he's the modern day Bahama.</v>

321
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.060
<v Speaker 2>The only difference between him and Muhammad Ali because he doesn't have 50</v>

322
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:14.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking documentaries.</v>

323
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm a boring,</v>

324
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

325
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out what it was,</v>

326
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.070
<v Speaker 2>but the different things on,</v>

327
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.260
<v Speaker 2>so he has massive,</v>

328
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.830
<v Speaker 2>just unbelievable like fountains in mountains and fields of potential,</v>

329
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.673
<v Speaker 2>but he's only,</v>

330
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.750
<v Speaker 2>but when I saw him fighting for,</v>

331
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 25 but when I saw him fight,</v>

332
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.651
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

333
00:12:42.651 --> 00:12:47.240
<v Speaker 2>this guy is so far ahead of everybody else and he's so much better than</v>

334
00:12:47.241 --> 00:12:47.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>

335
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.770
<v Speaker 2>But also his stories guy.</v>

336
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.900
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy.</v>

337
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And the whole thing of like when he won the championship,</v>

338
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.840
<v Speaker 2>the choking out the person.</v>

339
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like two hours.</v>

340
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.713
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

341
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:03.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

342
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.610

344
00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:05.631
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 2>this is what we sold to two UFC is we should have,</v>

347
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.900
<v Speaker 2>we should have had him choking out a fucking purse.</v>

348
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Snatcher in New Jersey before he went to went the fucking check.</v>

<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

355
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:35.130
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about Jon Jones before he fought for the UFC light heavyweight</v>

356
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 2>title,</v>

357
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.720
<v Speaker 2>like the day of the fight,</v>

358
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.840
<v Speaker 2>it was meditating in a park in New Jersey and he saw some guys snatch someone's</v>

359
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:48.010
<v Speaker 2>purse and he was crying like Spiderman,</v>

360
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.530
<v Speaker 2>like literally like Peter Parker.</v>

361
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:51.364
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

362
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 2>He went over and he took down this,</v>

363
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.023
<v Speaker 2>so he crossed it out.</v>

364
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.800
<v Speaker 2>He ran after him.</v>

365
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Choke him out in mid stride.</v>

366
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:01.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

367
00:14:01.491 --> 00:14:02.324
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

368
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 2>The purse bag then to thank you very much and went on to win the fucking shit</v>

369
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.000
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

370
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.833
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>

371
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.853
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>

372
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 2>That's the greatest story in fighting ever.</v>

373
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Reverse Parker,</v>

374
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.370
<v Speaker 2>let the,</v>

375
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.730
<v Speaker 2>the the criminal past five and then he killed his uncle Ben.</v>

376
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's what haunted Peter Parker and make him be so,</v>

377
00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:28.701
<v Speaker 2>and this guy is literally like Muhammad Ali going to go fight for his title.</v>

378
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 2>He choked down to fucking prison in New Jersey.</v>

379
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Choked him out,</v>

381
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.390
<v Speaker 2>gave him to the cops and said two hours later I'm going to go fucking fight for</v>

382
00:14:38.391 --> 00:14:39.470
<v Speaker 2>the championship of the world.</v>

383
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.610
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

384
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

385
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.580
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to say that's a great story.</v>

386
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a great story.</v>

387
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 2>But that was going on free to go to go one more step you with what you do,</v>

388
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.973
<v Speaker 2>fear factor,</v>
