<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:03.704
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

4
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.580
<v Speaker 2>like a top scientist should have died after the uh,</v>

5
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.463
<v Speaker 2>appendicitis.</v>

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 2>He's like one of the rare guys that three Jiu Jitsu classes I tapped out for.</v>

10
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:14.544
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

16
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not a man.</v>

17
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Would love,</v>

18
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to go down there and have it reinforced all you guys get this</v>

19
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 2>pressure side.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is it a calm me down and make you feel better</v>

21
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.761
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

22
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the commerce I've been in my life.</v>

23
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm always going to sound like I'm in a bad mood because I have the east coast</v>

24
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:34.694
<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>

25
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Look dude,</v>

26
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 2>your fucking phony.</v>

27
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Calm down.</v>

28
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.021
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

29
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:39.171
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

30
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:39.611
<v Speaker 2>you're you,</v>

31
00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 2>you smoke weed.</v>

32
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Why calm down from exercise to I.</v>

33
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>We doesn't necessarily calm me down as it does make me just a little more</v>

34
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:48.534
<v Speaker 1>sensitive.</v>

35
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Red Redman you buying this?</v>

36
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd calmed me down.</v>

37
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

38
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.681
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

39
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 2>you are a completely different person.</v>

40
00:00:55.571 --> 00:01:00.571
<v Speaker 2>Like when I met you in like 96 97 you are good guy,</v>

41
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.960
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't want the most intense fucking dude's I never met.</v>

42
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:09.961
<v Speaker 2>It was like this switch somewhere in your life was flipped and the shit was on.</v>

43
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how you slept.</v>

44
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.731
<v Speaker 2>You were like,</v>

45
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 2>you are like,</v>

46
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

47
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking goal line defense,</v>

48
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 2>middle linebacker.</v>

49
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 2>That's shit doesn't mean anything to you.</v>

50
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm using sports analogies like you were fucking intense to and every story I</v>

51
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 2>heard about you at Taekwondo,</v>

52
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

53
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>

54
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I believed all of it after meeting you for literally about 25 seconds.</v>

55
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.991
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>

56
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I was transitioning then still.</v>

57
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>That was still just a few years.</v>

58
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a guy trying to mix the role.</v>

59
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

60
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>it was true.</v>

61
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>He was transgender when I was a,</v>

62
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>when I was a young guy.</v>

63
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.821
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

64
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:45.631
<v Speaker 1>Or when I was younger,</v>

65
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I was going through my entire,</v>

66
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>my entire childhood was spent competing in martial arts tournaments from the</v>

67
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>time I was like 15 to the time I was 22 was my last fight.</v>

68
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 2>So do you think it made you like that or it tapped into something that was</v>

69
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:00.154
<v Speaker 2>already there?</v>

70
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would have been that intense if I didn't have to deal with</v>

71
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous shit on a regular basis.</v>

72
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It was the fact that you were fighting in tournament's on a regular basis and</v>

73
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>nothing ever happened to me.</v>

74
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I never got hurt,</v>

75
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>but I easily could've easily could zig when I should have zagged and got knocked</v>

76
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out.</v>

77
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It just never happened.</v>

78
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I only lost once in a kickboxing match and that was not,</v>

79
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>not that I didn't lose a before and taekwondo,</v>

80
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>but lost once by stoppage.</v>

81
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>The only time I ever got stopped was in a kickboxing match.</v>

82
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>That was the third fight in a day and I was terrible nutrition back then,</v>

83
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>always getting sick,</v>

84
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really take vitamins and shit and that was on the fence back then.</v>

86
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like doing stand up and fighting at the same time,</v>

87
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't like a bad knock out.</v>

88
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I got dropped by a left hook and then I got up and I,</v>

89
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

90
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>my legs just wouldn't work and he hit me again and I fell down again and they</v>

91
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:51.991
<v Speaker 1>stopped the fight.</v>

92
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just a,</v>

93
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>he had hit my jaw like in the perfect spot and everything gave out.</v>

94
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about it like when I was,</v>

95
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>when I was going back that there's one of two things I'm gonna do.</v>

96
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Either I'm going to go fucking crazy now and rededicate myself and try to be a</v>

97
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>world champion kickboxer and just use the fact that I got tired in the third</v>

98
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:15.241
<v Speaker 1>fight of the day as motivation to just run extra miles and do extra plyometrics</v>

99
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and do extra rounds or be a standup.</v>

100
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

101
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.793
<v Speaker 2>no brainer.</v>

102
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

103
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

104
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

105
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.050
<v Speaker 2>there's no reward.</v>

106
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>There was no ultimate fighting championship back then.</v>

107
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

108
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>so it's like I had to reprogram my brain.</v>

109
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I ended up pro my,</v>

110
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>my brain was used to always thinking about martial arts competition.</v>

111
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.461
<v Speaker 1>That's all it was.</v>

112
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It was dodging kicks,</v>

113
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>landing your own,</v>

114
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:42.401
<v Speaker 1>getting in,</v>

116
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>closing the distance.</v>

117
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

118
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.081
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

119
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>and forcing your game plan.</v>

120
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what my whole day was spent fighting in my head.</v>

121
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Even if I wasn't finding it would be fighting in my head what I was when I was</v>

122
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

123
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>like I had girlfriends,</v>

124
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:52.901
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

125
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.810
<v Speaker 1>they'd sleep over and uh,</v>

126
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

127
00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I would throw kicks in the middle of the night like don't like my,</v>

128
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>my whole body would jolt like a kick cause I was having a fighting dream.</v>

129
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>So I was terrified.</v>

130
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I was constantly terrified.</v>

131
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I got really good at it because I was absolutely horrified of it.</v>

132
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.381
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to,</v>

133
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Speaker 1>I just did not want to get my ass kicked and I was already doing it.</v>

134
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

135
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>well this is what we're doing then we've got to get really fucking good at this</v>

136
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>because this is not something you can half ass dudes are kicking dudes in the</v>

137
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>face and knocking people unconscious.</v>

138
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Like this is fucking terrifying.</v>

139
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I saw it happens so many times.</v>

140
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Saw happened to good friends.</v>

141
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I saw it happen to people who are better than me.</v>

142
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>They just fought the wrong dude at the wrong time,</v>

143
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>which easily could have happened to me.</v>

144
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:36.694
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>

145
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>but it easily could have like a,</v>

146
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>our instructor never protected us at all.</v>

147
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.071
<v Speaker 1>He put us even,</v>

148
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:42.581
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

149
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.560
<v Speaker 1>kids were teenagers.</v>

150
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.260
<v Speaker 1>He would put us in the men's division and you know,</v>

151
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.051
<v Speaker 1>and tell you like,</v>

153
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>red belt.</v>

154
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>He was just,</v>

155
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to see who is crazy.</v>

156
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.223
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to see,</v>

157
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to develop a team of people who didn't give a fuck.</v>

158
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.600
<v Speaker 2>That's so funny that you,</v>

159
00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 2>you could do that with kids.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ditch.</v>

166
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>The martial arts schools are very cultish.</v>

167
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.141

00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>You always call him sir.</v>

176
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.581
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

177
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

178
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

179
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

180
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I never been able to exist in that dynamic no matter what it was like,</v>

181
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I could,</v>

182
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.204
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

183
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I needed it.</v>

184
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I grew up without a dad.</v>

185
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I grew up without a,</v>

186
00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I have a Stepdad,</v>

187
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.210
<v Speaker 1>but my real dad,</v>

188
00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I knew he was alive and I didn't communicate with them,</v>

189
00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:35.780
<v Speaker 1>so it always fucked with me.</v>

190
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.410
<v Speaker 1>So I needed some sort of intense discipline to get my shit together.</v>

191
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.620
<v Speaker 1>So first time I ever felt like I had any control of my life at all was when I</v>

192
00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:43.580
<v Speaker 1>started doing martial arts.</v>

193
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

194
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

195
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.081
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

196
00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I can fucking get good at something.</v>

197
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

198
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at this shit.</v>

199
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.583
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

200
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.811
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

201
00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>so that's why I was so wound up met.</v>

202
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.940
<v Speaker 1>It took me a while to relax.</v>

203
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.103
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

204
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>it's so amazing how we've been able to cut that out of our lives.</v>

205
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>That whole food gathering nonsense.</v>

206
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Like while I was watching this mountain men show and watched this poor guy with</v>

207
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>shitty rodeo knees.</v>

208
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>He's going out looking for deer,</v>

209
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>like trying to get a deer,</v>

210
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>some meat for the freezer while he's looking for bears constantly.</v>

211
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

212
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.560
<v Speaker 2>what an amazing change of life it's happened when they figured out how to cut</v>

213
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.700
<v Speaker 2>out that whole gathering food that was already bad enough.</v>

214
00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Bad knees looking for a deer.</v>

215
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.961
<v Speaker 2>And then he does the,</v>

216
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:24.141
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

217
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:26.710
<v Speaker 2>the over the top wild looking for bears.</v>

218
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

219
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:27.701
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

220
00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:28.650
<v Speaker 2>You got to watch the show.</v>

221
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a great show.</v>

222
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.471
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

223
00:06:29.471 --> 00:06:31.660
<v Speaker 2>that's why I just watched it last night for the first time.</v>

224
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm comfortable being in the Matrix.</v>

225
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.180
