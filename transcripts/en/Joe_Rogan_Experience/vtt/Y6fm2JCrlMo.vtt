00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.220
<v Speaker 1>What is the state of Japanese on my main now?</v>

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.610
<v Speaker 1>It was gigantic for awhile when Soccer Rabo was big.</v>

4
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>When you were huge.</v>

5
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>When pride was filling 90,000 seat arenas.</v>

6
00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:13.094
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

7
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>It was like nothing else.</v>

8
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like I experienced 60,000 at Rogers in Canada when George Saint Pierre</v>

9
00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:20.534
<v Speaker 1>fought Jake shields.</v>

10
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine 30 more thousand people there.</v>

11
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>But you were there for that.</v>

12
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean if that was a 10 and before,</v>

14
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean may actually came out when they were only had pancreas and that was a</v>

15
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:33.700
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 2>it sounded like a foreigner right now what happened is Yuck was the involvement.</v>

17
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing that people don't realize is in Japan,</v>

19
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 2>everything is Jaquelle's involvement.</v>

20
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Every big company,</v>

21
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 2>every big promotion shoot,</v>

22
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:48.310
<v Speaker 2>they'll chose to say that didn't ever get a cause Yahoo's involvement.</v>

23
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:49.144
<v Speaker 2>But they're there.</v>

24
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 2>They're backed by [inaudible],</v>

25
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 2>which is the second largest group of Japan,</v>

26
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:56.140
<v Speaker 2>so everyone has yakuza connections to any big Coca Cola company.</v>

28
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Johnson and Johnson.</v>

29
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Any company has yell cause the connections.</v>

30
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

31
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>But it's not public.</v>

32
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>So save cocacola goes over there and they open up a plant in Japan.</v>

33
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>They must go through the Yakuza.</v>

34
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.740
<v Speaker 1>They'll have that connections.</v>

35
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:10.071
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

36
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

37
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>How do they negotiate that?</v>

38
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

39
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

40
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.941
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

41
00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:13.691
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy.</v>

42
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:13.871
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

43
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:14.101
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

44
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:14.471
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

45
00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

46
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a turf thing.</v>

47
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:16.211
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

48
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 2>if you know somebody,</v>

49
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:17.681
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

50
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:18.514
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

51
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a percentage you pay.</v>

52
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

53
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

54
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty given thing.</v>

55
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like,</v>

56
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.523
<v Speaker 2>like taxes.</v>

57
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

58
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Pink Tabs just accepted.</v>

60
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Accepted,</v>

61
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.271
<v Speaker 2>accepted.</v>

62
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:29.104
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's,</v>

63
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how when it became public,</v>

64
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>

65
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 2>it got really bad because it's a,</v>

66
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing is accepted,</v>

67
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's frowned upon.</v>

68
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 2>It's something that they know they need to be a part of in society,</v>

69
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.490
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to make it public because the Yakuza has,</v>

70
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 2>does have a bad name.</v>

71
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>That was the only place where I've ever been with a,</v>

72
00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>asked me to cover up my tattoos.</v>

73
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.811
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

76
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:53.471
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't have,</v>

77
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I try to keep them all from my sleep,</v>

78
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>so it comes up from here.</v>

79
00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>But after that I stopped because I don't want to</v>

80
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 2>walk around and you know,</v>

81
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 2>be kicked out of places,</v>

82
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:01.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 2>I just got denied to go in a hotel like last week when I was in Japan.</v>

84
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

85
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Because of my tattoos with the neck.</v>

87
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

88
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

89
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>they saw it.</v>

90
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>They sell it for wear a Hoodie.</v>

91
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:11.924
<v Speaker 1>It covers it up.</v>

92
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.180
<v Speaker 1>It helps me.</v>

93
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:15.021
<v Speaker 1>I got a,</v>

95
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked out of a gym.</v>

96
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>They made me go put a long sleeve shirt on.</v>

97
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>The Gym's even big gyms at Gold's gym won that year.</v>

98
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.281
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

99
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>What does it represent to Japanese?</v>

101
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 2>It represents the underworld gangsters and you know the,</v>

102
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 2>you got to figure when you have a gang,</v>

103
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 2>a gang,</v>

104
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 2>there's two or three top men.</v>

105
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Those men are awesome people.</v>

106
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And then you got the rest of the hundreds and thousands that are punks and</v>

107
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 2>that's the ones that you see.</v>

108
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 2>So basically a,</v>

109
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 2>a gangster,</v>

110
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 2>someone with tattoos,</v>

111
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 2>which equals the Alcazar would mean trouble and they would,</v>

112
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 2>if you go into a sports gym and you're working out next to a guy and you know</v>

113
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.371
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

114
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:52.981
<v Speaker 2>you're working on,</v>

115
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 2>say you take his awaits by accident because see in the middle of a set and if</v>

116
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it to someone that's a normal person,</v>

117
00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:58.531
<v Speaker 2>he'll just say,</v>

118
00:02:58.531 --> 00:02:58.651
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

119
00:02:58.651 --> 00:02:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I was using ways old.</v>

120
00:02:59.611 --> 00:02:59.861
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

121
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

122
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 2>well it might be different for the Yakuza and people would rather not work out</v>

123
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.970
<v Speaker 2>in the area if there's a cause.</v>

124
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>The guy working on there,</v>

125
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 2>so it's a bad rap.</v>

126
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just justifiable though.</v>

127
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I can understand that.</v>

128
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.881
<v Speaker 1>The UFC,</v>

129
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>when they went in and bought pride,</v>

130
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a crazy story,</v>

131
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>but they paid $65 million.</v>

132
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>They bought pride and they thought,</v>

133
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:19.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.171
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

135
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run pride as well as the UFC.</v>

136
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>The same way they did with Strikeforce when they bought strike force,</v>

137
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>they kept strike for us going for a years.</v>

138
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>They thought they were going to do that.</v>

139
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile it turned out all the contracts are illegal.</v>

140
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>They really didn't have anybody on the contract.</v>

141
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>They spent $65 million and all they really got was a video library.</v>

142
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And then while they had offices in Japan and they were hiring these people and</v>

143
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>painful him,</v>

144
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>they were starting up dream.</v>

145
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>They were starting up their own organization,</v>

146
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>organizing everything and yeah.</v>

147
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:51.094
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

148
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>

150
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>it took years before they could come back and do a UFC there.</v>

151
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>They took,</v>

152
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>it took a long time.</v>

153
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Dana was getting like some like underworld threats and you know,</v>

154
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

155
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.411
<v Speaker 2>that's what I heard.</v>

156
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:04.521
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

157

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.710
<v Speaker 2>I sent Dana email in that because if anything,</v>

159
00:04:06.711 --> 00:04:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of pulling that site and I told him that if you have any problems</v>

160
00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:10.821
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can help you.</v>

162
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.310
<v Speaker 2>What would he have to do,</v>

163
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 2>come to you and then you go to the,</v>

164
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I really respected in their world.</v>

165
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.241
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

166
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:17.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

167
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.381
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

168
00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:18.681
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

169
00:04:18.681 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 2>if I don't know the person directly,</v>

170
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I have guys at norm.</v>

171
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.690
<v Speaker 2>So if he had any type of problem,</v>

172
00:04:23.691 --> 00:04:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>

173
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.130
<v Speaker 2>it still sounds still today,</v>

174
00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:27.470
<v Speaker 2>if Dana has any type of underwrote problems there,</v>

175
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.670
<v Speaker 2>if he calls me arc,</v>

176
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.513
<v Speaker 2>take care of it for him.</v>

177
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.290
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that there's such an underworld presence in Japan because it</v>

178
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:34.970
<v Speaker 1>seems so safe when you're there.</v>

179
00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:35.804
<v Speaker 1>Everything is so,</v>

180
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.670
<v Speaker 1>people are so polite and you don't see violence you don't see like you see drunk</v>

181
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>people walking into the street and no one hurts them day.</v>

182
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.933
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's fine.</v>

183
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Girls Walk down the dark lanes and it's okay.</v>

184
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:46.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:46.971
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

186
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

187
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange sort of,</v>

188
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:50.744
<v Speaker 1>a contrast.</v>

190
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

191
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:51.541
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

192
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:51.881
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

193
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you just have bad areas.</v>

194
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Like can change your cool.</v>

195
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.440
<v Speaker 2>They have over 300 was offices there.</v>

196
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Roppongi only has three.</v>

197
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

198
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:01.771
<v Speaker 2>So you've got,</v>

200
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:04.380
<v Speaker 2>these are districts that they're accumulated in,</v>

201
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 2>they have offices,</v>

202
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 2>they have offices.</v>

203
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.460
<v Speaker 2>The mafia doesn't have office.</v>

205
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:09.534
<v Speaker 2>See that's the thing.</v>

207
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Like for me,</v>

208
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I guess I grew up in America,</v>

209
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>so for me the mafia just scares me way more.</v>

210
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

211
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I have this image that you screw with the Mafia.</v>

212
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 2>You better change your name,</v>

213
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you were to move and you better hide who your family is and you've got to get</v>

214
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 2>the hell out of just disappear.</v>

215
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 2>But when you get in trouble at the Yakuza,</v>

216
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.491
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

217
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I've been in trouble with them before and it's,</v>

218
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

219
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.910
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can kind of pretty much deal with them the way you want to deal</v>

220
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:33.180
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

221
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

222
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.660
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how much you're willing to sacrifice.</v>

223
00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:37.494
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

224
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 2>And for me it was your issue with them.</v>

225
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 2>There was a one to it with kid.</v>

226
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

227
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

228
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.853
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

229
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.481
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

230
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>this Jaquez guy wanting to,</v>

231
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 2>to open up a gym and I agreed to open up a gym with him called purebred Tokyo</v>

232
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.043
<v Speaker 2>killer bee.</v>

233
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.550
<v Speaker 2>And I just told them that the only thing you have to do is you have to hire two</v>

234
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 2>of my fighters so they can make a living through fighting.</v>

235
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.250
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to help them on,</v>

236
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.093
<v Speaker 2>I want to no money,</v>

237
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 2>you can use my name or my gym,</v>

238
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 2>but you have to hire my two fighters.</v>

239
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.131
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

240
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>they acquired kid and they're hard.</v>

241
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Ryan Bull.</v>

242
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>And those are the fighters in everything was good.</v>

243
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was kid started,</v>

244
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

245
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I guess from the influence of his father,</v>

246
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:14.384
<v Speaker 2>he started being,</v>

247
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 2>the loyalty issue in him was getting,</v>

248
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 2>was wavering where he wasn't telling me stuff,</v>

249
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 2>he was hiding stuff.</v>

250
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.781
<v Speaker 2>He's lying to me.</v>

251
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 2>And then I put that [inaudible] was the guy in charge of them that ran the gym.</v>

252
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:25.521
<v Speaker 2>So I told him,</v>

253
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I called him and say,</v>

254
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 2>what's going on man?</v>

255
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.311
<v Speaker 2>You got to take care of it.</v>

256
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:28.501
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

257
00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:29.151
<v Speaker 2>I'll take care of it.</v>

258
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:29.601
<v Speaker 2>I'll take care of.</v>

259
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 2>He's told me that and it got to a point he didn't take care of it.</v>

260
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 2>So I called him and I was pissed dirty by now.</v>

261
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 2>And I called him and said,</v>

262
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

263
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Call me.</v>

264
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>He avoided my calls for three days.</v>

265
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.911
<v Speaker 2>So three,</v>

266
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

267
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.223
<v Speaker 2>three weeks.</v>

268
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.281
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sitting there,</v>

269
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 2>this guy's running from me.</v>

270
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking this is ridiculous.</v>

271
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.031
<v Speaker 2>So then they'll say,</v>

272
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 2>this guy is running from me.</v>

273
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to look for him.</v>

274
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

275
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 2>he's going to pop up these guys that charter to run their pop up all the time.</v>

276
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.911
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

277
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sitting there watching the [inaudible] kid flight and kid wins a fight</v>

278
00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 2>and this guy's in the ring jumping and hug him and team has a mother fucker.</v>

279
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:04.080
<v Speaker 2>This guy's hiding from me and he's on national TV hugging me saying Hansen,</v>

280
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.933
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

281
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 2>So I guess is it?</v>

282
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 2>So I called my students,</v>

283
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I took the final where the after party is what after part and I was leery going</v>

284
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 2>to walk in there and grab that guy with the hair and pulled the model of party.</v>

285
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 2>But my students felt it was going to be a problem,</v>

286
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 2>is going to make too much commotion.</v>

287
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 2>The cops are going to be called.</v>

288
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 2>So Daddy said to get them in.</v>

289
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 2>They brought him up and brought him to the park and pretty much beat him for</v>

290
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:26.151
<v Speaker 2>like 20 minutes,</v>

291
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 2>which is something he shouldn't do in Japan because in the acquisition world</v>

292
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 2>they work by face,</v>

293
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 2>they work by being tough,</v>

294
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 2>being scary to collect money and stuff.</v>

295
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And if he's got all,</v>

296
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 2>they got a black tie and bruises on their faces,</v>

297
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.310
<v Speaker 2>kind of goes against the fact that they're tough people.</v>

298
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:40.600
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

299
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 2>So I beat him up pretty bad.</v>

300
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

301
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.903
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

302
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.511
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

303
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:44.811
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

304
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 2>the thing is I never did pick on anyone.</v>

305
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I never did do anything without a reason.</v>

306
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

307
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.330
<v Speaker 2>I believed that I would die for my beliefs tomorrow and I believe that I was</v>

308
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 2>right and this guy really deserve that shit.</v>

309
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 2>So if they didn't like it,</v>

310
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 2>if the top guys didn't like it,</v>

311
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.344
<v Speaker 2>then they can,</v>

312
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 2>they know where to find me.</v>

313
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 2>And so what happened was it was going off for 20 minutes.</v>

314
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And when I went down,</v>

315
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.981
<v Speaker 2>I let people in,</v>

316
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 2>some people in my friends know and they were all worried.</v>

317
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 2>So they made calls and we had two other Yakuza guys come down to the scene to,</v>

318
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 2>to try and stop me,</v>

319
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 2>to kind of getting me tween not stop me physically,</v>

320
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.180
<v Speaker 2>but to,</v>

321
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.540
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

322
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 2>to ask for forgiveness for this guy.</v>

323
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 2>And they're kind of like bawling in the middle of me and the guy and I'm getting</v>

324
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.614
<v Speaker 2>around and just,</v>

325
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>just giving them wax at a time.</v>

326
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 2>And when he,</v>

327
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 2>if he would've fallen from a hit,</v>

328
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I had ground and standing right back it up.</v>

329
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

330
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of getting really,</v>

331
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.010
<v Speaker 2>he was all bloody and then,</v>

332
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.193
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

333
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 2>these guys are kind of my friends too,</v>

334
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 2>so they weren't going to get involved,</v>

335
00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 2>but they're trying to stop me from going too far.</v>

336
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 2>And when we,</v>

337
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 2>there's this old lady,</v>

338
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>you know how you have the old ladies in the neighborhood that don't give a fuck</v>

339
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:46.814
<v Speaker 2>who you are.</v>

340
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.121
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

341
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 2>this lady comes on and says screaming at us,</v>

342
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:52.200
<v Speaker 2>he didn't make it the less noise and shit cause that gets on the lady and I say,</v>

343
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:52.381
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

344
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

345
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.091
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man,</v>

346
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:53.751
<v Speaker 2>don't do that man.</v>

347
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:54.584
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

348
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So he moved over to the next part and as you're moving on with the next bar,</v>

349
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 2>lake three fricking monkeys disguise higher ups to find out what's happening and</v>

350
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>come out and they're walking up like these,</v>

351
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:03.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 2>like the movies they are walking through that I,</v>

353
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 2>it was funny because I call them monkeys because they're walking through bushes.</v>

354
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I saw him walking through the trees and they came on and like,</v>

355
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>these are like the hot head guys.</v>

358
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.460
<v Speaker 2>And they came up to me and they're screaming in Japanese to me,</v>

359
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

361
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 2>And then some of my guys came and held him back and I say,</v>

362
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:24.781
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

363

364
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.881

365
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:27.714
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have to know.</v>

366
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.221
<v Speaker 2>So I told my guys,</v>

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.900
<v Speaker 2>the legal side,</v>

437
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.733
<v Speaker 2>the illegal side,</v>

438
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 2>the legitimate site and you are never ever,</v>

439
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:50.720
<v Speaker 2>if you're on the ligament side,</v>

440
00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 2>they have a legitimate problem.</v>

441
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You are never ever allowed to go to the other side to get home.</v>

442
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:56.810
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

443
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

444
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to stay,</v>

445
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get other guys to help you on this site and retaliate,</v>

446
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:01.674
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

447
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 2>But if you ever go to authorities and you lose face and you can never can ever</v>

448
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 2>work in that world again.</v>

449
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.103
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

450
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:08.781
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

451
00:11:08.781 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>So you have to deal with things on your own,</v>

452
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the problem like that.</v>

453
00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

454
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.060
<v Speaker 2>You pretty much,</v>

455
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.991
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

456
00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 2>if you're someone from the outside and you're like a regular businessmen and</v>

457
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:20.330
<v Speaker 2>these guys come and bother you,</v>

458
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 2>the best thing to do is go to the authorities because of the,</v>

459
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.000
<v Speaker 2>the police are just waiting to grab the yellow buses.</v>

460
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.380
<v Speaker 2>So He's psycho role.</v>

461
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:28.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like Kryptonite to the [inaudible].</v>

462
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Speaker 2>If you go say you're going to the police still back off.</v>

463
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.830
<v Speaker 2>But if I,</v>

464
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.660
<v Speaker 2>I live my life in that side pretty much,</v>

465
00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:36.494
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

466
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.780
<v Speaker 2>A lot of my friends are part of those groups and a lot of my beliefs run really</v>

467
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 2>deep with their beliefs.</v>

468
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

469
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

470
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.861
<v Speaker 2>see the thing is,</v>

471
00:11:45.861 --> 00:11:46.171
<v Speaker 2>is you,</v>

472
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.260
<v Speaker 2>you and you hear about the youngest,</v>

473
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.420
<v Speaker 2>they get a bad rap because you talk about child pornography,</v>

474
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:51.254
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

475
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:51.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.760
<v Speaker 2>extortion.</v>

477
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.153
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

478
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:54.851
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

479
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:54.971
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

480
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:55.331
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

481
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 2>when they steal money from people,</v>

482
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:57.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

483
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:00.440
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that they don't see that,</v>

484
00:12:00.441 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 2>so that's all the things in the media,</v>

485
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 2>but the things that they don't see,</v>

486
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:03.671
<v Speaker 2>which I feel is,</v>

487
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

488
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 2>is really unfortunate is the honor and the loyalty they have for each other.</v>

489
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's where me and them click really well.</v>

490
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:11.224
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

491
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.020
<v Speaker 2>They will die for anyone in your group tomorrow.</v>

492
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 2>They'll go to jail for 10 years for their boss tomorrow if they have to.</v>

493
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.533
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

494
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you don't see that type of loyalty around all these,</v>

495
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 2>non American and I love,</v>

497
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:23.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I think that loyalty,</v>

499
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:25.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

500
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:26.434
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

501
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.281
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

502
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why they respect me so much is you,</v>

503
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I will die for my values.</v>

504
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll die for my people that are close to me.</v>

505
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:33.723
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a</v>

506
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.520
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably fascinating culture.</v>

507
00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:36.750
<v Speaker 1>How different Japan is.</v>

508
00:12:36.751 --> 00:12:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And so many ways,</v>

509
00:12:37.861 --> 00:12:38.291
<v Speaker 1>like a big,</v>

510
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:39.270
<v Speaker 1>there's big gaps in it.</v>

511
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

512
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.003
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

513
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.851
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

514
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:42.151
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

515
00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:43.500
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating stuff.</v>

516
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just that all these different cultures evolve independently,</v>

517
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.200
<v Speaker 1>that the Japanese culture evolved independently from the American culture.</v>

518
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:55.050
<v Speaker 1>We independently from the European culture and it's so different.</v>

519
00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:55.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

520
00:12:55.401 --> 00:12:57.260
<v Speaker 2>it is all he think all the places are different men.</v>

521
00:12:57.261 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to really move into,</v>

522
00:12:59.160 --> 00:12:59.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

523
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.520
<v Speaker 2>a different country and,</v>

524
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.780
<v Speaker 2>and run yourself in the way that you learned in another country because it's,</v>

525
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:06.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

527
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:07.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

528
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 1>when in Rome he was,</v>

529
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:08.711
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

530
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about the state of a Japanese MMA right now?</v>

531
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Because it's kind of in a transitionary period.</v>

532
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 1>If one at one point in time it was gigantic and you say Yakuza involvement as</v>

533
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 1>why people,</v>

534
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>corporate sponsors backed out and then they lost a lot of viewership.</v>

535
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

536
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 1>it was just not that long ago that there were selling out these gigantic places.</v>

537
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Not what,</v>

538
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.450
<v Speaker 1>what's going on right now?</v>

539
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

540
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 2>right now I'm,</v>

541
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.331
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

542
00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:34.620
<v Speaker 2>it's up the number four right now.</v>

543
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.030
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are real hesitant.</v>

544
00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>They're not among many sponsors that want to put money into it.</v>

545
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

546
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.130
<v Speaker 2>on the flip side,</v>

547
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.300
<v Speaker 2>the big things that's happening is gangster events where they allow gangsters to</v>

548
00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:46.080
<v Speaker 2>fight in the ring.</v>

549
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.831
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

550
00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:48.030
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy though.</v>

551
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:48.864
<v Speaker 2>This thick,</v>

552
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I attend all of those.</v>

553
00:13:49.951 --> 00:13:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a guest and most of them they pay me to just to be there and to judge</v>

554
00:13:53.341 --> 00:13:55.230
<v Speaker 2>sometimes to make a speech in their ring.</v>

555
00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:55.951
<v Speaker 2>Maybe in the beginning,</v>

556
00:13:55.951 --> 00:13:58.110
<v Speaker 2>because I'm still respected in that world,</v>

557
00:13:58.111 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 2>that to have me there a lot of these gangsters him down,</v>

558
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:01.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:02.310
<v Speaker 2>when they want to riot,</v>

560
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:02.971
<v Speaker 2>they don't riot,</v>

561
00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

562
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

563
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.860
<v Speaker 2>you go to the event and it's not unusual to see a picture of two stick figures</v>

564
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:09.570
<v Speaker 2>fighting and has a big x on it.</v>

565
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So don't fight,</v>

566
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.933
<v Speaker 2>don't fight.</v>

567
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

568
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.920
<v Speaker 2>isn't that a given?</v>

569
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.790
<v Speaker 2>You never see any signs up in the UFC saying please don't fight in the audience.</v>

570
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:18.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

571
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.290
<v Speaker 2>it's already given this,</v>

572
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.400
<v Speaker 2>not something you should do.</v>

573
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.351
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

574
00:14:21.351 --> 00:14:23.280
<v Speaker 2>so that's a big thing right now.</v>

575
00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:26.930
<v Speaker 2>But it's good because the gangster events actually they,</v>

576
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.050
<v Speaker 2>they have headbutts,</v>

577
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.230
<v Speaker 2>they have elbow striking that you can split system.</v>

578
00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:32.720
<v Speaker 2>You can neither groin,</v>

579
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.541
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever.</v>

580
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much they have two on one.</v>

581
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.520
<v Speaker 2>They have to and to really,</v>

582
00:14:37.521 --> 00:14:38.720
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy dude.</v>

583
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.010
<v Speaker 2>How often do they have these findings held on the bowl?</v>

584
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Once a month man,</v>

585
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.691
<v Speaker 2>there's one somewhere.</v>

586
00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

587
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:43.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

588
00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:44.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's like these guys,</v>

589
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.160
<v Speaker 2>it's become,</v>

590
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a good trend because it's become where these guys just came off the street</v>

591
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:49.651
<v Speaker 2>singing.</v>

592
00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 2>They're tough gassing on one minute from these guys actually spending time in</v>

593
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 2>the gym though and being off the street.</v>

594
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I should a good movement.</v>

595
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

596
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

597
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 2>there's about three or four gang shirts already now this actually made their pro</v>

598
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 2>debut and deep.</v>

599
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 2>So these guys are actually going to run the gangs and,</v>

600
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:07.980
<v Speaker 2>and start selling drugs and you know,</v>

601
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.470
<v Speaker 2>doing illegal activity.</v>

602
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 2>They're not training and it's having a future and fighting,</v>

603
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:12.524
<v Speaker 2>which is awesome.</v>

604
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 2>As far as the legitimate side of MMA,</v>

605
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

606
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I see it,</v>

607
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I can see it picking up again and it's all due to the UFC.</v>

608
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 2>The UFC has done a couple of events there now.</v>

609
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.680
<v Speaker 2>And the last one they did when I went to that,</v>

610
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:24.951
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

611
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 2>it's huge man.</v>

612
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.481
<v Speaker 2>It's so big.</v>

613
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:27.314
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

614
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.750
<v Speaker 2>as much as the Japanese fans are kind of losing hope in Japanese,</v>

615
00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe cause a lot of productions were folding.</v>

616
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.143
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

617
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:35.721
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

618
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

619
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 2>when we went to,</v>

620
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 2>when I went to the UFC,</v>

621
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

622
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I felt debt that energy again when I was fighting in pride,</v>

623
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 2>that energy that they had in the audience.</v>

624
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And especially when ramp piece chemo with the pride music,</v>

625
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.160
<v Speaker 2>it gave me goosebumps because when he came out to that,</v>

626
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I looked around the arena and I was like,</v>

627
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:51.441
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

628
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:52.420
<v Speaker 2>this is a psycho pride.</v>

629
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.280
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

630
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.113
<v Speaker 2>this is a pride.</v>

631
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

632
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.540
<v Speaker 2>it's the first time since that big incident with the [inaudible] and pride that</v>

633
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I've actually seen that again.</v>

634
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.603
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

635
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it's so surreal to me actually.</v>

636
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.361
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

637
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:05.610
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

638
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna,</v>

639
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.943
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna be the,</v>

640
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 2>the ticket back is the UFC coming to Japan.</v>

641
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 2>If the UFC did an ultimate fighter in Japan and,</v>

642
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.281
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

643
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:14.690
<v Speaker 2>have a Japanese version of it,</v>

644
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 2>would you be interested in coaching?</v>

645
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.400

651
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 2>you would really be perfect for something like that.</v>

652
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I would love that.</v>

653
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.203
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

654
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.540
