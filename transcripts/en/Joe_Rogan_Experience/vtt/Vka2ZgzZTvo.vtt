00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shock,</v>

5
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.190
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very,</v>

6
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much for being here.</v>

7
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I've been following your work for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time now and uh,</v>

8
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very appreciative of you and very </v>

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.211
<v Speaker 1>appreciative of everything you've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been fascinated by the subject </v>

10
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>of ancient Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

11
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

12
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very siloed.</v>

13
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real pleasure to be here.</v>

14
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a lot about your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a lot about you.</v>

15
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you'd like John Anthony West I</v>

16
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>think was on with you a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

17
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>He was very proud that I guess you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only full skype interview with him.</v>

18
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only one I've ever done is </v>

19
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.631
<v Speaker 1>He used to like to talk about that so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I just had to talk to him and he </v>

21
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>was in upstate New York at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

22
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>he really didn't have any plans to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>down here and I'm just,</v>

23
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I was very fortunate to one day get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in studio though.</v>

24
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>It was really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been wonderful.</v>

25
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his work,</v>

26
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>that DVD series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did magical Egypt was amazing and I </v>

27
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.181
<v Speaker 1>had seen your work before that in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries of the Sphinx thing that was </v>

28
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>narrated by Charlton Heston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heston,</v>

29
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1993,</v>

30
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:19.791
<v Speaker 1>I think in many ways it was the mystery </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Sphinx that really broke </v>

31
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:23.721
<v Speaker 1>everything open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brought everything to the public </v>

32
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had many people tell me,</v>

33
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:28.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to brag or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's actually that this </v>

34
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>really opened up a new field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could put it that way,</v>

35
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>a new way of looking at things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular,</v>

36
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>among the popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>public popular media that people around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world versus the academic scholarly </v>

38
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>journals and the back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that type of thing.</v>

39
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a faculty member.</v>

40
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm at Boston University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an academic,</v>

41
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many of the academics have poo pooed</v>

42
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>should we say over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing things to the public.</v>

43
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's been important to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>now what we're talking about,</v>

44
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:07.461
<v Speaker 1>for the people that are uninformed is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that some of the structures in </v>

45
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:12.291
<v Speaker 1>ancient Egypt are far older than </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional wisdom or conventional </v>

46
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>modern day archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern day egyptologist.</v>

47
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>They would like us to believe that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this spawned from a very specific </v>

48
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.101
<v Speaker 1>time period and people like John Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 1>West and yourself and some other folks </v>

49
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:30.021
<v Speaker 1>like Graham Hancock are proposing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that there were </v>

50
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:34.011
<v Speaker 1>many different areas of construction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt and that there are some structures</v>

51
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>that are far far older than we think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

52
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.801
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this what I was alluding to is just </v>

53
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:45.531
<v Speaker 1>really opened up with our work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the Great Sphinx and I think you</v>

54
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:50.781
<v Speaker 1>know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe just to summarize in the </v>

55
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>smallest of nutshells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West,</v>

56
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>before I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was became a followership.</v>

57
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>We say I shouldn't say follower because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds wrong.</v>

58
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like it's a religion</v>

59
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 2>dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he became interested in the work of </v>

60
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 2>the late Schwaller de Lubitsch who died </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed away in 1961,</v>

61
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 2>but he had mentioned in one line that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sphinx had been weathered by rain,</v>

62
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I would say precipitation as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>geologist,</v>

63
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>not wind and sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this if it were true,</v>

64
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660
<v Speaker 2>and it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would put the Sphinx back to a much </v>

65
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.660
<v Speaker 2>earlier period which would tie in with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Schwab Adler's work and John Anthony </v>

66
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 2>West sis subsequent work that there were</v>
<v Speaker 2>indications that dynastic Egypt as we </v>

67
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 2>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to about 3000 BC,</v>

68
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 2>was really a legacy of what I call now </v>
<v Speaker 2>an earlier cycle of civilization or </v>

69
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>something that goes back much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much earlier,</v>

70
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>which at this point I date back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the last ice age.</v>

71
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Ice Age ended 9,700</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>

72
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Just to put it in perspective for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

73
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.960
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did you first get on board with </v>

74
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West come to you or John?</v>

75
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Anthony West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:05.101
<v Speaker 2>So the story goes this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West published serpent in </v>

77
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 2>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His probably most famous book,</v>

78
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.490
<v Speaker 2>First Edition Nineteen 79,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was then looking for someone that </v>

79
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:17.011
<v Speaker 2>could really validate or at least assess</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific point of view,</v>

80
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.610
<v Speaker 2>this theory about this face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he had just barely sort of touched</v>

81
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>the surface based on Schwaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be.</v>

82
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.501
<v Speaker 2>It could be older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this was really a geological </v>

83
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.901
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He mentioned that in 1979 in serpent in </v>

84
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 2>the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West went on to become very</v>

85
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 2>involved with Egypt and he started </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling to Egypt.</v>

86
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:44.461
<v Speaker 2>He led tourists to Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the travelers key to ancient </v>

87
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Egypt in 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also mentions in appendix.</v>

88
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just the older sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

89
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 2>but really looking for someone to at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least assess it scientifically.</v>

90
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 2>He met a fellow at in in Egypt actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

91
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Robert Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is a phd in English literature,</v>

92
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

93
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but he was teaching in Cairo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>American University in Cairo,</v>

94
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

95
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Then he came to Boston University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is late 19 eighties.</v>

96
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I was and still do teach at Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>University full time.</v>

97
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Robert Eddy and myself got to know each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

98
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Robert Eddie mentioned me as a geologist</v>
<v Speaker 2>to John Anthony West and that may be.</v>

99
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>This was someone who seemed fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledgeable,</v>

100
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>fairly open minded about things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

101
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any live on Egypt or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

102
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

103
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.620
<v Speaker 2>my interest in Egypt goes way back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading about ancient Egypt when I</v>

104
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 2>was literally six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

105
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:53.791
<v Speaker 2>eight years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a grandmother who had a wonderful </v>

106
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 2>library at the time and I would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through her library.</v>

107
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>She had books from British Museum on</v>

108
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Ancient Egypt going back to the turn of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the century,</v>

109
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:05.531
<v Speaker 3>so I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was prepared in the sense that I was </v>

110
00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 3>open to such things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't imagine getting involved in</v>

111
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Egypt in any way professionally.</v>

112
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 4>Did you have any thoughts about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dating of the Sphinx and the pyramids or</v>

113
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 4>anything back then before you looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>into?</v>

114
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 3>There were two things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there were two things going on in my </v>

115
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.381
<v Speaker 3>head back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which may be prepped me for this number </v>

116
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:24.960
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew the conventional story.</v>

117
00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:27.840
<v Speaker 3>I knew that the Sphinx goes back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>2,500</v>

118
00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:32.841
<v Speaker 3>BC according to the standard </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptologists in 1989,</v>

119
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.390
<v Speaker 3>which is when I first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was 1989,</v>

120
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:41.391
<v Speaker 3>I first actually met western person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had in my mind that the egyptologists </v>

121
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.580
<v Speaker 3>must be correct because they've studied </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

122
00:06:44.581 --> 00:06:49.581
<v Speaker 3>They must know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was coming from an academic point of </v>

123
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:49.740
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

124
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

125
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm just giving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

126
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 3>saying where I'm coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had gone to Yale University and get my</v>

127
00:06:55.321 --> 00:07:00.321
<v Speaker 3>phd in Geology and geophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very well grounded in the status </v>

128
00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:05.481
<v Speaker 3>quo academic point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought when I first went to Egypt </v>

129
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I would just prove west wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just prove that the egyptologist</v>

130
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.310
<v Speaker 3>knew what they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

131
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 3>and this is an important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was also trained in many ways,</v>

132
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 3>both as a graduate student and going </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to my grandmother who I had great </v>

133
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.521
<v Speaker 3>respect for and was also very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should we say liberal and open minded </v>

134
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:25.860
<v Speaker 3>but critical.</v>

135
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.130
<v Speaker 3>You always have to follow the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it goes.</v>

136
00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:34.131
<v Speaker 3>And that's always been my rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that not everything is always the way </v>

137
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 3>people say it is even if their </v>
<v Speaker 3>authorities and something I already knew</v>

138
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:44.571
<v Speaker 3>when I went to Egypt for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>was that some of the very old </v>

139
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 3>egyptologists in the late 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early 20th century had actually </v>

140
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 3>suggested that just the way it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feel of the Sphinx,</v>

141
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.010
<v Speaker 3>not based on hard evidence really that </v>
<v Speaker 3>may be,</v>

142
00:07:56.011 --> 00:07:57.990
<v Speaker 3>it was older than the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That may be.</v>

143
00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:02.991
<v Speaker 3>It goes back earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I felt that it wasn't all said and </v>

144
00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:08.181
<v Speaker 3>done and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pat and sound that the egyptologist </v>

145
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.751
<v Speaker 3>necessarily knew what they were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in modern times because some of </v>

146
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:14.931
<v Speaker 3>the earlier egyptologist who they held </v>
<v Speaker 3>in very high respect supposedly had set </v>

147
00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:17.160
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>

148
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 3>and I hate to bring this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I will because it's part of the </v>

149
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

150
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandmother,</v>

151
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 3>who I mentioned a second ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

152
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.870
<v Speaker 3>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>theosophy and Thea,</v>

153
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:32.370
<v Speaker 3>if you know anything about theosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also suggests that,</v>

154
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's things that go back </v>

155
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't theosophy theosophy it's,</v>

156
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I explain it?</v>

157
00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:44.520
<v Speaker 3>You have you heard of Blavatsky Madame </v>
<v Speaker 3>Blavatsky?</v>

158
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.180
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

159
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing my headphones.</v>

160
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Theosophy was founded in the late 19th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>

161
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.160
<v Speaker 3>It questioned a lot of the values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the dogma of Science,</v>

162
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 3>of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of religion,</v>

163
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:05.421
<v Speaker 3>of the time it looked to the east in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular to other philosophies,</v>

164
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 3>other world views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically it was a way.</v>

165
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.630
<v Speaker 3>This is what it did for me at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not a theosophist I don't want </v>

166
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 3>to say I'm a theosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

167
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 3>but reading theosophical works on top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else allowed me,</v>

168
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:25.101
<v Speaker 3>I think to expand my horizons and to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe this dogma of the day is just</v>

169
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:32.511
<v Speaker 3>that the dogma of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are other possibilities and </v>

170
00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:36.531
<v Speaker 3>not that we accept something just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone said it or it because </v>

171
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:39.771
<v Speaker 3>it's old or because it's this religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>or that religion or that supposed to be </v>

172
00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:39.771
<v Speaker 3>ancient culture.</v>

173
00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep everything open.</v>

174
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 3>You look at the evidence and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really where I was coming from.</v>

175
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 3>But my point is that even in late 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>

176
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 3>early 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first got involved with this,</v>

177
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 3>if I looked at it critically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence was not that definitive for</v>

178
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:03.351
<v Speaker 3>the age of the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was going in with openminded </v>

179
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But honestly,</v>

180
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 3>when I first went to Egypt with John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony West in 1990,</v>

181
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I thought before I got off the plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this would be simple,</v>

182
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:20.060
<v Speaker 3>open and shut case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would prove him wrong in the sense of </v>

183
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 3>his assertions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That may be the Sphinx was older.</v>

184
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I had no doubt at the time that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues in Egyptology must know what </v>

185
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:33.441
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>change literally within 30,</v>

186
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:38.451
<v Speaker 3>without exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 to 120 seconds of first seen </v>

187
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:38.451
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reasonings.</v>

188
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really did.</v>

189
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 3>What was your first impression?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because my first impression of the spanx</v>

190
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 3>was now that I saw on the ground in </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

191
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 3>there was something wrong with the Egypt</v>
<v Speaker 3>and logical dating.</v>

192
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Because when you look at the Sphinx as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>geologist with a geological I,</v>

193
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.920
<v Speaker 3>this was not weathered by wind and sand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was not desert erosion.</v>

194
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 3>And weathering that I saw on the sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body of the Sphinx,</v>

195
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 3>which is very difficult to tell because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been heavily repaired and reworked,</v>

196
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 3>but particularly on the walls of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>are known as the Sphinx enclosure.</v>

197
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:19.010
<v Speaker 3>The Sphinx enclosure is important </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it preserves a lot of the </v>

198
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.211
<v Speaker 3>details and if you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the audience has not been to Egypt,</v>

199
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 3>they should realize that when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>carved the Sphinx,</v>

200
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 3>it's all solid bedrock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only.</v>

201
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 3>The head initially was above the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>

202
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.550
<v Speaker 3>You carved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they carved down into the rock to free </v>

203
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.030
<v Speaker 3>up the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I call it,</v>

204
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.040
<v Speaker 3>the core body of the Sphinx in that core</v>
<v Speaker 3>body and the walls of the enclosure,</v>

205
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:48.470
<v Speaker 3>more or less the quarry around it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to use that term that showed</v>

206
00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:53.471
<v Speaker 3>these ancient weathering precipitation </v>
<v Speaker 3>erosion or features that are </v>

207
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:59.611
<v Speaker 3>incompatible with the last 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of climatic history on the eastern</v>

208
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 3>edge of the Sahara.</v>

209
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.360
<v Speaker 3>So immediately I knew there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong geologically had to </v>

210
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.741
<v Speaker 3>figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either this was a weird geological </v>

211
00:12:10.741 --> 00:12:14.401
<v Speaker 3>anomaly or something else was going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Sphinx might go back to an </v>

212
00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 3>earlier period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

213
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:22.741
<v Speaker 3>I want to point out that when you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the Sphinx and other geologists have </v>

214
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:28.171
<v Speaker 3>looked at this as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did not just chip away at the rock </v>

215
00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:32.310
<v Speaker 3>to carve the body more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have chipped away at the rock </v>

216
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.581
<v Speaker 3>with pick axes and that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoveled out chips of rock in baskets.</v>

217
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:41.161
<v Speaker 3>That would've been the easy way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they did is they carved out huge </v>

218
00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 3>blocks of stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I say huge,</v>

219
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 3>we're talking multitenant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tens of tons.</v>

220
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 3>Some of them maybe over 50 tons or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>of limestone.</v>

221
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 3>They moved those due east of the Sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 3>and built what is now known as the </v>

222
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.531
<v Speaker 3>Sphinx Temple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is still there in ruinous </v>

223
00:12:58.531 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 3>condition and the valley temple.</v>

224
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.530
<v Speaker 3>So you had these two huge temples and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is interesting and lot of people </v>

225
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 3>don't realize this or they don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

226
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I think those constructions which are </v>
<v Speaker 3>contemporary with the oldest portion of </v>

227
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.411
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are more impressive if you think about </v>

228
00:13:16.411 --> 00:13:19.861
<v Speaker 3>the technology and what went into </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructing them than the age of the </v>

229
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 3>Sphinx itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just the Sphinx.</v>

230
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.640
<v Speaker 3>It's also these limestone temples that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are associated with it and we're built </v>

231
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 3>contemporaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so jamie pulled up to photos here.</v>

232
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:34.270
<v Speaker 3>The first one that he pulled up was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer image that showed the Sphinx </v>

233
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.080
<v Speaker 3>and showed how I'm looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

234
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in this image,</v>

235
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.651
<v Speaker 3>what you can see that's a computer image</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually from mystery of the </v>

236
00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:47.331
<v Speaker 3>Sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a inset that's an </v>

237
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:47.331
<v Speaker 3>aerial photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real thing,</v>

238
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 3>and that shows how when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>carving the body,</v>

239
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.470
<v Speaker 3>they cut out huge blocks and then put </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in position to make what's known as</v>

240
00:13:56.341 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 3>the swings temple due east of the swing.</v>

241
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 3>And the second image is the Sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 3>Temple.</v>

242
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 3>You look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says this,</v>

243
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:07.861
<v Speaker 3>things faces due east,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rising sun and right in front of it </v>

244
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:11.220
<v Speaker 3>is the Sphinx Temple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a humongous temple made out </v>

245
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:16.141
<v Speaker 3>of these huge blocks of stone which were</v>
<v Speaker 3>carved out when they carve the body of </v>

246
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:19.950
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here you see in this image another,</v>

247
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 3>a picture of the Sphinx Temple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these erosion,</v>

248
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 3>if you can see how big they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see how big they are.</v>

249
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:28.960
<v Speaker 3>They're enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

250
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 3>These erosion features on the blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about them for the moment.</v>

251
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back to the Sphinx enclosure </v>

252
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.530
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sphinx enclosure where you see </v>

253
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 3>the rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undulating,</v>

254
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 3>profiled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Roche no features here.</v>

255
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 3>You see it in that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vertical fissures,</v>

256
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:52.501
<v Speaker 3>and I know you're familiar with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally because I've heard you talk </v>

257
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:52.501
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finance they west,</v>

258
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 3>that can only be caused by </v>
<v Speaker 3>precipitation.</v>

259
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 3>The rocks are like a layer cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it takes out the software layers,</v>

260
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:04.150
<v Speaker 3>it receipts the software layer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the harder layer stick out </v>

261
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:09.041
<v Speaker 3>further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the water also finds its way down </v>

262
00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:13.001
<v Speaker 3>crevices and cracks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural features that are slightly </v>

263
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 3>softer and it forms these vertical </v>
<v Speaker 3>fissures.</v>

264
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 3>I want to make the point because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people get confused.</v>

265
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't it be rising Nile floods?</v>

266
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geologically,</v>

267
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:25.890
<v Speaker 3>that will give a very different </v>
<v Speaker 3>signature on the rockets,</v>

268
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.900
<v Speaker 3>not floods coming up from the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually precipitation and rainfall</v>

269
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.240
<v Speaker 3>runoff coming from above and rainfall </v>
<v Speaker 3>for thousands of years.</v>

270
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two aspects here.</v>

271
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 3>It could be thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be much stronger rainfall,</v>

272
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge flash floods,</v>

273
00:15:45.201 --> 00:15:50.201
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the story that I hope we'll </v>

274
00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 3>get to is that initially I'm jumping </v>
<v Speaker 3>around here a little bit,</v>

275
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 3>but initially I was thinking five to </v>
<v Speaker 3>7,000</v>

276
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:03.020
<v Speaker 3>bc that was very conservative based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the geological data,</v>

277
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 3>based on the seismic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we have to get to also.</v>

278
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.490
<v Speaker 3>But now I believe we're talking prior to</v>
<v Speaker 3>9,700</v>

279
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:15.491
<v Speaker 3>BC for the original construction of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sphinx and we can talk about why the </v>

280
00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:19.931
<v Speaker 3>data and at 9,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>bc we have the end of the younger Dryas,</v>

281
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.820
<v Speaker 3>the end of the glacial epic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the last ice age.</v>

282
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I have now put together the story based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on evidence and when I ever I say if I </v>

283
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:35.540
<v Speaker 3>say I believe something or I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>something is always based on evidence.</v>

284
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I've been piecing together that what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had ending the younger dryas ending the </v>

285
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 3>last ice age was a huge eruption from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun.</v>

286
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:48.881
<v Speaker 3>A huge solar outbursts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge climatic changes which put among </v>

287
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:53.831
<v Speaker 3>other things a lot of precipitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allow moisture into the air which came </v>

288
00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:58.691
<v Speaker 3>down as precipitation with huge floods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge centrally,</v>

289
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.080
<v Speaker 3>thunderstorms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

290
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of the initial </v>
<v Speaker 3>errosion that we still see on the walls </v>

291
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 3>of the sinks enclosure go back to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

292
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 3>So you hAd the situation where you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>get thIs incredible weathering and </v>

293
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:19.541
<v Speaker 3>erosion and then it continued for </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years after that and was </v>

294
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:23.381
<v Speaker 3>reinforced until you had the sahara </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in in relatively recent times and</v>

295
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.130
<v Speaker 3>geologically in times desert that sahara</v>
<v Speaker 3>desert.</v>

296
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 3>So before that it was some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rain forest,</v>

297
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a vanity rainforest.</v>

298
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.440
<v Speaker 3>It actually varied over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And before that it was very fertile.</v>

299
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:41.360
<v Speaker 3>Savannah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of plants there.</v>

300
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 3>People have seen it even in popular </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies and whatnot,</v>

301
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:48.350
<v Speaker 3>how the sahara at one point had water </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of animals.</v>

302
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 3>That's before end of the last ice age </v>
<v Speaker 3>before this.</v>

303
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.840
<v Speaker 3>These incredible changes that we have at</v>
<v Speaker 3>9,700</v>

304
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.370
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's where the sphinx,</v>

305
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:04.371
<v Speaker 3>I think the original sphinx goes back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time period and that's what the </v>

306
00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 3>egyptians called zep tepi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a first time for them or what I</v>

307
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 3>call an earlier cycle of civilization.</v>

308
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Speaker 3>The last cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that we're still part of in my </v>

309
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.770
<v Speaker 3>terminology is the last 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

310
00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:22.771
<v Speaker 3>So civilization arising reemerging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say about 3000 to 4,000</v>

311
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:29.931
<v Speaker 3>bc company into really what we have now </v>
<v Speaker 3>is high technology,</v>

312
00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But before that there had been an </v>

313
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.960
<v Speaker 3>earlier cycle civilization that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially snuffed out or brought to </v>

314
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 3>its knees if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the end of the last ice age.</v>

315
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 3>And just to map this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a period from about 9,700</v>

316
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:51.801
<v Speaker 3>bc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm reconstructing now to </v>

317
00:18:51.801 --> 00:18:54.891
<v Speaker 3>about 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 3000 bc where we have civilization </v>

318
00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:58.140
<v Speaker 3>reemerging between that period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thousands of years.</v>

319
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Ninety 700 bc to say 3,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>bc for round numbers,</v>

320
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 3>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

321
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:08.570
<v Speaker 3>We have essentially a dark period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I've been now calling siddha </v>

322
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 3>solar induced dark age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of ironic.</v>

323
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:16.011
<v Speaker 3>the sun will induce a dark age because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of brought civilization back to an </v>

324
00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:18.120
<v Speaker 3>earlier stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you would.</v>

325
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I follow that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

326
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:21.640
<v Speaker 3>how did the son do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

327
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 3>solar outburst essentially coronal mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>ejection,</v>

328
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.960
<v Speaker 3>huge eruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than anything we've ever seen </v>

329
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.690
<v Speaker 3>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these massive thunder showers and we </v>

330
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 3>exactly in modern history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern history is even close to this,</v>

331
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 3>but we do have isotope data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

332
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:45.410
<v Speaker 3>That indicates this has happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past at the end of the last ice age and </v>

333
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.881
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's happened many times over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have a lot of markers that </v>

334
00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 3>indicate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have vitrification of rock.</v>

335
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm in fact a lot of the markers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to be debating the </v>

336
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.461
<v Speaker 3>issue necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of the markers that people </v>

337
00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:06.381
<v Speaker 3>have used for a comment at the younger </v>
<v Speaker 3>dryas or during the younger dryas </v>

338
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.120
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them are at the beginning of the</v>

339
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 3>younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'S what they're claiming,</v>

340
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 3>but loved that a lot of the dating is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

341
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:13.800
<v Speaker 3>very iffy.</v>

342
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found it interesting.</v>

343
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:21.471
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone will use something as a marker </v>

344
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 3>for the younger dry ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that will give a date of 12,000</v>

345
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 3>plus or minus 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

346
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 3>this is just the way geology is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember,</v>

348
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had a guest on one of your shows.</v>

349
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.250
<v Speaker 3>he was when?</v>
<v Speaker 3>randall carlson,</v>

350
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 3>not randall carlson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know randall very well.</v>

351
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on with carlson and shermer and a</v>

352
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he came on by a skype.</v>

353
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.610
<v Speaker 3>You outcome malcolm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not remember it.</v>

354
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.190
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the people that was quote,</v>

355
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.550
<v Speaker 3>comment proponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he started pointed out a lot of the </v>

356
00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 3>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a micro spirituals,</v>

357
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.160
<v Speaker 3>glassy spheres on nano diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he mentioned biomed,</v>

358
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 3>say shocked quartz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

359
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.720
<v Speaker 3>And everyone has been assuming this has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be from a physical impact in the </v>

360
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:16.900
<v Speaker 3>sense of something coming down like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comet or asteroid,</v>

361
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>

362
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is you don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>find craters.</v>

363
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't necessarily find the pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comment.</v>

364
00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 3>You should find some physical remains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he mentioned,</v>

365
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:31.561
<v Speaker 3>and I found it very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he mentioned in passing what I've been </v>

366
00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:33.730
<v Speaker 3>working on now for a number of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>that no,</v>

367
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:39.150
<v Speaker 3>and I was once on the comment band bike </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll put it that way and I'm not </v>

368
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.301
<v Speaker 3>trying knock good research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at the evidence,</v>

369
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 3>what is not being considered by a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

370
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 3>and he mentioned this in passing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

371
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:49.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

372
00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:54.931
<v Speaker 3>something else that could cause this </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightning but you wouldn't have </v>

373
00:21:54.931 --> 00:21:54.931
<v Speaker 3>lightning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

374
00:21:54.931 --> 00:21:58.180
<v Speaker 3>that's very localized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think of this very localized.</v>

375
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have a major solar outburst,</v>

376
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:06.331
<v Speaker 3>mainers are coronal mass ejections and </v>
<v Speaker 3>astrophysicists who is now deceased.</v>

377
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 3>He was at cornell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thomas gold,</v>

378
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.020
<v Speaker 3>who did a lot of really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

379
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:16.021
<v Speaker 3>prize winning work in astrophysics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first pointed out in the 19 sixties that</v>

380
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 3>if you have a major solar outburst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major coronal mass ejection,</v>

381
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.320
<v Speaker 3>you would get essentially huge.</v>

382
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.320
<v Speaker 3>What would be like huge lightning </v>
<v Speaker 3>strikes over incredible areas of the </v>

383
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.770
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simultaneously.</v>

384
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 3>This would cost vitrification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would cause all these features.</v>

385
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 3>And just as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the last year,</v>

386
00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:42.511
<v Speaker 3>there's been more work done showing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>full rights were lightning strikes in </v>

387
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:46.831
<v Speaker 3>modern times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even small lightning strikes like that </v>

388
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:48.760
<v Speaker 3>can cause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can create things like shocked quartz.</v>

389
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Other quote impact features that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have always said,</v>

390
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be a comet or asteroid,</v>

391
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 3>but you're not finding the craters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you not finding other things.</v>

392
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.380
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm finding are my own research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

393
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:08.430
<v Speaker 3>is I'm coming to conclude that it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>a physical object that hit us.</v>

394
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.730
<v Speaker 3>It was a solar outburst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a general term I use possible </v>

395
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.090
<v Speaker 3>that it was both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

396
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.400
<v Speaker 3>actually there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite possible that it could have </v>

397
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.740
<v Speaker 3>been both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

398
00:23:20.741 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 3>there could have been fragments of both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can address that.</v>

399
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a couple of aspects to both.</v>

400
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:32.310
<v Speaker 3>When you say both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is indications that comments </v>

401
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>diving into the sun actually caused </v>
<v Speaker 3>coronal mass ejections a correlated with</v>

402
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.380
<v Speaker 3>disturbing the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in some cases you'll have the occult,</v>

403
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:45.390
<v Speaker 3>the comic group talking about how we go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through these comment streams </v>

404
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 3>periodically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree 100 percent.</v>

405
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:51.761
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about this in some of my early </v>

406
00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:51.770
<v Speaker 3>books because I really was into comments</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time,</v>

407
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 3>four inches of the pyramid builders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

408
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I talk about how comments might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>begun and ended the younger dryas,</v>

409
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't thinking about solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity at that time.</v>

410
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Seriously asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one else was.</v>

411
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.220
<v Speaker 3>But we now find that commentS dive into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun when we go through comment </v>

412
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 3>streams that can set off solar activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in fact,</v>

413
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:17.561
<v Speaker 3>I think it could be both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could be that the comments are </v>

414
00:24:17.561 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 3>affecting the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is then affecting the earth rather</v>

415
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:21.850
<v Speaker 3>than directly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>

416
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other thing is that people have </v>

417
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 3>to understand there's a couple of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

418
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.510
<v Speaker 3>The younger dryas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,900</v>

419
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:33.020
<v Speaker 3>bc when it first begins is a cooling </v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

420
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not as dramatic climate change as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have at 9,700</v>

421
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:42.611
<v Speaker 3>bc when all of a sudden we go from deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>ice age climatic regime to modern are </v>

422
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:49.190
<v Speaker 3>even a little bit warmer initially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Modern changes.</v>

423
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.690
<v Speaker 3>And this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

424
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

425
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:56.141
<v Speaker 3>there we have some isotope data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we have at 9,700</v>

426
00:24:56.361 --> 00:25:01.361
<v Speaker 3>bc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is based on sediment cores in </v>

427
00:25:01.361 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 3>ice cores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also have lunar data that supports is</v>

428
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 3>at 9,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>

429
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.190
<v Speaker 3>We have incredible climatic change going</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

430
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep ice age to modern warming.</v>

431
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.280
<v Speaker 3>And this literally now based on what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they call micro stratigraphy from </v>

432
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 3>greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice cores can be dated within.</v>

433
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Get this weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days.</v>

434
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thiS happened literally we're talking</v>

435
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:24.590
<v Speaker 3>virtually overnight.</v>

436
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 3>When I was a graduate student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we thought things had happened.</v>

437
00:25:27.231 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly we were talking thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years or decades.</v>

438
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take decadeS for something to </v>

439
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.030
<v Speaker 3>happen geologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be crazy.</v>

440
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're talking literally weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

441
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.610
<v Speaker 3>So that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

442
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.790
<v Speaker 3>So I think this ties in to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a massive solar event in </v>

443
00:25:45.851 --> 00:25:47.480
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 9,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>

444
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we had a,</v>

445
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.310
<v Speaker 3>just a slide a minute ago when I saw it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

446
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.820
<v Speaker 3>the side of my eye was a graph of based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on isotope data is what they call </v>

447
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 3>proxies of solar activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

448
00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:03.500
<v Speaker 3>based on primarily ice core sediment </v>
<v Speaker 3>cores.</v>

449
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 3>And the sun was incredibly active and </v>
<v Speaker 3>9,700</v>

450
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 3>bc and shortly after there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it had huge,</v>

451
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.210
<v Speaker 3>if you think of anthropomorphically mood</v>
<v Speaker 3>swings,</v>

452
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:19.211
<v Speaker 3>will be very active.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then would go very skilled and very </v>

453
00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:19.211
<v Speaker 3>active again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very still.</v>

454
00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:24.100
<v Speaker 3>And this happened for some thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and then it evened out.</v>

455
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.920
<v Speaker 3>The sun cert became quiescent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was during this quiescence period </v>

456
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.360
<v Speaker 3>that tying back into human civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization was able to reemerge,</v>

457
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:40.661
<v Speaker 3>redevelop again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've had incredibly good conditions</v>

458
00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:42.950
<v Speaker 3>should we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the last 5,000</v>

459
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.470
<v Speaker 3>quite condition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stable conditions on earth for </v>

460
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 3>civilization to reemerge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tying back into that theme,</v>

461
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.660
<v Speaker 3>but recently the son has become very </v>
<v Speaker 3>active again and we have to be very </v>

462
00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 3>careful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a doomsayer scaremonger.</v>

463
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to sell people on being </v>
<v Speaker 3>preppers,</v>

464
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is the sun is starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to become active again,</v>

465
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.940
<v Speaker 3>just as it was at the end of the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>ice age.</v>

466
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think this makes perfect sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the sun is a star.</v>

467
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 3>It goes through cycles like other stars </v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

468
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.040
<v Speaker 3>and we're a little planet or retain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're like all the other plants </v>

469
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.560
<v Speaker 3>affected by this fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that we have this incredible need to</v>

470
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:30.561
<v Speaker 3>keep things exactly the way they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where we were in denial </v>

471
00:27:30.561 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 3>about any potential change.</v>

472
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 3>If you're studying things that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

473
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.350
<v Speaker 3>it'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

474
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 3>we're so inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are so inclined to do that.</v>

475
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 3>It's very interested helion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

476
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who it was.</v>

477
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 3>One of the astrophysicist some decades </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago said about the sun.</v>

478
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.580
<v Speaker 3>It was sort of the last vestige of eris </v>
<v Speaker 3>julianism in modern science.</v>

479
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Everyone assumed the son is stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

480
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

481
00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:59.361
<v Speaker 3>it goes through little sun cycles of 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 22 years and maybe some bigger ones </v>

482
00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:03.580
<v Speaker 3>have a few centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one wanted to think of it as what</v>

483
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:08.590
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a plain old star that goes through </v>

484
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.870
<v Speaker 3>periods of the equilibrium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been in relative solar equilibrium</v>

485
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:17.241
<v Speaker 3>for thousands of years now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it goes through disequilibrium and </v>

486
00:28:17.241 --> 00:28:21.050
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll call hiccups in spurts and has to </v>

487
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.750
<v Speaker 3>recalibrate itself if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

488
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.150
<v Speaker 3>and we feel the effects on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so at the end of the last ice age,</v>

489
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.230
<v Speaker 3>we had this massive solar event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solar outburst,</v>

490
00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:35.400
<v Speaker 3>what they call 'em,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a solar proton events,</v>

491
00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:40.401
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have messed up the ionosphere </v>

492
00:28:40.401 --> 00:28:40.401
<v Speaker 3>caused all kinds of geomagnetic storms.</v>

493
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.560
<v Speaker 3>This tyson with earthquake activity that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see at the end of the last ice age </v>

494
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.190
<v Speaker 3>because we now have lots of evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that solar activity upset,</v>

495
00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:53.370
<v Speaker 3>said mac nita sphere and the magnate </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnetic fields on the earth,</v>

496
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:58.670
<v Speaker 3>the electrical currents in the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's A will trigger earthquakes that are</v>

497
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:03.360
<v Speaker 3>about to happen anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not unlike.</v>

498
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.380
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to katy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife on the right here.</v>

499
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:12.381
<v Speaker 3>And a good analogy is when you have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>avalanche just about ready to go,</v>

500
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 3>you can clap your hands in some cases </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it sets off this huge avalanche.</v>

501
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So solar activity is tied in with earth </v>

502
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.670
<v Speaker 3>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake activity for instance,</v>

503
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 3>of volcanic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we see volcanic activity,</v>

504
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:30.690
<v Speaker 3>increased volcanic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a major,</v>

505
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:36.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm super volcano that went off just at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the last ice age.</v>

506
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Will why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably it.</v>

507
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 3>This is me speaking because of the solar</v>
<v Speaker 3>activity that set it off,</v>

508
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:48.210
<v Speaker 3>so when you start getting things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>platinum iridium osmium spikes,</v>

509
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 3>that's not necessarily extra </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial.</v>

510
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:57.030
<v Speaker 3>That could be from terreStrial volcanic </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity was occurring at that period,</v>

511
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's extraterrestrial causes,</v>

512
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there's a very strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>case to be made that this is solar,</v>

513
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.900
<v Speaker 3>that this is the sun influencing us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really important to fast </v>

514
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 3>forward to today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we are,</v>

515
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:15.370
<v Speaker 3>we're on skype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're using all these electronic media.</v>

516
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 3>What could be more vulnerable to a solar</v>
<v Speaker 3>outburst?</v>

517
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.270
<v Speaker 3>That kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

518
00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.350
<v Speaker 3>our grid power grids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Power grids will be friday.</v>

519
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.610
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we're seeing the beginning </v>

520
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 3>of this are we saw the beginning of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>

521
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:35.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm a geologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think in broad terms,</v>

522
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.250
<v Speaker 3>few hundred years is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighteen,</v>

523
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 3>59.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you aware of the carrington event?</v>

524
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.880
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a major solar outburst from a </v>

525
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 3>human Perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major solar outburst.</v>

526
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:52.630
<v Speaker 3>From an astrophysical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was nothing but it was a coronal mass</v>

527
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 3>ejection.</v>

528
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Actually two in a row that hit us in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>59.</v>

529
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 3>It's known as the carrington event after</v>
<v Speaker 3>richard carrington,</v>

530
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:00.550
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

531
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.880
<v Speaker 3>first saw the solar flares,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really bright solar flares that were </v>

532
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.991
<v Speaker 3>associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was picked up on the primitive </v>

533
00:31:09.991 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 3>magnetometers of the time that they had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

534
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:12.210
<v Speaker 3>in london,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

535
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Study by the physicists of the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

536
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:18.730
<v Speaker 3>59,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were electronics around.</v>

537
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.180
<v Speaker 3>It was called the telegraph system to </v>
<v Speaker 3>telegraph system.</v>

538
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Acted as huge antenna that picked up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing magnetic fields,</v>

539
00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:31.870
<v Speaker 3>generated electricity along it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>burnt out the telegraph lines,</v>

540
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.950
<v Speaker 3>literally set telegraph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

541
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

542
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the places where the telegraph operators</v>

543
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 3>worked on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>telegraph stations on fire,</v>

544
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.430
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

545
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:51.870
<v Speaker 3>if we had a carrington level event now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really quite minor from a </v>

546
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.240
<v Speaker 3>astrophysical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orders of magnitude less than what </v>

547
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.110
<v Speaker 3>happened at the end of the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

548
00:31:59.111 --> 00:32:04.111
<v Speaker 3>it would fry are grid lines that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock out all the huge transformers it </v>

549
00:32:05.531 --> 00:32:06.300
<v Speaker 3>would be for it.</v>

550
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Did that as it's coming in and probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock out all the sound lights on the </v>

551
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.450
<v Speaker 3>gps systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>communications.</v>

552
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:16.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would really bring us to our knees.</v>

553
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Is this an article from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>59?</v>

554
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

555
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 3>The rural display in boston's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the display of auroral.</v>

556
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

557
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At 1:00,</v>

558
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:29.230
<v Speaker 3>ordinary print can be read by the light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

559
00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Because one thing you get is these </v>
<v Speaker 3>bright auroras,</v>

560
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:38.910
<v Speaker 3>these bright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people think of as in northern and </v>

561
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:38.910
<v Speaker 3>southern lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in 18,</v>

562
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:39.890
<v Speaker 3>59,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they saw them around the world.</v>

563
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm back at the end of the last ice age </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were so powerful.</v>

564
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become more intense.</v>

565
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:52.370
<v Speaker 3>They take on very discrete structures in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky.</v>

566
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Here's some of what are known as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

567
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:57.650
<v Speaker 3>northern lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

568
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Rural displays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see how it starts to take on a </v>

569
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.280
<v Speaker 3>discreet structure on there right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to describe it to the audience.</v>

570
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Do you see how it sort of looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person with their hands up in the air?</v>

571
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.430
<v Speaker 3>They start to take on more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>discreet structures.</v>

572
00:33:10.431 --> 00:33:15.431
<v Speaker 3>Some of them looked like people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their hands up in there and little legs </v>

573
00:33:15.431 --> 00:33:19.571
<v Speaker 3>and some birds phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is basically the high charge </v>

574
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:24.941
<v Speaker 3>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrons and protons and whatnot </v>

575
00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:25.260
<v Speaker 3>interacting with the atmoSphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

576
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 3>and they form these figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's electrical phenomenon,</v>

577
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it will ultimately come down if you </v>

578
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 3>have a tense enough one as you did at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of last ice age,</v>

579
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 3>it will look like if you were there </v>
<v Speaker 3>living,</v>

580
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12,000</v>

581
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:41.900
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000,</v>

582
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 3>11,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>700 years ago at the end of the last ice</v>

583
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:46.700
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you saw this,</v>

584
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.070
<v Speaker 3>you would see these things in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

585
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 3>they look like god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

586
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:52.880
<v Speaker 3>look like stick figure humans in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky.</v>

587
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would see huge lightning bolts </v>

588
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.731
<v Speaker 3>hitting parts of the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating because that image on that's</v>

589
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 3>in hieroglyphics and exactly find this </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world.</v>

590
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.890
<v Speaker 3>and anthony parak who's along when we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

591
00:34:08.891 --> 00:34:13.891
<v Speaker 3>but for the people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of people just listening </v>

592
00:34:13.891 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 3>what we're looking at a discharge </v>
<v Speaker 3>formation.</v>

593
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is plasma discharge formation.</v>

594
00:34:16.101 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Plasma is essentially think of is </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrically charged particles,</v>

595
00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 3>electrons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protons,</v>

596
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:25.640
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As it comes off the sun.</v>

597
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.730
<v Speaker 3>And this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of a coronal mass ejection,</v>

598
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 3>a huge ball of charged gas is one way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>describe it,</v>

599
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.780
<v Speaker 3>hitting the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving down into the atmosphere,</v>

600
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 3>causing these northern lights on </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>

601
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:46.181
<v Speaker 3>If you wanT to put that image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing very specific images that </v>

602
00:34:46.181 --> 00:34:48.800
<v Speaker 3>looked like stick figures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are things you would see in the</v>

603
00:34:48.801 --> 00:34:53.801
<v Speaker 3>sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except they're in many cases they're </v>

604
00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:56.711
<v Speaker 3>spinning electrically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't notice that they were </v>

605
00:34:56.711 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>spinning generally and they looked sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like.</v>

606
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:02.710
<v Speaker 3>because we've tend to anthropomorphize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tend to look at like even clouds are </v>

607
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.620
<v Speaker 3>rocks formations and we make them look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what we think they look like.</v>

608
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.770
<v Speaker 3>They look sort of like stick figure men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is any of this an actual photograph or </v>

609
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:13.250
<v Speaker 3>these just graphic illustrators?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Graphic illustrations.</v>

610
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:18.251
<v Speaker 3>But what we know because we haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced this fortunately and since </v>

611
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:23.471
<v Speaker 3>photography,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we do have our petroglyphs </v>

612
00:35:23.471 --> 00:35:27.130
<v Speaker 3>dating back to the end of last ice age </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people were seeing this in the sky</v>

613
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.530
<v Speaker 3>and they were drawing it on the walls of</v>
<v Speaker 3>caves,</v>

614
00:35:30.531 --> 00:35:34.130
<v Speaker 3>on the walls of rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually globally.</v>

615
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Anthony per rod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a los alamos plasma physicist.</v>

616
00:35:38.421 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 3>He is the world's expert on this type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>high energy plasma physics.</v>

617
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Speaker 3>These are some of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll go back.</v>

618
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jamie.</v>

619
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I'll look at this from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world looking at it exactly.</v>

620
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Amazing all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona,</v>

621
00:35:50.921 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all the same thing.</v>

622
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.870
<v Speaker 3>It's all the same thing in notice to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

623
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Spain see how they look like stick </v>
<v Speaker 3>figures,</v>

624
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 3>but they have little weird dots on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>

625
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Donuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real humans don't have that,</v>

626
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.930
<v Speaker 3>but they're seeing this around the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this guy and recording it.</v>

627
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Also the motif of when these take on </v>
<v Speaker 3>search formed,</v>

628
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.460
<v Speaker 3>they take on what looked like birds' </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads,</v>

629
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.580
<v Speaker 3>so the bird headed man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A moTif that you see around the world </v>

630
00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.571
<v Speaker 3>going back and I believe it all goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the end of the last ice age and </v>

631
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 3>what people were experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were seeing,</v>

632
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 3>if you will called gods in the sky or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

633
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:33.030
<v Speaker 3>but they were seeing this and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a real effect on their life.</v>

634
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 3>What is causing that very specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern,</v>

635
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:37.440
<v Speaker 3>that very specific shape that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing?</v>

636
00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.510
<v Speaker 3>The way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I would say,</v>

637
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 3>the best way to say it is you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

638
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:47.680
<v Speaker 3>this is simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got these huge electrical </v>

639
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.421
<v Speaker 3>charges coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of focus like a tornado </v>

640
00:36:50.421 --> 00:36:51.600
<v Speaker 3>focuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if you think of,</v>

641
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:53.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running water out of a spicket,</v>

642
00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:58.730
<v Speaker 3>if you play with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can sort of squeeze it and make it </v>

643
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.730
<v Speaker 3>form different shapes.</v>

644
00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.760
<v Speaker 3>That served my analogy to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

645
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.730
<v Speaker 3>and it's the magnetic and electric </v>
<v Speaker 3>fields interacting with each other.</v>

646
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they serve spin around each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

647
00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:13.011
<v Speaker 3>like a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that illustration here you see a how </v>

648
00:37:13.011 --> 00:37:16.691
<v Speaker 3>to say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perrott parent dr plots experiments </v>

649
00:37:16.691 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 3>where he essentially reproduce that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shape over and over and over again.</v>

650
00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.680
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

651
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Reproduce that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it gets even more fascinating.</v>

652
00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 3>And this is something that ties in well </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually with katie,</v>

653
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.100
<v Speaker 3>my wife catherine ulysse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

654
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.950
<v Speaker 3>and imparato team has confirmed it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>easter island.</v>

655
00:37:31.951 --> 00:37:36.951
<v Speaker 3>You have the rango rango script,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which also duplicates this and seems to </v>

656
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Be a reCord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

657
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 3>the modern rango rango are only a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred yearS old,</v>

658
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:45.270
<v Speaker 3>but just like any manuscript or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

659
00:37:45.271 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 3>it was copied over and over and seems to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to it too.</v>

660
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.230
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at some of the rango </v>
<v Speaker 3>rango and I know a lot of your audience </v>

661
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.250
<v Speaker 3>can't see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you look at some of them,</v>

662
00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 3>they're even more definitive.</v>

663
00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.700
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

664
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showing what [inaudible] was able to </v>

665
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.210
<v Speaker 3>reproduce experimentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

666
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:10.220
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have it recorded from ancient </v>

667
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.611
<v Speaker 3>timeS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're talking about this event </v>

668
00:38:13.611 --> 00:38:14.790
<v Speaker 3>that happened at the end of the younger </v>
<v Speaker 3>dryas,</v>

669
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.070
<v Speaker 3>you what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like put it in perspective,</v>

670
00:38:17.071 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 3>like are we talking about like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurricane times a thousand?</v>

671
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Like what would this be like a million?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

672
00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.220
<v Speaker 3>like huge thunderstorm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

673
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally possible to comprehend </v>
<v Speaker 3>and possible to comprehend from our </v>

674
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.740
<v Speaker 3>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my perspective,</v>

675
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 3>our perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's more to it than that.</v>

676
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 3>You would have incredible radiation </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels at the surface of the earth.</v>

677
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Paula violetta physicist I know and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>published on this,</v>

678
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 3>has talked about how during an event </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

679
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 3>you would have levels of radiation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were so high that large mammals,</v>

680
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 3>we are large mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>large mammals.</v>

681
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.610
<v Speaker 3>If they couldn't protect themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could die within,</v>

682
00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three to six,</v>

683
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.970
<v Speaker 3>seven days a week or so.</v>

684
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 3>How do you protect yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go underground,</v>

685
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:08.791
<v Speaker 3>you go Into caves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go into places because rock will </v>

686
00:39:08.791 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 3>protect you from the surface radiation </v>
<v Speaker 3>under the circumstances.</v>

687
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Now you don't need to stay there </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

688
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

689
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.900
<v Speaker 3>because these solar events probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>came.</v>

690
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Now this is hypothetical because we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>not experienced a huge one like this,</v>

691
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.460
<v Speaker 3>but they probably came.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

692
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 3>and then it went back off a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then maybe another one would come </v>

693
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a geologiSt,</v>

694
00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:34.471
<v Speaker 3>so think of a huge earthquake and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>aftershocks after shocks that can </v>

695
00:39:34.471 --> 00:39:37.450
<v Speaker 3>actually last centuries or millennia in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some cases,</v>

696
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:42.670
<v Speaker 3>smaller ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So something that was happening and you </v>

697
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 3>see this around the world too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we're people survived,</v>

698
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I believe in part because they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to natural caves initially.</v>

699
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Then they built underground structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>for when they came again and it also </v>

700
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.670
<v Speaker 3>encouraged our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

701
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 3>developed this whole tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shall we say,</v>

702
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 3>of having a place to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's not occurring to the moment</v>

703
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.050
<v Speaker 3>they knew that these things do occur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

704
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:09.880
<v Speaker 3>at least for some thousands of years.</v>

705
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
<v Speaker 3>And we're aware of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're getting prepared and now gi </v>

706
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.961
<v Speaker 3>would uses during the cold war here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did a lot of people build in their </v>

707
00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:18.790
<v Speaker 3>backyards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bonders bonkers.</v>

708
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.420
<v Speaker 3>So they were doing this also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get areas here.</v>

709
00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I see there's a slight of India up at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment.</v>

710
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Kappa dosha region is very well known </v>
<v Speaker 3>for those get underground.</v>

711
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.180
<v Speaker 3>How do they know to get into initially?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think initially,</v>

712
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've got literally fire coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>down from the sky.</v>

713
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Think of the lightening bolts fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you've got a cave there,</v>

714
00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:44.901
<v Speaker 3>you go into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the only thing that is going to </v>

715
00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:44.901
<v Speaker 3>protect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Protect these houses are useless.</v>

716
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:50.390
<v Speaker 3>All that burns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've got literally fire coming </v>

717
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:53.721
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of his fire lightning that is </v>

718
00:40:53.721 --> 00:40:55.120
<v Speaker 3>going to set things on fire and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely incinerate that.</v>

719
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Just lightening everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost like rainfall.</v>

720
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

721
00:40:59.281 --> 00:41:00.870
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In certain areas,</v>

722
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:04.110
<v Speaker 3>and that's why you have huge sheets of </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass in some cases.</v>

723
00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>

724
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

725
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.590
<v Speaker 3>and so you're incinerating everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it hits ice,</v>

726
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.430
<v Speaker 3>it's flash pricing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is hitting water.</v>

727
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:19.150
<v Speaker 3>It's vape to this massive flooding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's causing massive flooding.</v>

728
00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:21.790
<v Speaker 3>It's dumping all the ice ultimately into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oceans,</v>

729
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:26.791
<v Speaker 3>which is causing rising sea levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly it's causing </v>

730
00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:29.040
<v Speaker 3>massive precipitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive flash floods and loss.</v>

731
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Are we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>

732
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I think incredible because for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had can document linguistically,</v>

733
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:39.590
<v Speaker 3>and this is other people's work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it ties right in.</v>

734
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:43.190
<v Speaker 3>They haven't been explained it cogently </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise that there is.</v>

735
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Turkey,</v>

736
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:51.070
<v Speaker 3>middle east,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a constriction of the </v>

737
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 3>population to the anatolia region,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kappa dosha,</v>

738
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:55.550
<v Speaker 3>where you have these underground </v>
<v Speaker 3>shelters,</v>

739
00:41:55.551 --> 00:42:00.551
<v Speaker 3>you have a geology that was easy to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into and escape and linguistically we </v>

740
00:42:02.631 --> 00:42:07.631
<v Speaker 3>can map back into european languages to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a small pocket that survived there at </v>

741
00:42:08.331 --> 00:42:10.010
<v Speaker 3>the end of the last ice age.</v>

742
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

743
00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a massive around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

744
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:19.391
<v Speaker 3>you would've had populations being </v>
<v Speaker 3>constricted and then they spread out </v>

745
00:42:19.391 --> 00:42:20.480
<v Speaker 3>again and when they were constricted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

746
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I see the slight there for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>linguistic data,</v>

747
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.120
<v Speaker 3>when you constrict down in one area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you lose a lot of the </v>

748
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.771
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lose a lot of the high culture if </v>

749
00:42:32.771 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 3>you go back to a much more primitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage,</v>

750
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we find,</v>

751
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in anatolia,</v>

752
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:44.410
<v Speaker 3>a western Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no near asia as it was called in ancient</v>

753
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:49.871
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find not only of course you go </v>

754
00:42:49.871 --> 00:42:53.420
<v Speaker 3>things like comE back lay tappy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which goes back before this huge </v>

755
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.460
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe with the monumental stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>mega list,</v>

756
00:42:56.461 --> 00:43:01.461
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you find there are 2000 years </v>

757
00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:03.560
<v Speaker 3>later in the same general area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find friends since childhood,</v>

758
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.760
<v Speaker 3>which is a bunch of mud brick houses all</v>
<v Speaker 3>clustered together.</v>

759
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gone down.</v>

760
00:43:09.681 --> 00:43:14.681
<v Speaker 3>It's gone into what I call an acadian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call sit at this solar induced dark </v>

761
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 3>age where they lost a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not unlike an analogy,</v>

762
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it's easy for people understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>analogies,</v>

763
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:28.210
<v Speaker 3>the end of the roman empire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that was lost there and then </v>

764
00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.310
<v Speaker 3>go into a much more primitive state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

765
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 3>with the dark ages to the european dark </v>
<v Speaker 3>ages.</v>

766
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:35.350
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

767
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.900
<v Speaker 3>you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

768
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.730
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was much higher during the roman </v>

769
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 3>empire until maybe 1000 or 1200 a d </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

770
00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:48.170
<v Speaker 3>in many realms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing here,</v>

771
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.630
<v Speaker 3>although this was such a mighty </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwback,</v>

772
00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:55.631
<v Speaker 3>it took thousands of years for people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>reemerge and at least start to get up to</v>

773
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 3>the status now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had been before,</v>

774
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 3>presented this in front of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>scholars.</v>

775
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

776
00:44:04.811 --> 00:44:06.200
<v Speaker 3>It's getting at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

777
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

778
00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm an academic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

779
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to sound the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not looking for sympathy,</v>

780
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:19.030
<v Speaker 3>but going out on limbs like this going </v>
<v Speaker 3>just beginning with the reading of the </v>

781
00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:21.860
<v Speaker 3>sphinx and that's what we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't even finish with that yet,</v>

782
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.610
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll get back to that.</v>

783
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Got plenty of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

784
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of resistance to anything </v>

785
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 3>that's new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any new concepts,</v>

786
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 3>new ideas,</v>

787
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.110
<v Speaker 1>textbooks have been rich and people I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed.</v>

788
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Stayed robin given out.</v>

789
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay a.</v>

790
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:44.590
<v Speaker 3>They've staked their reputation on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I understand that and I try not to </v>

791
00:44:44.721 --> 00:44:46.220
<v Speaker 3>be that myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

792
00:44:46.221 --> 00:44:48.020
<v Speaker 3>the old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my pet theory,</v>

793
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:53.290
<v Speaker 3>but I do try and look at the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that slowly we're building up </v>

794
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 3>more and more interest more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

795
00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.890
<v Speaker 3>at least people looking at objectively </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

796
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I do see changes occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

797
00:45:03.891 --> 00:45:08.891
<v Speaker 3>one thing I'll mention right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as of relatively recently,</v>

798
00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:11.570
<v Speaker 3>knots are still very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small,</v>

799
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:16.520
<v Speaker 3>but at boston university I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to found what is called the iso,</v>

800
00:45:16.521 --> 00:45:21.521
<v Speaker 3>see the institute for the study of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>origins of civiliZation,</v>

801
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.920
<v Speaker 3>which is really just me at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to build it up and I'd like </v>

802
00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.410
<v Speaker 3>To get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to sound the wrong way,</v>

803
00:45:27.411 --> 00:45:29.540
<v Speaker 3>but I'd like to get people to donate to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

804
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.500
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ETc.</v>

805
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

806
00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:36.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found it with some colleagues of mine,</v>

807
00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:41.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including some academic colleagues or </v>

808
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:41.350
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which stands for the organization,</v>

809
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.941
<v Speaker 3>for the research of ancient cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're bringing into the mainstream </v>

810
00:45:45.941 --> 00:45:50.120
<v Speaker 3>both as a private,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for profit foundation as a institute</v>

811
00:45:50.121 --> 00:45:54.290
<v Speaker 3>through boston university to really be </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at these things in a,</v>

812
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.830
<v Speaker 3>when I say professional way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I mean by that is,</v>

813
00:45:57.831 --> 00:46:00.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidenced based way,</v>

814
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also looking outside the standard </v>

815
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.220
<v Speaker 3>dog must have standard boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standard paradigms and the standard </v>

816
00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.040
<v Speaker 3>vested interest because so much science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now people say to me all the time,</v>

817
00:46:13.041 --> 00:46:14.660
<v Speaker 3>they think science is supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective.</v>

818
00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it Is supposed to be objective,</v>

819
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:21.191
<v Speaker 3>but who are the scientists doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have all their subjective biases </v>

820
00:46:21.191 --> 00:46:25.040
<v Speaker 3>and notions and vested interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to knock anyone but,</v>

821
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in.</v>

822
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just a human fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

823
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all humans.</v>

824
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that documentary from 1993 that I was </v>

825
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:39.381
<v Speaker 1>kind of stunned by was the reaction by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conventional egyptologists when you </v>

826
00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 1>brought up this evidence where he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very dismissive,</v>

827
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:45.360
<v Speaker 1>almost mockingly in this weird sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way where he was like,</v>

828
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.950
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

829
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 1>what culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's this?</v>

830
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Where's the evidence in this culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

831
00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

832
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:56.721
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that really should not have any </v>

833
00:46:56.721 --> 00:46:58.830
<v Speaker 1>place in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in pain and being called.</v>

834
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been called a pseudo scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

835
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:03.090
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

836
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

837
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:09.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm as well as well </v>

838
00:47:09.351 --> 00:47:09.820
<v Speaker 1>credentialed as anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

839
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.630
<v Speaker 1>among my academic colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

840
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's why I appreciate you that </v>

841
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.301
<v Speaker 1>you have stuck your neck out for so long</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this research and since that time </v>

842
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 1>have I been punished?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

843
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

844
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>

845
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest.</v>

846
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:28.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten necessarily the,</v>

847
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I've</v>

848
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:35.290
<v Speaker 3>had colleagues say to me in no uncertain</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms very well,</v>

849
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:40.291
<v Speaker 3>meaning that I could have had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful career and had all of the </v>

850
00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:44.491
<v Speaker 3>promotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>advancements going up through the </v>

851
00:47:44.491 --> 00:47:44.491
<v Speaker 3>academic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

852
00:47:44.491 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 3>ladder if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with no problems if I just stuck to my,</v>

853
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some little specialty that no one really</v>

854
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:52.320
<v Speaker 3>cared about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

855
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

856
00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.770
<v Speaker 1>But you've had an impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gigantic impact on people like me that</v>

857
00:47:57.771 --> 00:47:59.210
<v Speaker 1>have a really about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

858
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:01.980
<v Speaker 3>continue to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

859
00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:07.130
<v Speaker 3>one of my specialties as a graduate </v>
<v Speaker 3>student was paleocene esc in malmo </v>

860
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:08.960
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would I be talking to you about that</v>

861
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.340
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if it's a,</v>

862
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.520
<v Speaker 1>if it was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but less likely,</v>

863
00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.690
<v Speaker 1>less likely from seeing your skeletons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot and skulls.</v>

864
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be.</v>

865
00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were doing that,</v>

866
00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.840
<v Speaker 1>you were talking to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he was saying in </v>

867
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:25.840
<v Speaker 1>this dismissive ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the evidence of this culture?</v>

868
00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Well now we have go beckley tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely because is the evidence </v>

869
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:31.400
<v Speaker 1>because that</v>

870
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:36.660
<v Speaker 3>that was an american association for </v>
<v Speaker 3>advancement of science debate on the </v>

871
00:48:36.771 --> 00:48:41.771
<v Speaker 3>sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which turned out I thought I was going </v>

872
00:48:41.771 --> 00:48:45.031
<v Speaker 3>in for a real debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was going to be a great </v>

873
00:48:45.031 --> 00:48:48.421
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're really going to discuss the </v>

874
00:48:48.421 --> 00:48:48.421
<v Speaker 3>evidence back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought all my data,</v>

875
00:48:48.421 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 3>the seismic data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very,</v>

876
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:52.690
<v Speaker 3>very important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we haven't even touched on yet.</v>

877
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Other types of data we haven't touched </v>
<v Speaker 3>on because I want to make the point is </v>

878
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:01.171
<v Speaker 3>much more than a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weathering on the sphinx and I've heard </v>

879
00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 3>so many critics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even to my face,</v>

880
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

881
00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:06.640
<v Speaker 3>you don't redate civilization based on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weathering profile.</v>

882
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:11.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've goT lots more than weathering </v>

883
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.670
<v Speaker 3>profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weathering profile and erosion.</v>

884
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:16.520
<v Speaker 3>the easiest thing to explain and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what I saw initially in that first </v>

885
00:49:16.841 --> 00:49:21.841
<v Speaker 3>30 to 120 seconds because that's before </v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought in equipment and work with tom</v>

886
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:27.901
<v Speaker 3>to becky to do seismic work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do other types of more detailed </v>

887
00:49:27.901 --> 00:49:27.901
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>

888
00:49:27.901 --> 00:49:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I would not be talking to you today if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a national profile.</v>

889
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I for my own self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put enough stock in that yet,</v>

890
00:49:37.031 --> 00:49:39.250
<v Speaker 3>but when it ties in with everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

891
00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:41.360
<v Speaker 3>we have a coach and picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

892
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.990
<v Speaker 3>but getting back to someone being </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismissive like that,</v>

893
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:49.110
<v Speaker 3>that was 1992.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The beckley tap bay had technically been</v>

894
00:49:49.151 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 3>discovered back in the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they misdated it completely.</v>

895
00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:58.921
<v Speaker 3>They thought was maybe a thousand or </v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 years old byzantine or roman greco </v>

896
00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:02.920
<v Speaker 3>roman period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not end of the last ice age,</v>

897
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:03.880
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

898
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:05.500
<v Speaker 3>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

899
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.700
<v Speaker 1>And how did they make the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was 12,000</v>

900
00:50:07.701 --> 00:50:10.190
<v Speaker 1>years old is based on the soil samples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

901
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.730
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was klaus schmidt.</v>

902
00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Klaus schmidt went back to it in about </v>
<v Speaker 3>1994 95.</v>

903
00:50:15.991 --> 00:50:20.280
<v Speaker 3>So a couple of years after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dismissive comment from the egyptologist</v>

904
00:50:20.281 --> 00:50:25.281
<v Speaker 3>mark laner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I think is the specific person </v>

905
00:50:25.281 --> 00:50:28.431
<v Speaker 3>you're referring to at the american </v>
<v Speaker 3>association for the advancement of </v>

906
00:50:28.431 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 3>science debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I just went to make the comment.</v>

907
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I went into that thinking that was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a debate.</v>

908
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:38.740
<v Speaker 3>I came out of it realizing that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were just trying to set me up to put me </v>

909
00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.670
<v Speaker 3>down and shut me up forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they were not successful in doing.</v>

910
00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that they're so reluctant </v>
<v Speaker 3>to just listen to the evidence and look </v>

911
00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.230
<v Speaker 3>at the information and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

912
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:53.231
<v Speaker 3>and consider the possibility that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>there had been an ancient civilization </v>

913
00:50:53.231 --> 00:50:56.810
<v Speaker 3>because it upsets the standard timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the standard standard story.</v>

914
00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 3>And it also upsets a lot of people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept of progression.</v>

915
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something John Anthony West like</v>

916
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 3>to talk about the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he called it the church of progress.</v>

917
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:08.780
<v Speaker 3>That we've gotten better and better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

918
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.960
<v Speaker 3>And I talked to so many people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that we are the end all and be all</v>

919
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 3>were the best that there ever has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

920
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:21.371
<v Speaker 3>maybe we are in terms of certain types </v>
<v Speaker 3>of technology and I'm not making any </v>

921
00:51:21.741 --> 00:51:26.741
<v Speaker 3>claim that people in the past could ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>do what we're doing now doing a podcast </v>

922
00:51:26.741 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 3>with all the electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I pointed out,</v>

923
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 3>that also makes us really vulnerable to </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

924
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:36.790
<v Speaker 3>But I would argue that there is a not so</v>
<v Speaker 3>remote possibility that they knew things</v>

925
00:51:39.501 --> 00:51:44.501
<v Speaker 3>that we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they may have understood things </v>

926
00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 3>that we don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may have had a worldview that would</v>

927
00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:49.550
<v Speaker 3>benefit us to at least have a feel for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

928
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

929
00:51:50.811 --> 00:51:53.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't want golf on spiritual tangents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

930
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:55.850
<v Speaker 3>if I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our philosophical tangent,</v>

931
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 3>but I also have a training as </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropologists.</v>

932
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Anthropologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an undergraduate degree in </v>

933
00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.661
<v Speaker 3>anthropology on top of everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm fascinated by human approaches </v>

934
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 3>to life and the environment and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

935
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:16.990
<v Speaker 3>And I'm convinced that we do have thingS</v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn from the ancients,</v>

936
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:23.710
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the really remote ancients </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the more recent ancients for only </v>

937
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.280
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

938
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.700
<v Speaker 3>even dynastic Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

939
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:32.770
<v Speaker 3>and that it's not all simply a one way </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress that there are fits and starts </v>

940
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:36.770
<v Speaker 3>that there have been high points and low</v>
<v Speaker 3>points and high points again,</v>

941
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:41.980
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not frankly convinced that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the highest point when it comes to </v>

942
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.761
<v Speaker 3>certain aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might be a high point with certain </v>

943
00:52:45.761 --> 00:52:49.121
<v Speaker 3>types of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not convinced that we're at a </v>

944
00:52:49.121 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 3>high point when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

945
00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:51.970
<v Speaker 3>stone construction.</v>

946
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly not with stone construction.</v>

947
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:58.430
<v Speaker 3>So there are types of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are not high point with much less gay</v>

948
00:52:58.431 --> 00:53:02.030
<v Speaker 3>into this philosophical or spiritual or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it.</v>

949
00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:07.060
<v Speaker 3>And we don't think of it as technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we think of technology as being </v>

950
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:07.060
<v Speaker 3>something that's electronic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

951
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:11.681
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are other technologies and if </v>

952
00:53:11.681 --> 00:53:11.690
<v Speaker 3>you asked me how did they build the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids,</v>

953
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you asked me how they </v>

954
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.841
<v Speaker 3>constructed the sphinx temple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They carved out those huge blocks of </v>

955
00:53:19.841 --> 00:53:23.771
<v Speaker 3>stone that can waive 50 or more tons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>move them in such tight spaces with such</v>

956
00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 3>tight tolerances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

957
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to.</v>

958
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.240
<v Speaker 3>No one really knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one really knows and some paints </v>

959
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:33.240
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

960
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.560
<v Speaker 3>you bring in thousands of slaves or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatnot.</v>

961
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence for that.</v>

962
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 3>And where would you have them stand when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're building the sphinx temple?</v>

963
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough room to gather.</v>

964
00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Round stones are so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even thousands of slaves struggled to </v>

965
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:46.900
<v Speaker 3>move them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like something like that.</v>

966
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get a couple of buddies.</v>

967
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 3>We're going to move this couch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

968
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about that.</v>

969
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

970
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

971
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 3>you can try to hypothesize levers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing,</v>

972
00:53:55.650 --> 00:54:00.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has been said before and I've seen </v>

973
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:03.180
<v Speaker 3>it questioned there in person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen off the record document,</v>

974
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>footage of it when they've tried to just</v>

975
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:10.820
<v Speaker 3>construct a little pyramid with very </v>
<v Speaker 3>small blocks and then they end up using </v>

976
00:54:11.911 --> 00:54:15.420
<v Speaker 3>modern machines and they still weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>very successful.</v>

977
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they knew they knew a lot.</v>

978
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:24.230
<v Speaker 3>So there's a real resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find among allow my academic </v>

979
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:28.281
<v Speaker 3>colleagues to one to even suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people could have known things in the </v>

980
00:54:28.281 --> 00:54:32.421
<v Speaker 3>past that we don't know now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or If they knew something in the past </v>

981
00:54:32.421 --> 00:54:36.051
<v Speaker 3>that we don't know now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so trivial that it was worth </v>

982
00:54:36.051 --> 00:54:36.051
<v Speaker 3>forgetting.</v>

983
00:54:36.051 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Worth not worrying about all should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>

984
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:43.580
<v Speaker 3>that concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it amazing and I hate to be </v>

985
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.480
<v Speaker 3>stereotypical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some broad brushing,</v>

986
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:50.481
<v Speaker 3>but many egyptologists when I read their</v>
<v Speaker 3>works or I listened to them at </v>

987
00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 3>conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

988
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:57.770
<v Speaker 3>And I get the impression that they might</v>
<v Speaker 3>love egyptology and studying the ancient</v>

989
00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 3>egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also have this view that,</v>

990
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:07.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys made wonderful temples and </v>

991
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:07.100
<v Speaker 3>had some fantastic art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really,</v>

992
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:11.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sort of primitive and </v>

993
00:55:11.871 --> 00:55:12.210
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] isn't that silly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see what I mean.</v>

994
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like the very thing they station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

995
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:19.510
<v Speaker 3>The very thing they study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put down in a sense to Build </v>

996
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:23.030
<v Speaker 3>themselves up and to build up this idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ultimate progress that we Can.</v>

997
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

998
00:55:24.751 --> 00:55:27.960
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you also have in Egypt tall g,</v>

999
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:29.640
<v Speaker 3>and I wouldn't give you another example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this,</v>

1000
00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:34.641
<v Speaker 3>not just me bringing in scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence and data and the egyptologists </v>

1001
00:55:34.641 --> 00:55:39.171
<v Speaker 3>rejecting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just recently in the last couple of </v>

1002
00:55:39.171 --> 00:55:43.220
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you heard about the project on the </v>

1003
00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:43.220
<v Speaker 3>great pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big void,</v>

1004
00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:47.780
<v Speaker 3>they've been using mammography,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a highly sophisticated </v>

1005
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:51.420
<v Speaker 3>technique using muon set come from outer</v>
<v Speaker 3>space or come from the atmosphere.</v>

1006
00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:56.420
<v Speaker 3>They go through the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can set up detectors longterm and </v>

1007
00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.050
<v Speaker 3>pick these up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sort of like x,</v>

1008
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.650
<v Speaker 3>think of x rays technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but using muons,</v>

1009
00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:07.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are sort of exotic particle that </v>

1010
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.220
<v Speaker 3>most people are not aware of because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just pass right through us without </v>

1011
00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.940
<v Speaker 3>interacting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you've got massive stone,</v>

1012
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:17.300
<v Speaker 3>massive stone will block some of them so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pick up essentially image over a</v>

1013
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 3>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is really high tech physics,</v>

1014
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:27.470
<v Speaker 3>very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A consortium of physicists did work on </v>

1015
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 3>the great pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's still ongoing,</v>

1016
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.130
<v Speaker 3>but they put up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1017
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.170
<v Speaker 3>tens of millions if not more worth of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

1018
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticate physical physics equipment,</v>

1019
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 3>gathered all this data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the raw data.</v>

1020
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 3>I have a degree in geophysics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>geology and geophysics.</v>

1021
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 3>I have some aBility to evaluate this </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of data,</v>

1022
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 3>whereas I hate to say aloud the </v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptologist don't.</v>

1023
00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I found that with my own data when I</v>

1024
00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:59.011
<v Speaker 3>shared my own data that not to be nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't know what they were </v>

1025
00:56:59.011 --> 00:57:03.181
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is somewhat understandable since </v>

1026
00:57:03.181 --> 00:57:03.181
<v Speaker 3>it's not their training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1027
00:57:03.181 --> 00:57:07.230
<v Speaker 3>So you have with the great pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just recently in the last couple of </v>

1028
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:11.760
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>published in nature of very prestigious </v>

1029
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 3>journal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found what they believe is evidence</v>

1030
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:18.961
<v Speaker 3>for a huge void above the grand gallery </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has never been known before.</v>

1031
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

1032
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:27.091
<v Speaker 3>there we have a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The egyptologist had been so resistant </v>

1033
00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 3>to this saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is nonsense.</v>

1034
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:31.330
<v Speaker 3>There can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't.</v>

1035
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Basically we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there can't be anything new that we </v>

1036
00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:36.360
<v Speaker 3>don't know about are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it is,</v>

1037
00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.360
<v Speaker 3>it's just trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just some space between the rocks.</v>

1038
00:57:40.361 --> 00:57:43.030
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I wanted to say,</v>

1039
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:48.050
<v Speaker 3>what's really important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some egyptologists actually called for </v>

1040
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:52.291
<v Speaker 3>the whole project to be closed down </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't like the results and </v>

1041
00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 3>they called it quote propaganda because </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1042
00:57:56.381 --> 00:58:00.490
<v Speaker 3>but you'll cut that closed down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole scientific project.</v>

1043
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:02.380
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only do they not want to look at the</v>

1044
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:07.381
<v Speaker 3>data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll want more data collected that </v>

1045
00:58:07.381 --> 00:58:07.381
<v Speaker 3>might contradict their standard.</v>

1046
00:58:07.381 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating that someone would </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually call for them because this </v>

1047
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 4>isn't even their study of their field of</v>
<v Speaker 4>study.</v>

1048
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're dealing with physical evidence</v>

1049
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:19.600
<v Speaker 4>that they're saying is nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is not something they study in </v>

1050
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:23.051
<v Speaker 4>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's this void that we're looking </v>

1051
00:58:23.051 --> 00:58:25.841
<v Speaker 4>at here in these images.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you explain to people that are just </v>

1052
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:25.841
<v Speaker 4>listening what we're seeing?</v>

1053
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're seeing is they call it a </v>

1054
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:29.820
<v Speaker 3>hidden chamber there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can see how it's parallel to the</v>

1055
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 3>grand gallery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The grand galleries is huge gallery that</v>

1056
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:36.030
<v Speaker 3>goes up to the king's chamber and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>great pyramid</v>

1057
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:41.060
<v Speaker 4>and that's deep in the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pyramid in chambers above bobbitt</v>

1058
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.930
<v Speaker 3>parallel shit is maybe close to the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>size of it.</v>

1059
00:58:44.931 --> 00:58:47.660
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell with until it gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>prob,</v>

1060
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:52.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to dro into it and maybe put </v>

1061
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:52.700
<v Speaker 3>a camera in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen the raw data.</v>

1062
00:58:52.701 --> 00:58:57.701
<v Speaker 3>My point is I've seen the raw data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly think it's important they're</v>

1063
00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:02.060
<v Speaker 3>interpreting it correctly now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The proof will be in the pudding as they</v>

1064
00:59:02.061 --> 00:59:05.600
<v Speaker 3>say if they ever entered or at least put</v>
<v Speaker 3>a probe into it,</v>

1065
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:10.930
<v Speaker 3>but my point right now is to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismiss the data is nonsense to call for</v>

1066
00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:16.361
<v Speaker 3>the whole project to be shut down is non</v>
<v Speaker 3>client project and some of the Egypt </v>

1067
00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Egypt in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tologist.</v>

1068
00:59:18.891 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm close close to the ministry and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>point</v>

1069
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 2>is they've done the same thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>

1070
00:59:24.381 --> 00:59:29.381
<v Speaker 2>when we did seismic work and we found </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chamber under the left pog this </v>

1071
00:59:29.381 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 2>sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's never been explored since,</v>

1072
00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 2>at least not to my knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just dismiss it and say,</v>

1073
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 2>we know there's nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1074
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.440
<v Speaker 2>and that was despite the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>also found the chamber at the rump of </v>

1075
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 2>the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't know about the time,</v>

1076
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:46.811
<v Speaker 2>but they already knew about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it confirmed that our data was good </v>

1077
00:59:46.811 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 2>because we were finding something they </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew about,</v>

1078
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:53.260
<v Speaker 2>but when we find something that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know about and they don't want to </v>

1079
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 2>be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dismiss it and don't want to pursue</v>

1080
00:59:55.971 --> 01:00:00.971
<v Speaker 2>it further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have explored one of those </v>

1081
01:00:00.971 --> 01:00:00.971
<v Speaker 2>chambers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1082
01:00:00.971 --> 01:00:00.971
<v Speaker 2>Instead they explore the one that's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rump.</v>

1083
01:00:00.971 --> 01:00:01.790
<v Speaker 2>The one in the rump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1084
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:04.220
<v Speaker 2>The one in the rump by it turns out they</v>
<v Speaker 2>already knew about it.</v>

1085
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:09.340
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not super significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably is just maybe a greco roman </v>

1086
01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 2>or late period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1087
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.960
<v Speaker 2>burial or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some kind of excavation.</v>

1088
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:18.310
<v Speaker 2>The one I believe is important is under </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left palm,</v>

1089
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.320
<v Speaker 2>the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I believe is a archive actually </v>

1090
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.641
<v Speaker 2>may go back to this very early period </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we now have hieroglyphic </v>

1091
01:00:27.641 --> 01:00:31.570
<v Speaker 2>evidence indicating that what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the evidence indicates it's an </v>

1092
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:31.570
<v Speaker 2>archive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1093
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 2>So recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this gets back to,</v>

1094
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sphinx?</v>

1095
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.480
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1096
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Speaker 2>So we started this portion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion with the sphinx in my initial</v>

1097
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:46.361
<v Speaker 2>observations of the spanx and one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>observations was that there's something </v>

1098
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 2>going on with the weathering and erosion</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the sphinx.</v>

1099
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:55.750
<v Speaker 2>The second observation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is within the first two minutes at </v>

1100
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:59.591
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that the head is too small for the </v>

1101
01:00:59.591 --> 01:01:02.231
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The head is not eroded the way the core </v>

1102
01:01:02.231 --> 01:01:02.231
<v Speaker 2>body is.</v>

1103
01:01:02.231 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not erode the way the walls at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sphinx enclosure or it's not the </v>

1104
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.400
<v Speaker 2>original head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say it this way,</v>

1105
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:13.430
<v Speaker 2>but I knew immediately that was not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original head,</v>

1106
01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.660
<v Speaker 2>just from a geological point of view and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's now since been fully </v>

1107
01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.750
<v Speaker 2>confirmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is not the original head.</v>

1108
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:25.460
<v Speaker 2>It wAs a recurved head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for a long time the question has been</v>

1109
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.690
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we talk about this event,</v>

1110
01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:32.691
<v Speaker 2>I'm mystery of the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the original head of the </v>

1111
01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:32.691
<v Speaker 2>sphinx?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the sphinx?</v>

1112
01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:37.211
<v Speaker 2>Originally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've speculated and other people </v>

1113
01:01:37.211 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 2>speculate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My have been a lion,</v>

1114
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.930
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leo,</v>

1115
01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:43.490
<v Speaker 2>because it faces on the equinox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constellation,</v>

1116
01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:47.660
<v Speaker 2>leo in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not today,</v>

1117
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>but 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>bc or so,</v>

1118
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.660
<v Speaker 2>more or less at the very end of the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>ice age.</v>

1119
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Now I've had a lot of colleagues of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>

1120
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>academic colleagues say that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1121
01:01:58.551 --> 01:02:03.551
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean anything because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't even recognizing the </v>

1122
01:02:03.551 --> 01:02:03.990
<v Speaker 2>constellations back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1123
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 2>we now have plenty of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least some of the constellations that</v>

1124
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 2>we recognize today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A leo,</v>

1125
01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I would put in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tourist is in that category.</v>

1126
01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ryan is in that core category.</v>

1127
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have evidence</v>

1128
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.750
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ones I just mentioned,</v>

1129
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1130
01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:25.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1131
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 3>these are constellations that go back </v>
<v Speaker 3>well into the end of the last ice age.</v>

1132
01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:34.191
<v Speaker 3>We have documents of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have mammoth bones where you have a </v>

1133
01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:36.450
<v Speaker 3>ryan carved on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have tourists shown in cave walls.</v>

1134
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 3>We have leo shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's to me,</v>

1135
01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>constellations that we recognize today,</v>

1136
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.170
<v Speaker 3>we're recognized tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1137
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:51.171
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's not nonsense that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>carved a structure 10,000</v>

1138
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:55.590
<v Speaker 3>bc approximately that was facing its own</v>
<v Speaker 3>image in the sky.</v>

1139
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 3>So one suggestion was that maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>leo,</v>

1140
01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 3>but recently manu safe today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dr.</v>

1141
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Mondo saves a day and another colleague </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mine,</v>

1142
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 3>he recognized initially that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>title,</v>

1143
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:14.631
<v Speaker 3>what's known as a dual title in dynastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egypt that goes back to the fourth </v>

1144
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:21.861
<v Speaker 3>dynasty and even back to the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynasty with the earliest writing and it</v>

1145
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.860
<v Speaker 3>when properly translate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it basically refers to the sphinx as the</v>

1146
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:33.651
<v Speaker 3>guardian up an archive and not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sphinx is we think of it as a lion with </v>

1147
01:03:34.171 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 3>a human head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as a lioness.</v>

1148
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:42.530
<v Speaker 3>And there was a name for this line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this method she was the goddess met hit </v>

1149
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:45.330
<v Speaker 3>who guarded archive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1150
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:48.570
<v Speaker 3>and we wrote a paper on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I say we,</v>

1151
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 3>my new safe day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and robert duvall,</v>

1152
01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:54.570
<v Speaker 3>who you may know us from a ryan </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation,</v>

1153
01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.210
<v Speaker 3>some of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his work ties in with this,</v>

1154
01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.600
<v Speaker 3>the rko astronomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we've now found that there is this </v>

1155
01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.490
<v Speaker 3>sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we named the jaw signed and honor.</v>

1156
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under John Anthony West.</v>

1157
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

1158
01:04:09.481 --> 01:04:12.210
<v Speaker 3>There's the jaw sign and what you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1159
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a lioness met hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the sphinx originally based on</v>

1160
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:21.891
<v Speaker 3>our reconstruction and interpretation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and can't go into all the details.</v>

1161
01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Now you can actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can read the paper.</v>

1162
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 3>If I could put a plug in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people go to my website,</v>

1163
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:32.870
<v Speaker 3>www dot robert schoch and that's r o b e</v>
<v Speaker 3>r t r o b e r t s c h o c h.</v>

1164
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.670
<v Speaker 3>The main thing is my name is spelled s c</v>
<v Speaker 3>h o c h,</v>

1165
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 3>so www dot robert [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can go.</v>

1166
01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I did a popular summary of the paper and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can also go and download the </v>

1167
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:53.541
<v Speaker 3>original paper and the peer reviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>journal archeological discovery where we</v>

1168
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:58.470
<v Speaker 3>argue that what we have here is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>line has met him.</v>

1169
01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.250
<v Speaker 3>She has what looks like a bent rod </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out of her back.</v>

1170
01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Then people look at the actual image and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then aBove it is a aCts.</v>

1171
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.760
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1172
01:05:10.761 --> 01:05:13.740
<v Speaker 3>it's a primitive acts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1173
01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:18.770
<v Speaker 3>when I say primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even for the ancient egyptians in </v>

1174
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:22.050
<v Speaker 3>dynastic Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would have been sort of a symbolIc </v>

1175
01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:24.631
<v Speaker 3>acts if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a sign of someone who was in </v>

1176
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:29.290
<v Speaker 3>charge of things you oversee or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of thing that bent rod.</v>

1177
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a primitive key.</v>

1178
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.720
<v Speaker 3>We would now call the primitive key,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it represents a key and so it's </v>

1179
01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.780
<v Speaker 3>basically saying that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guardian of the archives have met,</v>

1180
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:45.781
<v Speaker 3>hit the locked chamber or vault of </v>
<v Speaker 3>method and we also have images.</v>

1181
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I see it up on the board now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at,</v>

1182
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:55.170
<v Speaker 3>you've got the linus with the key and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you also have a line not in that image </v>

1183
01:05:55.511 --> 01:05:59.650
<v Speaker 3>by different image that we had before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at that,</v>

1184
01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:04.651
<v Speaker 3>can you see how there's a linus a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagrammatic shape over what looks like </v>

1185
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.140
<v Speaker 3>a facade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1186
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:16.141
<v Speaker 3>If you then go to the stella that sits </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the paws of this finks,</v>

1187
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:24.480
<v Speaker 3>you have the same image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more artistically rendered of the </v>

1188
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 3>sphinx sitting over a facade over what </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like a building.</v>

1189
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not really a building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the archive underneath.</v>

1190
01:06:31.031 --> 01:06:36.031
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I know there's something </v>

1191
01:06:36.031 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 3>underneath because long ago in the early</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 nineties,</v>

1192
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:43.411
<v Speaker 3>thomas to becky and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we did seismic work around the </v>

1193
01:06:43.411 --> 01:06:46.861
<v Speaker 3>sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found the chamber under the paws of </v>

1194
01:06:46.861 --> 01:06:49.690
<v Speaker 3>the sphinx and it's I'm sure an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial chamber.</v>

1195
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.840
<v Speaker 3>It's very regular and this I believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>could well be.</v>

1196
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm hypothesizing and in science we make</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis that are testable.</v>

1197
01:06:59.861 --> 01:07:03.460
<v Speaker 3>This is perfectly testable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All we have to do is enter that chamber.</v>

1198
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:08.580
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's just to put fiber optic </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and we can see is it an artificial </v>

1199
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:14.041
<v Speaker 3>chamber that's an archive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully there's still things there or </v>

1200
01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was gutted and cleaned out at </v>
<v Speaker 3>some point,</v>

1201
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:21.060
<v Speaker 3>but here we have the seismic work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the seismic maps,</v>

1202
01:07:21.251 --> 01:07:26.251
<v Speaker 3>I'll call it to a data and what's label </v>
<v Speaker 3>is normally a under the left paw that is</v>

1203
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:34.921
<v Speaker 3>the chamber we found under the left paw </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the egyptologists have to deny ever</v>

1204
01:07:34.961 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 3>since and they don't want to explore it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we haven't gotten permission.</v>

1205
01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:41.950
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1206
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is.</v>

1207
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 3>If there's physical evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is politics in Egypt.</v>

1208
01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.110
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so squirrely.</v>

1209
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1210
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.350
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1211
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:54.520
<v Speaker 3>this is 1991 or so early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen nineties.</v>

1212
01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.850
<v Speaker 3>As of last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2017.</v>

1213
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
<v Speaker 3>We have textual evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient hieroglyphs talking about this </v>

1214
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.621
<v Speaker 3>chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this finks talking about </v>

1215
01:08:07.621 --> 01:08:08.740
<v Speaker 3>the sphinx being alignness guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chamber,</v>

1216
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:13.920
<v Speaker 3>and I want to point out that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earliest hieroglyphs that we have that </v>

1217
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.311
<v Speaker 3>refer to this are about 30 3030 100 bc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hundreds of years before the </v>

1218
01:08:18.651 --> 01:08:23.651
<v Speaker 3>egyptologists claim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sphinx was even thought about being </v>

1219
01:08:23.651 --> 01:08:24.550
<v Speaker 3>carved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is somewhere around 2,500</v>

1220
01:08:24.551 --> 01:08:25.030
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

1221
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.510
<v Speaker 3>500 bc back sides with the construction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The great pyramid of giza.</v>

1222
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's another question.</v>

1223
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll come back to that because I </v>

1224
01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:36.010
<v Speaker 3>don't buy the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more.</v>

1225
01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Can we come back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1226
01:08:36.541 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1227
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.690
<v Speaker 3>So the age of tall just claimed that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sphinx was first car of 2,500</v>

1228
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:44.570
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet there's no mention of the carving of</v>

1229
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:47.260
<v Speaker 3>the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they cite the inventory,</v>

1230
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:48.420
<v Speaker 3>not inventory stella.</v>

1231
01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:52.220
<v Speaker 3>That's another step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cite the top most of fourth dream.</v>

1232
01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Stella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a thousand plus years later,</v>

1233
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.350
<v Speaker 3>which had one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a partial cartoon of kafra,</v>

1234
01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.140
<v Speaker 3>partial cartouche of coffer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has since flaked away,</v>

1235
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:08.170
<v Speaker 3>was there reputedly in the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were drawings of it,</v>

1236
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:12.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we to put in our plugin,</v>

1237
01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:15.140
<v Speaker 3>just if people are interested in gaining</v>
<v Speaker 3>more information.</v>

1238
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Robert duvall and I wrote a book last </v>
<v Speaker 3>year published last year called origins </v>

1239
01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:24.371
<v Speaker 3>of the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we discuss a lot of this but met </v>

1240
01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 3>hit is a more recent discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1241
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.070
<v Speaker 3>so there was a partial cartouche of </v>
<v Speaker 3>kafra,</v>

1242
01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.150
<v Speaker 3>which egyptologists said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aha,</v>

1243
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:34.520
<v Speaker 3>this proves that kafra carved the sphinx</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the sphinx,</v>

1244
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Speaker 3>it's due east of crawford pyramid coffer</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the pharaoh and 2,500</v>

1245
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore the Sphinx must be 2,500</v>

1246
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:44.960
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I contend,</v>

1247
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.120
<v Speaker 3>and robert duvall and other people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in our line of thinking content that</v>

1248
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 3>this stella that's over a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands,</v>

1249
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over a thousand years later,</v>

1250
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:59.000
<v Speaker 3>does not say that it carved.</v>

1251
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:04.390
<v Speaker 3>He carved the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that he restored the sphinx just </v>

1252
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:07.640
<v Speaker 3>like most moses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fourth who was putting up the stella</v>

1253
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 3>was restoring the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at the sphinx,</v>

1254
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.600
<v Speaker 3>it has been restored numerous times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including blocks of limestone that were </v>

1255
01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:22.601
<v Speaker 3>put onto it to restore some of the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient weathering that when I asked sy </v>

1256
01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.550
<v Speaker 3>hawala,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while my biggest critics,</v>

1257
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:29.900
<v Speaker 3>how old those blocks are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said they were fourth dynasty.</v>

1258
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you restored in the fourth </v>

1259
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:35.500
<v Speaker 3>dynasty when it had just been built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1260
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.941
<v Speaker 3>literally a century or two ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to restore a meter worth </v>

1261
01:10:39.941 --> 01:10:40.090
<v Speaker 3>of weathering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1262
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his answer,</v>

1263
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:46.391
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not trying to make fun of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's rotten rock that wasn't </v>

1264
01:10:46.391 --> 01:10:48.260
<v Speaker 3>very high quality rocks was how somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just crumbled away,</v>

1265
01:10:48.261 --> 01:10:49.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meter or so,</v>

1266
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.500
<v Speaker 3>a couple of hundred years.</v>

1267
01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Graham hancock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1268
01:10:52.641 --> 01:10:54.880
<v Speaker 3>But that's another issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want get into that.</v>

1269
01:10:54.881 --> 01:10:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BeCause,</v>

1270
01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just say it this way,</v>

1271
01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.430
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1272
01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:01.730
<v Speaker 3>there was not just science going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1273
01:11:01.731 --> 01:11:04.010
<v Speaker 3>there was politics going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1274
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on.</v>

1275
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1276
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:13.361
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it too and I've known all </v>

1277
01:11:13.361 --> 01:11:13.361
<v Speaker 3>these people for a very frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>

1278
01:11:13.361 --> 01:11:17.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm trying to keep just to the </v>

1279
01:11:17.711 --> 01:11:19.851
<v Speaker 3>science right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so he himself admits that some of </v>

1280
01:11:20.611 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 3>these repairs go BaCk well over 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1281
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 3>which makes no sense if it's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>4,500</v>

1282
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:31.050
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

1283
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.080
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they've always contended there was </v>

1284
01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.481
<v Speaker 3>no inscriptions or anything really </v>
<v Speaker 3>referring to the sphinx until new </v>

1285
01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 3>kingdom times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We point out in origins at the sphinx,</v>

1286
01:11:41.851 --> 01:11:46.851
<v Speaker 3>robert paval night that no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to know what they were calling </v>

1287
01:11:46.851 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 3>the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now with matt hit,</v>

1288
01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 3>we have inscriptions.</v>

1289
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:51.120
<v Speaker 3>They find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when did they find this lioness.</v>

1290
01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:54.030
<v Speaker 3>And when do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're saying this is very recent.</v>

1291
01:11:54.031 --> 01:11:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manu saves the day.</v>

1292
01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 3>My coauthor just discovered that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1293
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly when he found the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inscription,</v>

1294
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:10.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he first pointed it out to robert </v>

1295
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.060
<v Speaker 3>duvall myself about a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year ago,</v>

1296
01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:16.050
<v Speaker 3>and we all worked on it and confirmed it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put together the pieces.</v>

1297
01:12:16.051 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really gets the most credit for it.</v>

1298
01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1299
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:24.010
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows his heart gliffy really where </v>

1300
01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:24.740
<v Speaker 3>they find this higher glyphic of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1301
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's shoWn in several different,</v>

1302
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1303
01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 3>ancient artifacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>

1304
01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:36.470
<v Speaker 3>there is a statue of vca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1305
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.560
<v Speaker 3>from the fourth dynasty who may have </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually overseeing the construction of </v>

1306
01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:45.720
<v Speaker 3>the great pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I would say the reconstruction of the</v>

1307
01:12:45.721 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 3>great pyramid because I might get back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

1308
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:53.150
<v Speaker 3>I think the peer at great pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the sphinx was being </v>

1309
01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:54.660
<v Speaker 3>reconstructed refurbished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you would,</v>

1310
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.840
<v Speaker 3>during the old kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not constructed de novo,</v>

1311
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.850
<v Speaker 3>but he was overseeing that he must have </v>
<v Speaker 3>had something to do with the sphinx.</v>

1312
01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was apparently the,</v>

1313
01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given the title of being the overseer </v>

1314
01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.890
<v Speaker 3>for the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing,</v>

1315
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.210
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out this title was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something he had in cuckoo's time,</v>

1316
01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:18.930
<v Speaker 3>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1317
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.500
<v Speaker 3>the pharaoh before supposedly when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sinks is built to begin with.</v>

1318
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:25.380
<v Speaker 3>So that messes up the Egypt logical </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking right there.</v>

1319
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this title was something that had </v>

1320
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:33.051
<v Speaker 3>been held by others before him back down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to about 31 or so hundred bc,</v>

1321
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:36.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>

1322
01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:36.930
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1323
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:40.950
<v Speaker 3>500 or more years before the swings was </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly built.</v>

1324
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:47.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now we hAve this hieroglyphic text </v>

1325
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:49.920
<v Speaker 3>that goes back refutes what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptologist are saying,</v>

1326
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.040
<v Speaker 3>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at the way they wrIte </v>

1327
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:55.940
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the earliest writing,</v>

1328
01:13:55.941 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 3>so it's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have anything earlier.</v>

1329
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe eventually we'll find earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1330
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 3>the precursors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are also in the context,</v>

1331
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:11.210
<v Speaker 3>it seems abundantly evident they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>referring to it as a very old structure.</v>

1332
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now how do egyptologists receive this?</v>

1333
01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just making its way into the Egypt </v>

1334
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>logical community if we will see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they received.</v>

1335
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:24.880
<v Speaker 2>So far there's been no reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1336
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:26.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just put it that way.</v>

1337
01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I know officially.</v>

1338
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen it all before.</v>

1339
01:14:30.301 --> 01:14:35.301
<v Speaker 2>So I've seen it all before and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a classic thing to that in some </v>

1340
01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:36.540
<v Speaker 2>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll,</v>

1341
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it related to the sphinx and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe hopefully somewhat analogous.</v>

1342
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I pointed out decades should go and John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony West and I working on this,</v>

1343
01:14:50.601 --> 01:14:55.601
<v Speaker 2>that this finks the head is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original head and I'm not sure if I'm </v>

1344
01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 2>the very first one to ever say that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to try to take credit,</v>

1345
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 2>but it was quite obvious to me when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>

1346
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:06.900
<v Speaker 2>without anyone saying that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had not heard that someone else </v>

1347
01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 2>suggested that since then egyptologist </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1348
01:15:09.971 --> 01:15:14.971
<v Speaker 2>of course out ever citing me or John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony West have also been suggesting </v>

1349
01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:20.311
<v Speaker 2>that in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some have suggested that maybe it </v>

1350
01:15:20.311 --> 01:15:23.611
<v Speaker 2>was [inaudible] face on the sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than coffers face after we </v>

1351
01:15:23.611 --> 01:15:28.501
<v Speaker 2>brought in frank domingo who demonstrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not coppers face a frank domingo,</v>

1352
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 2>if you remember from mystery of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sphinx,</v>

1353
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:35.401
<v Speaker 2>was a New York city police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forensic expert who literally would </v>

1354
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 2>reconstruct faces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compare faces that was his business.</v>

1355
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 2>And To present it in court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1356
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 2>he analyzed the face of the Sphinx in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of kafir,</v>

1357
01:15:45.761 --> 01:15:50.761
<v Speaker 2>also known as schaeffer on the pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The egyptologists before our time,</v>

1358
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:55.210
<v Speaker 2>before we got involved in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always said these were the same faces to</v>

1359
01:15:55.211 --> 01:15:57.140
<v Speaker 2>face of the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The face of copper,</v>

1360
01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:02.430
<v Speaker 2>a frank domingo came out very </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitively that they're not the same </v>

1361
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:06.691
<v Speaker 2>face and they're both competent artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not frankly the same ethnicity </v>

1362
01:16:06.691 --> 01:16:07.960
<v Speaker 2>of face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1363
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:13.320
<v Speaker 2>and for mark laner to publish in </v>
<v Speaker 2>national geographic that I'll </v>

1364
01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.671
<v Speaker 2>paraphrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the sphinx came alive when he </v>

1365
01:16:17.671 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 2>reconstructed with the face of chef ron </v>
<v Speaker 2>or face of conference just,</v>

1366
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.880
<v Speaker 2>that's not science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1367
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1368
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:29.830
<v Speaker 2>wish fulfillment or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted it to be the face of a certain</v>

1369
01:16:29.831 --> 01:16:34.650
<v Speaker 2>pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does computer construction with it,</v>

1370
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>having the face of the pharaoh he wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be.</v>

1371
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:41.860
<v Speaker 2>And then past the ad off is somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1372
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I guess science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no egyptologist not </v>

1373
01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:48.610
<v Speaker 2>necessarily science either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that a nasty way,</v>

1374
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:51.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's an important point because </v>
<v Speaker 2>egyptology,</v>

1375
01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:56.941
<v Speaker 2>a lot of egyptologists classically come </v>
<v Speaker 2>more from a art history background,</v>

1376
01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:03.330
<v Speaker 2>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tying in with the question you asked </v>

1377
01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:03.400
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally.</v>

1378
01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:05.530
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>

1379
01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:10.531
<v Speaker 2>when I was in graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a seminar in sciences</v>

1380
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:12.770
<v Speaker 3>and other disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1381
01:17:12.771 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 3>this was because I was being trained as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a scientist and one of the papers we had</v>

1382
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:22.451
<v Speaker 3>to read at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was long before I ever thought </v>

1383
01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:25.721
<v Speaker 3>about going to Egypt was how </v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptologists are resistant to </v>

1384
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:31.421
<v Speaker 3>scientific information and scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>data and how to help try to overcome </v>

1385
01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:37.961
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're working with egyptologist </v>

1386
01:17:37.961 --> 01:17:39.870
<v Speaker 3>basically what's the answer was it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult and it's not to put them </v>

1387
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:43.110
<v Speaker 3>down because I have lots of colleagues </v>
<v Speaker 3>and other fields that are not sciences,</v>

1388
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:48.440
<v Speaker 3>but classically I would contend </v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptology is not a science.</v>

1389
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:52.520
<v Speaker 3>It comes more from art history or from </v>
<v Speaker 3>linguistic studies,</v>

1390
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:54.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>translating hieroglyphs,</v>

1391
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>historical studies and those are all </v>

1392
01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.901
<v Speaker 3>very important academic studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you do sometimes get people in a </v>

1393
01:18:01.901 --> 01:18:05.600
<v Speaker 3>certain field and they're resistant to </v>
<v Speaker 3>outsiders from another field,</v>

1394
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:10.630
<v Speaker 3>especially when they think it's a field </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so far apart and so diverse from </v>

1395
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 3>what they understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they know,</v>

1396
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:15.140
<v Speaker 3>their own mindset.</v>

1397
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their mindset is not geared towards </v>

1398
01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:20.560
<v Speaker 1>scientific data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not.</v>

1399
01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be nasty,</v>

1400
01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:23.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just have to explain yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1401
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you're not coming across nasdaq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you initially saw these erosion </v>

1402
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:34.421
<v Speaker 1>features and and you the first 30 to 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds or whatever,</v>

1403
01:18:35.091 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you said it was 120 seconds when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>first looked at it and new,</v>

1404
01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:44.260
<v Speaker 1>did you have any idea that your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>would take the turn that it's taken?</v>

1405
01:18:44.591 --> 01:18:49.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have any indication thrown into </v>

1406
01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 1>such a shit storm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these years later?</v>

1407
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 1>We are in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still fighting the good fight.</v>

1408
01:18:53.781 --> 01:18:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I know as John Anthony West one said </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing me.</v>

1409
01:18:56.981 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ruined.</v>

1410
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:03.430
<v Speaker 1>He ruined my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five years later after that </v>

1411
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still swinging.</v>

1412
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1413
01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm still getting attacked and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

1414
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.520
<v Speaker 3>The answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was naive.</v>

1415
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:15.521
<v Speaker 3>I was incredibly naive at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still was not that far out of graduate</v>

1416
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:17.900
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

1417
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.290
<v Speaker 1>You thought you could just present?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Stand on its own and just present the </v>
<v Speaker 1>said man,</v>

1419
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:25.760
<v Speaker 1>what a great new discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1420
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.130
<v Speaker 1>That was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was so naive</v>

1421
01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:33.420
<v Speaker 3>and so we first present the evidence at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the geological society of America annual</v>

1422
01:19:33.421 --> 01:19:36.750
<v Speaker 3>meeting in 1991,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was.</v>

1423
01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1991,</v>

1424
01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:43.350
<v Speaker 3>and I want to say bluntly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of geologists,</v>

1425
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:44.790
<v Speaker 3>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally thought,</v>

1426
01:19:44.791 --> 01:19:46.080
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>

1427
01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.280
<v Speaker 3>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made,</v>

1428
01:19:47.281 --> 01:19:49.770
<v Speaker 3>started making some headlines around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1429
01:19:49.771 --> 01:19:54.771
<v Speaker 3>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were one or two geologists there </v>

1430
01:19:54.771 --> 01:19:59.151
<v Speaker 3>that turns out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turns out we're working for </v>

1431
01:19:59.151 --> 01:20:02.750
<v Speaker 3>egyptologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't think this was so great </v>

1432
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.481
<v Speaker 3>because they saw the implications for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Egypt illogical colleagues and they </v>

1433
01:20:05.481 --> 01:20:05.610
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1434
01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 3>a little rumbling there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the journalists come in back then </v>

1435
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 3>you'll know internet like we have it </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1436
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:16.340
<v Speaker 3>just phones and the journalists start </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling egyptologists that we're not </v>

1437
01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.820
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had not seen the data,</v>

1438
01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:22.860
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immediately they were telling the </v>

1439
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.191
<v Speaker 3>journalists at this has to all be </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense that hundreds of egyptologists </v>

1440
01:20:25.191 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 3>have studied this for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1441
01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:29.880
<v Speaker 3>two or three centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is total nonsense.</v>

1442
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.880
<v Speaker 3>It turns out I knew every egyptologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're so few that have </v>

1443
01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.460
<v Speaker 3>actually stayed the sphinx personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surely just to.</v>

1444
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1445
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:44.310
<v Speaker 3>they were just trying to dismiss it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the egyptologists come back and say</v>

1446
01:20:44.311 --> 01:20:47.190
<v Speaker 3>we know this is nonsense essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

1447
01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:52.340
<v Speaker 3>we know that the pyramids were not built</v>
<v Speaker 3>by aliens so they start bringing aliens </v>

1448
01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 3>and you have photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So essentIally just to dismiss,</v>

1449
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:58.010
<v Speaker 3>dismiss me and I wasn't talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>total straw.</v>

1450
01:20:58.090 --> 01:21:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't talking about pyramids,</v>

1451
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:02.610
<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could talk about that if you want to.</v>

1452
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.520
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't talking about aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hadn't been there,</v>

1453
01:21:05.521 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 3>they hadn't seen the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so bizarre in hindsight.</v>

1454
01:21:10.381 --> 01:21:15.381
<v Speaker 3>And I'm so frustrated trying to defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>their positions and they were just,</v>

1455
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:20.760
<v Speaker 3>they were really just attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in Egypt at one point they were</v>

1456
01:21:20.761 --> 01:21:23.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting things in the arabic press.</v>

1457
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Little did they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that would read it to me </v>

1458
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:30.750
<v Speaker 3>and they were saying that I wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>a faculty member at boston university,</v>

1459
01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:33.390
<v Speaker 3>which is outright lie since I had just </v>
<v Speaker 3>been tenured.</v>

1460
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:36.600
<v Speaker 3>So there Was no doubt I was a faculty </v>
<v Speaker 3>member there.</v>

1461
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:41.601
<v Speaker 3>But this was other academic saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they never thought we'd get back to </v>

1462
01:21:41.601 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean really,</v>

1463
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 3>really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nasty,</v>

1464
01:21:44.690 --> 01:21:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm so game back to the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they set up in,</v>

1465
01:21:48.691 --> 01:21:51.660
<v Speaker 3>this was I think unprecedented within </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1466
01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:56.661
<v Speaker 3>They'd set up this debate at the triple </v>
<v Speaker 3>a s american association for the </v>

1467
01:21:56.661 --> 01:21:58.830
<v Speaker 3>advancement of science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought again,</v>

1468
01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I was so naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

1469
01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:02.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is wonderful.</v>

1470
01:22:02.191 --> 01:22:07.191
<v Speaker 3>Fine though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll get rid of all this nonsense in </v>

1471
01:22:07.191 --> 01:22:09.601
<v Speaker 3>this name calling and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff in the popular press that no </v>

1472
01:22:09.601 --> 01:22:10.950
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't blame them.</v>

1473
01:22:10.951 --> 01:22:15.951
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily and will really get the </v>

1474
01:22:15.951 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 3>evidence out and we'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss it.</v>

1475
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanely and objectively turns out that </v>

1476
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:24.270
<v Speaker 3>wasn't the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just from my perspective,</v>

1477
01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:28.800
<v Speaker 3>they were just calling me more names and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to set up straw men.</v>

1478
01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:28.950
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1479
01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:32.540
<v Speaker 4>is this the egyptologist who was in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary who dismissed everything was</v>

1480
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.120
<v Speaker 4>still around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1481
01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:36.910
<v Speaker 4>And has he amended his position at all?</v>

1482
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Not to my knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't spoken with him for years and </v>

1483
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:46.840
<v Speaker 3>years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did yoU ever speak with them off the </v>

1484
01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:46.940
<v Speaker 3>record personally alone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

1485
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1486
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:50.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't say was off the record.</v>

1487
01:22:50.631 --> 01:22:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess was off the record.</v>

1488
01:22:52.161 --> 01:22:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would have said this </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1489
01:22:53.781 --> 01:22:57.560
<v Speaker 3>but I'll say it now at that debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that debate,</v>

1490
01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.050
<v Speaker 3>aaa's debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1491
01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I just suddenly found myself in the hall</v>
<v Speaker 3>with him and there was no one else </v>

1492
01:23:05.741 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 3>around so he could totally deny this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's true.</v>

1493
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.850
<v Speaker 3>My perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least he,</v>

1494
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:15.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said something to me like,</v>

1495
01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:16.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really believe this.</v>

1496
01:23:16.901 --> 01:23:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just want to be on television and,</v>

1497
01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:24.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be famous or something like that.</v>

1498
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1499
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:28.630
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do believe it.</v>

1500
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really go by the evidence and I do </v>

1501
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:33.720
<v Speaker 3>think the evidence says this.</v>

1502
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.540
<v Speaker 3>And he served.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me that,</v>

1503
01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:35.290
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1504
01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1505
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I analyze what the sizing you.</v>

1506
01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1507
01:23:40.931 --> 01:23:43.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he lead in and then,</v>

1508
01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:48.331
<v Speaker 3>and then what he does is he starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking me a question of some detailed </v>

1509
01:23:48.331 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 3>question about the geology and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case,</v>

1510
01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:54.820
<v Speaker 3>how can such and such and I think in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hindsight might have been fed to them by</v>

1511
01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:59.821
<v Speaker 3>some geo archeologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They called someone who does archeology </v>

1512
01:23:59.821 --> 01:24:02.020
<v Speaker 3>but knows a little geology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1513
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:07.260
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realize in hindsight it was meant to </v>

1514
01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.071
<v Speaker 3>be one of those gotcha questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they say nowadays where I </v>

1515
01:24:11.071 --> 01:24:11.620
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be able to answer it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

1516
01:24:11.621 --> 01:24:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I'd thought about it.</v>

1517
01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.520
<v Speaker 3>It was to me as a geologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very obvious.</v>

1518
01:24:15.521 --> 01:24:20.521
<v Speaker 3>So I start giving him this detailed </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation as to why that's not the </v>

1519
01:24:20.521 --> 01:24:20.610
<v Speaker 3>case and why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1520
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.270
<v Speaker 3>my evidence stands up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1521
01:24:22.271 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're standing there face to face.</v>

1522
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:31.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm explained this to him and I see his </v>
<v Speaker 3>face turn and it goes blank and I'm in </v>

1523
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:34.480
<v Speaker 3>midsentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just turns around and walks away.</v>

1524
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:35.770
<v Speaker 3>He's the one</v>

1525
01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.330
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't refuse,</v>

1526
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 3>can refute what I was saying and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't really answered.</v>

1527
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:47.430
<v Speaker 3>My takeaway is that he wasn't interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in discussing it rationally or aunts,</v>

1528
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just went to,</v>

1529
01:24:50.141 --> 01:24:52.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the debate or whatever,</v>

1530
01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:52.980
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

1531
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he knew that he</v>

1532
01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:57.550
<v Speaker 3>wasn't going to with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just got out of there.</v>

1533
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1534
01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.540
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1535
01:24:59.550 --> 01:25:01.300
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a personal thing.</v>

1536
01:25:01.301 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 3>There was no other witnesses to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of this,</v>

1537
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 3>but if he had really wanted to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1538
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:08.800
<v Speaker 3>I was willing to discuss it with them</v>

1539
01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.840
<v Speaker 4>and it's so disturbing that someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>would put their own egos so far above </v>

1540
01:25:15.451 --> 01:25:20.451
<v Speaker 4>the information that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed to scholars and people and </v>

1541
01:25:20.451 --> 01:25:21.960
<v Speaker 4>students and all these folks out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have questions about the history of</v>

1542
01:25:21.961 --> 01:25:26.961
<v Speaker 4>the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's someone would put their own </v>

1543
01:25:26.961 --> 01:25:28.620
<v Speaker 4>reputation and eagle above all of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not have the,</v>

1544
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:29.610
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1545
01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.980
<v Speaker 4>the mindset to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1546
01:25:31.981 --> 01:25:34.530
<v Speaker 4>we have new evidence and what we thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>of before.</v>

1547
01:25:34.531 --> 01:25:38.370
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have to apply to this new</v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence and create a new timeline.</v>

1548
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:41.480
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't dismiss all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they learned in the past.</v>

1549
01:25:41.481 --> 01:25:41.760
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1550
01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.800
<v Speaker 3>That's something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1551
01:25:42.801 --> 01:25:47.801
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you brought that up because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>long contended that people talk about </v>

1552
01:25:47.801 --> 01:25:48.410
<v Speaker 3>rewriting history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

1553
01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1554
01:25:49.291 --> 01:25:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I understand that argument and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>we do need to rewrite good chunks of our</v>

1555
01:25:53.551 --> 01:25:58.551
<v Speaker 3>very early history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never denied dynastic Egypt in </v>

1556
01:25:58.891 --> 01:26:03.891
<v Speaker 3>the basic chronology for dynastic agent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what I say that we've got a whole </v>

1557
01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:08.000
<v Speaker 3>new chapter to add to it going back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>time plus,</v>

1558
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:09.680
<v Speaker 3>and I won't mention the great pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1559
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:15.130
<v Speaker 3>plus things like the great pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the standard dating for the great </v>

1560
01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:16.040
<v Speaker 3>pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say 20 5:50</v>

1561
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:20.110
<v Speaker 3>bc or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pharaoh khufu also known as cheops.</v>

1562
01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Just in case people hear those terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't deny that he had something to do</v>

1563
01:26:26.001 --> 01:26:31.001
<v Speaker 3>with the great pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I study it geologically and I </v>

1564
01:26:31.001 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 3>don't want to get into great detail </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1565
01:26:31.431 --> 01:26:36.431
<v Speaker 3>When I study a geologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a older structure </v>

1566
01:26:36.431 --> 01:26:36.431
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1567
01:26:36.431 --> 01:26:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I think there was something else there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

1568
01:26:38.601 --> 01:26:43.601
<v Speaker 3>a subterranean chamber I suspect goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>back much earlier than the time of </v>

1569
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.790
<v Speaker 3>fourth dynasty khufu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>

1570
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:51.791
<v Speaker 3>to bring in robert [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has his awry in correlation of the </v>

1571
01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:52.640
<v Speaker 3>three pyramids to the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stars have a ryan,</v>

1572
01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.750
<v Speaker 3>which correlate very well at about </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,500</v>

1573
01:26:56.751 --> 01:27:01.751
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he'll talk and we talk about this in </v>

1574
01:27:01.751 --> 01:27:01.751
<v Speaker 3>our joint book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>origins of the sphinx,</v>

1575
01:27:01.751 --> 01:27:04.190
<v Speaker 3>how there was a master plan going back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that period.</v>

1576
01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.510
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1577
01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:10.511
<v Speaker 3>that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would they be following a master </v>

1578
01:27:10.511 --> 01:27:13.151
<v Speaker 3>plan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of years later when they </v>

1579
01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:13.151
<v Speaker 3>finally got around to building these </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>

1580
01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there were earlier markers are </v>

1581
01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.590
<v Speaker 3>structures at those spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pyramids in this case,</v>

1582
01:27:21.591 --> 01:27:26.591
<v Speaker 3>those three major pyramids were built </v>
<v Speaker 3>over or enhanced or restored older </v>

1583
01:27:26.811 --> 01:27:29.030
<v Speaker 3>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>

1584
01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.120
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the great pyramid is what I call </v>

1585
01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.091
<v Speaker 3>the sacred mound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually literally a stone </v>

1586
01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:40.370
<v Speaker 3>outcropping mound and John Paul move </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

1587
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:45.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm robert [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Older brother's actually architect </v>

1588
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:47.720
<v Speaker 3>robert paval himself was trained as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineer.</v>

1589
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:52.220
<v Speaker 3>They both make the point among are </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that if you're building the great</v>

1590
01:27:52.221 --> 01:27:57.221
<v Speaker 3>pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a humongous structure </v>

1591
01:27:57.221 --> 01:27:59.351
<v Speaker 3>with incredible way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's much easier to flatten the plateau </v>

1592
01:27:59.351 --> 01:28:00.400
<v Speaker 3>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1593
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:05.410
<v Speaker 3>nice level base rather than try to build</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and around a mound that's to this </v>

1594
01:28:06.921 --> 01:28:09.200
<v Speaker 3>day incorporate within the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramid.</v>

1595
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.680
<v Speaker 3>This takes a lot more energy and work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a much more difficult </v>

1596
01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 3>engineering feat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sense if you're.</v>

1597
01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:21.230
<v Speaker 3>You want to preserve that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was sacred to them or whatever.</v>

1598
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:26.410
<v Speaker 3>That older structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have images of the soldiers </v>

1599
01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:26.410
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1600
01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 3>you can't see it at this point because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally covered,</v>

1601
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:32.501
<v Speaker 3>but we have something very analogous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know you mentioned this when John </v>

1602
01:28:32.501 --> 01:28:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Anthony West was on the red pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is also built over an older structure </v>

1603
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:42.860
<v Speaker 3>and you can see that to this day in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the chambers where you have this much</v>

1604
01:28:42.861 --> 01:28:44.060
<v Speaker 3>older structure.</v>

1605
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:47.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking geologically now based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence.</v>

1606
01:28:47.331 --> 01:28:52.331
<v Speaker 3>Then we have some images there where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this older weathered structure,</v>

1607
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.640
<v Speaker 3>which I believe goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much older but </v>

1608
01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.761
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years old or let's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave it that and then they built the </v>

1609
01:29:00.761 --> 01:29:04.091
<v Speaker 3>pyramid over it and around it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think marketing it,</v>

1610
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:09.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refurbishing and much older structure </v>

1611
01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:09.860
<v Speaker 3>and you can tell by the weathering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff,</v>

1612
01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.660
<v Speaker 3>whether it's stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether constructed.</v>

1613
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see the sharp divide between</v>

1614
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:17.700
<v Speaker 3>the older structure and the newer </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

1615
01:29:17.701 --> 01:29:20.250
<v Speaker 3>which is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally cut stone.</v>

1616
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 3>And that newer structure goes back </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier than the great pyramid.</v>

1617
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:25.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is snefru.</v>

1618
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.570
<v Speaker 3>This is even earlier by a generation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1619
01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:34.670
<v Speaker 3>so you have this where they're using and</v>
<v Speaker 3>dynastic Egypt older structures there,</v>

1620
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 3>reappropriating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the case here.</v>

1621
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I believe you have that with the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramid.</v>

1622
01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 3>I believe you have to have that with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second pyramid.</v>

1623
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.550
<v Speaker 3>You have that with the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most definitely.</v>

1624
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:47.160
<v Speaker 3>And the valley temple and the sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 3>temple.</v>

1625
01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:52.520
<v Speaker 3>The first piece of evidence that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced me that something was going on</v>

1626
01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:57.831
<v Speaker 3>with the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first evidence that I saw that </v>

1627
01:29:58.111 --> 01:30:01.140
<v Speaker 3>made me suspicious that the egyptologist</v>
<v Speaker 3>did not have it right,</v>

1628
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:06.380
<v Speaker 3>was within that first 30 to 120 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I described the weathering and the </v>

1629
01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:09.900
<v Speaker 3>head's too small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first piece of really solid evidence</v>

1630
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:15.140
<v Speaker 3>was looking at the walls of the sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 3>and valley temple that were constructed </v>

1631
01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 3>from the stones that came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sphinx.</v>

1632
01:30:18.370 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Enclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about that they are weathered,</v>

1633
01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 3>but then they were cut back a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1634
01:30:24.031 --> 01:30:29.031
<v Speaker 3>That weathering was cut back and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were resurfaced or re faced with granted</v>

1635
01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.740
<v Speaker 3>in dynastic times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's believed.</v>

1636
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:37.730
<v Speaker 3>So what you have is a older structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's a diagram a for anyone that's</v>

1637
01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:42.831
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you have is older limestone </v>

1638
01:30:42.831 --> 01:30:42.831
<v Speaker 3>temples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are massive,</v>

1639
01:30:42.831 --> 01:30:46.230
<v Speaker 3>which were then faced with granite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they did,</v>

1640
01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:51.260
<v Speaker 3>they did it the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They preserved as much of the older </v>

1641
01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:54.870
<v Speaker 3>limestone temple as possible before </v>
<v Speaker 3>refacing it with granted.</v>

1642
01:30:54.871 --> 01:30:59.871
<v Speaker 3>So they actually took the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some cases to cut the backs of the </v>

1643
01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:02.340
<v Speaker 3>granite blocks to fit the weathered </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface of the limestone.</v>

1644
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it would be much easier,</v>

1645
01:31:05.401 --> 01:31:08.550
<v Speaker 3>you have plenty of rock there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just skim down the limestone.</v>

1646
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:13.580
<v Speaker 3>Totally make a nice flat surface and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then replaster so speak regranted it.</v>

1647
01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1648
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:19.770
<v Speaker 1>What you all chipping away the old rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shipped with the new role because I</v>

1649
01:31:19.771 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 1>think it was important for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if we have a national monument</v>

1650
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:24.750
<v Speaker 1>now that goes back to</v>

1651
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:29.950
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary war days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to preserve as much of the </v>

1652
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:32.561
<v Speaker 3>original structure as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it makes it more difficult to do</v>

1653
01:31:32.601 --> 01:31:33.590
<v Speaker 3>the restoration.</v>

1654
01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Now you put the effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to clarify,</v>

1655
01:31:36.471 --> 01:31:41.471
<v Speaker 1>so you feel that this time period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1656
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the coronal mass ejections mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>ejections was somewhere around 10,000</v>

1657
01:31:47.601 --> 01:31:49.790
<v Speaker 1>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well 9,700</v>

1658
01:31:49.791 --> 01:31:52.240
<v Speaker 1>bc and I say that very specific</v>

1659
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:57.130
<v Speaker 3>because based on greenland ice core data</v>
<v Speaker 3>in particular,</v>

1660
01:31:57.131 --> 01:32:02.131
<v Speaker 3>you can literally count back year by </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and the best estimate is about </v>

1661
01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 3>9,700.</v>

1662
01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:05.820
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1663
01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:10.900
<v Speaker 4>give or take a decade or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So from that point to 2,500</v>

1664
01:32:11.691 --> 01:32:16.691
<v Speaker 4>bc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is where most conventional </v>

1665
01:32:16.691 --> 01:32:19.040
<v Speaker 4>egyptologists date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the construction of the pyramid,</v>

1666
01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 4>you believe that the great pyramid was </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably built on top of this great </v>

1667
01:32:24.711 --> 01:32:27.560
<v Speaker 4>mound which represented an older </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>

1668
01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:32.860
<v Speaker 4>but these are the people that their </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization was destroyed and then </v>

1669
01:32:33.441 --> 01:32:38.441
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years later we're able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another rebuild</v>

1670
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:43.260
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't know if they were rebuilding a</v>

1671
01:32:43.261 --> 01:32:48.261
<v Speaker 3>nut pyramid as it was before or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were building new pyramid on top.</v>

1672
01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they obviously had retained some of the </v>

1673
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 4>incredible</v>

1674
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 3>wisdom and knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1675
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.880
<v Speaker 3>think of it to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

1676
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:59.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll think of judeo christian islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1677
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean we still have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the temple mound.</v>

1678
01:33:02.201 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 3>We have places where we know that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were older structures,</v>

1679
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:07.480
<v Speaker 3>solomon's temple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

1680
01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:12.481
<v Speaker 3>and maYbe only a fragment of it is left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we still held in high esteem </v>

1681
01:33:13.361 --> 01:33:18.361
<v Speaker 3>veneration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Modern structures are built around or </v>

1682
01:33:18.361 --> 01:33:21.541
<v Speaker 3>over these relics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a somewhat of an analogy </v>

1683
01:33:21.941 --> 01:33:24.020
<v Speaker 3>of what the parthenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1684
01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1685
01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:28.910
<v Speaker 3>So you have veneration of older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I could use that,</v>

1686
01:33:28.911 --> 01:33:32.050
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not used necessarily using it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious terms,</v>

1687
01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could just be respect.</v>

1688
01:33:33.461 --> 01:33:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1689
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:39.720
<v Speaker 3>so I think that for all three of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>major pyramids on the giza plateau,</v>

1690
01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 3>we have evidence that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something there,</v>

1691
01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 3>whether they were pyramids as we see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them now,</v>

1692
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:51.850
<v Speaker 3>which is quite a possibility and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were just refurbished or something else.</v>

1693
01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have evidence that goes back to that </v>

1694
01:33:57.150 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 3>much earlier period before the demise of</v>
<v Speaker 3>high civilization,</v>

1695
01:34:01.421 --> 01:34:03.910
<v Speaker 3>if I could put it that way at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last ice age.</v>

1696
01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:08.260
<v Speaker 3>And then it was reappropriate re-used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebuilt,</v>

1697
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:13.710
<v Speaker 3>restored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever term you wanna use in dynastic </v>

1698
01:34:13.710 --> 01:34:16.000
<v Speaker 3>egyptian times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1699
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 3>when give you another example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been to Egypt?</v>

1700
01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:21.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not.</v>

1701
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think you had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to come to show thIs to you in </v>

1702
01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.280
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go with you.</v>

1703
01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Your chicken chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scared to go to Egypt.</v>

1704
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Hurt is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not with me.</v>

1705
01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Not with me because I take care of her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1706
01:34:34.811 --> 01:34:36.190
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I buy have enough context.</v>

1707
01:34:36.191 --> 01:34:41.191
<v Speaker 3>I have enough context that I'll go with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you immediately get we have to make </v>

1708
01:34:41.191 --> 01:34:41.191
<v Speaker 3>something happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1709
01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.310
<v Speaker 3>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

1710
01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:47.660
<v Speaker 4>Points of the mountain and digital to </v>
<v Speaker 4>give people a perspective of time that t</v>

1711
01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.860
<v Speaker 4>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>500 years ago,</v>

1712
01:34:50.861 --> 01:34:53.820
<v Speaker 4>the conventional dating of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction,</v>

1713
01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:58.840
<v Speaker 4>the grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cleopatra is closer to the construction </v>

1714
01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.230
<v Speaker 4>of the iphone than she is to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction of the great pyramids.</v>

1715
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:07.300
<v Speaker 4>That's just how long a history you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with when it comes to ancient </v>

1716
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:12.430
<v Speaker 4>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're talking about thousands and </v>

1717
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:14.720
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is for sure for sure.</v>

1718
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:19.780
<v Speaker 4>Like where we absolutely know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about all the speculation just </v>

1719
01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 4>from cleopatra to the 2000 fIve hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>bc,</v>

1720
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:26.510
<v Speaker 4>which is what almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>egyptologists except you're dealing with</v>

1721
01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:28.990
<v Speaker 4>just a giant leap harris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1722
01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could see it here.</v>

1723
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.990
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1724
01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we are closer to the dynastic </v>

1725
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.970
<v Speaker 3>egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the old kingdom dynastic egyptians,</v>

1726
01:35:39.971 --> 01:35:44.971
<v Speaker 3>we are closer to them in time than they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were to the end of the last ice age and </v>

1727
01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:51.330
<v Speaker 3>the demise of that earlier civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a dynastic egyptian dynastic Egypt </v>

1728
01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:51.400
<v Speaker 3>arose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rough terms,</v>

1729
01:35:51.401 --> 01:35:52.990
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1730
01:35:53.410 --> 01:35:58.410
<v Speaker 3>that was about 3000 bc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1731
01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:03.510
<v Speaker 3>they arose over 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years after close to 7,000</v>

1732
01:36:03.911 --> 01:36:08.470
<v Speaker 3>years after the end of the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's crazy.</v>

1733
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's hard.</v>

1734
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:13.130
<v Speaker 4>Hartford were talking real spans of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>here and you're looking at.</v>

1735
01:36:13.131 --> 01:36:15.500
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at a chart right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any way,</v>

1736
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:20.530
<v Speaker 4>is there a place or were other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>can go and see this because it's </v>

1737
01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:20.530
<v Speaker 4>ongoing.</v>

1738
01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 3>A chart like this is on my website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the article,</v>

1739
01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:27.960
<v Speaker 3>if you go to my website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robert shocked again,</v>

1740
01:36:27.961 --> 01:36:32.640
<v Speaker 3>www dot robert schoch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s c h o c h.com,</v>

1741
01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.700
<v Speaker 3>and go to the website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see charts like this,</v>

1742
01:36:35.701 --> 01:36:40.701
<v Speaker 3>but what you should do is go to the main</v>
<v Speaker 3>page of the website and then I believe </v>

1743
01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:45.040
<v Speaker 3>it is a research highlights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to whatsapp,</v>

1744
01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:50.090
<v Speaker 3>hauled research highlights actually I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think for those on the podcast are </v>

1745
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:52.940
<v Speaker 3>seeing here and then go to what's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cita article as did a,</v>

1746
01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:56.070
<v Speaker 3>and this is what we're looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>standard on the website now which stands</v>

1747
01:36:56.071 --> 01:36:59.100
<v Speaker 3>for solar induced dark age today and </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1748
01:36:59.101 --> 01:37:01.020
<v Speaker 3>it's ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the sun,</v>

1749
01:37:01.021 --> 01:37:03.750
<v Speaker 3>which of course is pride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't induce a dark age,</v>

1750
01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.240
<v Speaker 3>but when you have a major eruption like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1751
01:37:06.241 --> 01:37:11.241
<v Speaker 3>a major outburst from the sun hitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth and all the ramifications we </v>

1752
01:37:11.241 --> 01:37:15.891
<v Speaker 3>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to bring any civilization </v>

1753
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:15.891
<v Speaker 3>down</v>

1754
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:20.220
<v Speaker 4>to its knees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thousands and thousands of years of </v>

1755
01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.701
<v Speaker 4>rebuilding civilization and rising </v>
<v Speaker 4>backup to some still unbelievably </v>

1756
01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:29.941
<v Speaker 4>incredible technological level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even if they did rebuild the pyramid </v>

1757
01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:31.210
<v Speaker 4>at 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 4>bc,</v>

1758
01:37:31.211 --> 01:37:33.090
<v Speaker 4>it's still this incredible feat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1759
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.570
<v Speaker 4>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For years,</v>

1760
01:37:34.730 --> 01:37:35.550
<v Speaker 4>why 500</v>

1761
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:40.550
<v Speaker 3>bc?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before if I could just finish a thought </v>

1762
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:43.431
<v Speaker 3>that I started to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying we have to go Egypt </v>

1763
01:37:43.431 --> 01:37:43.930
<v Speaker 3>together and I could show you something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we could do a podcast there.</v>

1764
01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Snap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1765
01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:52.670
<v Speaker 3>I could take you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Among other things around the second </v>

1766
01:37:52.670 --> 01:37:52.880
<v Speaker 3>pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second pyramid.</v>

1767
01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:57.510
<v Speaker 3>You can see evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would point to you that I interpret as</v>

1768
01:37:57.511 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 3>going back to an earlier structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Furthermore,</v>

1769
01:38:00.301 --> 01:38:05.301
<v Speaker 3>the second period pyramid few people </v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to pay attention to this has a </v>

1770
01:38:05.301 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ring of granite around the base.</v>

1771
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:13.430
<v Speaker 3>That's significant because they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>using granted in many cases and </v>

1772
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 3>conventional egyptologists who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmed to this,</v>

1773
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:20.510
<v Speaker 3>confirm this verbally with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would use granted when they were </v>

1774
01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:25.670
<v Speaker 3>indicating they were restoring an older </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure and there's no question that </v>

1775
01:38:26.011 --> 01:38:31.011
<v Speaker 3>granite goes back to the fourth dynasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like there's no question that the </v>

1776
01:38:31.471 --> 01:38:36.471
<v Speaker 3>granite on the valley and sphinx temple </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes back to at least the fourth </v>

1777
01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 3>dynasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not earlier,</v>

1778
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.120
<v Speaker 3>but they're using it to restore.</v>

1779
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.120
<v Speaker 3>So we have all of this indication that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynastic Egypt acknowledged that they </v>

1780
01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 3>were restoring older structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1781
01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:51.530
<v Speaker 3>so getting back to where we were just on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great pyramid.</v>

1782
01:38:51.531 --> 01:38:54.900
<v Speaker 3>So no matter how you look at it to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>

1783
01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:59.010
<v Speaker 3>build a great pyramid today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're talking 2,500</v>

1784
01:38:59.011 --> 01:39:01.860
<v Speaker 3>bc or earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1785
01:39:01.861 --> 01:39:03.900
<v Speaker 3>how were they doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>how were they doing?</v>

1786
01:39:03.901 --> 01:39:08.901
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you I am not going to try to get </v>

1787
01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:08.901
<v Speaker 3>into how they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1788
01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:09.990
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did it.</v>

1789
01:39:09.991 --> 01:39:12.030
<v Speaker 3>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1790
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1791
01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:14.250
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

1792
01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I thought about a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1793
01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Whether I'm there in Egypt on site or </v>
<v Speaker 3>elsewhere.</v>

1794
01:39:20.551 --> 01:39:21.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

1795
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any answer for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that the people in that </v>

1796
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:30.181
<v Speaker 1>part of the world somehow another </v>
<v Speaker 1>survived the coronal mass ejection in </v>

1797
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:35.470
<v Speaker 1>and they came out better than the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other parts of the world that were </v>

1798
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:36.610
<v Speaker 1>really knocked into the stone age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1799
01:39:36.611 --> 01:39:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because,</v>

1800
01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.520
<v Speaker 1>because we seem to have a huge gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>

1801
01:39:42.730 --> 01:39:45.560
<v Speaker 1>around the gap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still historically</v>

1802
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:51.470
<v Speaker 3>now what they were doing in Egypt is </v>
<v Speaker 3>incomparable.</v>

1803
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:57.620
<v Speaker 3>One could argue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it may well be that they found all </v>

1804
01:39:57.721 --> 01:40:00.240
<v Speaker 3>the right materials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the right environments,</v>

1805
01:40:00.241 --> 01:40:05.241
<v Speaker 3>a nile valley in its height,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is nonsense height.</v>

1806
01:40:06.241 --> 01:40:07.540
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1807
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of sydney,</v>

1808
01:40:09.541 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 3>let's say for a reemergence may have </v>
<v Speaker 3>just been,</v>

1809
01:40:13.021 --> 01:40:18.021
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say the goldie locks words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just right for everything to come </v>

1810
01:40:18.421 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 3>together for this to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1811
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.790
<v Speaker 3>come together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very fertile area.</v>

1812
01:40:23.791 --> 01:40:26.100
<v Speaker 3>It's very easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1813
01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:30.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defended that type of thing.</v>

1814
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also I do want to tie in with what </v>

1815
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 3>you were saying it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've certainly thought about this.</v>

1816
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:39.760
<v Speaker 3>It is possible that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are electrical and um,</v>

1817
01:40:39.930 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 3>the fluctuating and electric fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>magnetic fields.</v>

1818
01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:46.660
<v Speaker 3>Did they have some influence if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain development or you know,</v>

1819
01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:51.710
<v Speaker 3>that's real speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't say it's impossible </v>

1820
01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:51.710
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1821
01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:51.710
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1822
01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible they retained some</v>

1823
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:59.310
<v Speaker 2>of the knowledge from thousands of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they definitely retaining </v>

1824
01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:02.630
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like we have monasteries in europe </v>

1825
01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:02.830
<v Speaker 2>during the dark ages retaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

1826
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:07.980
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is in some cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would retain chunks of knowledge </v>

1827
01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:12.720
<v Speaker 2>that don't even make sense out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>context except that they know they're </v>

1828
01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:12.940
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're no,</v>

1829
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:15.120
<v Speaker 2>they're valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of examples?</v>

1830
01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in europe where you would have </v>

1831
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:20.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1832
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:22.090
<v Speaker 2>pieces of technology that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>retained,</v>

1833
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:26.650
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have the whole complex or </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking literary terms.</v>

1834
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:31.651
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the easiest where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have parts of like a history of </v>

1835
01:41:31.651 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 2>alexander where the whole thing did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive,</v>

1836
01:41:35.051 --> 01:41:40.051
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six out of nine chapters or whatever </v>

1837
01:41:40.051 --> 01:41:43.411
<v Speaker 2>survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even Though they knew it was an </v>

1838
01:41:43.411 --> 01:41:45.420
<v Speaker 2>incomplete manuscript,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would make numerous copies of the </v>

1839
01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 2>incomplete manuscript.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing that it was important,</v>

1840
01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 2>sort of like the goals.</v>

1841
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another example,</v>

1842
01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:54.760
<v Speaker 2>although the dead sea scrolls </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially were absolutely complete,</v>

1843
01:41:54.761 --> 01:41:59.220
<v Speaker 2>or at least most of them are complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were buried and you know,</v>

1844
01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 2>put away for storage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them,</v>

1845
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:07.500
<v Speaker 2>the incomplete lists there may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they degrade it because they </v>

1846
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:08.390
<v Speaker 2>were discovered by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1847
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:11.680
<v Speaker 2>locals who have been tore them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so pieces here or there,</v>

1848
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm referring more to a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have ancient knowledge,</v>

1849
01:42:15.941 --> 01:42:20.941
<v Speaker 2>our ancient manuscripts and even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>say the monks and a monastery knew that </v>

1850
01:42:20.941 --> 01:42:25.561
<v Speaker 2>this was not a complete manuscript,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew that even in its </v>

1851
01:42:25.561 --> 01:42:30.330
<v Speaker 2>incompleteness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was important to maintain as much of </v>

1852
01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:34.500
<v Speaker 2>it as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just stunning that civilization </v>

1853
01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:35.260
<v Speaker 2>that was knocked down like every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>

1854
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.500
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>bc rose to this incredible level of </v>

1855
01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:44.440
<v Speaker 2>construction that is just unparalleled </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else on the planet.</v>

1856
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:46.450
<v Speaker 2>And it did it very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly,</v>

1857
01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:48.340
<v Speaker 2>very quickly.</v>

1858
01:42:48.490 --> 01:42:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think does,</v>

1859
01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:56.420
<v Speaker 2>is it indicative potentially that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were reusing knowledge that had been </v>

1860
01:42:57.341 --> 01:43:00.220
<v Speaker 2>passed down and somehow maybe things </v>
<v Speaker 2>just clicked together.</v>

1861
01:43:00.221 --> 01:43:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it took one genius to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting things together.</v>

1862
01:43:03.851 --> 01:43:06.460
<v Speaker 2>And that set off a renaissance if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

1863
01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:11.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've seen that historically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more recent times that maybe </v>

1864
01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:15.720
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the understanding of how it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>built and designed is more prevalent </v>

1865
01:43:15.881 --> 01:43:19.810
<v Speaker 2>amongst the civilization amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community than maybe it would be today.</v>

1866
01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's still a lot of </v>

1867
01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:25.300
<v Speaker 2>unanswered questions here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

1868
01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's incredible incredible </v>

1869
01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:33.301
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we're starting to get more </v>

1870
01:43:33.301 --> 01:43:36.990
<v Speaker 2>toward an answer or at least getting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>broader outlines of what is going on.</v>

1871
01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so fascinating to think that </v>

1872
01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:44.920
<v Speaker 2>this could potentially happen to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1873
01:43:44.921 --> 01:43:48.190
<v Speaker 2>that it's not the only fast dane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to use the term.</v>

1874
01:43:48.191 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>It's scary and I think we're incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and people are not</v>

1875
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 3>addressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not the type of thing to address</v>

1876
01:43:56.121 --> 01:44:01.121
<v Speaker 3>for some reason because a major solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>outburst and coronal mass ejection and </v>

1877
01:44:01.761 --> 01:44:05.390
<v Speaker 3>all the related phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've mentioned this earlier would bring</v>

1878
01:44:05.391 --> 01:44:09.650
<v Speaker 3>down modern technology as we know it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would fry the grid system.</v>

1879
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 3>YoU'd have high radiation levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd probably have all the flooding.</v>

1880
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what happens now when you have </v>

1881
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.270
<v Speaker 3>lIttle floods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say that as a geologist,</v>

1882
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:22.490
<v Speaker 3>not to downplay the horrible disasters </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had,</v>

1883
01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:25.340
<v Speaker 3>but other factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

1884
01:44:25.341 --> 01:44:29.120
<v Speaker 3>we have nuclear power plants all around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

1885
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:33.320
<v Speaker 3>We've seen that with a few isolated </v>
<v Speaker 3>instances.</v>

1886
01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Chernobyl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three mile island fukushima recently.</v>

1887
01:44:37.491 --> 01:44:39.230
<v Speaker 3>What happens when you have problems with</v>
<v Speaker 3>those?</v>

1888
01:44:39.231 --> 01:44:42.590
<v Speaker 3>If you cut off power to a nuclear power </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant,</v>

1889
01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:44.780
<v Speaker 3>it's ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of people don't realize it.</v>

1890
01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:46.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they generate power,</v>

1891
01:44:46.281 --> 01:44:48.350
<v Speaker 3>but they need a power supply going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1892
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:53.351
<v Speaker 3>IF you fry the grid system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're essentially going to have </v>

1893
01:44:53.351 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 3>meltdowns and radiation.</v>

1894
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:56.930
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on top of everything else,</v>

1895
01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:01.040
<v Speaker 3>we're going to bring on this artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>radiation around the world.</v>

1896
01:45:01.530 --> 01:45:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1897
01:45:02.490 --> 01:45:02.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1898
01:45:02.931 --> 01:45:04.730
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying this,</v>

1899
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't have anything to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1900
01:45:07.251 --> 01:45:09.960
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I hear people talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there was.</v>

1901
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:11.900
<v Speaker 3>So they're prepping kid and now they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>

1902
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:13.460
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for so much money,</v>

1903
01:45:13.461 --> 01:45:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1904
01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.100
<v Speaker 3>jim baker style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1905
01:45:16.101 --> 01:45:16.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1906
01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:17.510
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1907
01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:22.511
<v Speaker 3>I hate to even talk about it except I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's important and I think that </v>

1908
01:45:22.511 --> 01:45:24.170
<v Speaker 3>one of the things this gets back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1909
01:45:24.171 --> 01:45:29.060
<v Speaker 3>it's not just sort of academic to study </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient civilization,</v>

1910
01:45:29.061 --> 01:45:34.061
<v Speaker 3>it's not just fun and interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there are things to learn </v>

1911
01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:38.681
<v Speaker 3>from this and one of the things to learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they survived incredible.</v>

1912
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they survive,</v>

1913
01:45:40.941 --> 01:45:43.340
<v Speaker 3>but they were knocked to their knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

1914
01:45:43.930 --> 01:45:48.930
<v Speaker 3>they went through natural catastrophes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are not unrealistic that we could </v>

1915
01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.640
<v Speaker 3>go through them again and be potentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more vulnerable than they are than </v>

1916
01:45:55.881 --> 01:45:58.110
<v Speaker 3>they were at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1917
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.400
<v Speaker 3>because we're so reliant on silver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1918
01:46:02.130 --> 01:46:07.130
<v Speaker 4>Are there any hieroglyphs that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>convincing or at least point to some of </v>

1919
01:46:08.071 --> 01:46:12.480
<v Speaker 4>the construction methods of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the pyramid or of any of the other?</v>

1920
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said convincing,</v>

1921
01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:16.640
<v Speaker 3>I would say no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I would say no.</v>

1922
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this gets into the problem to that.</v>

1923
01:46:21.081 --> 01:46:26.081
<v Speaker 3>Why would you expect that I'm serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what we have surviving are </v>

1924
01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.850
<v Speaker 3>generally religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat literary,</v>

1925
01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in tombs.</v>

1926
01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't buy for a second that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>great pyramid was a tumor initially too.</v>

1927
01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:43.760
<v Speaker 3>That's like saying a huge cathedrals </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to tune because you find a couple </v>

1928
01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.331
<v Speaker 3>of bodies there and you've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually found bodies in the great </v>

1929
01:46:47.331 --> 01:46:49.350
<v Speaker 3>pyramid oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the major pyramids and as you know,</v>

1930
01:46:49.351 --> 01:46:54.351
<v Speaker 3>I know you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pure construction goes down hill as </v>

1931
01:46:54.351 --> 01:46:58.551
<v Speaker 3>you go into later dynastic Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they seem to have either gotten </v>

1932
01:46:58.551 --> 01:47:02.481
<v Speaker 3>sloppier or just lost some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological finesse they had.</v>

1933
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:07.790
<v Speaker 3>So you find in some of the tombs these </v>
<v Speaker 3>what almost seemed silly pictures of </v>

1934
01:47:09.151 --> 01:47:14.151
<v Speaker 3>them dragging huge statues on sledges </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're supposedly pouring oil or </v>

1935
01:47:16.051 --> 01:47:18.630
<v Speaker 3>water in front of it to lubricated.</v>

1936
01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:22.470
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the egyptologist say,</v>

1937
01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:24.300
<v Speaker 3>aha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how they built it all.</v>

1938
01:47:24.301 --> 01:47:27.960
<v Speaker 3>We'll try doing that in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really work.</v>

1939
01:47:27.961 --> 01:47:32.940
<v Speaker 3>So I think some of that may just be sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of artistic license or metaphor,</v>

1940
01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.190
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any images of that?</v>

1941
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not.</v>

1942
01:47:37.111 --> 01:47:42.111
<v Speaker 3>Not that I brought with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point is that you wouldn't even </v>

1943
01:47:42.121 --> 01:47:47.121
<v Speaker 3>expect them to be leaving detailed </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction plans are that we wouldn't </v>

1944
01:47:48.411 --> 01:47:51.620
<v Speaker 3>necessarily find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll get lucky find someday,</v>

1945
01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 3>but put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they find a bunch of iphones 12,000</v>

1946
01:47:55.021 --> 01:48:00.021
<v Speaker 3>years from now or 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from now with whichever period we </v>

1947
01:48:00.021 --> 01:48:03.601
<v Speaker 3>want to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about will they know what they are </v>

1948
01:48:03.601 --> 01:48:04.470
<v Speaker 3>and even if they know what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will we,</v>

1949
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:09.500
<v Speaker 3>will they find the plans of how to build</v>
<v Speaker 3>one and the factory specifications of </v>

1950
01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:11.280
<v Speaker 3>all the engineering that goes into it?</v>

1951
01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:15.720
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why would you expect it for the great</v>

1952
01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:16.410
<v Speaker 3>pyramids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1953
01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:17.310
<v Speaker 3>But well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1954
01:48:17.311 --> 01:48:19.820
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a lucky find different bid,</v>

1955
01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.110
<v Speaker 3>but how much would that odds are against</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1956
01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:27.320
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not to throw out too much academia </v>

1957
01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:30.351
<v Speaker 3>type stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things I study is a </v>

1958
01:48:30.351 --> 01:48:32.811
<v Speaker 3>graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I took a series of courses in </v>

1959
01:48:32.811 --> 01:48:35.290
<v Speaker 3>taxonomy which is basically how did </v>
<v Speaker 3>things get preserved focusing on </v>

1960
01:48:35.290 --> 01:48:35.720
<v Speaker 3>fossils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1961
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.880
<v Speaker 3>but the principles apply to other things</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1962
01:48:38.970 --> 01:48:43.970
<v Speaker 3>And as you go back in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you expect to survive </v>

1963
01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:46.110
<v Speaker 3>logarithmically drops off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1964
01:48:46.111 --> 01:48:49.710
<v Speaker 3>so you go back to these earlier periods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

1965
01:48:49.711 --> 01:48:53.310
<v Speaker 3>We have much of anything and what'S </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to survive big,</v>

1966
01:48:53.311 --> 01:48:58.311
<v Speaker 3>massive stone structures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the plans on papaya iris or sheep </v>

1967
01:49:00.331 --> 01:49:04.290
<v Speaker 3>skin or whatever of the details of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build it.</v>

1968
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:06.710
<v Speaker 3>That's why what I found particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive about that,</v>

1969
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:09.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptologist saying,</v>

1970
01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:11.940
<v Speaker 3>where's the evidence of this culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>from 10,500</v>

1971
01:49:11.941 --> 01:49:12.420
<v Speaker 3>years ago?</v>

1972
01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1973
01:49:13.050 --> 01:49:14.550
<v Speaker 3>What do you expect to find?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1974
01:49:14.551 --> 01:49:16.530
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what we're talking about.</v>

1975
01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:19.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we find from that earlier period,</v>

1976
01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:24.020
<v Speaker 3>if you think about our massive stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>monumental structures,</v>

1977
01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:27.120
<v Speaker 3>everything else would be grounded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was incinerated,</v>

1978
01:49:27.121 --> 01:49:30.750
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was ground into dust or it was reused</v>

1979
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:32.790
<v Speaker 3>in some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people say,</v>

1980
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1981
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.210
<v Speaker 3>how could they do that without metal </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools will,</v>

1982
01:49:36.211 --> 01:49:41.211
<v Speaker 3>maybe metallurgy does go back further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was lost and then reinvented </v>

1983
01:49:41.211 --> 01:49:41.880
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

1984
01:49:41.881 --> 01:49:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't deny the standard timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there could be a lot of things going</v>

1985
01:49:45.451 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 3>back before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have metal.</v>

1986
01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:53.490
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not trying to focus on metal now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not making any big claims about </v>

1987
01:49:53.490 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 3>metallurgy a earlier time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's just say for instance,</v>

1988
01:49:56.711 --> 01:50:01.711
<v Speaker 3>as a thought experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had metallurgy much earlier than </v>

1989
01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:07.380
<v Speaker 3>conventional timeframe says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had a natural catastrophe like </v>

1990
01:50:08.351 --> 01:50:10.840
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they just going to leave their metal</v>

1991
01:50:10.841 --> 01:50:12.400
<v Speaker 3>tools all over the place?</v>

1992
01:50:13.050 --> 01:50:18.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they collect all the scraps of metal </v>

1993
01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 3>possible and recycle and reuse and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reuse.</v>

1994
01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 3>we do that to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people got,</v>

1995
01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:27.500
<v Speaker 3>in Massachusetts at least if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>warehouse and you're not paying </v>

1996
01:50:27.551 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 3>attention to it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an old warehouse.</v>

1997
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.960
<v Speaker 3>There have been cases where people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>found.</v>

1998
01:50:31.961 --> 01:50:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Someone broke in not to steal the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the warehouse,</v>

1999
01:50:35.051 --> 01:50:37.060
<v Speaker 3>but to steal the copper piping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2000
01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very common.</v>

2001
01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Now there's some of the more interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces of evidence that came out of the </v>

2002
01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:49.300
<v Speaker 3>great pyramid and a lot of the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures of Egypt had been the pottery</v>

2003
01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:52.330
<v Speaker 3>that's incredibly difficult to reproduce</v>
<v Speaker 3>those stone.</v>

2004
01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just made a mistake.</v>

2005
01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:56.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not criticizing you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said pottery.</v>

2006
01:50:57.010 --> 01:50:59.480
<v Speaker 3>You said padre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's Important distinctions,</v>

2007
01:50:59.750 --> 01:51:04.530
<v Speaker 3>not monitoring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is fired in a kiln and fired dearly,</v>

2008
01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:09.540
<v Speaker 3>carved out really hard stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will crack easily if you don't do </v>

2009
01:51:10.361 --> 01:51:15.361
<v Speaker 3>it just right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it looks like pottery and that's you </v>

2010
01:51:15.361 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 3>used a term colloquially put it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2011
01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Looks like pottery because that's how </v>
<v Speaker 3>people imagine,</v>

2012
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:22.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a beautifully shaped pot,</v>

2013
01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:27.120
<v Speaker 3>but some of these they go and they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the earliest dynastic Egypt and </v>

2014
01:51:27.131 --> 01:51:32.131
<v Speaker 3>probably much earlier they are carved </v>
<v Speaker 3>out really hard granites and schists and</v>

2015
01:51:32.741 --> 01:51:33.490
<v Speaker 3>nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2016
01:51:33.491 --> 01:51:38.491
<v Speaker 3>these really hard stones and two </v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredible tolerances and incredibly </v>

2017
01:51:39.671 --> 01:51:44.671
<v Speaker 3>thin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly beautifully carved and most </v>

2018
01:51:44.671 --> 01:51:47.390
<v Speaker 3>importantly to very small opening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very small openings is.</v>

2019
01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how do you do this?</v>

2020
01:51:50.561 --> 01:51:55.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just incredible when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to come to Egypt with us and when </v>

2021
01:51:55.841 --> 01:51:58.840
<v Speaker 3>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll look at some of these onsite.</v>

2022
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:04.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch in the museum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some at a museum at sakara where</v>

2023
01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:08.260
<v Speaker 3>they had been nice one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2024
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:10.000
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a mace.</v>

2025
01:52:10.001 --> 01:52:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Headers are destined jar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what we're talking about.</v>

2026
01:52:12.521 --> 01:52:13.780
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's much,</v>

2027
01:52:13.781 --> 01:52:14.560
<v Speaker 3>much nicer.</v>

2028
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:20.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm a much nicer in the sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>finesse of how both arterial,</v>

2029
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:24.580
<v Speaker 3>theY were carved out of marble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different marbles.</v>

2030
01:52:24.581 --> 01:52:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Two easier ones to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would grab them out.</v>

2031
01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.440
<v Speaker 3>diorite granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

2032
01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Which is a metamorphic stone schist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are really hard stones.</v>

2033
01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:37.000
<v Speaker 3>He's called direct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm d,</v>

2034
01:52:37.001 --> 01:52:39.250
<v Speaker 3>I o r I t e,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

2035
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Try that because that's what I'm pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure I saw one of them.</v>

2036
01:52:41.851 --> 01:52:46.851
<v Speaker 3>It was carved out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what we're saying is that these </v>

2037
01:52:48.591 --> 01:52:50.900
<v Speaker 3>are really hard to carve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that use very narrow openings,</v>

2038
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:55.930
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they put handles on them so </v>

2039
01:52:55.930 --> 01:52:58.901
<v Speaker 3>they're not just spinning them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allow lave because how will you get the </v>

2040
01:52:58.901 --> 01:52:59.000
<v Speaker 3>handles on it because that's not put on </v>
<v Speaker 3>separately.</v>

2041
01:52:59.001 --> 01:53:01.250
<v Speaker 3>It's all car from one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

2042
01:53:01.251 --> 01:53:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a nice one,</v>

2043
01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:08.310
<v Speaker 3>a then on vessels and these thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these have been found going back to the </v>

2044
01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:13.110
<v Speaker 3>earliest dynastic times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what suggested the.</v>

2045
01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's um,</v>

2046
01:53:14.091 --> 01:53:17.740
<v Speaker 3>how they were carved according to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>standard egyptologist.</v>

2047
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I try to do that without cracking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without making a mistake,</v>

2048
01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:22.370
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2049
01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll explain what we're looking at.</v>

2050
01:53:24.591 --> 01:53:25.900
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2051
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:30.970
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a little like amazed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they use scratch out the inside.</v>

2052
01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.540
<v Speaker 1>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>

2053
01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:37.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they did it and just took a </v>

2054
01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:37.600
<v Speaker 1>log until.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the speculation?</v>

2055
01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get the one right above it.</v>

2056
01:53:38.831 --> 01:53:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that red one,</v>

2057
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:42.440
<v Speaker 1>the red one right above your cursor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one's incredible.</v>

2058
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2059
01:53:42.901 --> 01:53:46.440
<v Speaker 1>they're absolutely incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can see these on site.</v>

2060
01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:48.880
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the circulation?</v>

2061
01:53:49.090 --> 01:53:51.850
<v Speaker 3>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2062
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.030
<v Speaker 3>the speculation is that they weRe doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it the same way.</v>

2063
01:53:55.031 --> 01:53:59.650
<v Speaker 3>They were doing a new kingdom times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at them and new kingdon</v>

2064
01:53:59.651 --> 01:54:04.651
<v Speaker 3>times as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get things similar to this new </v>

2065
01:54:04.651 --> 01:54:06.820
<v Speaker 3>kingdoms that say 1500 bC just for round</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

2066
01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.790
<v Speaker 3>You get similar types of vases and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatnot,</v>

2067
01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:13.870
<v Speaker 3>but they're actually to my eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much cruder.</v>

2068
01:54:13.871 --> 01:54:18.871
<v Speaker 3>Generally they're made out softer stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more your calcites sites in limestones </v>

2069
01:54:19.451 --> 01:54:21.340
<v Speaker 3>and marbles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>

2070
01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:26.580
<v Speaker 3>They geneRally are just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll have the same artistic finesse </v>

2071
01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:30.340
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same perfection to them and the new </v>

2072
01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:33.091
<v Speaker 3>kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians did show diagrams as we just </v>

2073
01:54:33.091 --> 01:54:35.530
<v Speaker 3>saw how they did it or supposedly did it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that may well be how they were doing</v>

2074
01:54:35.531 --> 01:54:40.531
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I questioned as a geologist whether </v>

2075
01:54:40.531 --> 01:54:43.000
<v Speaker 3>that would really work for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful harder stone,</v>

2076
01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:46.030
<v Speaker 3>muCh more perfect in my assessment.</v>

2077
01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Older ones that you find going back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earliest dynasties and you find in </v>

2078
01:54:52.061 --> 01:54:54.850
<v Speaker 3>some cases thousands of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at sakara,</v>

2079
01:54:54.851 --> 01:54:58.030
<v Speaker 3>at the step pyramId,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally considered the oldest pyramid,</v>

2080
01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:01.930
<v Speaker 3>although I would question that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely an old pyramid.</v>

2081
01:55:01.931 --> 01:55:06.931
<v Speaker 3>Even by Egypt biological standards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you found thousands of these really well</v>

2082
01:55:07.601 --> 01:55:12.130
<v Speaker 3>carved ones from the harder stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more artistic ones,</v>

2083
01:55:12.131 --> 01:55:15.880
<v Speaker 3>if we could call it that sort of a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>horde of them.</v>

2084
01:55:16.630 --> 01:55:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think they were necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>carved at that time.</v>

2085
01:55:19.241 --> 01:55:24.241
<v Speaker 3>I think this may have been a horde that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had preserved from thousands of </v>

2086
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:26.590
<v Speaker 3>years earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Service stock poweR museum,</v>

2087
01:55:26.591 --> 01:55:27.880
<v Speaker 3>if you would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2088
01:55:27.881 --> 01:55:31.180
<v Speaker 3>what we're finding for as many of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote tombs and temples,</v>

2089
01:55:31.210 --> 01:55:33.340
<v Speaker 3>not temples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tombs and pyramids,</v>

2090
01:55:33.341 --> 01:55:34.990
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that maybe the.</v>

2091
01:55:34.991 --> 01:55:37.510
<v Speaker 3>Essentially they were stockpiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were um,</v>

2092
01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:38.930
<v Speaker 3>the equivalent of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2093
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:39.690
<v Speaker 3>fall out shelter.</v>

2094
01:55:39.690 --> 01:55:44.690
<v Speaker 3>So if you were you stuck away supplies </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of thing that may have been part of</v>

2095
01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:50.151
<v Speaker 3>the original structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of these are very long next to a </v>

2096
01:55:50.151 --> 01:55:52.360
<v Speaker 3>very long neck bottoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2097
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Sanely difficUlt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the ones that you've told them,</v>

2098
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:58.680
<v Speaker 3>there's ones that are difficult and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have all kinds of curves.</v>

2099
01:55:59.310 --> 01:56:04.310
<v Speaker 3>And what you have to be careful as I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying is that you have the really well </v>

2100
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:08.181
<v Speaker 3>finished very ancient ones and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have ancient ones that are from the new </v>

2101
01:56:09.001 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 3>cayman only 3000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>3000,</v>

2102
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:12.930
<v Speaker 3>500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2103
01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2104
01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.530
<v Speaker 3>and then what you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I Could show you one,</v>

2105
01:56:16.531 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 3>and if it's still on display in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptian museum,</v>

2106
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:23.811
<v Speaker 3>I say still on display because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed the displace and they're </v>

2107
01:56:23.811 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 3>building a new grant Egypt museum as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it.</v>

2108
01:56:25.141 --> 01:56:30.141
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard to say in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Egypt when we go to Egypt now going </v>

2109
01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:35.930
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can show you one where I'm convinced </v>

2110
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:38.661
<v Speaker 3>that it's a very old bowl that was then </v>
<v Speaker 3>reused in later times.</v>

2111
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:44.870
<v Speaker 3>So you see this crude or hieroglyphic </v>
<v Speaker 3>inscription on it and you just look at </v>

2112
01:56:45.571 --> 01:56:50.571
<v Speaker 3>it and you say someone that incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowl would not have done such a crude </v>

2113
01:56:51.361 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 3>inscription on it this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2114
01:56:53.011 --> 01:56:58.011
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when we go through each with a </v>

2115
01:56:58.011 --> 01:57:01.161
<v Speaker 3>megalithic statutes and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find over and over where they </v>

2116
01:57:01.161 --> 01:57:06.021
<v Speaker 3>would carve on them later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So reappropriate them in later dynastic </v>

2117
01:57:06.781 --> 01:57:09.510
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is still thousands of years ago.</v>

2118
01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:12.180
<v Speaker 3>So very ancient from our personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

2119
01:57:12.450 --> 01:57:16.830
<v Speaker 3>but they were reusing older structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>and older,</v>

2120
01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.390
<v Speaker 3>older artifacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2121
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.860
<v Speaker 3>the whole subject is so fascinating to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2122
01:57:22.861 --> 01:57:27.861
<v Speaker 3>But this bowl thing is very weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's almost like one of the </v>

2123
01:57:27.861 --> 01:57:28.980
<v Speaker 3>crazier pieces of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's dismissed.</v>

2124
01:57:29.590 --> 01:57:31.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like right under your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2125
01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:34.410
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely dismissed and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike.</v>

2126
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.810
<v Speaker 3>And I only think of this because I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw it.</v>

2127
01:57:36.811 --> 01:57:41.811
<v Speaker 3>If you remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I watched the recently to </v>

2128
01:57:41.811 --> 01:57:45.261
<v Speaker 3>refresh my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast where you interviewed John </v>

2129
01:57:45.261 --> 01:57:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Anthony West and he showed a picture </v>
<v Speaker 3>which happened to be my hand.</v>

2130
01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in mY hand was a little bead that </v>

2131
01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:53.070
<v Speaker 3>was founded come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

2132
01:57:53.071 --> 01:57:56.220
<v Speaker 3>remember that little beat had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a very hard,</v>

2133
01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:01.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably volcanic stone and little </v>
<v Speaker 3>teeny hole drilled all the way through </v>

2134
01:58:02.491 --> 01:58:03.420
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the long way.</v>

2135
01:58:03.421 --> 01:58:05.850
<v Speaker 3>So you had a drilling that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2136
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:10.910
<v Speaker 3>a centimeter or more long going through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a little hole punch </v>

2137
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:11.970
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a little tunnel going through.</v>

2138
01:58:11.971 --> 01:58:13.440
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>UM,</v>

2139
01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:19.250
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that with quote primitive </v>

2140
01:58:19.441 --> 01:58:23.490
<v Speaker 3>technology that to me is as amazing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the erection of the pillars,</v>

2141
01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:29.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to look at both small scale </v>

2142
01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.821
<v Speaker 3>and large scale and like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bowls may be something you hold in </v>

2143
01:58:31.821 --> 01:58:31.821
<v Speaker 3>your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just justice.</v>

2144
01:58:31.821 --> 01:58:36.711
<v Speaker 3>Incredible technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like if people were to judge us </v>

2145
01:58:36.711 --> 01:58:37.230
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

2146
01:58:37.231 --> 01:58:42.231
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd say that iphone is incredible </v>

2147
01:58:42.231 --> 01:58:42.231
<v Speaker 3>technology even</v>

2148
01:58:42.231 --> 01:58:43.870
<v Speaker 2>though it's small scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

2149
01:58:43.871 --> 01:58:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess they would maybe say if anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>survives of them,</v>

2150
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:51.961
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some high rise was a incredible in this </v>

2151
01:58:51.961 --> 01:58:53.070
<v Speaker 2>is good beckley [inaudible] that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just pulled up jamie.</v>

2152
01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.840
<v Speaker 2>These images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are these images of?</v>

2153
01:58:55.841 --> 01:59:00.841
<v Speaker 2>Looks like a nail or something called </v>
<v Speaker 2>earplugs or Bugs.</v>

2154
01:59:01.530 --> 01:59:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Some people claim that no one really </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows exactly what they are.</v>

2155
01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Airports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2156
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2157
01:59:07.230 --> 01:59:10.040
<v Speaker 2>not ear plugs and plug your ears are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2158
01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your earrings.</v>

2159
01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2160
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:19.810
<v Speaker 2>they call them buttons there sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the speculation,</v>

2161
01:59:19.850 --> 01:59:21.940
<v Speaker 2>the construction methods of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated bowls.</v>

2162
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:23.860
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do people believe they did,</v>

2163
01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:29.190
<v Speaker 2>but the bolsa Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any speculations or any </v>

2164
01:59:30.610 --> 01:59:35.610
<v Speaker 2>installation is that they may have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>using some kind of lave for it at least </v>

2165
01:59:36.041 --> 01:59:39.640
<v Speaker 2>in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is you can't turn it and</v>

2166
01:59:39.641 --> 01:59:43.460
<v Speaker 2>still have the handle sticking if you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>standard workout,</v>

2167
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:45.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning late type of thing.</v>

2168
01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:49.090
<v Speaker 2>so there's something else that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on there.</v>

2169
01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with any of this knowledge being passed </v>

2170
01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:56.470
<v Speaker 2>down right up into at least the 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>

2171
01:59:56.471 --> 01:59:57.790
<v Speaker 2>early 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>

2172
01:59:57.791 --> 02:00:00.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were guilt systems where you would</v>

2173
02:00:00.341 --> 02:00:05.341
<v Speaker 2>retain knowledge of how you do search </v>
<v Speaker 2>and technological things and I think </v>

2174
02:00:05.921 --> 02:00:10.921
<v Speaker 2>that may go back to very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very ancient times that you don't want </v>

2175
02:00:10.921 --> 02:00:11.360
<v Speaker 2>to just give out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2176
02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:13.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge to anyone,</v>

2177
02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:15.670
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2178
02:00:15.671 --> 02:00:20.671
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard no good compelling and my </v>

2179
02:00:20.671 --> 02:00:22.330
<v Speaker 2>mind explanation as to how these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>were made.</v>

2180
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Now one of the things that they found in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the king's chamber was what they </v>

2181
02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:28.450
<v Speaker 2>referred to as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it a sarcophagus,</v>

2182
02:00:28.451 --> 02:00:30.160
<v Speaker 2>like what they called the chicago </v>
<v Speaker 2>fergus.</v>

2183
02:00:30.161 --> 02:00:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I preferred the term coffer and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of granite.</v>

2184
02:00:33.761 --> 02:00:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Aswan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granite.</v>

2185
02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:39.780
<v Speaker 2>The coffer meaning like almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>treasure chest treasure chest or a big </v>

2186
02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:40.480
<v Speaker 2>chest or brock's that type of thing.</v>

2187
02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:45.480
<v Speaker 2>It's missing its lid and the sarcophagus</v>
<v Speaker 2>represents something that you've put a </v>

2188
02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:45.700
<v Speaker 2>body in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that's correct?</v>

2189
02:00:45.730 --> 02:00:46.420
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2190
02:00:46.421 --> 02:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't like calling it </v>
<v Speaker 2>fergus coffer is more generic,</v>

2191
02:00:50.591 --> 02:00:51.720
<v Speaker 2>should we say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2192
02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>And doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the king's chamber has some of the more </v>

2193
02:00:56.970 --> 02:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>complicated stones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2194
02:00:56.970 --> 02:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2195
02:00:56.970 --> 02:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>it has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's lined with granite.</v>

2196
02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:03.960
<v Speaker 2>So the primary construction material of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2197
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>The primary construction material for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the great pyramid is limestone,</v>

2198
02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:17.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the limestone was quarried </v>

2199
02:01:17.690 --> 02:01:18.250
<v Speaker 2>pretty much onsite and you can still see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quarries there,</v>

2200
02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.000
<v Speaker 2>other high quality limestone known as </v>
<v Speaker 2>tour limestone,</v>

2201
02:01:22.001 --> 02:01:27.001
<v Speaker 2>which brought from across denial and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can still see the turro limestone </v>

2202
02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:32.251
<v Speaker 2>quarries and then granite which used for</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the construction,</v>

2203
02:01:33.130 --> 02:01:36.490
<v Speaker 2>particularly to line the king's chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this grant,</v>

2204
02:01:36.491 --> 02:01:39.110
<v Speaker 2>it was brought from southern Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought up,</v>

2205
02:01:39.650 --> 02:01:41.300
<v Speaker 2>brought down the nile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say,</v>

2206
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:46.510
<v Speaker 2>from the south to the north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now flows from the south to the north </v>

2207
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:49.730
<v Speaker 2>and it's asked one grant and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about huge blocks of stone up to</v>

2208
02:01:49.731 --> 02:01:54.731
<v Speaker 2>90 tons or so have been the estimates </v>
<v Speaker 2>for those particular stones in the </v>

2209
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:55.640
<v Speaker 2>king's chamber.</v>

2210
02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:00.640
<v Speaker 2>So when you go into the king's chAmber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's totally lined with this beautiful </v>

2211
02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>red as juan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Granted,</v>

2212
02:02:01.730 --> 02:02:05.090
<v Speaker 2>you've got this big coffer there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2213
02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:06.950
<v Speaker 2>they give you permission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can lie in.</v>

2214
02:02:06.951 --> 02:02:08.000
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2215
02:02:08.001 --> 02:02:09.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a neat feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2216
02:02:10.110 --> 02:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>to lie in and a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2217
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:14.310
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2218
02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is these,</v>

2219
02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:23.590
<v Speaker 2>this lining is so perfect and so well </v>
<v Speaker 2>fit together and you have this,</v>

2220
02:02:25.210 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2221
02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:28.280
<v Speaker 2>all the sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a roof,</v>

2222
02:02:28.281 --> 02:02:30.470
<v Speaker 2>the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the roof,</v>

2223
02:02:30.471 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 2>the ceiling of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2224
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>the walls of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the floor of it,</v>

2225
02:02:34.701 --> 02:02:37.490
<v Speaker 2>the coffer there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have,</v>

2226
02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call star chefs are air shafts</v>

2227
02:02:40.881 --> 02:02:45.881
<v Speaker 2>that go out to a north and south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what robert has worked on in </v>

2228
02:02:45.881 --> 02:02:47.210
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then above the king's chamber,</v>

2229
02:02:47.211 --> 02:02:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you have the so called relief chambers </v>
<v Speaker 2>or relieving chambers,</v>

2230
02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.220
<v Speaker 2>which you can't get into normally.</v>

2231
02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I've been in there a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2232
02:02:54.411 --> 02:02:59.411
<v Speaker 2>but you have to get special permission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to put a ladder up from the </v>

2233
02:02:59.411 --> 02:03:00.770
<v Speaker 2>grand gallery and you go through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little snake hole,</v>

2234
02:03:00.771 --> 02:03:02.160
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2235
02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:07.240
<v Speaker 2>to get up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's these chambers above it </v>

2236
02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>which seemed to serve no function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're called relief </v>

2237
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:13.640
<v Speaker 2>chambers or relieving chambers because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was early speculation that somehow</v>

2238
02:03:13.641 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they help distribute the weight of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great pyramid,</v>

2239
02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:19.340
<v Speaker 2>but engineering from an engineering </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view,</v>

2240
02:03:19.341 --> 02:03:22.400
<v Speaker 2>they don't seem to work or it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to make any difference.</v>

2241
02:03:22.401 --> 02:03:27.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean the rest of the pyramid solid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>other pyramids are solid and don't </v>

2242
02:03:27.401 --> 02:03:31.631
<v Speaker 2>collapse without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they copy these chamber and It's </v>

2243
02:03:31.631 --> 02:03:35.081
<v Speaker 2>called the king's chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the arabs called it that </v>

2244
02:03:35.081 --> 02:03:36.350
<v Speaker 2>because their concept was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

2245
02:03:36.590 --> 02:03:41.180
<v Speaker 2>that men will have a chamber with a flat</v>
<v Speaker 2>ceiling on it.</v>

2246
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>The queens chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is lower down in the,</v>

2247
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:48.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pyramid has a inverted v shape change </v>

2248
02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:53.540
<v Speaker 2>a ceiling to it and they thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was for the queen.</v>

2249
02:03:53.541 --> 02:03:58.541
<v Speaker 2>That would be female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The king's chamber would be for the </v>

2250
02:03:58.541 --> 02:04:01.481
<v Speaker 2>male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the more impressive chamber </v>

2251
02:04:01.481 --> 02:04:01.790
<v Speaker 2>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Purely speculation.</v>

2252
02:04:01.791 --> 02:04:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's purely spec.</v>

2253
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:04.110
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the coffer,</v>

2254
02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:09.140
<v Speaker 4>this giant stone box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I read was that </v>

2255
02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:12.770
<v Speaker 4>the way it was built,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believed that it was possible that </v>

2256
02:04:12.931 --> 02:04:14.610
<v Speaker 4>cores were drilled out.</v>

2257
02:04:14.670 --> 02:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2258
02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Probably the corn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have good evidence for that going</v>

2259
02:04:18.901 --> 02:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>back to earliest dynastic times of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier that they,</v>

2260
02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:28.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what you call it in modern </v>

2261
02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:28.240
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2262
02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:31.971
<v Speaker 2>you have a drill bit that is circular in</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape and it drills out a core.</v>

2263
02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:35.400
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were drilling granite.</v>

2264
02:04:35.610 --> 02:04:36.690
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2265
02:04:36.691 --> 02:04:41.691
<v Speaker 2>if it's on display,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could show you in the egyptian museum </v>

2266
02:04:41.691 --> 02:04:42.420
<v Speaker 2>in cairo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sarcophagi guy,</v>

2267
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:48.200
<v Speaker 2>which probably really worse or carf a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy or at these big granite boxes where </v>

2268
02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:49.980
<v Speaker 2>they were signed the granite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2269
02:04:49.981 --> 02:04:52.800
<v Speaker 2>not only were they saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like they were using high speed</v>

2270
02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:57.801
<v Speaker 2>saws because in some cases they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a little mistake and then have to </v>

2271
02:04:57.801 --> 02:05:01.080
<v Speaker 2>back off and then go at it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that if you're,</v>

2272
02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:03.810
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing it by hand,</v>

2273
02:05:03.811 --> 02:05:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth with a,</v>

2274
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of machinery involved.</v>

2275
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:11.970
<v Speaker 2>There's some kind of machining they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>using.</v>

2276
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:14.280
<v Speaker 2>And very ancient times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2277
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 2>once you open your eyes to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it.</v>

2278
02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Where you see it seems to be high speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinery.</v>

2279
02:05:21.601 --> 02:05:23.670
<v Speaker 2>There's no regulation as to how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2280
02:05:23.671 --> 02:05:25.260
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2281
02:05:25.261 --> 02:05:30.261
<v Speaker 2>some people say they had electric motors</v>
<v Speaker 2>and electricity and all that type of </v>

2282
02:05:30.261 --> 02:05:30.810
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people.</v>

2283
02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people I don't go there because I </v>

2284
02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:38.151
<v Speaker 2>want real evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I see real evidence that they were </v>

2285
02:05:38.151 --> 02:05:41.751
<v Speaker 2>doing things that seem really </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable from a standard status quo </v>

2286
02:05:44.791 --> 02:05:49.020
<v Speaker 2>conventional point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that standard Egypt logical point of</v>

2287
02:05:49.021 --> 02:05:51.180
<v Speaker 2>view of how cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how primitive they were.</v>

2288
02:05:51.690 --> 02:05:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not into speculating in </v>

2289
02:05:56.690 --> 02:05:59.901
<v Speaker 2>ordinarily as to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what kind of technology they might </v>

2290
02:05:59.901 --> 02:06:00.390
<v Speaker 2>have had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know at this point.</v>

2291
02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are images of the inside of the</v>

2292
02:06:03.451 --> 02:06:08.451
<v Speaker 2>sarcophagus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we could get a look at what that </v>

2293
02:06:08.451 --> 02:06:08.451
<v Speaker 2>looks like.</v>

2294
02:06:08.451 --> 02:06:08.451
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not very impressive.</v>

2295
02:06:08.451 --> 02:06:12.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he can probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can see the drill </v>

2296
02:06:12.651 --> 02:06:12.651
<v Speaker 2>marks they have essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2297
02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2298
02:06:15.151 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see other places.</v>

2299
02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:23.060
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we go into the valley temple next </v>

2300
02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:28.011
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one of the doors that was on </v>

2301
02:06:28.011 --> 02:06:31.311
<v Speaker 2>huge hinges and I don't think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to find pictures of this on the </v>

2302
02:06:31.311 --> 02:06:33.070
<v Speaker 2>internet because it's very hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>photograph a,</v>

2303
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at that in person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see how they drilled out,</v>

2304
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:40.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hinge several,</v>

2305
02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:44.970
<v Speaker 2>several inches in diameter and did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>core drill because you can still see,</v>

2306
02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>if I remember there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still see the sort of the stub </v>

2307
02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>where it broke off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>

2308
02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see how they were using </v>

2309
02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:56.540
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated techniques to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no idea whatsoever.</v>

2310
02:06:56.541 --> 02:06:58.470
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know what cad.</v>

2311
02:06:58.740 --> 02:06:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it this way,</v>

2312
02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:01.560
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is.</v>

2313
02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not speculating that they had such </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2314
02:07:03.751 --> 02:07:08.670
<v Speaker 2>but you can tell in modern times that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone used a power,</v>

2315
02:07:08.671 --> 02:07:11.820
<v Speaker 2>saw a power drill or this type of tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of tool.</v>

2316
02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to still see that in </v>

2317
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.330
<v Speaker 2>this table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2318
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:22.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm like beyond interpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have a single example of </v>

2319
02:07:22.191 --> 02:07:22.740
<v Speaker 2>the tool that was actually used for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2320
02:07:22.810 --> 02:07:24.960
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know these guys.</v>

2321
02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes almost find it silly when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

2322
02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:29.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

2323
02:07:29.731 --> 02:07:31.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this how could out there.</v>

2324
02:07:31.621 --> 02:07:33.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a nice example of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2325
02:07:33.871 --> 02:07:35.680
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good example.</v>

2326
02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:40.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually probably the one I was </v>

2327
02:07:40.681 --> 02:07:42.241
<v Speaker 2>just talking about us as a bore hole and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the,</v>

2328
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:48.390
<v Speaker 2>how it was spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see how they were cutting down </v>

2329
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.390
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit in each turn.</v>

2330
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:49.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2331
02:07:49.241 --> 02:07:51.820
<v Speaker 2>so I almost find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't almost find.</v>

2332
02:07:51.821 --> 02:07:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I do find it silly sometimes when people</v>
<v Speaker 2>say to me the critics or skeptics,</v>

2333
02:07:56.290 --> 02:07:56.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2334
02:07:56.831 --> 02:07:58.180
<v Speaker 2>if they were doing all of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

2335
02:07:58.181 --> 02:08:01.950
<v Speaker 2>where's examples of their tools?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>

2336
02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:03.690
<v Speaker 2>How many guys just leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2337
02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 2>they walk away from a site and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave their buck toolbox.</v>

2338
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:10.150
<v Speaker 2>There are even our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget.</v>

2339
02:08:10.151 --> 02:08:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

2340
02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:14.770
<v Speaker 2>all the mechanics I've ever known and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like that,</v>

2341
02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:20.250
<v Speaker 2>they're very careful to pick up every </v>
<v Speaker 2>tool and put it back and make sure </v>

2342
02:08:20.250 --> 02:08:24.181
<v Speaker 2>they've got all their equipment will go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the building and try to find a </v>

2343
02:08:24.181 --> 02:08:24.181
<v Speaker 2>hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2344
02:08:24.181 --> 02:08:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2345
02:08:24.461 --> 02:08:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2346
02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:27.970
<v Speaker 2>that completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

2347
02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I would just like to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what were they doing and how did </v>

2348
02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:34.480
<v Speaker 2>they make that whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2349
02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:38.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive mr right in front of everyone's </v>

2350
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.790
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2351
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:39.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2352
02:08:39.251 --> 02:08:43.570
<v Speaker 2>What's the standard eds egyptologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation.</v>

2353
02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:51.340
<v Speaker 2>They just really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just shrug their shoulders all we </v>

2354
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:51.340
<v Speaker 2>see that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2355
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:52.030
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see it all the time,</v>

2356
02:08:52.031 --> 02:08:54.540
<v Speaker 2>but it reminds me of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2357
02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:57.430
<v Speaker 2>this is maybe silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to say it any way.</v>

2358
02:08:57.850 --> 02:08:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2359
02:08:59.011 --> 02:08:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2360
02:08:59.651 --> 02:09:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A supposedly a analogy.</v>

2361
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:07.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2362
02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:09.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're used to something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it this way.</v>

2363
02:09:09.401 --> 02:09:11.980
<v Speaker 2>If you're used to seeing something on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular basis,</v>

2364
02:09:11.981 --> 02:09:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stop questioning.</v>

2365
02:09:13.931 --> 02:09:15.950
<v Speaker 2>It just becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2366
02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:21.380
<v Speaker 2>common to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't really question it.</v>

2367
02:09:21.381 --> 02:09:26.381
<v Speaker 2>It's like technology today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people could explain how even </v>

2368
02:09:26.381 --> 02:09:29.200
<v Speaker 2>the most rudimentary sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how some of the technology works that we</v>

2369
02:09:29.201 --> 02:09:31.750
<v Speaker 2>have today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The egyptologist seemed to.</v>

2370
02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:37.320
<v Speaker 2>They just get immune to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see all this fabulous stuff and </v>

2371
02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:40.741
<v Speaker 2>they just forget that will this was made</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow we don't really know how it was </v>

2372
02:09:40.741 --> 02:09:40.741
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

2373
02:09:40.741 --> 02:09:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Then they again go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplistic explanations of,</v>

2374
02:09:46.031 --> 02:09:46.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2375
02:09:46.491 --> 02:09:50.710
<v Speaker 2>on some new kingdom or late period we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this illustration.</v>

2376
02:09:50.711 --> 02:09:55.711
<v Speaker 2>This must be how they did it and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that that's always how they </v>

2377
02:09:55.711 --> 02:09:58.210
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost just to look a little cartoon.</v>

2378
02:09:58.260 --> 02:09:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they have any illustrators?</v>

2379
02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:05.560
<v Speaker 2>They would have a drill and some stones </v>
<v Speaker 2>around it as a wage to keep it spinning.</v>

2380
02:10:07.511 --> 02:10:08.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that.</v>

2381
02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have had.</v>

2382
02:10:11.110 --> 02:10:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2383
02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that's just purely </v>

2384
02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>speculation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2385
02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:19.921
<v Speaker 2>Or it could be sort of the equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern cartoons of a,</v>

2386
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:25.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple explanation of how something </v>

2387
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:27.010
<v Speaker 2>works and a lot of that is really more </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

2388
02:10:27.011 --> 02:10:29.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a watchmaker,</v>

2389
02:10:29.081 --> 02:10:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I say 200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a watchmaker,</v>

2390
02:10:31.451 --> 02:10:34.820
<v Speaker 2>you might have some sign that indicates </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a watchmaker,</v>

2391
02:10:35.210 --> 02:10:40.210
<v Speaker 2>but don't try to take that sign is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blueprint of how you actually made </v>

2392
02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:40.210
<v Speaker 2>watches.</v>

2393
02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2394
02:10:40.670 --> 02:10:41.660
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2395
02:10:41.661 --> 02:10:42.650
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2396
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

2397
02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:51.200
<v Speaker 2>when they constructed that coffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they somehow or another board,</v>

2398
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:56.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably board down maybe board in </v>

2399
02:10:56.290 --> 02:10:56.290
<v Speaker 2>the quarters board down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke out pieces,</v>

2400
02:10:56.290 --> 02:11:01.001
<v Speaker 2>this a speculation now and broke it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once you've got it roughed out,</v>

2401
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:04.610
<v Speaker 2>then polished the surfaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of thing.</v>

2402
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

2403
02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:11.150
<v Speaker 2>if you leave any traces of how it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually constructed,</v>

2404
02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:14.970
<v Speaker 2>that's not as good as if there are no </v>
<v Speaker 2>trace.</v>

2405
02:11:14.971 --> 02:11:15.830
<v Speaker 2>It's more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2406
02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:19.370
<v Speaker 2>it's not as good a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at something like the statue of</v>

2407
02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:24.371
<v Speaker 2>kafra or chef ron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is credible statue and the egyptian</v>

2408
02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 2>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2409
02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:31.780
<v Speaker 2>it's the one that has the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharaoh that supposedly was the face of </v>

2410
02:11:31.881 --> 02:11:36.881
<v Speaker 2>the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they don't match up at all as the </v>

2411
02:11:36.881 --> 02:11:36.881
<v Speaker 2>hawk control has a haka shoulders.</v>

2412
02:11:36.881 --> 02:11:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that statue is absolutely incredible.</v>

2413
02:11:40.701 --> 02:11:43.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so smoothly polished,</v>

2414
02:11:43.170 --> 02:11:48.170
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to look very hard to find a </v>

2415
02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:50.340
<v Speaker 2>tool marks or evidence of how it was car</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

2416
02:11:50.341 --> 02:11:55.341
<v Speaker 2>a really good work and ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remove all that ultimately.</v>

2417
02:11:56.870 --> 02:12:01.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of the problem with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this really high quality egyptian </v>

2418
02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:05.270
<v Speaker 2>work is that they would remove the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traces.</v>

2419
02:12:05.271 --> 02:12:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

2420
02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:07.370
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2421
02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:12.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would remove the traces of how it </v>

2422
02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:15.770
<v Speaker 2>was made in that image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing on the side of it,</v>

2423
02:12:15.771 --> 02:12:18.020
<v Speaker 2>you see that sort of plasma formation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2424
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:20.420
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this ties in.</v>

2425
02:12:20.421 --> 02:12:25.421
<v Speaker 2>This is why I brought image of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it ties in with that whole </v>

2426
02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:29.000
<v Speaker 2>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2427
02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:30.530
<v Speaker 2>it has the circle said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2428
02:12:30.531 --> 02:12:32.090
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very observant.</v>

2429
02:12:32.091 --> 02:12:37.091
<v Speaker 2>And think about the bird headed man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hoc and this incredible statue.</v>

2430
02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:43.190
<v Speaker 2>If you feel it face on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see the bird from the side.</v>

2431
02:12:43.190 --> 02:12:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You see the bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2432
02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:48.220
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this stuff is so fascinating,</v>

2433
02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:53.240
<v Speaker 2>so I think it really all goes back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this very early formative period.</v>

2434
02:12:54.471 --> 02:12:59.471
<v Speaker 2>If you would this really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>period for humanity and what was </v>

2435
02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:03.671
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a head on view and there you </v>

2436
02:13:03.671 --> 02:13:04.160
<v Speaker 2>don't see the bird at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2437
02:13:04.610 --> 02:13:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And tammy carve something like that </v>

2438
02:13:09.610 --> 02:13:10.490
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it would cost,</v>

2439
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:12.740
<v Speaker 2>who you could pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard,</v>

2440
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:15.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is anecdotal,</v>

2441
02:13:15.021 --> 02:13:18.950
<v Speaker 2>but I've talked to his stone cutters and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of thing and you know,</v>

2442
02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:23.750
<v Speaker 2>to try to duplicate some of what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>see in Egypt.</v>

2443
02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just would take them so long </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so much work and it would be so </v>

2444
02:13:30.501 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 2>expensive with modern power</v>

2445
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:35.190
<v Speaker 3>tools that they basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2446
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:36.000
<v Speaker 3>who could do it?</v>

2447
02:13:36.110 --> 02:13:37.920
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any fear that this is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to?</v>

2448
02:13:37.930 --> 02:13:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Disinformation is going to be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that you're so far down this </v>

2449
02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:47.741
<v Speaker 4>track of sort of explaining these things</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these revolutionary theories about </v>

2450
02:13:48.981 --> 02:13:51.530
<v Speaker 4>what happened and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>

2451
02:13:51.531 --> 02:13:56.531
<v Speaker 4>I been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been studying this for a long time </v>

2452
02:13:56.531 --> 02:13:56.531
<v Speaker 4>and this is the first time I'm hearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2453
02:13:56.531 --> 02:14:01.170
<v Speaker 3>so that's why I need to be on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you're here to get this out </v>

2454
02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:01.870
<v Speaker 3>into the public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2455
02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:06.940
<v Speaker 4>You're so far down this road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there anyone else is doing the same </v>

2456
02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:08.060
<v Speaker 4>kind of work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does anybody else's with you on this?</v>

2457
02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:13.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm the one that's doing this </v>

2458
02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:16.311
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there are a lot of other </v>

2459
02:14:16.311 --> 02:14:16.980
<v Speaker 3>pieces that tie in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So per dr parata work,</v>

2460
02:14:16.981 --> 02:14:18.540
<v Speaker 3>but he served,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

2461
02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:23.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had some health issues and other </v>

2462
02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:23.660
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's older.</v>

2463
02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm the electric universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's what's known as the electric </v>

2464
02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:31.221
<v Speaker 3>universe community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which ties in with this that a </v>

2465
02:14:31.221 --> 02:14:33.360
<v Speaker 3>electrical phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plasma discharges are more important.</v>

2466
02:14:33.630 --> 02:14:36.170
<v Speaker 3>There is a whole group now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2467
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:41.270
<v Speaker 3>that I think are starting to think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if we had another carrington event </v>

2468
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:45.060
<v Speaker 3>in the new future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would that affect our grid systems?</v>

2469
02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:48.810
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm saying is I think there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of little pieces that are starting</v>

2470
02:14:48.811 --> 02:14:53.220
<v Speaker 3>to come together and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to come together,</v>

2471
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:56.610
<v Speaker 3>weaving this together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm trying to do right now,</v>

2472
02:14:56.611 --> 02:15:01.611
<v Speaker 3>it's to paint the broad picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the broad strokes and I think it goes </v>

2473
02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:06.150
<v Speaker 3>back to the end of the last ice age and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what was happening then,</v>

2474
02:15:06.450 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 3>right up until now and what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>implications are</v>

2475
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:15.950
<v Speaker 4>and how is this being received.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are people picking up on that for </v>

2476
02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:16.490
<v Speaker 4>picking</v>

2477
02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:19.020
<v Speaker 3>up on it and sometimes the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2478
02:15:19.021 --> 02:15:20.730
<v Speaker 3>people are picking up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

2479
02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:22.840
<v Speaker 3>how did they say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sincereness,</v>

2480
02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:28.620
<v Speaker 3>was it copying someone or is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sincerest form of flattery,</v>

2481
02:15:31.050 --> 02:15:36.050
<v Speaker 3>imitation that should imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do find and I'm kind of sometimes </v>

2482
02:15:36.050 --> 02:15:38.580
<v Speaker 3>get a little annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2483
02:15:38.581 --> 02:15:40.950
<v Speaker 3>People are starting to talk about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these things,</v>

2484
02:15:41.070 --> 02:15:46.070
<v Speaker 3>especially the plasma and the sun and </v>
<v Speaker 3>solar events and all of a sudden by </v>

2485
02:15:46.070 --> 02:15:49.020
<v Speaker 3>chance they're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily mentioning me,</v>

2486
02:15:49.021 --> 02:15:51.000
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2487
02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I know they tend to lecture or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe read my book.</v>

2488
02:15:54.451 --> 02:15:59.451
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things take time and I'm not </v>

2489
02:15:59.451 --> 02:15:59.451
<v Speaker 3>asking for a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2490
02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:01.850
<v Speaker 3>everyone has to acknowledge me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2491
02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:07.280
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's important to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information out and I think as we have </v>

2492
02:16:07.290 --> 02:16:12.290
<v Speaker 3>things like your podcast and people read</v>
<v Speaker 3>the books and I'm able to talk at </v>

2493
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:13.800
<v Speaker 3>conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we slowly get this out.</v>

2494
02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2495
02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:16.050
<v Speaker 3>it takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all takes time.</v>

2496
02:16:16.070 --> 02:16:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Made me put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Copernicus,</v>

2497
02:16:18.541 --> 02:16:20.700
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not comparing myself to </v>
<v Speaker 3>copernicus,</v>

2498
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:26.030
<v Speaker 3>but copernicus and the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heliocentric view,</v>

2499
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:32.290
<v Speaker 3>now he publishes that on his death bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a view that actually went back </v>

2500
02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:33.130
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2501
02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 3>there were predecessors in ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

2502
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:40.381
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he published his on his death bed </v>

2503
02:16:40.381 --> 02:16:40.560
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2504
02:16:40.570 --> 02:16:45.570
<v Speaker 3>a couple generations later they're still</v>
<v Speaker 3>persecuting galileo for supporting it.</v>

2505
02:16:45.791 --> 02:16:47.530
<v Speaker 3>So these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2506
02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.990
<v Speaker 3>things go quicker now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2507
02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 3>But it still takes some time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a big difference now,</v>

2508
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:59.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than I do in the 19 nineties for even </v>

2509
02:16:59.150 --> 02:17:00.100
<v Speaker 3>the reading of the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

2510
02:17:00.101 --> 02:17:02.660
<v Speaker 3>is because of the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2511
02:17:02.661 --> 02:17:05.470
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2512
02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:08.410
<v Speaker 3>the internet helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have mixed feelings about the internet</v>

2513
02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:12.160
<v Speaker 3>because the problem with the internet is</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can disseminate information,</v>

2514
02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:17.730
<v Speaker 3>you get information out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean it's good </v>

2515
02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:19.480
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get the naysayers,</v>

2516
02:17:19.481 --> 02:17:21.430
<v Speaker 3>the critics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the skeptics,</v>

2517
02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:23.860
<v Speaker 3>they have access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fake news,</v>

2518
02:17:23.890 --> 02:17:25.750
<v Speaker 3>fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and genuine</v>

2519
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.000
<v Speaker 2>news versus real fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems that so many times they're </v>

2520
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:31.850
<v Speaker 2>flipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very much.</v>

2521
02:17:32.330 --> 02:17:36.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the problems I see</v>

2522
02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:41.380
<v Speaker 3>with all this information and </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinformation and all these factoids </v>

2523
02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:45.461
<v Speaker 3>out there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very confusing for many people if </v>

2524
02:17:45.461 --> 02:17:46.040
<v Speaker 3>they're not involved in something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2525
02:17:46.041 --> 02:17:51.041
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to claim you have to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to experts and authorities because </v>

2526
02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:52.910
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have the pseudo authorities who</v>

2527
02:17:52.911 --> 02:17:57.911
<v Speaker 3>just are pushing their own agendas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>frankly don't know what they're talking </v>

2528
02:17:57.911 --> 02:18:01.751
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I see too many of that among we'll </v>

2529
02:18:01.751 --> 02:18:03.260
<v Speaker 3>say certain academics and skeptics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>

2530
02:18:03.730 --> 02:18:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also confusing when you only </v>

2531
02:18:08.730 --> 02:18:12.310
<v Speaker 3>take information and you don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 3>put altogether.</v>

2532
02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:13.690
<v Speaker 3>So I teach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2533
02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:17.480
<v Speaker 3>I teach in university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I teach college at boston university and</v>

2534
02:18:17.481 --> 02:18:21.140
<v Speaker 3>what I find with students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not picking on them,</v>

2535
02:18:21.141 --> 02:18:26.141
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying this with all due respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have so much access to facts and </v>

2536
02:18:26.141 --> 02:18:27.470
<v Speaker 3>factoids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll use that term,</v>

2537
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:30.230
<v Speaker 3>but they have to understand the bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>

2538
02:18:30.231 --> 02:18:34.550
<v Speaker 3>They have to be able to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>critically and think critically about it</v>

2539
02:18:34.551 --> 02:18:36.590
<v Speaker 3>to put things together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2540
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:41.690
<v Speaker 3>and how does it all fit together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's so important.</v>

2541
02:18:41.691 --> 02:18:46.691
<v Speaker 3>And that's not something I think you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>just from surfing the internet,</v>

2542
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:48.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2543
02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2544
02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Watching a couple of youtube videos by </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that's not necessarily reliable,</v>

2545
02:18:54.541 --> 02:18:55.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2546
02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:59.390
<v Speaker 2>How much misinformation that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread through youtube more.</v>

2547
02:18:59.430 --> 02:19:02.030
<v Speaker 2>More than good information probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2548
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:07.070
<v Speaker 2>we could put on some fake lab coats </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and just make some nonsense </v>

2549
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:09.180
<v Speaker 2>video views by not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And see,</v>

2550
02:19:09.181 --> 02:19:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I've had the problem too in my business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2551
02:19:12.721 --> 02:19:17.721
<v Speaker 2>what I'm talking about is that they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't please everyone all the time.</v>

2552
02:19:18.510 --> 02:19:21.720
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like in some cases in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

2553
02:19:21.721 --> 02:19:26.721
<v Speaker 2>in this field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been able to displease every one </v>

2554
02:19:26.721 --> 02:19:29.510
<v Speaker 2>because I'll come out with position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry I'm losing my headset.</v>

2555
02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll come out with position sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm not pleasing my academic </v>

2556
02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:36.890
<v Speaker 2>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not extreme enough for the.</v>

2557
02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Should we say other sites either also </v>
<v Speaker 2>like caught in the middle because I'm </v>

2558
02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:44.740
<v Speaker 2>going by the evidence I actually have </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2559
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:47.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not jiving with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to speak.</v>

2560
02:19:47.121 --> 02:19:48.950
<v Speaker 2>The foil hat brigade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2561
02:19:48.970 --> 02:19:53.970
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that received by the people that </v>

2562
02:19:53.970 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 2>mean there are those ancient aliens type</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks that really want everything.</v>

2563
02:19:55.911 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 2>They want everything to be ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>

2564
02:19:57.921 --> 02:20:01.520
<v Speaker 2>And I've been accused of how could I not</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept this or that,</v>

2565
02:20:01.521 --> 02:20:06.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they get really mad at me and </v>

2566
02:20:06.521 --> 02:20:08.390
<v Speaker 2>they say nasty son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll even tell me,</v>

2567
02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:13.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this supports what everything you've </v>

2568
02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:15.071
<v Speaker 2>been saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if it supports everything </v>

2569
02:20:15.071 --> 02:20:15.071
<v Speaker 2>I've been saved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

2570
02:20:15.071 --> 02:20:15.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not real evidence isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2571
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:21.670
<v Speaker 2>It is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do dig up these ancient structures </v>

2572
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:22.850
<v Speaker 2>and the machu picchu and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different places were like,</v>

2573
02:20:22.851 --> 02:20:27.851
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these construction methods are really </v>

2574
02:20:27.851 --> 02:20:27.851
<v Speaker 2>pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

2575
02:20:27.851 --> 02:20:31.170
<v Speaker 2>It was going on back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they always want to tie it to </v>

2576
02:20:31.170 --> 02:20:31.170
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always want to tie it to aliens,</v>

2577
02:20:31.170 --> 02:20:31.880
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a.</v>

2578
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I hate to use this term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sure of a cop out.</v>

2579
02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a business.</v>

2580
02:20:37.690 --> 02:20:40.430
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets down to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is business.</v>

2581
02:20:40.431 --> 02:20:43.570
<v Speaker 2>People want to sell their books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to sell in their conference.</v>

2582
02:20:43.571 --> 02:20:48.571
<v Speaker 2>Just they were settled their dvds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to sell their youtube videos </v>

2583
02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:51.770
<v Speaker 2>and in some cases they want to sell for </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2584
02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:54.980
<v Speaker 2>In some cases they want to sell for </v>
<v Speaker 2>promotion,</v>

2585
02:20:54.981 --> 02:20:57.410
<v Speaker 2>self promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they want to be famous.</v>

2586
02:20:57.530 --> 02:21:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I told you I was accused of that back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties.</v>

2587
02:21:02.770 --> 02:21:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just doing this place.</v>

2588
02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2589
02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:09.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that type of person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people love those shows.</v>

2590
02:21:09.171 --> 02:21:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Those ufo in ancient alien type shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they love those conferences.</v>

2591
02:21:13.821 --> 02:21:17.420
<v Speaker 2>They go to those conferences and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>all just mentally masturbate together.</v>

2592
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're all like,</v>

2593
02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:22.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>

2594
02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:27.170
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was exCiting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it does fill a void for some</v>

2595
02:21:27.171 --> 02:21:31.700
<v Speaker 2>people and one thing I'm trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fill that void with something real,</v>

2596
02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:33.350
<v Speaker 2>something important.</v>

2597
02:21:33.350 --> 02:21:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Something thAt has evidence to back it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up because there are a lot of the </v>

2598
02:21:38.350 --> 02:21:43.331
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of mysteries and I will </v>

2599
02:21:43.331 --> 02:21:43.430
<v Speaker 2>admit I've been on the ancient aliens </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

2600
02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:47.510
<v Speaker 2>but I've never proposed ancient aliens </v>
<v Speaker 2>have never supported that.</v>

2601
02:21:47.511 --> 02:21:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I've always been clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People actually listened to me,</v>

2602
02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:53.210
<v Speaker 2>but they asked me to be on in a number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of other academics have to.</v>

2603
02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Do they kick you out of context a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit?</v>

2604
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2605
02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.140
<v Speaker 2>the context is not slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slippery,</v>

2606
02:22:00.350 --> 02:22:05.350
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that there are real </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery to this day.</v>

2607
02:22:05.691 --> 02:22:10.691
<v Speaker 2>Things that we don't really understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you and I have been discussing </v>

2608
02:22:10.691 --> 02:22:11.120
<v Speaker 2>about and there's so many more we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss,</v>

2609
02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:16.540
<v Speaker 2>but those are real and so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know that watched shows like </v>

2610
02:22:16.941 --> 02:22:21.941
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I talked to them and I'm talking </v>

2611
02:22:21.941 --> 02:22:21.941
<v Speaker 2>academics who would never admit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they watch it,</v>

2612
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:24.020
<v Speaker 2>they watch it because they find it </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining,</v>

2613
02:22:24.021 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't quite say it this way,</v>

2614
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:31.070
<v Speaker 3>but I think it fills a void and it does </v>
<v Speaker 3>raise issues that if they're perceptive,</v>

2615
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:35.700
<v Speaker 3>then they might become aware of and </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that these are real issues.</v>

2616
02:22:35.701 --> 02:22:40.701
<v Speaker 3>No ancient aliens or some other easy </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer is not the way to go,</v>

2617
02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:46.200
<v Speaker 3>but they are real things that need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked into.</v>

2618
02:22:46.290 --> 02:22:48.840
<v Speaker 3>So even when I speak at a conference </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2619
02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:53.310
<v Speaker 3>there are so many very intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are there besides the other,</v>

2620
02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.650
<v Speaker 3>but you know they're different types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2621
02:22:55.651 --> 02:22:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know many people,</v>

2622
02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:02.600
<v Speaker 3>they'll have phds and stuff and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to it for a serve between </v>

2623
02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:05.991
<v Speaker 3>entertainment but also to get exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>things they're not going to be exposed </v>

2624
02:23:06.541 --> 02:23:11.541
<v Speaker 3>to by the standard academic community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get exposed to a lot</v>

2625
02:23:13.011 --> 02:23:15.360
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These types of questions.</v>

2626
02:23:15.361 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 3>If you just go to the standard closed </v>
<v Speaker 3>academic conferences,</v>

2627
02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:21.330
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be washed over.</v>

2628
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:22.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2629
02:23:22.351 --> 02:23:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm part what on trying to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>oracle,</v>

2630
02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:29.160
<v Speaker 3>the organization for the research of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient cultures,</v>

2631
02:23:29.161 --> 02:23:31.260
<v Speaker 3>which is not just me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be clear on that.</v>

2632
02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:32.190
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2633
02:23:32.191 --> 02:23:35.700
<v Speaker 3>our president is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2634
02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:36.900
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's actually,</v>

2635
02:23:36.901 --> 02:23:40.770
<v Speaker 3>I guess heavy metal guitar player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really berkeley trained.</v>

2636
02:23:40.771 --> 02:23:42.000
<v Speaker 3>He's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2637
02:23:42.001 --> 02:23:42.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean seriously,</v>

2638
02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:48.200
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a really bright guy and he's </v>

2639
02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:50.481
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have people like jocelyn godwin from </v>

2640
02:23:50.481 --> 02:23:54.640
<v Speaker 3>colgate university who's a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>renowned scholar on the visory board.</v>

2641
02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we're trying to do with things </v>

2642
02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:02.610
<v Speaker 3>like oracle and I will encourage people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to actually look at it because we've got</v>

2643
02:24:02.611 --> 02:24:04.980
<v Speaker 3>a website up that you can go through my </v>
<v Speaker 3>website,</v>

2644
02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:09.560
<v Speaker 3>www.robertschoch.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get there or um,</v>

2645
02:24:10.050 --> 02:24:14.670
<v Speaker 3>go directly to us@www.oracle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2646
02:24:14.671 --> 02:24:15.720
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

2647
02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Or coal online o r a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c u l online.</v>

2648
02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2649
02:24:21.691 --> 02:24:26.691
<v Speaker 3>all one word.org.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we're trying to do with this </v>

2650
02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:32.700
<v Speaker 3>and also through the institute for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>study of the origins of civilization,</v>

2651
02:24:32.701 --> 02:24:33.660
<v Speaker 3>iso,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soc,</v>

2652
02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:35.520
<v Speaker 3>which I'm trying to do at boston </v>
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>

2653
02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:40.320
<v Speaker 3>is to have a forum where we can look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>these real topics,</v>

2654
02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:44.250
<v Speaker 3>these topics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these topic seriously using evidence,</v>

2655
02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.400
<v Speaker 3>but not all but also not be dismissive </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because we have to uphold the </v>

2656
02:24:49.621 --> 02:24:54.621
<v Speaker 3>standard dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want to go with just a </v>

2657
02:24:54.621 --> 02:24:54.621
<v Speaker 3>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2658
02:24:54.621 --> 02:24:59.040
<v Speaker 3>flippant or easy out to sell someone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>book that,</v>

2659
02:24:59.070 --> 02:25:01.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy book or yeah,</v>

2660
02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:03.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being nasty about anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2661
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:08.370
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just stick to the standard pair of time,</v>

2662
02:25:08.371 --> 02:25:11.460
<v Speaker 3>but thinking out of the box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as they say,</v>

2663
02:25:11.461 --> 02:25:15.540
<v Speaker 3>but thinking out of the box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using real evidence and using real logic</v>

2664
02:25:15.541 --> 02:25:20.380
<v Speaker 3>and using real rationality to look at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of these issues,</v>

2665
02:25:20.390 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 3>they're more resistance towards a </v>
<v Speaker 3>redating</v>

2666
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Egypt and Egypt technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly ancient Egypt versus other </v>

2667
02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:30.520
<v Speaker 2>cultures like go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back,</v>

2668
02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>like tap a and some other ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that they're finding a tap a.</v>

2669
02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.980
<v Speaker 2>The Beauty of rebecca tap bay is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cd attached to it.</v>

2670
02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:44.100
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dating of rebecca tap is the dating </v>

2671
02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:48.040
<v Speaker 2>that is based on hard strategic rfi </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiocarbon dates,</v>

2672
02:25:48.250 --> 02:25:50.920
<v Speaker 2>german archeological institute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

2673
02:25:50.921 --> 02:25:55.921
<v Speaker 2>it's because it was pr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was purposely purposefully covered </v>

2674
02:25:55.921 --> 02:25:57.520
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus years ago.</v>

2675
02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.000
<v Speaker 2>And in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ties back to our bigger picture.</v>

2676
02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:06.180
<v Speaker 2>You have evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have evidence of catastrophe at </v>

2677
02:26:06.180 --> 02:26:10.770
<v Speaker 2>rebecca beckley tap bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have evidence that the pillars were </v>

2678
02:26:10.770 --> 02:26:12.700
<v Speaker 2>knocked down and hastily re-erected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2679
02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:16.630
<v Speaker 2>and you can see that in the pillars they</v>
<v Speaker 2>built these.</v>

2680
02:26:16.690 --> 02:26:18.010
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a picture up there.</v>

2681
02:26:18.011 --> 02:26:21.220
<v Speaker 2>If you can see the pillar on the far on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right side,</v>

2682
02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 2>that is not an archeological </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstruction.</v>

2683
02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:27.400
<v Speaker 2>That pillar was knocked down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was put back into position,</v>

2684
02:26:27.401 --> 02:26:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but you can see how it was put back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>position crudely,</v>

2685
02:26:30.490 --> 02:26:35.490
<v Speaker 2>using fragments of another pillar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they built these crude walls to </v>

2686
02:26:35.951 --> 02:26:37.540
<v Speaker 2>serve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold the pillars up.</v>

2687
02:26:37.541 --> 02:26:39.280
<v Speaker 2>They butted against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2688
02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:44.520
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is happening and the dating </v>

2689
02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:46.951
<v Speaker 2>confirms it in the aftermath of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>initial solar outburst at the end of the</v>

2690
02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:49.660
<v Speaker 2>last ice age when you had all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>tumultuous,</v>

2691
02:26:50.410 --> 02:26:52.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2692
02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:53.450
<v Speaker 2>things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2693
02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:57.790
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this the precipitation,</v>

2694
02:26:57.791 --> 02:27:00.580
<v Speaker 2>the rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fire coming down the thunder.</v>

2695
02:27:00.850 --> 02:27:05.850
<v Speaker 2>So you have this incredible situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we have captured at beckley tap </v>

2696
02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:11.360
<v Speaker 2>bay the catastrophe that was going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how they were trying to reconstruct </v>

2697
02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:12.580
<v Speaker 2>it and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say that gave up,</v>

2698
02:27:12.581 --> 02:27:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably just so much.</v>

2699
02:27:14.951 --> 02:27:17.830
<v Speaker 2>They ended up covering the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificially.</v>

2700
02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe to preserve it.</v>

2701
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they intended to go back to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe for posterity.</v>

2702
02:27:23.621 --> 02:27:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their thinking was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could speculate about that,</v>

2703
02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but tying in with what you were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking,</v>

2704
02:27:31.690 --> 02:27:36.690
<v Speaker 2>beckley tap bay is not tied to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other later civilization as is dynastic </v>

2705
02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of dogma involved.</v>

2706
02:27:41.950 --> 02:27:44.530
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dogma there is involved.</v>

2707
02:27:44.531 --> 02:27:49.531
<v Speaker 2>How sophisticated is is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BeckleY tap a and you know those that </v>

2708
02:27:49.531 --> 02:27:51.610
<v Speaker 2>want to uphold the standard story </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2709
02:27:51.611 --> 02:27:52.960
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty,</v>

2710
02:27:52.961 --> 02:27:57.961
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissive data as hunter gatherers.</v>

2711
02:27:58.510 --> 02:28:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called hunter gatherers and they </v>

2712
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.510
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2713
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:05.020
<v Speaker 2>hunter gatherers are thereby primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and therefore they,</v>

2714
02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:08.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just try to wave their arms and say</v>

2715
02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:12.900
<v Speaker 2>it served like saying it's a normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>but not much of a nominally,</v>

2716
02:28:12.910 --> 02:28:17.910
<v Speaker 2>so we don't need to really worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've only correct me if I'm </v>

2717
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:21.241
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've only uncovered as very small </v>

2718
02:28:21.241 --> 02:28:21.241
<v Speaker 2>fragment of it.</v>

2719
02:28:21.241 --> 02:28:21.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2720
02:28:21.241 --> 02:28:25.531
<v Speaker 2>very small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an enormous structure structure </v>

2721
02:28:25.531 --> 02:28:28.811
<v Speaker 2>and in that picture that's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll describe it for those that don't </v>

2722
02:28:28.811 --> 02:28:32.261
<v Speaker 2>see the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's pictures like this in my </v>

2723
02:28:32.261 --> 02:28:32.360
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgotten civilization.</v>

2724
02:28:32.361 --> 02:28:34.090
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right out of my book,</v>

2725
02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:39.100
<v Speaker 2>probably are very similar to what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see the pillar in the back on the </v>

2726
02:28:39.100 --> 02:28:41.120
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see how that was knocked down and</v>

2727
02:28:41.121 --> 02:28:45.950
<v Speaker 2>it's propped up and it is been put back </v>
<v Speaker 2>into position.</v>

2728
02:28:45.951 --> 02:28:50.951
<v Speaker 2>Then they built these crude walls </v>
<v Speaker 2>against it before they buried the whole </v>

2729
02:28:50.951 --> 02:28:54.281
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this whole site underwent dramatic </v>

2730
02:28:54.281 --> 02:28:57.230
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe was being put together </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly again.</v>

2731
02:28:57.231 --> 02:29:00.920
<v Speaker 2>And then the animals as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2732
02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:02.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one right there.</v>

2733
02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The serve,</v>

2734
02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I call it a fee line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

2735
02:29:06.741 --> 02:29:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Feline going down and theY had a carved </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stone around that,</v>

2736
02:29:12.850 --> 02:29:15.000
<v Speaker 2>so much more complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more complicated.</v>

2737
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.650
<v Speaker 2>And when they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were carving these originally,</v>

2738
02:29:18.651 --> 02:29:22.040
<v Speaker 2>taking them out of the quarry to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a 15 ton pillar,</v>

2739
02:29:22.041 --> 02:29:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I think we're looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2740
02:29:23.391 --> 02:29:26.150
<v Speaker 2>there we are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so beautiful.</v>

2741
02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2742
02:29:27.411 --> 02:29:30.710
<v Speaker 2>if you saw that in a museum of modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

2743
02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:33.230
<v Speaker 2>it could fit right in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2744
02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two points I just wanted to make before </v>

2745
02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I forget them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2746
02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:41.981
<v Speaker 2>when you're carving these pillars to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 or 15 ton pillar like that finalized,</v>

2747
02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to cover a much bigger chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock initially because of course you </v>

2748
02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:51.140
<v Speaker 2>have to leave the rock where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have the animal.</v>

2749
02:29:51.141 --> 02:29:55.280
<v Speaker 2>You have to leave the rock because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not in sizing these in.</v>

2750
02:29:55.281 --> 02:29:58.630
<v Speaker 2>They're carving them and relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a lot more complicated kind of</v>

2751
02:29:58.631 --> 02:29:59.600
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the rock,</v>

2752
02:29:59.601 --> 02:30:04.601
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is an incredible technological </v>

2753
02:30:04.601 --> 02:30:04.850
<v Speaker 2>feat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also off the record.</v>

2754
02:30:04.910 --> 02:30:06.920
<v Speaker 2>And this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at that one,</v>

2755
02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:10.640
<v Speaker 2>do you see how it's got weather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pig pigs and whatnot,</v>

2756
02:30:10.641 --> 02:30:15.641
<v Speaker 2>but you also see the weathered surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to teach you a little geology </v>

2757
02:30:15.641 --> 02:30:20.180
<v Speaker 2>that is a older pillar that was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>reused at the end of the last ice age,</v>

2758
02:30:20.181 --> 02:30:25.181
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some of these structures actually go </v>

2759
02:30:25.181 --> 02:30:26.990
<v Speaker 2>back earlier and before klaus schmidt </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed away unexpectedly.</v>

2760
02:30:26.991 --> 02:30:31.991
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about this too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that even there they were maybe you </v>

2761
02:30:31.991 --> 02:30:35.531
<v Speaker 2>reusing some structures that were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit earlier or maybe several </v>

2762
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:39.020
<v Speaker 2>thousand years earlIer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this goes back.</v>

2763
02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:44.170
<v Speaker 2>The origins of get back late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teppei may go back thousands of years </v>

2764
02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:49.450
<v Speaker 2>earlier when all said and done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we get the evidence in a well into </v>

2765
02:30:49.450 --> 02:30:53.090
<v Speaker 2>the end of the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stuffed out about 9,700</v>

2766
02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:58.120
<v Speaker 2>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say before I forget it a </v>

2767
02:30:58.120 --> 02:30:59.540
<v Speaker 2>lot going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the record,</v>

2768
02:30:59.830 --> 02:31:01.700
<v Speaker 2>of course they would never admit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2769
02:31:01.701 --> 02:31:06.701
<v Speaker 2>but off the record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken to archaeologists when </v>

2770
02:31:06.701 --> 02:31:10.650
<v Speaker 2>they're in a giddy mood and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and asked them,</v>

2771
02:31:12.081 --> 02:31:13.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just found,</v>

2772
02:31:13.370 --> 02:31:18.370
<v Speaker 2>say that animal on the glabella tip a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pillar in isolation or you just found </v>

2773
02:31:18.801 --> 02:31:21.510
<v Speaker 2>one of these pillars are part of one in </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation.</v>

2774
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:24.540
<v Speaker 2>You were just looking at how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it would be,</v>

2775
02:31:24.541 --> 02:31:29.541
<v Speaker 2>and I've heard the answer 600 bc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand bc based on the technology,</v>

2776
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:33.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technological finesse,</v>

2777
02:31:33.461 --> 02:31:37.320
<v Speaker 2>the beauty of the carving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not eight,</v>

2778
02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:38.850
<v Speaker 2>9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years earlier,</v>

2779
02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:39.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2780
02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:41.940
<v Speaker 2>But they would never say that on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>

2781
02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2782
02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:44.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2783
02:31:44.221 --> 02:31:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Because it's so complicated to monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2784
02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2785
02:31:47.161 --> 02:31:48.660
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've had them say that,</v>

2786
02:31:48.661 --> 02:31:49.860
<v Speaker 2>well if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just found,</v>

2787
02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:55.040
<v Speaker 2>say that little feline type thing on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the pillar just broken off and </v>

2788
02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:57.120
<v Speaker 2>just an isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd probably say one told me,</v>

2789
02:31:57.121 --> 02:31:59.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh maybe it's a thousand bc at most,</v>

2790
02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:02.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most but not 9,000,</v>

2791
02:32:02.851 --> 02:32:05.940
<v Speaker 2>700 bc or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2792
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Now are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have they Identified the quarries?</v>

2793
02:32:08.461 --> 02:32:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Were these stones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2794
02:32:10.241 --> 02:32:15.241
<v Speaker 2>some of them happen and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>super far away as a kilometer or a bit </v>

2795
02:32:15.241 --> 02:32:15.270
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

2796
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's limestone around there,</v>

2797
02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:20.400
<v Speaker 2>so it's not a situation as you have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peru for instance,</v>

2798
02:32:20.401 --> 02:32:22.950
<v Speaker 2>where they're dragging this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2799
02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:27.230
<v Speaker 2>tens of kilometers away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that detracts from.</v>

2800
02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:28.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2801
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:29.790
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they were doing it sort of,</v>

2802
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:31.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still crazy and um,</v>

2803
02:32:32.430 --> 02:32:36.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for me to say this,</v>

2804
02:32:36.121 --> 02:32:39.210
<v Speaker 2>but once you've quarried a block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're moving a kilometer,</v>

2805
02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:42.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not that much harder to move it 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>kilometers,</v>

2806
02:32:42.481 --> 02:32:44.880
<v Speaker 2>it just takes more effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the same technology,</v>

2807
02:32:44.881 --> 02:32:49.881
<v Speaker 2>it's really korean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be able to move it to begin with and </v>

2808
02:32:49.881 --> 02:32:52.170
<v Speaker 2>then be able to carve it into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful structures.</v>

2809
02:32:52.410 --> 02:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>And something I want to point out too is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of times when I talk about </v>

2810
02:32:57.410 --> 02:33:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Rebecca Lee bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make the comment about stone henge </v>

2811
02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:02.550
<v Speaker 2>because people are familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>stonehenge.</v>

2812
02:33:03.430 --> 02:33:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Stonehenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the blocks,</v>

2813
02:33:05.491 --> 02:33:09.030
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so much cruder than what we have</v>

2814
02:33:09.031 --> 02:33:13.770
<v Speaker 2>at beckley tap bay and the tap pay stone</v>
<v Speaker 2>pillars.</v>

2815
02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:18.980
<v Speaker 2>The central ones particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are so beautifully carved,</v>

2816
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:21.930
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also very,</v>

2817
02:33:21.931 --> 02:33:26.931
<v Speaker 2>very thin and their smallest dimension </v>
<v Speaker 2>there you can see it how thin it is and </v>

2818
02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:31.410
<v Speaker 2>that one's anthropomorphic with the belt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the hands.</v>

2819
02:33:31.411 --> 02:33:36.411
<v Speaker 2>And that sure looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people would say a metal buckle on </v>

2820
02:33:36.411 --> 02:33:39.981
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's very similar to like those </v>

2821
02:33:39.981 --> 02:33:39.981
<v Speaker 2>easter island Is very similar to easter </v>
<v Speaker 2>island there.</v>

2822
02:33:39.981 --> 02:33:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I think there are definite connections </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2823
02:33:41.791 --> 02:33:46.791
<v Speaker 2>but why shouldn't there be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about rango rango </v>

2824
02:33:46.791 --> 02:33:50.021
<v Speaker 2>in ours to ago and how they were seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar things in the sky,</v>

2825
02:33:51.210 --> 02:33:56.210
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to point out that when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>carve a pillar like that that's so thin </v>

2826
02:33:56.221 --> 02:34:01.221
<v Speaker 2>and narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's much more difficult to keep it </v>

2827
02:34:01.221 --> 02:34:02.340
<v Speaker 2>from snapping to keep it from breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

2828
02:34:02.490 --> 02:34:05.970
<v Speaker 2>if you see in that pillar how it's said </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the bedrock,</v>

2829
02:34:06.330 --> 02:34:10.410
<v Speaker 2>it's said in just literally very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very shallow.</v>

2830
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm the set into the bedrock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Klaus schmidt commented to me that,</v>

2831
02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:22.140
<v Speaker 2>and he published this too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they seem to be using some kind of </v>

2832
02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:25.060
<v Speaker 2>concrete or cement to help set them into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bedrock,</v>

2833
02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:30.390
<v Speaker 2>which is untold up at such an early </v>
<v Speaker 2>period when he fIrst was excavating them</v>

2834
02:34:31.181 --> 02:34:34.630
<v Speaker 2>before he got down to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said this to me verbally.</v>

2835
02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:39.840
<v Speaker 2>He estimated that about a third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least a third of the pillars should </v>

2836
02:34:40.331 --> 02:34:42.760
<v Speaker 2>be set into the bedrock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to hold it up,</v>

2837
02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:47.940
<v Speaker 2>prop it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just on the order of centimeters as </v>

2838
02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:50.590
<v Speaker 2>you find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this a sturdy construction like a,</v>

2839
02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:52.140
<v Speaker 2>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2840
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:53.350
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't touch it now.</v>

2841
02:34:53.351 --> 02:34:55.960
<v Speaker 2>They won't touch it and it probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>would fall over.</v>

2842
02:34:55.961 --> 02:34:57.850
<v Speaker 2>They have to do all kinds of supports on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2843
02:34:57.851 --> 02:35:02.851
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My suspicion is that initially it was </v>

2844
02:35:02.851 --> 02:35:04.990
<v Speaker 2>not roofed over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were free standing pillars and</v>

2845
02:35:04.991 --> 02:35:09.991
<v Speaker 2>they were very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very carefully set and balanced and </v>

2846
02:35:09.991 --> 02:35:12.040
<v Speaker 2>everythIng was in perfect order.</v>

2847
02:35:12.610 --> 02:35:17.610
<v Speaker 2>This is total speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like many of the habilis and </v>

2848
02:35:17.610 --> 02:35:21.091
<v Speaker 2>whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may have even had a vibration to </v>

2849
02:35:21.091 --> 02:35:24.961
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may have purposefully vibrator </v>

2850
02:35:24.961 --> 02:35:24.961
<v Speaker 2>picked up some kind of frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the.</v>

2851
02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how shallow it is,</v>

2852
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:29.830
<v Speaker 2>but they were finely tuned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want call that,</v>

2853
02:35:29.831 --> 02:35:34.831
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to claim it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some kind of weird machine or some </v>

2854
02:35:34.831 --> 02:35:37.861
<v Speaker 2>people have called speculated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there was something there </v>

2855
02:35:37.861 --> 02:35:42.460
<v Speaker 2>and resonance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An audio cues.</v>

2856
02:35:42.461 --> 02:35:47.461
<v Speaker 2>Audio frequencies are historically very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important in both modern structures.</v>

2857
02:35:49.690 --> 02:35:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Usually you think of as religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2858
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:58.420
<v Speaker 2>it affects your mental thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities and that type of thing.</v>

2859
02:35:58.421 --> 02:36:00.700
<v Speaker 2>So something may have been going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>there with that.</v>

2860
02:36:00.850 --> 02:36:05.320
<v Speaker 2>This may also be why they broke so </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily during the catastrophe.</v>

2861
02:36:05.321 --> 02:36:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a huge catastrophe.</v>

2862
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were trying to redirect them.</v>

2863
02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:15.970
<v Speaker 2>What is the timeline in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the total uncovering that site?</v>

2864
02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in modern times.</v>

2865
02:36:17.770 --> 02:36:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2866
02:36:18.101 --> 02:36:23.101
<v Speaker 2>what are they trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much time do you think it's </v>

2867
02:36:23.101 --> 02:36:23.101
<v Speaker 2>going to take for them to completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncover?</v>

2868
02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they do it carefully,</v>

2869
02:36:24.821 --> 02:36:26.350
<v Speaker 2>century century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2870
02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:27.790
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge site.</v>

2871
02:36:27.791 --> 02:36:32.791
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and klaus schmidt when katie and I were </v>

2872
02:36:32.791 --> 02:36:32.791
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2873
02:36:32.791 --> 02:36:36.900
<v Speaker 2>I think he waved his arms and he talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how there's all these other hills </v>

2874
02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:38.080
<v Speaker 2>out there that probably have more under </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2875
02:36:38.081 --> 02:36:43.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking a huge complex and we </v>

2876
02:36:43.081 --> 02:36:45.361
<v Speaker 2>know that in some cases because you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>little fragments sticking up and that </v>

2877
02:36:45.361 --> 02:36:49.051
<v Speaker 2>type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also remember when you're doing </v>

2878
02:36:49.051 --> 02:36:52.801
<v Speaker 2>archeology and I have training in </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaeology despite what some of my </v>

2879
02:36:53.201 --> 02:36:56.680
<v Speaker 2>critics would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're doing archeology,</v>

2880
02:36:56.681 --> 02:37:01.030
<v Speaker 2>it's inherently destructive because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't put it back together.</v>

2881
02:37:01.031 --> 02:37:04.150
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't do it carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't do it right.</v>

2882
02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:07.900
<v Speaker 2>You're destroying evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are inherently destroying evidence.</v>

2883
02:37:08.050 --> 02:37:11.320
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professionals,</v>

2884
02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:15.100
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to excavate the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>site at one time.</v>

2885
02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 2>They want leave</v>

2886
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:21.130
<v Speaker 3>parts on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excavate it so that other people have a </v>

2887
02:37:21.130 --> 02:37:21.830
<v Speaker 3>go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you develop new technology,</v>

2888
02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:27.050
<v Speaker 3>you can apply that to a different part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the site,</v>

2889
02:37:27.890 --> 02:37:30.800
<v Speaker 3>plus practical things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in Turkey,</v>

2890
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:35.000
<v Speaker 3>it's close to the syrian border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2891
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:40.460
<v Speaker 3>and we know how the political situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is with this l'amec state,</v>

2892
02:37:40.461 --> 02:37:42.680
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would love to destroy this site.</v>

2893
02:37:42.681 --> 02:37:43.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

2894
02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:45.500
<v Speaker 3>it's very close to earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2895
02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:50.530
<v Speaker 3>which is the city of abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very sacred holy site,</v>

2896
02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:52.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for judaism,</v>

2897
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:55.100
<v Speaker 3>christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But more than anything else,</v>

2898
02:37:55.130 --> 02:38:00.130
<v Speaker 3>islam get beckley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teppei is just outside psychic power </v>

2899
02:38:00.621 --> 02:38:04.420
<v Speaker 3>drive by taxi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm from earth in earth.</v>

2900
02:38:04.430 --> 02:38:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the,</v>

2901
02:38:05.421 --> 02:38:07.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacred cave of abraham.</v>

2902
02:38:07.761 --> 02:38:10.910
<v Speaker 3>You have the pools of abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have big mosque there.</v>

2903
02:38:11.330 --> 02:38:16.330
<v Speaker 3>And I bring this all up because this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very ancient city when they excavate </v>

2904
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:19.150
<v Speaker 3>in earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2905
02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:23.860
<v Speaker 3>not archeological excavations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but say they build a new road or they do</v>

2906
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:28.700
<v Speaker 3>build a new underground garage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they often hit 12,000</v>

2907
02:38:28.701 --> 02:38:31.370
<v Speaker 3>year old or there abouts remains.</v>

2908
02:38:31.490 --> 02:38:34.040
<v Speaker 3>So there's this beautiful statue called </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

2909
02:38:34.041 --> 02:38:36.810
<v Speaker 3>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is now in the museum and five,</v>

2910
02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:40.340
<v Speaker 3>which also has just lots of artifacts </v>
<v Speaker 3>from beckley tap bay.</v>

2911
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:43.830
<v Speaker 3>And it was found right near the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2912
02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:47.510
<v Speaker 3>modern pools of abraham when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing some construction project,</v>

2913
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:52.750
<v Speaker 3>but it represents an image of the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly are at least it's an image of</v>

2914
02:38:57.471 --> 02:39:01.760
<v Speaker 3>a man or person that gates back to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back 10 times.</v>

2915
02:39:01.761 --> 02:39:04.310
<v Speaker 3>It's about full sites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the same size as me,</v>

2916
02:39:04.430 --> 02:39:09.430
<v Speaker 3>but lucky legs very similar actually has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of comparisons to the moai on </v>

2917
02:39:10.461 --> 02:39:12.170
<v Speaker 3>easter island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got a picture of this.</v>

2918
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I think we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we do.</v>

2919
02:39:14.970 --> 02:39:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Is that beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2920
02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's staring at you with obsidian eyes </v>

2921
02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:23.430
<v Speaker 3>and he is from beckley tech time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was found in earth.</v>

2922
02:39:23.431 --> 02:39:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're not going to do it.</v>

2923
02:39:26.001 --> 02:39:31.001
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you could just wipe out the </v>

2924
02:39:31.001 --> 02:39:33.281
<v Speaker 3>modern city and excavate there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what you would find </v>

2925
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:35.190
<v Speaker 3>potentially erf.</v>

2926
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2927
02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:40.100
<v Speaker 3>this is me speaking as one of the oldest</v>
<v Speaker 3>inhabited cities on earth.</v>

2928
02:39:40.820 --> 02:39:45.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back to the late ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2929
02:39:45.381 --> 02:39:47.690
<v Speaker 3>this is something that goes on in Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 3>city as well,</v>

2930
02:39:47.691 --> 02:39:48.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2931
02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:50.370
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Building apartment building,</v>

2932
02:39:52.490 --> 02:39:55.300
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of things on an aztec temple </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2933
02:39:55.301 --> 02:39:58.310
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in cairo and other parts of Egypt.</v>

2934
02:39:58.311 --> 02:40:03.311
<v Speaker 3>There were families that lived for </v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries because their little huts or </v>

2935
02:40:03.311 --> 02:40:07.310
<v Speaker 3>the community was on the top of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruins and they would dig in their </v>

2936
02:40:07.551 --> 02:40:10.760
<v Speaker 3>basement and pull out a gold statuette </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

2937
02:40:10.761 --> 02:40:13.880
<v Speaker 3>sell it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat for the six months.</v>

2938
02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2939
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:19.100
<v Speaker 2>is this earth a place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any consideration to like </v>

2940
02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:21.250
<v Speaker 2>picking isolated spots and starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dig in?</v>

2941
02:40:21.650 --> 02:40:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some consideration on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the part of archeologist and turkish </v>

2942
02:40:27.781 --> 02:40:29.100
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of thing,</v>

2943
02:40:29.101 --> 02:40:34.101
<v Speaker 2>but you've also got a very strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious elements you mentioned placed </v>

2944
02:40:34.101 --> 02:40:34.380
<v Speaker 2>into all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2945
02:40:34.890 --> 02:40:38.960
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily want to destroy a,</v>

2946
02:40:39.490 --> 02:40:41.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient islamic temple,</v>

2947
02:40:41.301 --> 02:40:46.050
<v Speaker 2>say islamic mosque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mosque that goes back to,</v>

2948
02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just making this up.</v>

2949
02:40:47.461 --> 02:40:52.461
<v Speaker 2>Eight hundred 80 or something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>excavate something that's a few thousand</v>

2950
02:40:52.951 --> 02:40:55.170
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand years older or 10,000</v>

2951
02:40:55.171 --> 02:40:56.940
<v Speaker 2>years old or more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2952
02:40:56.941 --> 02:40:57.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2953
02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:00.720
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which am I more interested,</v>

2954
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:05.750
<v Speaker 2>it might be one versus the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other people are interested in the </v>

2955
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:08.571
<v Speaker 2>other car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's all these factors that </v>

2956
02:41:08.571 --> 02:41:08.760
<v Speaker 2>play into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it gets very complicated,</v>

2957
02:41:08.761 --> 02:41:09.720
<v Speaker 2>very messy.</v>

2958
02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:15.020
<v Speaker 2>And then of course You have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and this ties in where,</v>

2959
02:41:16.170 --> 02:41:19.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know christians are more interested in</v>

2960
02:41:19.171 --> 02:41:24.171
<v Speaker 2>the birth of jesus and where the mangers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can see in Egypt of one's </v>

2961
02:41:24.171 --> 02:41:28.590
<v Speaker 2>interested to suppose that place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the holy family stayed when jesus went </v>

2962
02:41:28.801 --> 02:41:29.850
<v Speaker 2>to Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2963
02:41:30.450 --> 02:41:32.010
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2964
02:41:32.190 --> 02:41:34.300
<v Speaker 2>and you can see things like that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

2965
02:41:34.301 --> 02:41:36.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for abraham and whatnot.</v>

2966
02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:41.480
<v Speaker 2>And how do you respect that with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also why excavate underneath.</v>

2967
02:41:42.810 --> 02:41:47.810
<v Speaker 2>And then some people would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>excavating underneath is sacrilegious </v>

2968
02:41:47.810 --> 02:41:47.880
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2969
02:41:47.881 --> 02:41:50.130
<v Speaker 2>what their main interest is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2970
02:41:50.131 --> 02:41:51.630
<v Speaker 2>so it gets very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated.</v>

2971
02:41:51.631 --> 02:41:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I've met phds in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2972
02:41:55.170 --> 02:41:57.810
<v Speaker 2>one in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to tell you a quick anecdote,</v>

2973
02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting there having breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was in the 19 nineties and um,</v>

2974
02:42:02.730 --> 02:42:06.860
<v Speaker 2>it was in a hotel where it's overlooking</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pyramid and sphinx.</v>

2975
02:42:06.870 --> 02:42:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

2976
02:42:08.401 --> 02:42:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Having a nice breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy comes down and sits with me,</v>

2977
02:42:10.861 --> 02:42:13.080
<v Speaker 2>joins with may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start making conversation.</v>

2978
02:42:13.081 --> 02:42:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Turns out he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cairo university,</v>

2979
02:42:16.470 --> 02:42:18.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>

2980
02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a professor of economics or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatnot.</v>

2981
02:42:21.630 --> 02:42:25.550
<v Speaker 2>And he starts telling me because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious I'm not a chip shit,</v>

2982
02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:28.890
<v Speaker 2>why am I there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm staying the pyramids.</v>

2983
02:42:28.891 --> 02:42:33.180
<v Speaker 2>And then he starts telling me his </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion of all this was opinion,</v>

2984
02:42:33.181 --> 02:42:37.200
<v Speaker 2>was that the pyramid should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dismantled.</v>

2985
02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of this finks don't need any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2986
02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Used those raw materials on site to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build a cupboard over air condition </v>

2987
02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:53.190
<v Speaker 2>shopping mall bigger than the one in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dubai.</v>

2988
02:42:54.210 --> 02:42:59.210
<v Speaker 2>And that would really benefit Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically and otherwise.</v>

2989
02:42:59.310 --> 02:43:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Who said this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a professor at our university.</v>

2990
02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:08.580
<v Speaker 2>I might not know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have no question.</v>

2991
02:43:08.581 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 2>He was genuine and real and I didn't or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything</v>

2992
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:16.690
<v Speaker 3>because it was serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where's he coming from?</v>

2993
02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Impart Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't mean anything to him.</v>

2994
02:43:19.151 --> 02:43:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Dynastic egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of egyptians do.</v>

2995
02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:26.410
<v Speaker 3>It means something to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of egyptians in Egypt.</v>

2996
02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:29.050
<v Speaker 3>They're muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's pre muslim,</v>

2997
02:43:29.051 --> 02:43:31.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's pre arab,</v>

2998
02:43:31.661 --> 02:43:34.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not a big deal because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>arabs.</v>

2999
02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:39.040
<v Speaker 3>They might've been in Egypt for over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years,</v>

3000
02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:43.350
<v Speaker 3>but the native egyptians is not their </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

3001
02:43:43.390 --> 02:43:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3002
02:43:44.890 --> 02:43:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

3003
02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Think about America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many native native american mounds </v>

3004
02:43:52.421 --> 02:43:56.290
<v Speaker 3>and raves and whatnot get bulldozed over</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

3005
02:43:56.291 --> 02:44:01.291
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the most preliminary archeological</v>
<v Speaker 3>salvage to build a shopping mall or a </v>

3006
02:44:02.951 --> 02:44:05.740
<v Speaker 3>neW development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>

3007
02:44:05.741 --> 02:44:10.741
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think it's really crazy when someone </v>

3008
02:44:10.741 --> 02:44:11.560
<v Speaker 3>like that would say that about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids and sphinx,</v>

3009
02:44:11.561 --> 02:44:13.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everyone knows about them,</v>

3010
02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:16.690
<v Speaker 3>but from his perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I quizzed him,</v>

3011
02:44:16.691 --> 02:44:18.100
<v Speaker 3>he could have turned around and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3012
02:44:18.101 --> 02:44:19.660
<v Speaker 3>look what you do in your country.</v>

3013
02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost human nature across the </v>

3014
02:44:24.900 --> 02:44:25.480
<v Speaker 3>planet when they're inconsiderate to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something along those lines.</v>

3015
02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:28.260
<v Speaker 3>So my point is not really to criticise </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

3016
02:44:28.270 --> 02:44:31.490
<v Speaker 3>He had very different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3017
02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:34.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with that perspective,</v>

3018
02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:37.600
<v Speaker 3>but I could understand where he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from.</v>

3019
02:44:37.601 --> 02:44:40.570
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't some crate,</v>

3020
02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:44.260
<v Speaker 3>he didn't strike me as some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists or anything like that.</v>

3021
02:44:44.261 --> 02:44:49.000
<v Speaker 3>He was just thinking in different terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for him,</v>

3022
02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:52.510
<v Speaker 3>and he's not the only one I've spoken to</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Egypt.</v>

3023
02:44:52.511 --> 02:44:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians a who'd take that perspective </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3024
02:44:55.871 --> 02:44:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Others will say we have to save all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3025
02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:03.720
<v Speaker 3>but not necessarily because they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>care less about pyramids and sphinxes </v>

3026
02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:06.730
<v Speaker 3>and tombs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because they're good for the economy</v>

3027
02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:12.300
<v Speaker 3>because it brings in tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's the counter argument </v>

3028
02:45:12.300 --> 02:45:15.580
<v Speaker 3>which I've heard many times that Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to separate itself from tourism.</v>

3029
02:45:15.850 --> 02:45:18.610
<v Speaker 3>So you need to cut off the nipple.</v>

3030
02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've had egyptian say to me in </v>

3031
02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:28.021
<v Speaker 3>no uncertain terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not joking or anything but </v>

3032
02:45:28.151 --> 02:45:30.460
<v Speaker 3>pointed out that depending on how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>count it,</v>

3033
02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 percent to 60 percent or more of the </v>

3034
02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:36.880
<v Speaker 3>egyptian economy could be based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>tourism because it's not just the direct</v>

3035
02:45:36.881 --> 02:45:41.881
<v Speaker 3>tourism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's those that supply the people </v>

3036
02:45:41.881 --> 02:45:41.881
<v Speaker 3>who deal with the tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

3037
02:45:41.881 --> 02:45:46.671
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you have a situation that you </v>

3038
02:45:46.671 --> 02:45:48.490
<v Speaker 3>have something happen in the middle east</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be far from Egypt,</v>

3039
02:45:50.110 --> 02:45:51.520
<v Speaker 3>but people get excited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3040
02:45:51.521 --> 02:45:53.190
<v Speaker 3>americans all of a sudden tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3041
02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:58.200
<v Speaker 3>I can't go to Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my interest to go to Egypt </v>

3042
02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:01.591
<v Speaker 3>because something happened in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I heard and it has nothing </v>

3043
02:46:01.591 --> 02:46:01.591
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3044
02:46:01.591 --> 02:46:05.820
<v Speaker 3>but I think if our country and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy was dependent upon tourism </v>

3045
02:46:06.161 --> 02:46:08.670
<v Speaker 3>solely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not solely,</v>

3046
02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 3>but portion of</v>

3047
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:15.040
<v Speaker 2>it was tourism and then something </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in Brazil and all of a sudden </v>

3048
02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:18.290
<v Speaker 2>because something happened in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no tourists are coming to America and it</v>

3049
02:46:18.291 --> 02:46:20.480
<v Speaker 2>cripples our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3050
02:46:20.481 --> 02:46:25.481
<v Speaker 2>I can Understand that perspective dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and completely understand their </v>

3051
02:46:25.481 --> 02:46:28.211
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the perspective in Turkey when </v>

3052
02:46:28.211 --> 02:46:28.211
<v Speaker 2>they're dealing with go beckley?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tempe and the.</v>

3053
02:46:28.250 --> 02:46:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mixed too.</v>

3054
02:46:30.141 --> 02:46:32.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're in Turkey,</v>

3055
02:46:32.451 --> 02:46:37.451
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got more and more rise of should </v>

3056
02:46:37.461 --> 02:46:42.461
<v Speaker 2>we say radical islamic fundamentalism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't really worry about such </v>

3057
02:46:42.461 --> 02:46:47.351
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also have people who seek of </v>

3058
02:46:47.351 --> 02:46:50.750
<v Speaker 2>beckley tap a as potentially someday </v>
<v Speaker 2>vine with the sphinx and pyramids for </v>

3059
02:46:52.011 --> 02:46:54.950
<v Speaker 2>tourist dollars and for a destination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean turkeys.</v>

3060
02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My opinion,</v>

3061
02:46:56.181 --> 02:46:59.990
<v Speaker 2>I love both Turkey and Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to visit them,</v>

3062
02:46:59.991 --> 02:47:02.090
<v Speaker 2>to travel through them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of thing.</v>

3063
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Within the country you have to know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing by people travel with me,</v>

3064
02:47:05.991 --> 02:47:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing.</v>

3065
02:47:07.430 --> 02:47:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that nasty way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know and I will not take risks.</v>

3066
02:47:11.810 --> 02:47:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll take risks for myself and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

3067
02:47:14.691 --> 02:47:17.350
<v Speaker 2>been on the wrong end of a garden </v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

3068
02:47:17.390 --> 02:47:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But happened.</v>

3069
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst was Pakistan,</v>

3070
02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:23.960
<v Speaker 2>but that's what we do in Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was collecting fossils.</v>

3071
02:47:23.961 --> 02:47:26.690
<v Speaker 2>This is when I was a graduate student </v>
<v Speaker 2>and at one point,</v>

3072
02:47:26.810 --> 02:47:29.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was accused of carrying plastic,</v>

3073
02:47:29.570 --> 02:47:33.800
<v Speaker 2>plastic explosives and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>had for um,</v>

3074
02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:39.000
<v Speaker 2>ak 47 point myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not point.</v>

3075
02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3076
02:47:40.430 --> 02:47:43.520
<v Speaker 2>they were touching it and I know enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>about small arms.</v>

3077
02:47:43.521 --> 02:47:48.521
<v Speaker 2>These were loaded in the cocktail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean their fingers were on the </v>

3078
02:47:48.861 --> 02:47:50.360
<v Speaker 2>triggers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on the trigger guards.</v>

3079
02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3080
02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:55.250
<v Speaker 2>It turns out I didn't have plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosives and you know,</v>

3081
02:47:55.251 --> 02:47:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mild mannered guy and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go whatever you want to.</v>

3082
02:47:59.180 --> 02:48:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything wrong and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained and I was carrying back then a</v>

3083
02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:11.380
<v Speaker 2>little bricks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little things of a oil based clay that I</v>

3084
02:48:11.911 --> 02:48:16.040
<v Speaker 2>guess have the texture and feel of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the explosives they would use.</v>

3085
02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:21.220
<v Speaker 2>We would use these when we collected </v>
<v Speaker 2>fossils and you find a bunch of </v>

3086
02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:24.230
<v Speaker 2>fragments to prop it up and put it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>position as you glued them together.</v>

3087
02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:28.130
<v Speaker 2>But explaining that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3088
02:48:28.131 --> 02:48:29.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to explain all of that.</v>

3089
02:48:29.541 --> 02:48:34.541
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone came from the Pakistan </v>

3090
02:48:34.541 --> 02:48:34.541
<v Speaker 2>geological survey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain that.</v>

3091
02:48:34.541 --> 02:48:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really was who I was,</v>

3092
02:48:36.470 --> 02:48:41.470
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a situation where people get </v>

3093
02:48:41.470 --> 02:48:42.650
<v Speaker 2>excited and that was back in the battle </v>
<v Speaker 2>days of,</v>

3094
02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:45.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know if it seemed better in</v>

3095
02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3096
02:48:49.250 --> 02:48:54.250
<v Speaker 2>they're tough situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you know how to behave and you </v>

3097
02:48:54.250 --> 02:48:54.250
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how deal with it,</v>

3098
02:48:54.250 --> 02:48:56.450
<v Speaker 2>you know how to avoid it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be okay.</v>

3099
02:48:56.451 --> 02:48:59.960
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I would say Egypt is very,</v>

3100
02:49:00.470 --> 02:49:02.120
<v Speaker 2>very safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

3101
02:49:02.121 --> 02:49:04.880
<v Speaker 2>People have all kinds of misconceptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Egypt.</v>

3102
02:49:05.330 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were starting to talk about Turkey.</v>

3103
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Turkey may be going the other route a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

3104
02:49:10.650 --> 02:49:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm being very honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3105
02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:17.720
<v Speaker 2>but I have no problem going with Turkey </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have no problem taking people to </v>

3106
02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:21.771
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at this point there are certain </v>

3107
02:49:21.771 --> 02:49:23.220
<v Speaker 2>areas I might avoid just to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>safest,</v>

3108
02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:25.260
<v Speaker 2>safest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little more slippery.</v>

3109
02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would never endanger anyone else.</v>

3110
02:49:29.041 --> 02:49:34.041
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always err on the side of safety when </v>

3111
02:49:34.041 --> 02:49:35.600
<v Speaker 2>it comes to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One else.</v>

3112
02:49:36.110 --> 02:49:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that I want to take great risks </v>
<v Speaker 2>with myself either.</v>

3113
02:49:39.001 --> 02:49:41.670
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes as a geologist and I read that</v>

3114
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel I have to do what I</v>

3115
02:49:43.380 --> 02:49:48.380
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any plans on releasing this </v>

3116
02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:50.570
<v Speaker 4>theory of coronal mass ejections and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that we've talked about today</v>

3117
02:49:50.571 --> 02:49:52.430
<v Speaker 4>into something like a documentary?</v>

3118
02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:54.530
<v Speaker 2>something that I might be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

3119
02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I would love to do a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that john,</v>

3120
02:49:58.221 --> 02:50:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Anthony West and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're often talking about documentary.</v>

3121
02:50:01.191 --> 02:50:06.191
<v Speaker 2>We also would like to do a film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a full length feature film if we could </v>

3122
02:50:06.191 --> 02:50:09.430
<v Speaker 2>get back in and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>serve a,</v>

3123
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:14.740
<v Speaker 2>how should I say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Semi popularized a semi fictionalized,</v>

3124
02:50:14.741 --> 02:50:17.390
<v Speaker 2>but always based on real science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real data,</v>

3125
02:50:17.391 --> 02:50:19.020
<v Speaker 2>real evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3126
02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I've seen so many films where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>about geological catastrophes,</v>

3127
02:50:23.361 --> 02:50:26.520
<v Speaker 2>whether it's huge asteroid city know or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3128
02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:29.180
<v Speaker 2>san andreas fault and they're so faked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3129
02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:32.330
<v Speaker 2>But because it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what really happened,</v>

3130
02:50:32.331 --> 02:50:37.331
<v Speaker 2>it's not really what happened and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying is what has happened in the </v>

3131
02:50:37.331 --> 02:50:41.180
<v Speaker 2>past and what really will happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future if we get hit again,</v>

3132
02:50:41.181 --> 02:50:45.770
<v Speaker 2>which I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a geological perspective,</v>

3133
02:50:45.771 --> 02:50:49.160
<v Speaker 2>there is no doubt these things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unavoidable.</v>

3134
02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:54.460
<v Speaker 2>It would be like saying we'll never have</v>
<v Speaker 2>another volcanic eruption or earthquake </v>

3135
02:50:54.460 --> 02:50:55.790
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we will.</v>

3136
02:50:55.850 --> 02:51:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Of course we will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's better to be aware of it and </v>

3137
02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:00.850
<v Speaker 2>prepare for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3138
02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:05.621
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good film and this film would be </v>

3139
02:51:05.621 --> 02:51:06.350
<v Speaker 2>something that would really catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3140
02:51:06.351 --> 02:51:08.030
<v Speaker 2>if you could help us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3141
02:51:08.031 --> 02:51:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll connect you to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that would be excellent.</v>

3142
02:51:10.281 --> 02:51:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

3143
02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:13.850
<v Speaker 2>This is something that katie and I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I guess he is of The grand egyptian </v>

3188
02:53:23.070 --> 02:53:23.070
<v Speaker 2>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new museum.</v>

3189
02:53:23.070 --> 02:53:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I think we could make inroads there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually explore that if someone has </v>

3190
02:53:27.390 --> 02:53:30.010
<v Speaker 2>money or interest in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>

3191
02:53:30.011 --> 02:53:32.380
<v Speaker 2>and I want to say is bluntly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people say,</v>

3192
02:53:32.381 --> 02:53:37.381
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why don't you just raise money by </v>

3193
02:53:37.381 --> 02:53:39.010
<v Speaker 2>crowdfundinG doesn't work for Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have the money upfront,</v>

3194
02:53:39.370 --> 02:53:40.750
<v Speaker 2>they don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3195
02:53:40.751 --> 02:53:43.540
<v Speaker 2>crowd funding type money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's another thing.</v>

3196
02:53:43.690 --> 02:53:47.770
<v Speaker 2>So my point is that there's film project</v>
<v Speaker 2>love to pursue,</v>

3197
02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:50.020
<v Speaker 2>there's research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love to pursue.</v>

3198
02:53:50.021 --> 02:53:54.070
<v Speaker 2>That's why we've set up the oracle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the not for profit to do this.</v>

3199
02:53:54.071 --> 02:53:59.071
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And legitimately that's why I'm saying </v>

3200
02:53:59.071 --> 02:54:02.000
<v Speaker 2>the institute at bu institute for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>study of the origins of civilization.</v>

3201
02:54:02.021 --> 02:54:05.660
<v Speaker 2>So lots of possibilities and I'm hoping </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make some of this happened.</v>

3202
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping we tend to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really appreciate you being here man.</v>

3203
02:54:08.471 --> 02:54:10.970
<v Speaker 1>It was really awesome to talk to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you blew my mind this,</v>

3204
02:54:10.971 --> 02:54:13.990
<v Speaker 1>this whole theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It scares the shit out of me,</v>

3205
02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:16.030
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very exciting.</v>

3206
02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3207
02:54:17.411 --> 02:54:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to scare anyone</v>

3208
02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:24.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think we have to be real and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be realistic and there's no </v>

3209
02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:26.410
<v Speaker 2>point in hiding and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>closing your eyes to.</v>

3210
02:54:26.540 --> 02:54:28.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's just an awesome theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

3211
02:54:28.410 --> 02:54:29.750
<v Speaker 1>it's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3212
02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

3213
02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen.</v>
