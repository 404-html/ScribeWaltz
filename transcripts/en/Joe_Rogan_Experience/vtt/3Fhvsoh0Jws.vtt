<v Speaker 1>we find that are beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

163
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 1>these kettlebells that we have made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a artistic talent kettlebells to</v>

164
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>the Zombie bells and the primal bells </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they are is kettlebells that </v>

165
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:16.320
<v Speaker 1>looked bad ass.</v>

166
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>They look like their sculptures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're made by this kid,</v>

167
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>

168
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 1>these young kids these days with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic talent.</v>

169
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might not be a kid on he didn't know </v>

170
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>his name his age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

171
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Steven Shubin Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He created the primal belt.</v>

172
00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:32.340
<v Speaker 1>YeaH,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monkey one and apes.</v>

173
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.490
<v Speaker 1>And then he also did the new ones which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are zombie bells.</v>

174
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>They're all balanced out because one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things about a kettle bells is it's </v>

175
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.901
<v Speaker 1>all about swinging this ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's heavy steel ball and it's all </v>

176
00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:48.570
<v Speaker 1>about balancing it and controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the ball was off,</v>

177
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.730
<v Speaker 1>like with these faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could easily be off.</v>

178
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.940
<v Speaker 1>So we had them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A part of the artwork is that they had </v>

179
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.361
<v Speaker 1>to be three d to make sure that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>still are a kettlebells that you can </v>

180
00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:03.741
<v Speaker 1>train with with no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I train with mY guerrilla all the time </v>

181
00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can work out with it just like a rug</v>

182
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 1>or kettlebell.</v>

183
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>You just have to be cognizant of where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head is facing,</v>

184
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>but you should know that anyway and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fine.</v>

185
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.290

<v Speaker 1>time exercise for strength and </v>

186
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:20.481
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fuck the music man.</v>

258
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Our experience here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to do this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the time he was doing like blade two </v>

<v Speaker 3>apparently he was off the handle.</v>

261
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 3>PaTton oswald has wrote a whole blog </v>
<v Speaker 3>entry about it on meeting.</v>

262
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>describing,</v>

263
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might've performed it somewhere.</v>

264
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.270
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might have performed it,</v>

265
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're hearing about it.</v>

266
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

267
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like Ryan O'neal and him.</v>

268
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:48.020
<v Speaker 3>And apparently this was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wesley was like,</v>

269
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.620
<v Speaker 3>he was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

270
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just off the deep end,</v>

271
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:56.761
<v Speaker 3>crazy on the set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they replaced him with what </v>

272
00:12:56.761 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 3>patent called much cooler black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They replaced him with another guy,</v>

273
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.550
<v Speaker 3>did the martial arts stuff and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I couldn't deal with them.</v>

274
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

275
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Why wasn't he already sort of a movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>star?</v>

276
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 3>He went crazy in between there and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are probably some substances were </v>

277
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always that.</v>

278
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Speaker 3>It's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always that.</v>

279
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you see them like taken whatever.</v>

280
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:19.370
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

281
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

282
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.220
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we can imagine what it's </v>

283
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 3>like to be that famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for some people it's just.</v>

284
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:32.790
<v Speaker 3>And then you get hooked up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong people in your life and you're </v>

285
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.040
<v Speaker 3>fucking around with the wrong friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>and getting in trouble.</v>

286
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 3>So many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elvis.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

288
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.200
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a well,</v>

289
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 3>the nature of the business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a fucking person who's in</v>

290
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:50.221
<v Speaker 3>the limelight that heavily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the nature of the business becomes </v>

291
00:13:50.221 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 3>very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the nature of your reality.</v>

292
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:52.930
<v Speaker 3>You're getting around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone treats me like a,</v>

293
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.310
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a commodity.</v>

294
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 3>What we were talking about justin </v>
<v Speaker 3>bieber,</v>

295
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:58.510
<v Speaker 3>like how justin bieber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids everywhere he goes,</v>

296
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 3>people fucking freak out just to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

297
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's some weird alien.</v>

299
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

300
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.750
<v Speaker 3>we can't imagine what the forum now sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of in a way.</v>

301
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an ideal way to live.</v>

302
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 3>It seems awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't feel bad.</v>

303
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 3>He's got all this money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but know it's so crazy,</v>

304
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.590
<v Speaker 3>like burden to throw on some bread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally told me he got into an elevator </v>

305
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.011
<v Speaker 3>with Jessica Simpson and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she turns to the woman who's with us </v>

306
00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:23.011
<v Speaker 3>because he's not supposed to be in here.</v>

307
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

308
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 3>It was just going up through whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>his room and he was in no way.</v>

309
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

310
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what though?</v>

311
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.920
<v Speaker 3>How do you start expecting that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is totally wrong,</v>

312
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:40.921
<v Speaker 3>but in her defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be her as a woman and be super duper </v>

313
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 3>super famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she must be so vulnerable.</v>

314
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.150
<v Speaker 3>IT must be weird to the opportunity to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For a guy to get in an elevator with her</v>

315
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 3>like men want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not used to it so much.</v>

316
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:57.341
<v Speaker 3>There's so many men who like and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows that he could probably </v>

317
00:14:57.341 --> 00:15:01.691
<v Speaker 3>physically take advantage of her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't believe that he's in her presence </v>

318
00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:03.130
<v Speaker 3>and attract environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an elevator really creep.</v>

319
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 3>He would go to town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could.</v>

320
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Who would ravage her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be horrible.</v>

321
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean now you're much more vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a woman if you're that super famous.</v>

322
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 3>If you think she puts in a writer when </v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes to a hotel is like,</v>

323
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to let him know,</v>

324
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 3>no one can ride with me.</v>

325
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

326
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 3>She might have rules at her security </v>
<v Speaker 3>follows security,</v>

327
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.060
<v Speaker 3>security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She might have rules like she doesn't </v>

328
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.061
<v Speaker 3>want security to let anybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hotel lobby with her won't let anybody </v>

329
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:31.890
<v Speaker 3>in the elevator with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

330
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:37.150
<v Speaker 3>she might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like people don't have to </v>

331
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.911
<v Speaker 3>listen to that normal after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's allowed to be in the elevator </v>

332
00:15:39.911 --> 00:15:39.911
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

333
00:15:39.911 --> 00:15:44.021
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing about like you and I is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're were standup comedians and by</v>

334
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:49.091
<v Speaker 3>being a stand up comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all the time forced to look at </v>

335
00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:49.091
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interrupt you,</v>

336

<v Speaker 3>You look at the world around you,</v>

338
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 3>you're looking for jokes and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look for jokes and yourself.</v>

339
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 3>You look at for jokes in your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't do that ever,</v>

340
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 3>so they're not thinking ever thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about their behavior.</v>

341
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 3>They just doing what they can get away </v>
<v Speaker 3>with and they're acting is fucking loony</v>

342
00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:14.561
<v Speaker 3>tunes often as they can get away with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is as they continue to get away with </v>

343
00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 3>more and more looney tune shit or got </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse and worse,</v>

344
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.920
<v Speaker 3>but that's what the whole diva thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>all about.</v>

345
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

346
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.700

<v Speaker 3>at people like,</v>

347
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.900
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

359
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 3>She's sAying that nobody can handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too after another.</v>

360

<v Speaker 3>but there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No way.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're not a man yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a child and you're adored.</v>

368
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.010
<v Speaker 3>That's not supposed to happen that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to feel insecure and see</v>

373
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot of it is exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seems like a nice kid.</v>

374
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I met him once.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It wasn't until I was shaking his hand </v>

379
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.140
<v Speaker 3>like as I was shaking his hand,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was just a nice kid.</v>

387
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:52.841
<v Speaker 3>Just came over and I realized as I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaking his hand that it was justin </v>

395
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.180
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like your,</v>

396
00:18:13.181 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 3>your reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so bizarre.</v>

397
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are just entitled to something,</v>

398
00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:19.010
<v Speaker 4>you were just like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

400
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Do you think they're just picking on him</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a point where like,</v>

401
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:28.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're like making new stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>of him peeing in a mop bucket and </v>

402
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.060
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

403
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.800
<v Speaker 4>they're making new stories of him being </v>
<v Speaker 4>a 21 year old egging his neighbor's </v>

404
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.770
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

405
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:34.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

406
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.650
<v Speaker 4>but it iS real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean when I was 21,</v>

407
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.880
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we all did.</v>

408
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:38.480
<v Speaker 4>We all did.</v>

409
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.360
<v Speaker 3>But a 21 year old that's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>$500,000,000</v>

410
00:18:43.361 --> 00:18:44.300
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

411
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.760
<v Speaker 3>that becomes more interesting when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>get mad at them in a bucket.</v>

412
00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:53.140
<v Speaker 3>You got thAt much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to pee in the house.</v>

413
00:18:53.141 --> 00:18:54.190
<v Speaker 3>The egging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house thing.</v>

414
00:18:54.191 --> 00:18:59.191
<v Speaker 3>I kind of disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

415
00:18:59.191 --> 00:18:59.191
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

416
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:00.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that being a story.</v>

417
00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a real important story.</v>

418
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

419
00:19:02.931 --> 00:19:05.900
<v Speaker 4>But he got caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like that is.</v>

420
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 4>But like all these other things are just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

421
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:09.950
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

422
00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:11.780
<v Speaker 4>you're 19 and slutting it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

423
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.790
<v Speaker 4>You're from the south,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

424
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.540
<v Speaker 4>That's perfect on on target.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you if you were hanging out with </v>

425
00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.891
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be just like hanging out with </v>

426
00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:23.891
<v Speaker 4>your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh dude,</v>

428
00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:24.320
<v Speaker 4>let's get a little faster than the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

429
00:19:24.321 --> 00:19:29.321
<v Speaker 4>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have all those things that </v>

430
00:19:29.321 --> 00:19:32.561
<v Speaker 4>you've did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've made stories out of all these </v>

431
00:19:32.561 --> 00:19:32.561
<v Speaker 4>little minor details and made it like </v>
<v Speaker 4>every time you go on tmz,</v>

432
00:19:32.561 --> 00:19:34.730
<v Speaker 4>it's something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like bieber did this,</v>

433
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.860
<v Speaker 4>he flicked off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was smoke coming out of his</v>

434
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 3>carly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He becomes the show.</v>

435
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:43.731
<v Speaker 3>See the problem is like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you step out like that and you </v>

436
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:47.541
<v Speaker 3>drive in a chrome car and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he's doing is he's stepping out,</v>

00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:53.601
<v Speaker 3>he's racing lamborghinis and miami and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's getting fucked up here and he's </v>

<v Speaker 3>getting fucked up there and he's having </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

440
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.120
<v Speaker 3>he's doing the best I've ever imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A 19 year old kid could do with a half a</v>

441
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>working on my painting.</v>

471
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:22.261
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you see more and more instances of </v>

472
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:24.670
<v Speaker 2>people that get that super stratosphere </v>
<v Speaker 2>fame and more and more.</v>

473
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:26.470

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

474
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson to me is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating character study on human </v>

475
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 2>beings that I've ever witnessed because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is.</v>

476
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:42.030
<v Speaker 2>He never went down and faint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I guess sort of he kind of did it </v>

477
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.030
<v Speaker 2>and then didn't.</v>

478
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Then we started sort of still in the mix</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people didn't want to believe </v>

479
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 2>that he was a child molester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wanted to believe it.</v>

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He became a monitor into a monster.</v>

483
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
<v Speaker 2>He became this white skinned vampire </v>
<v Speaker 2>like guy with alien eyes pick nose.</v>

<v Speaker 2>where his eyes were like really big and </v>

486
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.640
<v Speaker 2>why it was weird.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to have my nose fixed,</v>

492
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:31.891

546
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even willing to endure that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

547
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was getting paid so much fucking </v>

550
00:24:50.831 --> 00:24:52.060

<v Speaker 2>I guess you're not supposed to ask.</v>

552
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.430
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that would be a no </v>
<v Speaker 2>brainer.</v>

00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Like do you sleep?</v>

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

580
00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this dr.</v>

581
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Thought he was going to be able to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>them alive and if he kept him alive,</v>

582
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 2>he would be still pulling money out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>michael for a long time.</v>

583
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only reason why it makes any </v>

584
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.641
<v Speaker 2>sense that anybody would agree to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is because need money or they want </v>

585
00:26:45.641 --> 00:26:45.800
<v Speaker 2>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

586
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why it's not legal.</v>

587
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>

588
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.300
<v Speaker 2>It's scary that you can get a doctor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree to just put you under every night.</v>

589
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.380
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

590
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find the disadvantages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ended up going to sleep every night.</v>

591
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I might buy the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

592
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just the disadvantages of,</v>

593
00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:11.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of using it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>quality,</v>

628
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:41.000
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of hard work and people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that have worked on </v>

629
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.841
<v Speaker 2>farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that have families that </v>

630
00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:44.841
<v Speaker 2>worked on the farm.</v>

631
00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:47.870
<v Speaker 2>People that came over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their relatives came over here a long </v>

632
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.391
<v Speaker 2>ass time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I saw there once though I </v>

633
00:28:50.391 --> 00:28:52.611
<v Speaker 2>saw it was one of the early days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went there with you and there was </v>

634
00:28:52.611 --> 00:28:54.150
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put us into like a vip area,</v>

635
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.240
<v Speaker 2>those night clubs and some girl was </v>
<v Speaker 2>flirting and then she came in and sat </v>

636
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 2>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

637
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

638
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.830
<v Speaker 2>come on in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then as soon as she went in,</v>

639
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.200
<v Speaker 2>some girl behind the rope bumped her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just gave her this look like,</v>

640
00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to keep out of here.</v>

641
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 2>This isn't my area right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just took it over.</v>

642
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Was she kicked a girl out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so confused.</v>

643
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 2>She just got invited to some vip area </v>
<v Speaker 2>that immediately started acting like she</v>

644
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:22.700
<v Speaker 2>was better than everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first time I saw that behavior,</v>

645
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see where your shoes.</v>

646
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Somehow the queen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden,</v>

647
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can be county.</v>

648
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely explained that the least.</v>

649
00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 2>You might be too hard to talk right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My tolerance went down in New York.</v>

650
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:39.840
<v Speaker 2>My most slow your roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

651
00:29:39.841 --> 00:29:41.150
<v Speaker 2>The New York thing is a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

652
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's such a horrible way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They for folks who don't know.</v>

653
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not saying this like a.</v>

654
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 3>This is the way you have to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just letting you know,</v>

655
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.600
<v Speaker 3>in los angeles it is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously easy to procure a marijuana</v>

656
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.880
<v Speaker 3>just pulled over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially legal.</v>

657
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.220
<v Speaker 3>It's essentially legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

658
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a medical license,</v>

659
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 3>it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a medical license,</v>

660
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.550
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have a medical license,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's decriminalized.</v>

661
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.780
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

662
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that arnold did</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he left office.</v>

663
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 3>So As long as you're not smoking weed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and drIving like an asshole,</v>

664
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.630

<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fucking legal.</v>

665
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 3>You do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it in the privacy of your </v>

666
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 3>own home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll give a shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They don't give a shit in my window </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving me a lecture about texting with a</v>

668
00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 3>half smoke bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the middle,</v>

669
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 3>leaning in for like two minutes.</v>

670
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 3>They don't care then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

671
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.060
<v Speaker 3>They know what people are concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

672
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:39.061
<v Speaker 3>Especially police officers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are fucking </v>

673
00:30:39.061 --> 00:30:39.061
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

674
00:30:39.061 --> 00:30:39.130
<v Speaker 3>They're concerned with.</v>

675
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:41.110
<v Speaker 3>that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know if you.</v>

676
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 3>If you see a guy in his van looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheech and chong,</v>

677
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 3>that guy's probably drove really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow.</v>

678
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 3>As this smoke leaves is cracked window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is going to be a.</v>

679

<v Speaker 3>of merge,</v>

680
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.190
<v Speaker 3>but other than that in Maryland I </v>

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:28.200
<v Speaker 3>year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just.</v>

695
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't try it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the way to the airport.</v>

696
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder if I know edibles lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>their potency.</v>

697
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

698
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:37.210
<v Speaker 3>They go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes away like almost entirely.</v>

699
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:42.230
<v Speaker 3>It gets to the point where they don't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything but they only have like a </v>

700
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.780
<v Speaker 3>certain time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mccormick explained it to me once.</v>

701
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:48.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember if tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that was in the back of my </v>

702
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.830
<v Speaker 3>fridge for like three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you want it,</v>

706
00:31:55.150 --> 00:32:00.150
<v Speaker 3>it's different than when you cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the cooking aspect of it I </v>

707
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the edible form.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that it was the chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>noodle soup because I get that all the </v>

<v Speaker 3>habanero infused flavor.</v>

772

776
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:06.230

777
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 3>spaghetti.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took like a whole team one bite,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then all that was hot.</v>

780
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.970

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was just to narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems so strong.</v>

782
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:22.001
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it had to be more than when </v>

<v Speaker 5>They know to the stacks.</v>

814

<v Speaker 3>If I was an idiot,</v>

820
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.800
<v Speaker 3>if I was an idiot and I decided to start</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking cigarettes,</v>

832
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:22.950

<v Speaker 5>It gives people less like direct access,</v>

833
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.140
<v Speaker 5>easy access to a harmful product.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

834
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.530
<v Speaker 5>This is good.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they should,</v>

839
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Speaker 5>they should get rewarded that reward </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you do good thing.</v>

840
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:36.030
<v Speaker 5>It's nice when those people get </v>
<v Speaker 5>rewarded.</v>

841
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.560
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't make it bad.</v>

842
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you could just sell things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know are going to kill,</v>

843
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.330

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

844
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:48.210
<v Speaker 3>it's not even something that gets you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about,</v>

845
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.020
<v Speaker 3>there's a willingness when you decide </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to drink,</v>

846
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you,</v>

847
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.250
<v Speaker 3>like when if we're at a comedy club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you want to do shots,</v>

848
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.970
<v Speaker 3>shots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing that happens when you</v>

849
00:37:59.971 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 3>decide that you're going to drink that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is beneficial.</v>

850
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's camaraderie in it,</v>

851
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.130
<v Speaker 3>there's like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

852
00:38:07.131 --> 00:38:08.580

<v Speaker 3>there's happiness to it,</v>

853
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a warmth if you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

855
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 3>couple of drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the experience of smoking cigarettes</v>

856
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:19.660
<v Speaker 3>is just death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's all it is.</v>

857
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Nice when you're getting a good circle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>stimulation,</v>

00:45:57.991 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can portland.</v>

1042
00:45:59.101 --> 00:46:00.070
<v Speaker 2>it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be topless.</v>

1043
00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These tassels.</v>

1044
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

1045
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tasks on top of tassels.</v>

1046
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:12.590
<v Speaker 2>You need iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were tassels and issues you need </v>

1047
00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:17.691
<v Speaker 2>iowasca like that take you away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done that stuff?</v>

1048
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca still have not either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a more prolonged version of a dmt </v>

1049
00:46:31.281 --> 00:46:35.350
<v Speaker 1>trip that apparently doesn't quite get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that dmt flash level really,</v>

1050
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but it gives you sort of this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual insight thing that you don't </v>

1051
00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:44.150
<v Speaker 1>necessarily get with dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it's been described to me</v>

1052
00:46:44.151 --> 00:46:49.151
<v Speaker 1>by my friends who have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard like when you try to relate </v>

1053
00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:50.810
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's is very different,</v>

1054
00:46:50.811 --> 00:46:52.760
<v Speaker 1>so like if you haven't personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced it,</v>

1055
00:46:52.761 --> 00:46:56.450
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to put into context what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>

1056
00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Like how They're describing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:46:58.461 --> 00:47:01.490
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to put into words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of these days I'll have to do it,</v>

1058
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.940
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dmt flash,</v>

1059
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:10.390
<v Speaker 1>everybody that I've talked to where I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to piece together what they say </v>

1060
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:14.321
<v Speaker 1>about their experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all seems like we're all talkinG </v>

1061
00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:15.140
<v Speaker 1>about a similar place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to.</v>

1062
00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:20.830
<v Speaker 1>It's so wacky that it's hard to put into</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any context on,</v>

1063
00:47:21.921 --> 00:47:23.210
<v Speaker 1>in the real world.</v>

1064
00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:28.330
<v Speaker 1>so the words that you use are all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong words as they're talking about </v>

1065
00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:28.580
<v Speaker 1>talking about god and the voice of god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has no voice.</v>

1066
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:33.581
<v Speaker 1>It's something like is no arm of god is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that we can comprehend </v>

1067
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 1>if this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it isn't,</v>

1068
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1069
00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:36.190
<v Speaker 1>when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it isn't,</v>

1070
00:47:36.191 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 1>you actually communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1071
00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 1>If it's all happening inside your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all imaginary.</v>

1072
00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 1>God damn your brain has some untapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

1073
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably if that's in there,</v>

1074
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:50.810
<v Speaker 1>if that really is just our collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds in there or really is just the,</v>

1075
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1076
00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:56.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depth of the potential of human </v>

1077
00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.031
<v Speaker 1>thought and your ability to hallucinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>or imagined things are your imagination </v>

1078
00:48:00.031 --> 00:48:02.170
<v Speaker 1>in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very mechanics of your imagination,</v>

1079
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 1>creating all these crazy illusions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if that is the case,</v>

1080
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1081
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you know what an incredible potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human mind has just on its own that </v>

1082
00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 1>just we get to every now and again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts on this bizarre show of this,</v>

1083
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.650
<v Speaker 1>this godlike quality like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this perfect,</v>

1084
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 1>idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopian,</v>

1085
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 1>loving thought process.</v>

1086
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 1>The hits you when you're on that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like of course people think it's god.</v>

1087
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it is god and maybe what </v>
<v Speaker 1>god is is human potential.</v>

1088
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It's greatest heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what god really is.</v>

1089
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Just a concept and maybe we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting too much of it.</v>

1090
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 1>When you have a psychedelic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much.</v>

1091
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck you know that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping into.</v>

1092
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.830
<v Speaker 1>That gives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it once,</v>

1093
00:48:47.831 --> 00:48:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched them on.</v>

1094
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other stuff.</v>

1095
00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:52.960
<v Speaker 1>The empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empty.</v>

1096
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1097
00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:59.371
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we can make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were willing to sign a few pieces</v>

1098
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:02.890
<v Speaker 1>of paper for the government to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in this study,</v>

1099
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you should get in on the rick strassman </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

1100
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 1>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it again.</v>

1101
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.840
<v Speaker 1>What to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that wrote that book,</v>

1102
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.450
<v Speaker 1>dmt the spirit molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy that was able to,</v>

1103
00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:17.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secure federal research.</v>

1104
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a license to be able to do it.</v>

1105
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they funded it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They allowed him to do it,</v>

1106
00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:25.780
<v Speaker 1>but they allowed him to do intravenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>dmt.</v>

1107
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 1>A injection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some chippiness.</v>

1108
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book's called dmt,</v>

1109
00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:32.380
<v Speaker 1>the spirit molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a fantastic book.</v>

1110
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

1111
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:39.450
<v Speaker 1>he's a scientist and he's a strassman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say I would donate my Body to </v>

1112
00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:39.450
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant,</v>

1113
00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:42.280
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also like a really cool guy.</v>

1114
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1115
00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.940
<v Speaker 1>he's really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really nice persOn.</v>

1116
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And when you hear about his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relaying of these people's </v>

1117
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he set everything up and his,</v>

1118
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.770
<v Speaker 1>his willingness to track this idea down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to see what it really is all </v>

1119
00:49:58.770 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>about is really courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1120
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Speaker 1>for a doctor to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get in some weird.</v>

1121
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.830
<v Speaker 1>We can some weird situations where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think you're a kook,</v>

1122
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:11.130
<v Speaker 1>But he's dealing with a real chemical so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get funding to study </v>

1123
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:11.130
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms for the low.</v>

1124
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 1>The maps is starting to break some </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries on that and they're starting </v>

1125
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:16.300
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1126
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 1>to make some headway really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1127
00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a John Hopkins university </v>

1128
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.190
<v Speaker 1>study and psilocybin maps is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1129
00:50:24.191 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 1>multiple disciplinary psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

1130
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the actual acronym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it works,</v>

1131
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:35.081
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably the number one group </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like really intelligently </v>

1132
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:40.970
<v Speaker 1>debating and promoting psychedelics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the study of psychedelics.</v>

1133
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 1>All brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guys.</v>

1134
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had rick doblin,</v>

1135
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.540
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the guys from maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the head guys.</v>

1136
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:49.820
<v Speaker 1>We had them on the podcast and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have been cooler.</v>

1137
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I told him I suburban friends that take </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

1138
00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:56.060
<v Speaker 1>She didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's about to turn 40 well burbs.</v>

1139
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.040
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

1140
00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:57.720
<v Speaker 1>We're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1141
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.060
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like do it through with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband.</v>

1142
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Tell to take mushrooms and listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that use youtube song.</v>

1143
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Actually watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>

1144
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And when you can video the one fallon </v>
<v Speaker 1>from fallon.</v>

1145
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1146
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you think when you get through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain age though that it might be too </v>

1147
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:12.300
<v Speaker 2>scary to recommend somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1148
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't have herpes and she said I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be scared.</v>

1149
00:51:14.381 --> 00:51:14.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1150
00:51:14.681 --> 00:51:16.090
<v Speaker 2>of course you'll be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:17.610
<v Speaker 2>But I mean like when you get to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain age,</v>

1152
00:51:17.611 --> 00:51:19.630
<v Speaker 2>it kind of also have that like I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>

1153
00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:23.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1192
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.150
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mushrooms or smoked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having a conversation with a buddy</v>

1193
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:58.151
<v Speaker 1>of mine last night about a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ours and we were talking about like how </v>

1194
00:52:58.151 --> 00:53:02.351
<v Speaker 1>this dude could benefit from weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why he does this because he </v>

1195
00:53:02.351 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 1>doesn't smoke smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's not,</v>

1196
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:08.100
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have that paranoid </v>

1197
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:08.100
<v Speaker 1>introspective thing that you get when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you smoke weed.</v>

1198
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:12.860
<v Speaker 1>We start really examining yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncomfortable lights people.</v>

1199
00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:17.861
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't smoke weed who </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to lead the quality they're </v>

1200
00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:18.570
<v Speaker 1>lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have like this hubris thinking,</v>

1201
00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:24.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep pushing forward without </v>

1202
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:24.650
<v Speaker 1>considering how they come off to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1203
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 1>They just pushing forward.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it for a second.</v>

1206
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.230
<v Speaker 3>People get caught up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1207

<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

1213
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:48.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people say that martin </v>

1214
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.371
<v Speaker 3>scorsese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his movies are kind of like </v>

1221
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.640
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just knows how to make a movie that </v>

1222
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:09.150
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

1223
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Like he'll do things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a part when leonardo </v>

1224
00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:14.420
<v Speaker 3>dicaprio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1225
00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:18.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's moving and talking and they </v>

1226
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:18.740
<v Speaker 3>just stopped talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there,</v>

1227
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 3>there's no sound coming out.</v>

1228
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:24.140
<v Speaker 3>But he's walking towards the camera and </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at you essentially completely </v>

1229
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.840
<v Speaker 3>cut out the sound of all the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and he's talking to you.</v>

1230
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like these weird little things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does,</v>

1231
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 3>like this is the chaos of the trading </v>
<v Speaker 3>room floor.</v>

1232
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:31.790
<v Speaker 3>And as leonardo dicaprio walkthrough </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no sound.</v>

1234
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Just him talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's explaining his life.</v>

1235
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:40.850
<v Speaker 3>The world shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The record goes saying something about </v>

1236
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:40.850
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just dope.</v>

1237
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:42.650
<v Speaker 3>He's just dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin scorsese,</v>

1238
00:54:42.651 --> 00:54:44.330
<v Speaker 3>he's just a master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>

1239
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 3>he had his shot and I'm a taxi driver </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's when you see a guy walking </v>

1240
00:54:51.211 --> 00:54:53.340
<v Speaker 3>towards the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a character walk towards the camera,</v>

1241
00:54:53.341 --> 00:54:58.341
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd see another angle like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut right from there to cameron moving </v>

1242
00:54:58.341 --> 00:55:01.521
<v Speaker 3>towards something and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the point of view of the guy we </v>

1243
00:55:01.521 --> 00:55:01.521
<v Speaker 3>just saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1244
00:55:01.521 --> 00:55:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then he started having a pan across </v>

1245
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.210
<v Speaker 3>that view starts panning across the taxi</v>
<v Speaker 3>place all the way around and around,</v>

1246
00:55:06.211 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 3>and then it's that it puts the deniro in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shot was supposed to be his point of</v>

1247
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:11.590
<v Speaker 3>view and all of a sudden he's in it.</v>

1248
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:17.710
<v Speaker 3>He just does stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This shooting is just as craZy as this </v>

<v Speaker 2>demon soldiers flying out of your take </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this boner pills make me masturbate a</v>

1302
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:08.770
<v Speaker 2>lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really strike out.</v>

1303
00:58:08.771 --> 00:58:09.490
<v Speaker 2>And then you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You never even looked into it.</v>

1307
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I want propecia postcard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was.</v>

1308
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.860

<v Speaker 2>was like depression,</v>

1309
00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.670
<v Speaker 2>all stuff that maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1310
00:58:33.671 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe it's stuff was caused by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1311
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I think a hair shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1312
00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I had a bad reaction to that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It killed my bone on bone arthritis in </v>

1313
00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:44.460
<v Speaker 1>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killed my boners and it also made me,</v>

1314
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:45.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1315
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.690
<v Speaker 1>it made me more tired when I would work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1316
00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have as much endurance when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got off of it.</v>

1317
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:56.180
<v Speaker 1>My boners came back with a vengeance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt like I had more energy training </v>

1318
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.120
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1319
00:58:57.121 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's affecting me in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme way.</v>

1320
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody has like a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>stages.</v>

1321
00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:07.550
<v Speaker 1>The way it processes a testosterone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dihydrotestosterone see that everybody </v>

1322
00:59:09.031 --> 00:59:11.850
<v Speaker 1>has a different bodies reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>

1323
00:59:11.851 --> 00:59:14.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some people are allergic to certain</v>

1324
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.750
<v Speaker 1>types of antibiotics or they're allergic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to penicillin or they're allergic to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get weird rolls of the.</v>

1326
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 1>With your bodies is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be that my body didn't react to</v>

1327
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 1>it very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know a,</v>

1328
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy who's on it.</v>

1329
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:32.560
<v Speaker 1>There's no problems with it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been taking that shit for like 10 </v>

1330
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:32.560
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't.</v>

1331
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it was a problem,</v>

1332
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't realiZe it was a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>until after I stopped taking it.</v>

1333
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:42.070
<v Speaker 1>When it stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I ran out of it and all suddenly </v>

1334
00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:43.360
<v Speaker 1>take was like woken up from a coma to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in bold.</v>

1335
00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

1336
00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:47.300
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your head was.</v>

1337
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:48.740
<v Speaker 1>You look great when you shaved your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1338
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go.</v>

1339
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:52.370
<v Speaker 1>I did not like the shape that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>

1340
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:57.371
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look great with a shaved head or </v>

1341
00:59:57.371 --> 00:59:57.371
<v Speaker 1>going to have shaved heads in five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1342
00:59:57.371 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why the monks did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and I don't give a fuck move.</v>

1343
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1344
01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:06.230
<v Speaker 1>it was a matter of aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hair was getting so gross.</v>

1345
01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:11.231
<v Speaker 1>It was got down to the point where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't keep getting haircuts if </v>

1346
01:00:11.231 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>every time you get your haircut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hair still looks like shit.</v>

1347
01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>WhaT am I paying your shop all this shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1348
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>But I would have done now that diet now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've done,</v>

1349
01:00:18.591 --> 01:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I would have done a long ass time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the easiest way to deal with it.</v>

1350
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got a round head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1351
01:00:23.901 --> 01:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good head for,</v>

1352
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>for being bald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but getting your hair cut is so </v>

1353
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having to schedule that time out of your</v>

1354
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>day and sit down and listen to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

1355
01:00:35.661 --> 01:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I had a cool hairdresser for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1356
01:00:37.641 --> 01:00:42.641
<v Speaker 1>my friend gabrielle up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she was a hairdresser from the news </v>

1357
01:00:42.641 --> 01:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>radio days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so I used to actually enjoy.</v>

1360
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.980
<v Speaker 1>She probably kept me from cutting my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair off for a long time just because I </v>

1361
01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed hanging out with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to see her like once a month.</v>

1368
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:10.250
<v Speaker 4>The makeup people always hate me because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your ego because you always had that </v>

1369
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.761
<v Speaker 4>rule of like I never put makeup on like </v>

<v Speaker 1>I wore makeup everyday when I was on </v>

<v Speaker 1>newsradio.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They just want to do and I couldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1397
01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Then you know who was there anything I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did to be a dick.</v>

1398
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I was just totally replaceable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was totally replaceable.</v>

1399
01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:17.261
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't nobody on that show replay </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually replaced the guy who replaced </v>

1400
01:02:17.631 --> 01:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>ray romano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they took.</v>

1401
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Armando was booked for the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't shoot the pilot with ray</v>

1402
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>romano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1403
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray romano was booked for the pilot and </v>

1404
01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>he was working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they decided somewhere in the middle</v>

1405
01:02:29.611 --> 01:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>of race thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they weren't happy with </v>

1406
01:02:34.611 --> 01:02:37.731
<v Speaker 1>him or they decided to go a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>way with the character and he was </v>

1407
01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>originally the last minute like we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to switch.</v>

1408
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1409
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're beginning when they're coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with ideas and it's throwing the ideas </v>

1410
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.121
<v Speaker 1>around for a pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not uncommon for them to change a </v>

1411
01:02:50.121 --> 01:02:50.121
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked,</v>

1412
01:02:50.121 --> 01:02:53.451
<v Speaker 1>decide they need a different dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all these different dynamics </v>

1413
01:02:53.451 --> 01:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>and ray was more of a laid back sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dynamic.</v>

1414
01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:00.500
<v Speaker 1>That's who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where I'm going to see him on </v>

1415
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:00.500
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1416
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.920
<v Speaker 1>he's like a laid back sort of a guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they wanted someone who was a </v>

1417
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:03.920
<v Speaker 1>little aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

1418
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.550
<v Speaker 1>who was an idiot who's Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a male idiot,</v>

1419
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:07.140
<v Speaker 1>that was going to do aggressive stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1420
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:09.780
<v Speaker 1>That leaves room for funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got lucky.</v>

1421
01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I came along after ray was replaced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy who just fill it in for the </v>

1422
01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.520
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the pilot.</v>

1423
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>The other guy was in the pilot.</v>

1424
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:20.220
<v Speaker 1>He didn't think he had a job full time </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

1425
01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1426
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1427
01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:30.201
<v Speaker 1>maybe if he was really good they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have kept him or maybe if he was what </v>

1428
01:03:30.201 --> 01:03:30.201
<v Speaker 1>they were looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have kept him.</v>

1429
01:03:30.201 --> 01:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>So then they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1430
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:36.140
<v Speaker 1>did he knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing about the audition is </v>

1431
01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>that the first stuff that they wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1432
01:03:36.871 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting because um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that funny.</v>

1433
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.980
<v Speaker 1>It was like more like matter of factly </v>
<v Speaker 1>or was more like setting up a character.</v>

1434
01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was no jokes in them </v>
<v Speaker 1>were very subtle.</v>

1435
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1436
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:56.540
<v Speaker 1>a behavior sort of a piece and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like totally like tried to overdo </v>

1437
01:03:57.631 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 1>it and try to make it like really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't really funny.</v>

1438
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And they were saying they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The writers did that because they wanted</v>

1439
01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that no one would try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ham it up.</v>

1440
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1441
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

1442
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say it to make it funny like you </v>

1443
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.710
<v Speaker 1>know how to say it to make it funny or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1444
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>but if it's not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pretend it is.</v>

1445
01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have to be a joke.</v>

1446
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Like some things and not a joke and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are a joke just because you're </v>

1447
01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 1>creating a character like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1448
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:27.291
<v Speaker 1>that character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the character does like typical </v>

1449
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:27.291
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that character would,</v>

1450
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>it was like a joke of recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1451
01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the second time I came in for </v>

1452
01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:34.710
<v Speaker 1>the second one on the ground near bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet always go pick her up.</v>

1453
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it,</v>

1454
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll just pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in my pocket,</v>

1455
01:04:38.371 --> 01:04:39.860
<v Speaker 1>let him go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

1456
01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

1457
01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Well you guys have like routines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to things.</v>

1458
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based on what you know already.</v>

1459
01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:50.970
<v Speaker 1>But at the second time I went in for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audition,</v>

1460
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.010
<v Speaker 1>they wrote something really funny that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1461
01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:54.300
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is hilarious.</v>

1462
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.600
<v Speaker 1>It was really good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they had narrowed it down to a </v>

1463
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>group of people that they thought were </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to ham it up.</v>

1464
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And then they gave the smallest group to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remaining groups shit to be funny </v>

1465
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1466
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were super.</v>

1467
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know those guys.</v>

1468
01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a couple of guys.</v>

1469
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.020
<v Speaker 1>But I remember things I there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1470
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing that gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

1471
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It's to see other people falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subtests who's just fall apart.</v>

1472
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:29.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the guy who was auditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys who is waiting to </v>

1473
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.771
<v Speaker 1>audition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's totally fall apart or is visibly </v>

1474
01:05:31.771 --> 01:05:31.850
<v Speaker 1>sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was sweaty,</v>

1475
01:05:31.851 --> 01:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>like it was sweat was dripping down his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head really going over the lines in this</v>

1476
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>like really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a frantic way.</v>

1477
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Like he was like kind of mouthing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines while you're sitting there.</v>

1478
01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like he was falling apart.</v>

1479
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>

1480
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1482
01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:55.141
<v Speaker 1>There was something he was doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me massive confidence and I </v>

1483
01:05:55.141 --> 01:05:55.141
<v Speaker 1>remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1484
01:05:55.141 --> 01:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>if I just got an audition with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is gonna fall apart,</v>

1485
01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>one down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you know,</v>

1486
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.140
<v Speaker 1>it's probably one of those guys that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in hollywood like,</v>

1487
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:07.500
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're coming out here and you try </v>

1488
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and audition for shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally a crapshoot.</v>

1489
01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:12.900
<v Speaker 1>You could get super lucky on the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>first show you get cast and all of a </v>

1490
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.890
<v Speaker 1>sudden you're on television show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably helps that you don't know if</v>

1491
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 1>it's earlier where you don't really know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stakes.</v>

1492
01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it does,</v>

1493
01:06:18.311 --> 01:06:21.760
<v Speaker 1>but it also helps if you just get lucky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are what they're looking for,</v>

1494
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:26.500

<v Speaker 1>and never get cast and shit.</v>

1495
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.870

1531
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could never follow where,</v>

1532
01:07:59.461 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember people that have a.</v>

1533
01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1534
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:07.860
<v Speaker 1>if folks who weren't alive when roseanne</v>
<v Speaker 1>barr first hit,</v>

1535
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>she's like her voice ignored rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I gave it another shot and few </v>

1536
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>years later I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1537
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.430
<v Speaker 1>this show's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a great comic.</v>

1538
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1539
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially back in the day,</v>

1540
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when she,</v>

1541
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:22.700
<v Speaker 3>when she first made it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she to me is one of the most influential</v>

1542
01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:24.050
<v Speaker 3>comedians ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1543
01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because for women that had never been a </v>

1544
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:29.210
<v Speaker 3>woman like her before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the kinison version of a woman.</v>

1545
01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Never been a woman like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She actually had 30 minutes.</v>

1546
01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1547
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:35.590
<v Speaker 3>She did more than one special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1548
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:37.870
<v Speaker 3>she didn't maintain that level of stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1549
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once she became super famous and the tv </v>

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 3>show of the attitude of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1552
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:48.310
<v Speaker 3>She was bad ass dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When she was before she got her </v>

<v Speaker 3>television show and she was just doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up.</v>

1554
01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:50.690
<v Speaker 3>She was bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no women like her before.</v>

1555
01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:55.780
<v Speaker 3>She was a total new thing.</v>

1577
01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:49.210
<v Speaker 3>acceptable to say I don't shake hands.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to accept that.</v>

1584
01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's in the flintstones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking.</v>

1586
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.500
<v Speaker 3>No way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why is that allowed?</v>

1588
01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why it has to be like it's a movie.</v>

1589
01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.810
<v Speaker 3>A thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1590
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a fame thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our cues.</v>

1591
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>

1592
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're uniquely fortunate in </v>

1593
01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:32.471
<v Speaker 3>being stand up comedians that you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced to look at ourselves all the time</v>

1594
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.400
<v Speaker 3>and I think if you want to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who gets pushed into these weird</v>

1595
01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 3>boxes of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of power,</v>

1596
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 3>you the power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of unnatural,</v>

1597
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:46.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power that really doesn't exist anywhere</v>

1598
01:10:46.071 --> 01:10:46.600
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1599
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:51.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural world where someone is like </v>

1600
01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:51.650
<v Speaker 3>more famous than other people.</v>

1601
01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 3>So everyone around them is terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1602
01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.240
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they just have these </v>

1603
01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.840
<v Speaker 3>situations where they have a show and </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw soda at the fucking guy who was </v>

1604
01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.660
<v Speaker 3>running the show or they were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like one of those,</v>

1605
01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:10.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grace under fire.</v>

1606
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:15.270
<v Speaker 3>BreN butler apparently threw him in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face of the dude who was doing grace </v>

1607
01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:16.650
<v Speaker 3>under fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did we make enemies with the </v>

1725
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.550
<v Speaker 1>indians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they attack?</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it just like steal the women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>everybody that lands in a country and </v>

1728
01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:22.410
<v Speaker 1>this country is an attacker.</v>

1729
01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1730
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you might not think of yourself as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacker.</v>

1731
01:16:24.551 --> 01:16:27.010
<v Speaker 1>You think of yourself as a colonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're an attacker.</v>

1732
01:16:27.011 --> 01:16:28.510
<v Speaker 1>If you're running into people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>already there,</v>

1733
01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>

1734
01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:31.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1736
01:16:31.931 --> 01:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>they should make room for us to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1737
01:16:33.911 --> 01:16:38.911
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe they don't want to because </v>

1738
01:16:38.911 --> 01:16:38.911
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:16:38.911 --> 01:16:41.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you show any aggression to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you taking food out of their </v>

1740
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.610
<v Speaker 1>children are to get these things out of </v>

1741
01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was also the fucking </v>

1742
01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:49.140
<v Speaker 1>treaties that were broken and all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some crimes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1744
01:16:52.331 --> 01:16:55.780
<v Speaker 1>All the horrific crimes that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrated on the american indian.</v>

1745
01:16:55.781 --> 01:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

1746
01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:02.850

<v Speaker 1>think about it and he hears about the </v>

1747
01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:05.710
<v Speaker 1>slaughter and the fucking mass genocide </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1748
01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.890
<v Speaker 1>just the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1749
01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're respectful</v>

1750
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 5>of aboriginal people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If one aboriginal kills another one,</v>

1751
01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.310
<v Speaker 5>the white people don't deal with it.</v>

1752
01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:19.370
<v Speaker 1>You guys saw in you to deal with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1753
01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.310
<v Speaker 1>it freaked me out when they have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own justice system.</v>

1754
01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Freaked me out when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

1755
01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:25.060
<v Speaker 1>they were telling me about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1756
01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:30.090
<v Speaker 1>during the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was where they had this </v>

1757
01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:32.200
<v Speaker 1>concerted effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided to take aboriginal children</v>

1758
01:17:32.201 --> 01:17:37.201
<v Speaker 1>from their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steal them and raise them in the white </v>

1759
01:17:37.201 --> 01:17:37.201
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1760
01:17:37.201 --> 01:17:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help them to benefit them.</v>

1761
01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so craZy and dark.</v>

1762
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:48.090
<v Speaker 1>But the idea was that they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to civilize these people and the </v>

1763
01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:48.090
<v Speaker 1>only way to do it would be the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1764
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a real plan that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved with that.</v>

1765
01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1766
01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.000
<v Speaker 1>They took their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

1767
01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.060
<v Speaker 1>They took their kids because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that their culture was better.</v>

1768
01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:00.240
<v Speaker 1>So much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

1769
01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:03.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

1770
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.940
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy that people could take </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's children.</v>

1771
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

1773
01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:17.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently like they have a lot of the </v>

1774
01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.671
<v Speaker 1>same issues that american indians have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with alcohol problems in their </v>

1775
01:18:20.671 --> 01:18:21.730
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aboriginals.</v>

1776
01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Aborigines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1777
01:18:22.961 --> 01:18:27.040
<v Speaker 1>The native americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apparently it's a genetic issue with a</v>

1778
01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:29.920
<v Speaker 1>lot of them that they don't have long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1779
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Their ancestors didn't develop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance and they weren't accustomed to</v>

1780
01:18:33.971 --> 01:18:38.971
<v Speaker 1>alcohol the way like europeans were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So apparently aboriginal people in </v>

1781
01:18:39.161 --> 01:18:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Australia had a similar problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of them,</v>

1782
01:18:41.351 --> 01:18:43.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of real problems with.</v>

1783
01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they ever had alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1784
01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but they probably didn't have the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>

1785
01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Even if theY had their own alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't have wild Turkey,</v>

1786
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:56.870
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dIdn't ever have any crazy </v>

1787
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.870
<v Speaker 1>tequilas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have some shifts.</v>

1788
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:03.250
<v Speaker 1>It might add some fermented berry juice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that of gets you high if you leave it </v>

1789
01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:03.730
<v Speaker 1>out and chase off the flies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1790
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:06.970
<v Speaker 1>but they were so arrogant that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was okay to take their kids.</v>

1791
01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sell a mean horrible.</v>

1792
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Pulling a kid away from a mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrifying.</v>

1793
01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ugliest aspects of humanity.</v>

1794
01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:18.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1795
01:19:18.401 --> 01:19:22.120
<v Speaker 5>the thing I started thinking recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I thought about Philip Morris,</v>

1796
01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:27.340
<v Speaker 5>the tobacco companies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you think of their evil people like </v>

1797
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 5>trying to addict you even though they </v>
<v Speaker 5>know it's already like bad for you,</v>

1798
01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:32.560
<v Speaker 5>but they're not evil people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>TheY're just people that had a job there</v>

1799
01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.020
<v Speaker 5>that are doing that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not.</v>

1800
01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:40.021
<v Speaker 5>These are all old men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just people Who got a job and </v>

1801
01:19:40.021 --> 01:19:42.771
<v Speaker 5>now they're still doing that job even </v>
<v Speaker 5>though know it's terrible sort of.</v>

1802
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to make the decision to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

1803
01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could easily just say,</v>

1804
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna.</v>

1805
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take this job.</v>

1806
01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Then the encountered from cigarettes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a thing of the past.</v>

1807
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I think the shit that he's sucking on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing,</v>

1808
01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.480
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make much more sense for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1809
01:19:59.481 --> 01:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>If that stops killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't they do it?</v>

1810
01:20:01.701 --> 01:20:03.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a nicotine distribution device.</v>

1811
01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.990
<v Speaker 5>Definitely getting people into smoking </v>
<v Speaker 5>these again now and then it's helping.</v>

1812
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 5>It's helping like</v>

1813
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:13.070
<v Speaker 4>the tobacco farms find a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>money because they've all invested </v>

1814
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:14.960
<v Speaker 4>heavily in it because new people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually getting hooked on justice,</v>

1815
01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 4>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nicotine.</v>

1816
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Now I've noticed</v>

1817
01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:20.960
<v Speaker 3>what is the actual health of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendships?</v>

1818
01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Those are outlawed in New York now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1819
01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indoors,</v>

1820
01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:29.200
<v Speaker 3>because they said I'm a secondhand </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke,</v>

1821
01:20:29.201 --> 01:20:31.150
<v Speaker 3>but he builds vapor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they said they put.</v>

1822
01:20:31.151 --> 01:20:32.800
<v Speaker 3>The problem is they put on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>package.</v>

1823
01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:38.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm safer than smoking cigarettes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to prove that you can't </v>

1824
01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.840
<v Speaker 3>just say that you show me a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the problem.</v>

1825
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:42.510
<v Speaker 3>You do have to prove that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1826
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like some sort of like ses </v>
<v Speaker 3>carcinogen or something where it falls </v>

1827
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.971
<v Speaker 3>into the same category as cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem like that blue cigarettes </v>

1828
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:50.971
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lingers.</v>

1829
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Mill lingers more like smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't smell it though.</v>

1830
01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:59.730
<v Speaker 4>You definitely smell like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because how I found out about this </v>

1831
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:03.100
<v Speaker 4>actual one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this girl was smoking it and it smelled </v>

1832
01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:03.100
<v Speaker 4>like strawberries and I just walked by </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

1833
01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.900
<v Speaker 4>what was that strawberry snatcher vagina</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit,</v>

1834
01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.190
<v Speaker 4>and then she showed it to me and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1835
01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:07.580
<v Speaker 3>These will be better for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll probably will take off probably </v>

1861
01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:07.580
<v Speaker 3>with a cigarette in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll probably out there,</v>

1862
01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:11.680
<v Speaker 3>but this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that nicotine is actually an </v>

1863
01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.420
<v Speaker 3>infect a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an effective cognitive boost.</v>

1864
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:17.750
<v Speaker 3>It gives you like a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things that Steven </v>

1865
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:19.020
<v Speaker 3>King said when Stephen King stop smoking</v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>

1866
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:24.021
<v Speaker 3>He said he really felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really felt the difference in these </v>

1867
01:22:24.021 --> 01:22:26.921
<v Speaker 3>synapses firing his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he described it and writing his </v>

1868
01:22:26.921 --> 01:22:28.220
<v Speaker 3>books and nicotine as sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulating effect on,</v>

1869
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:33.250
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on thinking and creativity for a lot of </v>

1870
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:33.250
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the tar,</v>

1871
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:33.650
<v Speaker 3>the tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kudzu.</v>

1872
01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.680
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well no,</v>

1873
01:22:34.681 --> 01:22:37.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of the chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1874
01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:42.290
<v Speaker 3>there's like 590 chemicals that they add</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cigarettes on top of the tobacco </v>

1875
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.840
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All approved bar,</v>

1876
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:48.860
<v Speaker 3>lovely government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these insane chemicals are </v>

1877
01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:50.820
<v Speaker 3>essentially designed to change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flavor and to make more addictive.</v>

1878
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:53.610
<v Speaker 3>You know what to do with the nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a certain amount,</v>

1879
01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:58.640
<v Speaker 3>they'll shoot it up real high like all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden from five to seven and then </v>

1880
01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.201
<v Speaker 3>everyone has to smoke less cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like all of a sudden I get </v>

1881
01:23:03.201 --> 01:23:05.811
<v Speaker 3>in too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they always want to like half a </v>

1882
01:23:05.811 --> 01:23:07.071
<v Speaker 3>cigarette or whatever and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting their fix of whatever they need </v>

1883
01:23:07.071 --> 01:23:07.071
<v Speaker 3>and then they</v>

1884
01:23:07.071 --> 01:23:07.510
<v Speaker 2>plummeted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get used to that,</v>

1885
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:09.090
<v Speaker 2>they plummeted down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to.</v>

1886
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you start smoking more because </v>

1887
01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.281
<v Speaker 2>he's not getting what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they push it right back up to </v>

1888
01:23:16.281 --> 01:23:16.281
<v Speaker 2>average again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>

1889
01:23:16.281 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 2>they variant but on occasion in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get you fucking more addicted.</v>

1890
01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:24.660
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that they already know it causes </v>

1891
01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.541
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still trying to get you more </v>

1892
01:23:27.541 --> 01:23:27.541
<v Speaker 2>addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1893
01:23:27.541 --> 01:23:30.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they can vary the amount of nicotine </v>

1894
01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:30.810
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know this is?</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1955
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 1>it's an important subject for guys like </v>

<v Speaker 7>of 22 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>got fucked up.</v>

1961
01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:42.910
<v Speaker 7>I have noticed that most of the guests </v>
<v Speaker 7>are mostly white males.</v>

1962
01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.370
<v Speaker 7>Have 22 episodes that you can get into </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1963
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:49.480
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you take a look over here.</v>

1964
01:26:49.481 --> 01:26:50.680
<v Speaker 7>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you see?</v>

1965
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.720
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lOt of what's going on here.</v>

1966
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1967
01:26:58.590 --> 01:27:02.670
<v Speaker 7>this really pisses me off,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but really pisses me off.</v>

1968
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:03.710
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's okay.</v>

1969
01:27:03.711 --> 01:27:04.530
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go ahead.</v>

1970
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:09.950
<v Speaker 7>But you made a comment on the tina fey </v>
<v Speaker 7>episode that I thought was interesting </v>

1971
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:12.981
<v Speaker 7>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd like to get your thoughts on a </v>

1972
01:27:12.981 --> 01:27:12.981
<v Speaker 7>little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You said you were talking to her to that</v>

1973
01:27:12.981 --> 01:27:14.700
<v Speaker 7>and you said something about the female </v>
<v Speaker 7>comedians.</v>

1974
01:27:14.701 --> 01:27:19.701
<v Speaker 7>It's a struggle for them to balance </v>
<v Speaker 7>their feminine projections with their </v>

1975
01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:21.960
<v Speaker 7>comedic gold in this context of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not gender diverse.</v>

1976
01:27:21.961 --> 01:27:23.430
<v Speaker 7>I just want to know what you meant by </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1977
01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:28.490
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was kind of curious what it's like to </v>

1978
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:29.010
<v Speaker 7>be a woman in comedy as opposed to a </v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1979
01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:34.010
<v Speaker 7>There was a little bit of a difference </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I thought that might be an </v>

1980
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.010
<v Speaker 7>interesting thing to discuss from her </v>
<v Speaker 7>perspective.</v>

1981
01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:37.800
<v Speaker 7>She saw successful at it and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 7>wondering how she looked at it,</v>

1982
01:27:37.801 --> 01:27:41.220
<v Speaker 7>if she even thought about it and she </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of gave me the answer,</v>

1983
01:27:41.221 --> 01:27:43.650
<v Speaker 7>which is yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you do have to think about that,</v>

1984
01:27:43.651 --> 01:27:45.960
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just another thing to think about.</v>

1985
01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:46.890
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>

1986
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:48.210
<v Speaker 7>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now you,</v>

1987
01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:53.240
<v Speaker 7>there were a lot of things about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>comedians of cars in the beginning of </v>

1988
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.440
<v Speaker 7>the first 10 I did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think we're all white males and people</v>

1989
01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:56.230
<v Speaker 7>writing all about that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I,</v>

1990
01:27:56.250 --> 01:28:01.250
<v Speaker 7>part of the reason why I had people had </v>
<v Speaker 7>tweeted at me when I said I'm </v>

1991
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:04.071
<v Speaker 7>interviewing with jerry seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll ask him about their gender </v>

1992
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:04.071
<v Speaker 7>diversity on this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1993
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people think it's the census or </v>

1994
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:09.160
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I may represent the,</v>

1995
01:28:09.161 --> 01:28:12.390
<v Speaker 7>the actual pie chart of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of America.</v>

1996
01:28:12.391 --> 01:28:14.220
<v Speaker 7>Who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just funnY.</v>

1997
01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.140
<v Speaker 7>Funny is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is the,</v>

1998
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.050
<v Speaker 7>is the world that I live in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're funny.</v>

1999
01:28:19.051 --> 01:28:20.310
<v Speaker 7>I'm interested.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not funny.</v>

2000
01:28:20.311 --> 01:28:25.311
<v Speaker 7>I'm not interested and I have no </v>
<v Speaker 7>interest in gender or race or anything </v>

2001
01:28:25.531 --> 01:28:30.531
<v Speaker 7>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but everyone else is kind of with their </v>

2002
01:28:30.531 --> 01:28:32.040
<v Speaker 7>little calculating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is this the exact right mix?</v>

2003
01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:33.240
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2004
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's a,</v>

2005
01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:39.330
<v Speaker 7>to me it's anti comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's comedy,</v>

2006
01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:41.410
<v Speaker 7>it's more about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2007
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:45.480
<v Speaker 7>pc nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then are you making us laugh or not?</v>

2008
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.140
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

2009

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2011
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I saw people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bring it up.</v>

2013
01:28:56.421 --> 01:29:01.421
<v Speaker 1>I don't even Want to pull the video up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to watch it again </v>

2014
01:29:01.421 --> 01:29:01.421
<v Speaker 1>because it was so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2015
01:29:01.421 --> 01:29:02.820
<v Speaker 1>people that were taking that and saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a problem.</v>

2016
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:05.830
<v Speaker 1>They're taking that and he's not saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

2017
01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if he's saying I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only care about what's funny,</v>

2018
01:29:09.670 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 1>trying to make things funny and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about making them diverse.</v>

2019
01:29:13.501 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you think about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mustaches on your show,</v>

2020
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:17.910
<v Speaker 1>because I wasn't even thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2021
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:22.970
<v Speaker 1>that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you should be able to do creatively </v>

2022
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:25.551
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when your goal is just make </v>

2023

<v Speaker 1>stuff funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why should he have to.</v>

2024
01:29:25.551 --> 01:29:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I watch a show with all koreans in </v>

2025
01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.561
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get upset that there's no white </v>

2026
01:29:33.561 --> 01:29:33.561
<v Speaker 1>people say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2027
01:29:33.561 --> 01:29:37.580
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just because you're white and </v>

2028
01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.351
<v Speaker 1>you're privileged and there's an overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem maybe of not using enough black </v>

2029
01:29:39.961 --> 01:29:41.670
<v Speaker 1>people are not using enough people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>color,</v>

2030
01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:44.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's not each individual shoots </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2031
01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2032
01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:50.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best thing about this world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

2033
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:52.800
<v Speaker 1>there's racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the worst things,</v>

2034
01:29:52.801 --> 01:29:57.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best thing about our </v>

2035
01:29:57.801 --> 01:29:57.801
<v Speaker 1>culture that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2036
01:29:57.801 --> 01:29:58.680
<v Speaker 1>we aren't equally represented in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

2037
01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:00.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best thing when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2038
01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to factor in populations,</v>

2039
01:30:03.241 --> 01:30:04.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2040
01:30:04.801 --> 01:30:09.801
<v Speaker 1>how long the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who have been in the </v>

2041
01:30:09.801 --> 01:30:11.931
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long these people have been in the </v>

2042
01:30:11.931 --> 01:30:11.931
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit going on.</v>

2043
01:30:11.931 --> 01:30:12.270
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about putting a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>show on television,</v>

2044
01:30:12.271 --> 01:30:17.271
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think that once someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets into a position where they have a </v>

2045
01:30:17.271 --> 01:30:20.241
<v Speaker 1>successful show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then on top of having to create that </v>

2046
01:30:20.241 --> 01:30:23.301
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also have an obligation to be </v>

2047
01:30:23.301 --> 01:30:25.251
<v Speaker 1>diverse because they're representing </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and they're supposed to like </v>

2048
01:30:25.251 --> 01:30:28.590
<v Speaker 1>give opportunities to like a equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the population.</v>

2049
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:30.360
<v Speaker 1>For that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Storyteller show,</v>

2050
01:30:30.361 --> 01:30:35.361
<v Speaker 1>this is where it's a problem because no </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you should be able to do what </v>

2051
01:30:35.361 --> 01:30:39.411
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sOme government position we're </v>

2052
01:30:39.411 --> 01:30:40.410
<v Speaker 1>talking about is a creative thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making.</v>

2053
01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:45.411
<v Speaker 1>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are comfortable doing it only </v>

2054
01:30:45.411 --> 01:30:48.111
<v Speaker 1>with black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should only deal with black people </v>

2055
01:30:48.111 --> 01:30:48.111
<v Speaker 1>if then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're probably like,</v>

2056
01:30:48.111 --> 01:30:48.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked like four or five girls.</v>

2057
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.910
<v Speaker 1>None of them could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did my part.</v>

2058
01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:52.430
<v Speaker 1>what am I suppose to get somebody worse?</v>

2059
01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Just because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2060
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should especially like that.</v>

2061
01:30:56.221 --> 01:31:01.221
<v Speaker 1>Like the storyteller type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should get whoever you think is </v>

2062
01:31:01.221 --> 01:31:01.221
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your show things that you think are</v>

2063
01:31:01.221 --> 01:31:02.970
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know you.</v>

2064
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So I know if you find a woman who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay black,</v>

2065
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:12.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not that many black seven foot </v>

2066
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:15.501
<v Speaker 1>tall woman and she's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking lover and you'll start </v>

2067
01:31:15.501 --> 01:31:18.660
<v Speaker 1>talking about our gracious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she's a five foot nine white girl,</v>

2068
01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.180
<v Speaker 1>you know who's really cute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's really hilarious.</v>

2069
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:26.270
<v Speaker 1>You'll say she's really hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't give a shit about </v>

2070
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:28.821
<v Speaker 1>anything funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just one of the reasons why I wanted </v>

2071
01:31:28.821 --> 01:31:28.821
<v Speaker 1>to play this when you're here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2072
01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:31.770
<v Speaker 1>thIs is what you should be focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're tricking him.</v>

2073
01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.190
<v Speaker 1>They're setup question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a setup question because it's a.</v>

2074
01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:40.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of a goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what he's trying to do when </v>

2075
01:31:40.210 --> 01:31:44.211
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to make a good council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also pretty much most of that show </v>

2076
01:31:44.211 --> 01:31:48.290
<v Speaker 1>is him in a car getting coffee with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and look,</v>

2077
01:31:48.331 --> 01:31:49.990
<v Speaker 1>this clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2078
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:55.120
<v Speaker 1>We'll have the people that hang out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's not that many black comics </v>

2079
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:55.120
<v Speaker 1>at the clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothIng wrong with it.</v>

2080
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:59.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just who he is and who his friends </v>

2081
01:31:59.420 --> 01:31:59.420
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:31:59.420 --> 01:31:59.420
<v Speaker 1>He did a shoW with those four people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to have them on.</v>

2083
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:05.290
<v Speaker 3>We're going to force a black guy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it just have in this mostly </v>

2084
01:32:05.290 --> 01:32:06.290
<v Speaker 3>his friends and look what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had chris rock on.</v>

2085
01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:07.930
<v Speaker 3>They got pulled over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's just.</v>

2086
01:32:08.710 --> 01:32:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of their rope instead they </v>

2087
01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:14.940
<v Speaker 3>got pulled over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should be able to do whatever the </v>

2088
01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:14.940
<v Speaker 3>fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his thing,</v>

2089
01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:19.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't be able to do whatever he </v>

2090
01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:19.090
<v Speaker 3>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2091
01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:21.301
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you should even debating </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's got issues because what he </v>

2092
01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:26.101
<v Speaker 3>wants is different than when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it doesn't represent the exact </v>

2093
01:32:26.101 --> 01:32:26.101
<v Speaker 3>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he had three out of 20.</v>

2094
01:32:26.101 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 3>If you have five out of 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have been okay.</v>

2095
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong with sex and the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with the show them</v>

2096
01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.550
<v Speaker 3>that is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2097
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:35.050
<v Speaker 3>If you're a woman and you were in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>forties when that shit came out,</v>

2098
01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 3>you would love it.</v>

2099
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just wrong for ari shaffir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for them,</v>

2100
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:40.710
<v Speaker 3>nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women in entertainment,</v>

2101
01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.210
<v Speaker 3>if it's bunch of women doing shit for </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

2102
01:32:43.211 --> 01:32:45.610
<v Speaker 3>they should be able to cast whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>women they want to cast.</v>

2103
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:47.950
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be a man that steps up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

2104
01:32:47.951 --> 01:32:52.951
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and the guys behind you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>psi phi for women.</v>

2113
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:19.770

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2118
01:33:22.411 --> 01:33:22.930

<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>

2119
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.600
<v Speaker 3>If that's what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black entertainment is so bad.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you need them is fucking garbage.</v>

<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>funny movies that would happen to people</v>

2136
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:08.170
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like when?</v>

2138
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bunch of known a white comedy </v>

2139
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.991
<v Speaker 3>directors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judd apatow guys who produce phillips of</v>

2140
01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.620
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>top phillips,</v>

2141
01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 3>one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.460
<v Speaker 3>They're producing like white comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious white comedies.</v>

2143
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:29.470
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear about a lot of black guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are doing that.</v>

2144
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:30.380
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2145
01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:33.100
<v Speaker 3>but aren't they white comedies or are </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just comedies?</v>

2146
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not because craig robinson was </v>

2147
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.310
<v Speaker 3>on a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2148
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.310
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2149
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:40.870
<v Speaker 3>He was awesome and this is the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was really good in that.</v>

2150
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2151
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:46.550
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the part of michael cera got </v>

2152
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.600
<v Speaker 3>sabbath and somebody took my cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started ringing his backpack.</v>

2153
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:47.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2154
01:34:47.051 --> 01:34:51.610
<v Speaker 3>that's really embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a funny movie,</v>

2155
01:34:51.611 --> 01:34:53.390
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When kenny powers came in,</v>

2156
01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.480
<v Speaker 3>that's when it became the most awesome </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie ever.</v>

2157
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>He's such a dickhead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started washing is good with</v>

2158
01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:03.020
<v Speaker 1>their fucking whatever water they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>remaining small amount of water,</v>

2159
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:05.280
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2160
01:35:05.290 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to make a show with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever you want to make a show.</v>

2161
01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:11.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2162
01:35:11.150 --> 01:35:16.150
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The terms you're talking about have </v>

2163
01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:16.150
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with that world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world.</v>

2164
01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:17.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It exists in funny,</v>

2165
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all that matters,</v>

2166
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:24.430
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>affirmative action and comedy that you </v>

2167
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:25.790
<v Speaker 1>should then that's essentially what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>

2168
01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:28.580
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that you should have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have x amount of women.</v>

2169
01:35:28.581 --> 01:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>You should have to have x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people.</v>

2170
01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:31.400
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>

2171
01:35:31.401 --> 01:35:33.200
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have just a lot of white friends?</v>

2172
01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>But then the problem is then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>making female comedy worse.</v>

2173
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 1>You're makiNg it worse for advancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people without merit.</v>

2174
01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Making it overall worse while you can.</v>

2175
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Most certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2176
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:49.510
<v Speaker 1>the other argument would be that he just</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hang out in those cliques so he </v>

2177
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:53.801
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know these funny women and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would benefit everybody if he got to </v>

2178
01:35:53.801 --> 01:35:54.530
<v Speaker 1>know them and had them on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that argument.</v>

2179
01:35:54.531 --> 01:35:59.531
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if there was like a pool of talent</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you knew that was really fucking </v>

2180
01:35:59.531 --> 01:36:01.700
<v Speaker 1>crackling that you wanted to have on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your show,</v>

2181
01:36:01.701 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day it's who he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to talk to.</v>

2182
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Like when people say to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you have a big foot expert on?</v>

2183
01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to fucking talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why do you have a </v>

2184
01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:15.881
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting expert on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to talk to a bowhunting </v>

2185
01:36:15.881 --> 01:36:15.881
<v Speaker 1>expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2186
01:36:15.881 --> 01:36:16.160
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to listen,</v>

2187
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to,</v>

2188
01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:23.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will do my best to try to make it </v>

2189
01:36:23.230 --> 01:36:23.780
<v Speaker 1>entertaining and I will try to ask the </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions that I have.</v>

2190
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I will try to explore as objectively and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly.</v>

2191
01:36:27.150 --> 01:36:29.690
<v Speaker 1>But that's my perspective and my point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of view.</v>

2192
01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:30.490
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

2193
01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody asked me the other day like how</v>

2194
01:36:32.031 --> 01:36:34.030

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2195
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:35.570
<v Speaker 1>like three or four or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2196
01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:40.571

<v Speaker 1>todd glass martindale.</v>

2197

2231
01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:08.970
<v Speaker 3>step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A curious chimp.</v>

2232
01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.810
<v Speaker 3>We used to always look at these charts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store to see who got what.</v>

2239
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.740
<v Speaker 3>the higher primate fanny pack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the beginning from there.</v>

2240
01:38:29.741 --> 01:38:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm on my last launch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other get up.</v>

2241
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:36.550
<v Speaker 3>She me off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what natasha did when she had a </v>

2242
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.550
<v Speaker 3>thing for new year's eve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:40.140
<v Speaker 3>People are mad at her and she made up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to get mad.</v>

2245
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:45.440
<v Speaker 3>It's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she made the best apology you could </v>

2246
01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:45.440
<v Speaker 3>ever make.</v>

2247
01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:45.670
<v Speaker 3>It was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2248
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You misunderstood it.</v>

2249
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Their old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their teeth fall out when they're old.</v>

2250
01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:49.770
<v Speaker 3>That's the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2251
01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:51.130
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

2252
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:53.640
<v Speaker 3>she was pretty clear that she was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>joking around,</v>

2253
01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:58.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty obvious that it was just </v>

2254
01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:01.730
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Veterans are being mistreated as they </v>

2255
01:39:01.730 --> 01:39:01.730
<v Speaker 3>come home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's the issue.</v>

2256
01:39:01.730 --> 01:39:01.980
<v Speaker 3>You should worry about if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>honor the veterans.</v>

2257
01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a joke and it's not that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were really upset.</v>

2258
01:39:05.301 --> 01:39:10.301
<v Speaker 3>Is it that people think that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the license to be upset and then they </v>

2259
01:39:10.301 --> 01:39:10.920
<v Speaker 3>can get you in trouble now what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do,</v>

2260
01:39:10.921 --> 01:39:13.890
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to get you in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was just trying to change things.</v>

2261
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:16.090
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to get you in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in trouble.</v>

2262
01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:16.710
<v Speaker 3>They can feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2263
01:39:16.711 --> 01:39:20.480
<v Speaker 3>they can contact the network so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should do something with this.</v>

2264
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't have anybody in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family that says something that dumb.</v>

2265
01:39:24.121 --> 01:39:29.121
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally they missed one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know they go for a little old </v>

2266
01:39:29.121 --> 01:39:32.151
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>JOy when vengeance and I deserved </v>

2267
01:39:32.151 --> 01:39:32.151
<v Speaker 3>vengeance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She should be fired.</v>

2268
01:39:32.151 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 3>If an opposite of a drama is not any </v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

2269
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:38.100
<v Speaker 3>you can't fire anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to see as if it's not</v>

2270
01:39:38.101 --> 01:39:41.220
<v Speaker 3>such an innocuous joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it actually is a borderline like rape</v>

2271
01:39:41.221 --> 01:39:46.221
<v Speaker 3>or murder or pedophile joke where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not completely nothing and it's not a </v>

2272
01:39:46.221 --> 01:39:49.581
<v Speaker 3>cute woman doing the non-apology.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like you can't fucking endorse.</v>

2283
01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That lack kind of gay bashing,</v>

2284
01:40:10.651 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 3>like saying that he would stab his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his son if his son was gay.</v>

2285
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.640

<v Speaker 3>I can endorse that,</v>

2286
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:22.050

<v Speaker 3>it's what he does.</v>

2287
01:40:22.051 --> 01:40:27.051
<v Speaker 3>He says ridiculously outrageous shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he doesn't really mean and now </v>

2288
01:40:27.051 --> 01:40:27.720
<v Speaker 3>because it's popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go against it.</v>

2289
01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.990
<v Speaker 3>You caN't eat wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what he's doing.</v>

2290
01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:35.991
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a joke to pretend that he's </v>

2291
01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:37.200
<v Speaker 3>not saying something completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>outrageous,</v>

2292
01:40:37.201 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 3>that he absolutely doesn't matter how </v>
<v Speaker 3>old you are,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 3>He rubs his belly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll get pregnant who slap his belly</v>

<v Speaker 1>show someone getting pregnant tonight to</v>

2298

2299
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:04.470
<v Speaker 1>that's his whole thing was a real room </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he couldn't read a real legitimate </v>

2300
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.840
<v Speaker 1>rumor that people are telling charlie </v>
<v Speaker 1>barnett couldn't read.</v>

2301
01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:06.490
<v Speaker 1>That's how he couldN't get on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturday night live.</v>

2302
01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Charlie barnett was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris was shaped chappelle's teacher </v>

2304
01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>that's mentor him and a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

2305
01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.510
<v Speaker 1>When I was in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was already not there anymore.</v>

2306
01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died,</v>

2307
01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.110
<v Speaker 1>died of aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

2308
01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a,</v>

2309
01:41:26.050 --> 01:41:31.050
<v Speaker 1>like a guy who was dave chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of taught dave chappelle had to </v>

2310
01:41:31.050 --> 01:41:31.050
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2311
01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:34.660
<v Speaker 1>that those street side shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I might be talking to school,</v>

2312
01:41:34.661 --> 01:41:36.910
<v Speaker 1>but I have seen dave chappelle do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>street side show.</v>

2313
01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Dave chappelle in montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty hilarious when he was </v>

2314
01:41:42.150 --> 01:41:42.250
<v Speaker 1>really young too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when I first met him.</v>

2315
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I think he was probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I first met him in New York and then I </v>

2316
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.990
<v Speaker 1>saw him again up in montreal when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2317
01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe like 19 sit on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took his hat off,</v>

2318
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:56.160
<v Speaker 1>put his hat on the ground and did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy show and then pass the hat </v>

2319
01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:56.160
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2320
01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.200
<v Speaker 1>And people put money in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was before he was famous and he would</v>

2321
01:41:59.201 --> 01:42:02.530
<v Speaker 1>just do it at the drop of a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just do javelin notice.</v>

2322
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Just when he was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

2323
01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:07.780
<v Speaker 1>He would kick cassius developed to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd.</v>

2324
01:42:07.781 --> 01:42:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Like he must've developed certain things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to get them to gather around.</v>

2325
01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I think he would just call them around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2326
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 1>he looks like a guy who would be fun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to the talk so people slow down,</v>

2327
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2328
01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.740
<v Speaker 1>some folks are in a hurry and some folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>

2329
01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And the ones that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they circle them and then he'll do like </v>

2330
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:26.320
<v Speaker 1>a little five minute comedy show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then pass a hat around.</v>

2331
01:42:26.321 --> 01:42:31.321
<v Speaker 1>I saw him do it in montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well apparently charlie barnett used to </v>

2332
01:42:31.321 --> 01:42:31.420
<v Speaker 1>do that and he was like legendary out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

2333
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:34.330
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome at like being hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a bunch of people,</v>

2334
01:42:34.331 --> 01:42:36.340
<v Speaker 1>like off the cuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had material that he would do,</v>

2335
01:42:36.341 --> 01:42:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but they will also be off the cuff funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would gather people around.</v>

2336
01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Then he would hand out of the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass out the hat,</v>

2337
01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how he would make some money.</v>

2338
01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:47.200
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became famous,</v>

2339
01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:49.660
<v Speaker 1>like doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of standup people,</v>

2340
01:42:49.661 --> 01:42:54.661
<v Speaker 1>loved him onstage and then he got an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audition for saturday night live and </v>

2341
01:42:54.661 --> 01:42:56.500
<v Speaker 1>apparently the word was that he got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part but he couldn't read.</v>

2342
01:42:56.710 --> 01:42:58.700
<v Speaker 1>So since he couldn't read scripts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't hire them.</v>

2343
01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:03.730
<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The working environment without being </v>

2344
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:03.730
<v Speaker 1>able to route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he had a,</v>

2345
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:06.640
<v Speaker 1>he had a problem with intravenous drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he loved them.</v>

2346
01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found out about them.</v>

2347
01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:09.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2348
01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:13.060
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he apparently was like a keep saying</v>

2349
01:43:13.061 --> 01:43:16.840
<v Speaker 1>apparently apparently or adjectives or </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

2350
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:22.420
<v Speaker 1>He was like one of the pioneers of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>style of comedy.</v>

2351
01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2352
01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:24.670
<v Speaker 1>like natural talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:43:24.671 --> 01:43:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just natural talking,</v>

2354
01:43:26.351 --> 01:43:31.140
<v Speaker 1>but like knowing how to captivate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group and get everybody settled down and</v>

2355
01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:33.750
<v Speaker 1>put out a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a.</v>

2356
01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:38.440
<v Speaker 1>That's such a tough crowd that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go onto a stage at a comedy club must be</v>

2357
01:43:38.441 --> 01:43:38.960
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2358
01:43:38.970 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're running up hill all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2359
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Whenever we saw the third street </v>
<v Speaker 1>promenade people before we ever would </v>

2360
01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:45.880
<v Speaker 1>have thought of that to comedy here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could I do it?</v>

2361
01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard though.</v>

2362
01:43:48.491 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody do it besides </v>
<v Speaker 1>dave.</v>

2363
01:43:50.381 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody just do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>street comedy seems weird.</v>

2364
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:56.200
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that goofy.</v>

2365
01:43:56.210 --> 01:44:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Like the dancers will do comedy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between when they're going to make a </v>

2366
01:44:01.210 --> 01:44:01.210
<v Speaker 1>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2367
01:44:01.210 --> 01:44:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think dave would do it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2368
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I know he did do some shows in seattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>when remember when he wasn't doing </v>

2369
01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:11.651
<v Speaker 1>official shows anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a show in seattle where it just </v>

2370
01:44:11.651 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 1>showed up and brought like a speaker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing stand up in the park.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got to get ahold of him.</v>

2419
01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:26.201
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would walk around with bandannas </v>

2420
01:46:26.201 --> 01:46:26.201
<v Speaker 1>over their face.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He didn't want people to not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to his shows,</v>

01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:17.190
<v Speaker 1>before you go to any of that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy could kill me.</v>

2493
01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:20.610
<v Speaker 1>He was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really funny.</v>

2494
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:24.570
<v Speaker 1>He used to do this bit about getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed because kevin is a sweet guy.</v>

2495
01:49:24.571 --> 01:49:27.210
<v Speaker 1>He's an awesome guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he gets pissed off,</v>

2496
01:49:27.211 --> 01:49:29.070
<v Speaker 1>he's got a fucking temper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't do anythIng,</v>

2497
01:49:29.071 --> 01:49:31.800
<v Speaker 1>but he does get angry at shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a violent guy,</v>

2498
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:33.930
<v Speaker 1>but you could see I'm fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

2499
01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had this bit about his girlfriend.</v>

2500
01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:41.840
<v Speaker 1>He was like hitting the unlock button on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door at the same time and she was </v>

2501
01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.201
<v Speaker 1>pulling the handle and they cancel each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other out and you have this bit where </v>

2502
01:49:45.201 --> 01:49:47.991
<v Speaker 1>they kept doing it again and do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it builds up and fucking hilarious bit </v>

2503
01:49:47.991 --> 01:49:52.470
<v Speaker 1>and he would go ape shit on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream and I don't even think he swore </v>

2504
01:49:52.511 --> 01:49:57.511
<v Speaker 1>back down and you might swear he like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit like shit or something like </v>

2505
01:49:57.511 --> 01:49:57.511
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2506
01:49:57.511 --> 01:49:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Like every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2507
01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to do like a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of comedy.</v>

2508
01:50:01.631 --> 01:50:06.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story about him in montreal or aspen </v>

2509
01:50:06.631 --> 01:50:09.090
<v Speaker 1>with sussman struck a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got where you're like,</v>

2510
01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.670
<v Speaker 1>come talk to my guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't see what he can get you.</v>

2511
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2512
01:50:13.571 --> 01:50:15.100

<v Speaker 1>That's an unfortunate story,</v>

2513
01:50:15.101 --> 01:50:20.101
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we could repeat that </v>

<v Speaker 1>operating on the power generated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement of the building in the breeze.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking swaying of the building.</v>

2970
02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.120
<v Speaker 5>give me my hours back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five years to figure it out and</v>

2971
02:09:58.090 --> 02:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initially if I think if you watch that </v>

2972
02:10:03.090 --> 02:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>fox show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the fox show,</v>

2973
02:10:03.130 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 1>the moon landings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very compelling.</v>

2974
02:10:05.250 --> 02:10:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's very compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really interesting how it is </v>

2975
02:10:10.250 --> 02:10:10.250
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's saying it's not real.</v>

2976
02:10:10.250 --> 02:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the odds of that being true,</v>

2977
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:16.270
<v Speaker 1>it's so small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't know what haPpened,</v>

2978
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>but if I had a guest would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say they went to the moon and I </v>

2979
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:23.260
<v Speaker 1>wOuld say when you look at some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos that look like they're staged and</v>

2980
02:10:23.261 --> 02:10:28.261
<v Speaker 1>the fact that all of them were centered </v>
<v Speaker 1>there very well could have been some </v>

2981
02:10:28.261 --> 02:10:29.140
<v Speaker 1>counterfeit photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely did a little bit of that</v>

2982
02:10:29.141 --> 02:10:32.350
<v Speaker 1>back then in nasa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a photo from gemini,</v>

2983
02:10:32.570 --> 02:10:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was gemini 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Michael Collins and they took a </v>

2984
02:10:37.570 --> 02:10:41.141
<v Speaker 1>photo of him and training with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>wires and this harness on and then they </v>

2985
02:10:41.141 --> 02:10:45.491
<v Speaker 1>blacked out all the wires and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background and then use the same photo </v>

2986
02:10:45.491 --> 02:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>and said that he was in space.</v>

2987
02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Really it was doing a spacewalk like </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's taking his picture that spacewalk </v>

2988
02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:51.920
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a real photo.</v>

2989
02:10:51.921 --> 02:10:54.850
<v Speaker 1>There was nobody out there with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cameras with photos,</v>

2990
02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:56.670
<v Speaker 1>so we didn't know that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

2991
02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.660
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think that people are gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that many steps ahead.</v>

2992
02:10:59.661 --> 02:11:04.661
<v Speaker 1>So I think there it's very possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have faked some things,</v>

2993
02:11:06.351 --> 02:11:11.351
<v Speaker 1>like some photographs might have been on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a soundstage or stuff there.</v>

2994
02:11:11.511 --> 02:11:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for publIcity and to make sure that they</v>

2995
02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:18.700
<v Speaker 1>got a record of john kerry show those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures of Syria above dead bodies and </v>

2996
02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it was from five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2997
02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:21.890
<v Speaker 1>my favorite quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those clinton's quote about it,</v>

2998
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:26.950
<v Speaker 1>clinton talks about when he was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was working for a carpenter and the </v>

2999
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:31.541
<v Speaker 1>guy said that he didn't believe anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>on television that those television </v>

3000
02:11:31.541 --> 02:11:33.560
<v Speaker 1>fellers can put things on tv and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's real.</v>

3001
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then I thought that guy was a quack</v>

3002
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but or a crank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But during my eight years in the white </v>

3003
02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:45.461
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw things that made me think that </v>

3004
02:11:45.461 --> 02:11:45.461
<v Speaker 1>maybe he was ahead of his time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3005
02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:51.760
<v Speaker 1>clinton quote on the moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think they tell each president </v>

3006
02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:55.590
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the catch you up on the moon or </v>

3007
02:11:55.590 --> 02:11:56.870
<v Speaker 1>do anything that I don't even tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they want to tell them?</v>

3008
02:11:57.110 --> 02:11:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it really was fake,</v>

3009
02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:00.470
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it was.</v>

3010
02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more likely that there some</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckery involved in some of the evidence</v>

3011
02:12:06.650 --> 02:12:11.650
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to create things that </v>

3012
02:12:11.650 --> 02:12:11.890
<v Speaker 1>were used for publicity and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

3013
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:14.030
<v Speaker 1>some video that looks really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>hokey.</v>

3014
02:12:14.031 --> 02:12:19.031
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this video of them jumping </v>

3015
02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:20.741
<v Speaker 1>around with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on trampolines when they're on </v>

3016
02:12:20.741 --> 02:12:20.741
<v Speaker 1>the moon.</v>

3017
02:12:20.741 --> 02:12:20.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird.</v>

3018
02:12:20.741 --> 02:12:21.580
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird stuff because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3019
02:12:21.630 --> 02:12:26.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no consistency in the way they </v>

3020
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:29.981
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you watch the earliest video </v>

3021
02:12:29.981 --> 02:12:29.981
<v Speaker 1>from apollo 11 when they're walking on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

3022
02:12:29.981 --> 02:12:31.580
<v Speaker 1>you can watch their movement and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the,</v>

3023
02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the later stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they move a little </v>

3024
02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:36.600
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they can do weird shit.</v>

3025
02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Like they can jump and fly through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>

3026
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later in the uh,</v>

3027
02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:44.490
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the videos they got better at </v>

3028
02:12:44.490 --> 02:12:44.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever they were doing to get better </v>
<v Speaker 1>at walking into.</v>

3029
02:12:44.490 --> 02:12:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird.</v>

3030
02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:50.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think that it might very well be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that some of the footage that you look </v>

3031
02:12:50.290 --> 02:12:51.080
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible,</v>

3032
02:12:51.081 --> 02:12:52.910
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not suggesting that we didn't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the moon.</v>

3033
02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I know I haven't passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm suggesting is some of the </v>

3034
02:12:58.090 --> 02:13:00.941
<v Speaker 1>footage might be fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible they used to do that kind </v>

3035
02:13:00.941 --> 02:13:00.941
<v Speaker 1>of stuff back then.</v>

3036
02:13:00.941 --> 02:13:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I know we don't like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did a lot of stuff,</v>

3037
02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but now they still do it now they still </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake things.</v>

3038
02:13:06.051 --> 02:13:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Now it's got good boards of martin </v>
<v Speaker 1>luther king with white women.</v>

3039
02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MeanwHile,</v>

3040
02:13:12.710 --> 02:13:14.270
<v Speaker 1>martin luther king fucked a lot of white</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

3041
02:13:14.271 --> 02:13:16.610
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about he loved it?</v>

3042
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Who wouldn't your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luther king.</v>

3043
02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he did.</v>

3044
02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:21.860
<v Speaker 1>So he knew he was going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a rampage.</v>

3045
02:13:21.861 --> 02:13:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Get the white posts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this black girl like 5:00</v>

3059
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Hip hop.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like just get in there.</v>

3063
02:14:00.570 --> 02:14:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Did the vagina seem any different to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

3064
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Any colors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any shapes?</v>

3065
02:14:04.110 --> 02:14:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Surprisingly similar to white posts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty shocking actually.</v>

3066
02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:11.400
<v Speaker 2>How similarly shaped and feeling it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the same?</v>

3067
02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:16.410
<v Speaker 2>They're humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it got weird which she snored </v>

3068
02:14:16.410 --> 02:14:18.090
<v Speaker 2>and it was like a manly trouble after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3069
02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:18.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3070
02:14:18.951 --> 02:14:19.700
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3071
02:14:19.710 --> 02:14:20.060
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3072
02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Mainly way to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching your dick go into that pink </v>

3073
02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:27.070
<v Speaker 2>holdout with the contrast with the black</v>
<v Speaker 2>is such a coolest sight though.</v>

3074
02:14:28.210 --> 02:14:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a darker one when he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they are just bright pink inside</v>

3075
02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:34.560
<v Speaker 2>like pink starburst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a darker one,</v>

3076
02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:41.540
<v Speaker 2>medIum rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not the kind of things that women </v>

3077
02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:44.311
<v Speaker 2>want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a black and steak with the </v>

3078
02:14:44.311 --> 02:14:44.311
<v Speaker 2>medium rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Broadening my horizons.</v>

3083

<v Speaker 2>try to get laid.</v>

3089
02:15:07.410 --> 02:15:11.820
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like fuck the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations you're having in my head.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3092
02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't say that out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think,</v>

3093
02:15:18.190 --> 02:15:20.020
<v Speaker 2>but that's what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really want to talk to them.</v>

3094
02:15:20.021 --> 02:15:21.050
<v Speaker 2>You just want to fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:22.270
<v Speaker 2>So I want to get to the point where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to find women that you actually like as </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and not just as sexual partners,</v>

3101
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:35.510
<v Speaker 3>but if you get some just purely sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>partners,</v>

3102
02:15:35.511 --> 02:15:37.720
<v Speaker 3>then you can do that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to not be able to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a woman is allowed to say that if a </v>

3107
02:15:51.221 --> 02:15:51.221
<v Speaker 3>woman says that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you give someone an apple,</v>

3216
02:20:14.241 --> 02:20:15.620
<v Speaker 1>it's prostitution.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Give them an app on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3218
02:20:17.001 --> 02:20:22.001

<v Speaker 1>It was just the way this guy was just so</v>

3226
02:20:37.881 --> 02:20:40.940
<v Speaker 1>aggressive with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like such a point and he put</v>

3227
02:20:40.941 --> 02:20:43.640
<v Speaker 1>his hands on me like on my shoulder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3228
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:44.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

3229
02:20:44.210 --> 02:20:45.980

<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I understand you just hate America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand you're saying,</v>

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.990
<v Speaker 1>oh submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

3233
02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:56.540

<v Speaker 1>and that's when it turned ugly.</v>

3234
02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get your fucking hands off me.</v>

3235
02:20:58.371 --> 02:21:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't touch me dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't touch me and talk to America.</v>

3236
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Because I questioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had escalated it to not just that I </v>

3237
02:21:06.610 --> 02:21:09.761
<v Speaker 1>hate America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that he was going to like do some </v>

3238
02:21:09.761 --> 02:21:09.761
<v Speaker 1>weird shit to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That does push it up a level and </v>

3241
02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:14.990
<v Speaker 1>somebody touches you or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you on the head.</v>

3242
02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.660
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time ago by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time ago.</v>

3243
02:21:17.661 --> 02:21:22.661
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I would've ever even entered into </v>

3244
02:21:22.661 --> 02:21:22.661
<v Speaker 1>that conversation today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would.</v>

3245
02:21:22.661 --> 02:21:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I think today I'm much more skillful at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the art of evading nonsense.</v>

3246
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I would have known what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the upside.</v>

3247
02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:29.390
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

3248
02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I would have known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back then I would be like,</v>

3249
02:21:31.551 --> 02:21:33.140

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

3252

<v Speaker 1>it was the most ridiculous guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those people in your show,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's all unknown.</v>

3256
02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like you didn't have to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the people at the comedy show.</v>

3260
02:21:55.001 --> 02:21:58.031
<v Speaker 1>go too far is to see the results of </v>
<v Speaker 1>going too far or other people when it </v>

3261
02:21:58.031 --> 02:22:02.831

<v Speaker 3>A lot of people want to engage.</v>

3333
02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:51.180
<v Speaker 3>A specialist should have a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong and fierce shrine already.</v>

3334
02:24:51.181 --> 02:24:56.181
<v Speaker 3>The great was born here or the already </v>

<v Speaker 3>the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3337
02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It like if you ever read someone's bio </v>

3338
02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:09.650
<v Speaker 3>on their website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3339
02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:12.440
<v Speaker 3>they wrote it themselves and makes you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking up their lives in a part of like</v>

3340
02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:17.480
<v Speaker 3>near Washington dc where people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>historic houses things and he just made </v>

3341
02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:18.090
<v Speaker 3>one up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made up of historic house.</v>

3342
02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:21.420
<v Speaker 3>It was like a stop on the underground </v>
<v Speaker 3>railroad or something like that.</v>

3343
02:25:21.421 --> 02:25:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you just made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he apply for it?</v>

3344
02:25:23.111 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made it a real?</v>

3345
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how he did it.</v>

3346
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.220
<v Speaker 1>If he wants the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3347
02:25:27.221 --> 02:25:32.221
<v Speaker 1>this happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we could get a plaque or if you </v>

3348
02:25:32.221 --> 02:25:32.221
<v Speaker 1>just bought a plaque and stuck it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3349
02:25:32.221 --> 02:25:32.860
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably mostly bought a prac.</v>

3350
02:25:32.861 --> 02:25:37.861
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be really hard to pass that </v>

3351
02:25:37.861 --> 02:25:37.861
<v Speaker 1>through city though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell them like.</v>

3352
02:25:37.861 --> 02:25:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

3353
02:25:38.171 --> 02:25:39.880
<v Speaker 1>we ain't even know unless you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>super.</v>

3354
02:25:39.890 --> 02:25:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like some writer stayed here when</v>

3355
02:25:42.011 --> 02:25:43.660
<v Speaker 1>he was visiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3356
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:46.870
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a bunch of places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do kind of qualify for that.</v>

3357
02:25:46.871 --> 02:25:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Stephen King has a house in Maine,</v>

3358
02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.180
<v Speaker 1>in bangor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maine.</v>

3359
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And like that house should be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical house in my setting up there.</v>

3360
02:25:57.070 --> 02:26:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that was his house for so long and </v>

3361
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:05.101
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's got these wrought iron </v>
<v Speaker 1>gates that have these bats on them and </v>

3362
02:26:05.101 --> 02:26:05.101
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3363
02:26:05.101 --> 02:26:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Really dope ass house and it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of this town of bangor,</v>

3364
02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:12.751
<v Speaker 1>Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody knew about it and he's </v>

3365
02:26:12.751 --> 02:26:13.210
<v Speaker 1>such a legendary writer that that house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

3366
02:26:13.211 --> 02:26:15.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like an iconic house.</v>

3367
02:26:15.131 --> 02:26:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So you'd put like a historic.</v>

3369
02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:22.840
<v Speaker 1>King fans can come in and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the desk that he actually wrote.</v>

3370
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:27.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of his novels that I love those </v>

3372
02:26:28.661 --> 02:26:33.661

3373
02:26:33.661 --> 02:26:33.661
<v Speaker 1>times over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let people go and see.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He can do whatever he wants and he </v>

3451
02:29:32.671 --> 02:29:32.671

3453
02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:38.831
<v Speaker 1>Stephen king for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's really like giving in the way </v>

3454
02:29:38.831 --> 02:29:40.070
<v Speaker 1>he communicates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his ideas have him on your podcast.</v>

3455
02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I would love to.</v>

3456
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:45.200
<v Speaker 1>he's interesting in the way he </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicates a,</v>

3457
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you know how he goes through his </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

3458
02:29:46.701 --> 02:29:51.701
<v Speaker 1>He's super honest about it and he's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rare guys that doesn't have like </v>

3459
02:29:51.701 --> 02:29:55.301
<v Speaker 1>a setup like story in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like has these characters and he has </v>

3460
02:29:55.431 --> 02:29:58.070
<v Speaker 1>this idea that he starts with and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just goes,</v>

3461
02:29:58.550 --> 02:30:00.290
<v Speaker 1>starts writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just starts writing,</v>

3462
02:30:00.291 --> 02:30:02.890
<v Speaker 1>almost like goes into this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend and,</v>

3463
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:07.990
<v Speaker 1>and constructs this world and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get sucked into it and then you read it </v>

3464
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:09.710
<v Speaker 1>after he's done with and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

3465
02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:12.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just brings it out of nowhere.</v>

3466
02:30:12.771 --> 02:30:15.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we had scott sigler on the podcast.</v>

3467
02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:19.010
<v Speaker 1>It was a really cool guy and a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good writer as well,</v>

3468
02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:21.420
<v Speaker 1>but he has a totally different approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got sick,</v>

3469
02:30:21.421 --> 02:30:23.300
<v Speaker 1>was approach is he knows exactly where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going.</v>

3470
02:30:23.301 --> 02:30:28.301
<v Speaker 1>He knows where it's going to end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows where this is going to happen </v>

3471
02:30:28.301 --> 02:30:30.941
<v Speaker 1>and get changed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows this and has to just sort of </v>

3472
02:30:30.941 --> 02:30:30.941
<v Speaker 1>fill it in and figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flesh it out.</v>

3473
02:30:30.941 --> 02:30:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3474
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:33.320
<v Speaker 1>make it to his liking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

3475
02:30:33.321 --> 02:30:38.321
<v Speaker 1>he's very systematic about it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about stephen king's </v>

3476
02:30:38.321 --> 02:30:39.680
<v Speaker 1>approach that he just lets it go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

3477
02:30:39.681 --> 02:30:40.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't do it that way.</v>

3478
02:30:40.821 --> 02:30:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for him obviously it worked.</v>

3479
02:30:43.071 --> 02:30:48.071
<v Speaker 1>But for cyclers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great writer to be in his way works </v>

3480
02:30:48.071 --> 02:30:49.970
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no right or wrong way to do it.</v>

3481
02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you write like that to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say I want to write a joke about </v>

3482
02:30:55.810 --> 02:30:55.810
<v Speaker 1>driving a car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3483
02:30:55.810 --> 02:31:00.420
<v Speaker 3>I'll toss things over my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll write a note in my notebook and </v>

3484
02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:03.391
<v Speaker 3>then like when I looked to see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes I should do on stage tonight or </v>

3485
02:31:03.391 --> 02:31:03.391
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll keep passing that note.</v>

3486
02:31:03.391 --> 02:31:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna keep thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then when I'm driving or when I'm on the</v>

3487
02:31:05.981 --> 02:31:10.981
<v Speaker 3>subway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all I keep thinking it over and then </v>

3488
02:31:10.981 --> 02:31:12.601
<v Speaker 3>I'll just like do it on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't actually sit in front of </v>

3489
02:31:12.601 --> 02:31:12.601
<v Speaker 3>the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>

3490
02:31:12.601 --> 02:31:12.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you try that?</v>

3491
02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

3492
02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:18.640
<v Speaker 3>I've tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it before but it's never </v>

3493
02:31:18.640 --> 02:31:20.551
<v Speaker 3>really stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just kinda think things out in my </v>

3494
02:31:20.551 --> 02:31:20.551
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just let my mind wander.</v>

3495
02:31:20.551 --> 02:31:20.551
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

3496
02:31:20.551 --> 02:31:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you should write blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have some fucking hilarious </v>

3497
02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:24.980
<v Speaker 1>blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3498
02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:28.670
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about writing blogs is it </v>

3499
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:31.851
<v Speaker 1>gives you like an opportunity to spend a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time thinking about a subject </v>

3500
02:31:31.851 --> 02:31:32.850
<v Speaker 1>because in the time that it takes you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write it and type it out,</v>

3501
02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:37.880
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thInking a lot more and you're </v>

3502
02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:38.280
<v Speaker 1>thinking a lot more in the containment </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a particular subject.</v>

3503
02:31:38.281 --> 02:31:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So you actually do the thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3504
02:31:40.690 --> 02:31:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3505
02:31:41.101 --> 02:31:46.101
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's forcing you to focus on one </v>

3506
02:31:46.101 --> 02:31:47.841
<v Speaker 1>particular subject to and sometimes just</v>
<v Speaker 1>that extra focus is all you need to get </v>

3507
02:31:47.841 --> 02:31:49.620
<v Speaker 1>that extra path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take off that bit.</v>

3508
02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3509
02:31:50.281 --> 02:31:53.310
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you find a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's this way for you,</v>

3510
02:31:53.311 --> 02:31:56.160
<v Speaker 1>but for me it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I'll have an initial direction.</v>

3511
02:31:56.190 --> 02:31:59.760
<v Speaker 1>And then along the way I realized that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the right direction.</v>

3512
02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:03.420
<v Speaker 1>The right direction is one of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>taglines and then I'll go,</v>

3513
02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:05.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally,</v>

3514
02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:11.100
<v Speaker 1>totally turns it on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that those take place more when I</v>

3515
02:32:11.101 --> 02:32:14.190
<v Speaker 1>sit down and write things like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing.</v>

3516
02:32:14.310 --> 02:32:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I give myself more,</v>

3517
02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:18.810
<v Speaker 1>more paths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're talking about,</v>

3518
02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:21.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lava lamps,</v>

3519
02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:26.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going on a lava lamp path </v>

3520
02:32:26.180 --> 02:32:26.400
<v Speaker 1>when while you're on that path and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're writing it out,</v>

3521
02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:28.440
<v Speaker 1>instead of just thinking about it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>

3522
02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:33.590
<v Speaker 1>when you're forced to actually mash </v>
<v Speaker 1>those keys and form a sentence in the </v>

3523
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:38.091
<v Speaker 1>correct way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to read it to </v>

3524
02:32:38.091 --> 02:32:38.091
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3525
02:32:38.091 --> 02:32:38.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that [inaudible].</v>

3526
02:32:38.091 --> 02:32:38.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty dope.</v>

3527
02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:41.160

<v Speaker 1>I can't see it.</v>

3529
02:32:42.270 --> 02:32:45.180

<v Speaker 1>your notes on those virtual corkboards </v>

<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3545
02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:18.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna start going back into blogs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3550
02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind doing that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes an idea like it's an idea and </v>

3551
02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:30.270
<v Speaker 1>the blog and then it becomes a bit full </v>

02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:32.100
<v Speaker 1>well it's either that or you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blocks.</v>

3553
02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:38.360

<v Speaker 1>think that some of them are never going </v>

3554
02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:40.120
<v Speaker 1>to go to see my standup or friends will </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to see the germination.</v>

3555
02:33:41.210 --> 02:33:42.300
<v Speaker 1>And if You don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

3556
02:33:42.301 --> 02:33:47.301

3560
02:33:53.211 --> 02:33:54.581
<v Speaker 1>on my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the problem that some people </v>

3567
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:14.010
<v Speaker 1>rational about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to talk to,</v>

3568
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy who was a,</v>

3569

3608
02:35:53.780 --> 02:35:54.560
<v Speaker 1>well because I was worried that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say the only word.</v>

3609
02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:55.900
<v Speaker 1>It was like someone's going to say like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the first comment was lazy motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the only one.</v>

3612
02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:05.110
<v Speaker 1>But It was like the first one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Somebody tells me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3617
02:36:11.531 --> 02:36:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I saw this joke last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

3618
02:36:13.391 --> 02:36:14.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just bothers me.</v>

3619
02:36:15.370 --> 02:36:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you need to let them know,</v>

3620
02:36:17.291 --> 02:36:19.240
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on jokes and the only way to</v>

3621
02:36:19.241 --> 02:36:21.010
<v Speaker 1>work on jokes and you've got to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than once.</v>

3622
02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:24.580
<v Speaker 1>A bit is never finished unless it's done</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

3623
02:36:24.581 --> 02:36:25.480
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

3624
02:36:25.481 --> 02:36:27.340
<v Speaker 1>depending on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be done.</v>

3625
02:36:27.341 --> 02:36:32.341
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you have to do it onstage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perform it and tweak it and move it </v>

3626
02:36:32.341 --> 02:36:33.550
<v Speaker 1>around and if you think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3627
02:36:33.551 --> 02:36:38.551
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to see me in this town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go to see me in another town </v>

3628
02:36:38.551 --> 02:36:40.951
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 1>act a month later and some possible </v>

3629
02:36:40.951 --> 02:36:40.951
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

3630
02:36:40.951 --> 02:36:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I need to work on that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of my stuff that I've </v>

3631
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:46.030
<v Speaker 1>released in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I'd worked on it more.</v>

3632
02:36:46.270 --> 02:36:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I wish I'd spent more time going over </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3633
02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but that requires new people will come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3634
02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:56.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also requires you have to do it on </v>

3635
02:36:56.250 --> 02:36:58.560
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know I had everlast on the podcast </v>

3636
02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:01.561
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about the difference </v>

3637
02:37:01.561 --> 02:37:01.561
<v Speaker 1>between writing a song and writing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

3638
02:37:01.561 --> 02:37:04.801
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never made a joke without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>help of other people because every joke </v>

3639
02:37:04.801 --> 02:37:09.481
<v Speaker 1>I made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be done in front of an </v>

3640
02:37:09.481 --> 02:37:09.481
<v Speaker 1>audience and they let me know what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

3641
02:37:09.481 --> 02:37:10.810
<v Speaker 1>It's A combined effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is.</v>

3642
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'll write some good ideas that </v>

3643
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:15.990
<v Speaker 1>will work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I get on stage,</v>

3644
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:18.080
<v Speaker 1>but they get better when you do them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of an audience and you figure them</v>

3645
02:37:18.081 --> 02:37:19.580
<v Speaker 1>out and you gotta take chances.</v>

3646
02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:23.540
<v Speaker 1>You've got to do them this way and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta move the punchlines changing.</v>

3647
02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Look at order real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me examine each of these a bunch of </v>

3648
02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:28.580
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know man.</v>

3649
02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you nail one and it's just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect way to say you can't believe you</v>

3650
02:37:31.931 --> 02:37:33.990
<v Speaker 1>used to say it another way before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pause,</v>

3651
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:35.420
<v Speaker 1>right at some sock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3652
02:37:35.530 --> 02:37:38.840
<v Speaker 1>You know chris rock famously talks about</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3653
02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:43.960
<v Speaker 1>one of his greatest bits of all time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the bit that I love black </v>

3654
02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:46.190
<v Speaker 1>people and I hate niggers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that bit one of the.</v>

3655
02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:49.250
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you certainly did,</v>

3656
02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of the all time classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy bits.</v>

3657
02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:54.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just a brilliant bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3658
02:37:54.141 --> 02:37:57.080
<v Speaker 1>he said that that been bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck told me this.</v>

3659
02:37:57.290 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>He said that the bit bombed for like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

3660
02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Really couldn't get it to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3661
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:04.760
<v Speaker 1>And then finally he figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it right.</v>

3662
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:06.380
<v Speaker 1>If you could just figure it out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it right,</v>

3663
02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but he believed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed in the premise,</v>

3664
02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:13.900
<v Speaker 1>so he chased the premise down until it </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to a point where it was just a </v>

3665
02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:15.230
<v Speaker 1>weapon and then when by the time it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a special,</v>

3666
02:38:15.350 --> 02:38:17.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bit,</v>

3667
02:38:17.091 --> 02:38:20.400
<v Speaker 1>that bit so classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a legendary but legendary,</v>

3668
02:38:21.710 --> 02:38:24.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's a perfect example of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>legacy book can't do that.</v>

3669
02:38:24.591 --> 02:38:26.600
<v Speaker 1>if you want to hear the same jokes every</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

3670
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:32.190
<v Speaker 1>same with rather than wondering to new </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes every show because you're never </v>

3671
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:36.161
<v Speaker 1>going to get to that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really great doing going in New </v>

3672
02:38:36.161 --> 02:38:36.161
<v Speaker 1>York where do four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

3673
02:38:36.161 --> 02:38:40.511
<v Speaker 1>six spots a night and if you work on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and you do want to go get that </v>

3674
02:38:40.511 --> 02:38:40.511
<v Speaker 1>feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3675
02:38:40.511 --> 02:38:41.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't enough laps,</v>

3676
02:38:41.690 --> 02:38:46.690
<v Speaker 1>but then usually I wait 24 hours before </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and I sort of forget this </v>

3677
02:38:46.690 --> 02:38:48.010
<v Speaker 1>time it's 40 minutes later I'm doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3678
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3679
02:38:48.411 --> 02:38:50.450
<v Speaker 1>it's still weak in the middle there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then on the subway I'm like,</v>

3680
02:38:50.451 --> 02:38:55.451
<v Speaker 1>I gotta write something and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't still weak in the middle of the </v>

3681
02:38:55.451 --> 02:38:55.580
<v Speaker 1>next thing you do when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was okay,</v>

3682
02:38:55.581 --> 02:38:57.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe that'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try something else and by the end of</v>

3683
02:38:57.980 --> 02:38:58.740
<v Speaker 1>the night you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3684
02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I've fixed this up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

3685
02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like a dilapidated house </v>

3686
02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done some work on it now.</v>

3687
02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when I'm in a bit that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really working,</v>

3688
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I try to think of myself like when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

3689
02:39:10.401 --> 02:39:13.610
<v Speaker 1>especially I try to think of myself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of making a bit,</v>

3690
02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.940
<v Speaker 1>instead of trying to turn it and figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to make a bit,</v>

3691
02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:22.240
<v Speaker 1>just figuring out a way to just express </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and what you're talking </v>

3692
02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:25.991
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is actually going on at a bunch of </v>

3693
02:39:25.991 --> 02:39:25.991
<v Speaker 1>shit to it.</v>

3694
02:39:25.991 --> 02:39:25.991
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily the writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it.</v>

3695
02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Like write a bunch of Shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about the whole thing,</v>

3696
02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:32.420
<v Speaker 1>read whatever the subject of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>building or whatever.</v>

3697
02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:36.500
<v Speaker 1>What emotions you were having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Describe how embarrassed you fell.</v>

3698
02:39:36.501 --> 02:39:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Describe why you were embarrassed to add</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of shit,</v>

3699
02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you know you're never going to say on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage a bunch of shit,</v>

3700
02:39:41.961 --> 02:39:46.940
<v Speaker 1>like go way too far and then look at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go and just start cherry picking and</v>

3701
02:39:46.941 --> 02:39:47.450
<v Speaker 1>then go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3702
02:39:47.451 --> 02:39:48.620
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this makes sense.</v>

3703
02:39:48.621 --> 02:39:53.621
<v Speaker 1>If I can cut that out and go right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and you'll somEtimes you just give </v>

3704
02:39:53.621 --> 02:39:57.341
<v Speaker 1>yourself more by going too far back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teacher would tell us that like if </v>

3705
02:39:57.341 --> 02:39:57.341
<v Speaker 1>people weren't going to even close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>far enough,</v>

3706
02:39:57.341 --> 02:39:58.850
<v Speaker 1>that bloke was your cheat on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

3707
02:39:58.851 --> 02:40:00.530
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going far enough.</v>

3708
02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm pretty upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't look like that.</v>

3709
02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:05.330
<v Speaker 1>And he would alwaYs go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do it like 10 times too much.</v>

3710
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Just for argument's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just see that.</v>

3711
02:40:07.290 --> 02:40:08.180
<v Speaker 1>And then people would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3712
02:40:08.181 --> 02:40:09.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull that back.</v>

3713
02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three percent.</v>

3714
02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just barely over the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you should be.</v>

3715
02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:16.710
<v Speaker 3>You got to take chances and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to take chances.</v>

3716
02:40:16.711 --> 02:40:19.560
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hallmark of bad acting.</v>

3717
02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:23.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want to dive into and </v>
<v Speaker 3>become someone else.</v>

3718
02:40:23.310 --> 02:40:24.840
<v Speaker 3>They're still clinging onto who they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

3719
02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:27.210
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not even going in there.</v>

3720
02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:32.600
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know how to be noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freddy would do that when he would </v>

3721
02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:35.470
<v Speaker 3>really do is dad getting exasperated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would lift his hand all the way up </v>

3722
02:40:35.470 --> 02:40:38.481
<v Speaker 3>over his head like at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll see the new upper makers </v>

3723
02:40:38.481 --> 02:40:43.010
<v Speaker 3>trying something similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hammered comments about their </v>

3724
02:40:43.010 --> 02:40:43.010
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>

3725
02:40:43.010 --> 02:40:43.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3726
02:40:43.010 --> 02:40:46.340
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just didn't have the guts to stick </v>

3727
02:40:46.340 --> 02:40:48.831
<v Speaker 3>with it to just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a commitment because it's so </v>

3728
02:40:48.831 --> 02:40:49.170
<v Speaker 3>foolish if you fail like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3729
02:40:49.171 --> 02:40:50.760
<v Speaker 3>there was way more foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3730
02:40:50.761 --> 02:40:51.720
<v Speaker 3>we've all done that.</v>

3731
02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:56.720
<v Speaker 3>We've over committed to bits and tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pump them up and they're just dumb </v>

3732
02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:57.710
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that feeling,</v>

3733
02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:58.740
<v Speaker 3>brian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about.</v>

3734
02:40:58.741 --> 02:41:03.741
<v Speaker 3>When you get in the middle of a bit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really working it and you're </v>

3735
02:41:03.741 --> 02:41:03.741
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

3736
02:41:03.741 --> 02:41:05.770
<v Speaker 3>I can't even get out of this bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's usually the dolphin one.</v>

3737
02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:10.530
<v Speaker 3>When people start going like women get </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusted about it or something.</v>

3738
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the dolphin.</v>

3739
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stripper one.</v>

3740
02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's even more.</v>

3741
02:41:14.221 --> 02:41:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what are they going to do every.</v>

3742
02:41:17.290 --> 02:41:20.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people like bluegrass succeeds that</v>

3743
02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:25.780
<v Speaker 3>stories like 10 minutes long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once you start to realize a whole </v>

3744
02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:25.920
<v Speaker 3>crowd is not that intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3745
02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:27.360
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really should've stopped.</v>

3746
02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found a way out of it that lately.</v>

3747
02:41:29.610 --> 02:41:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sometimes important.</v>

3748
02:41:31.261 --> 02:41:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Part of like not doing well with a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

3749
02:41:33.451 --> 02:41:34.290
<v Speaker 3>is that it shows other.</v>

3750
02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well also I like doing it for crowd.</v>

3751
02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:38.490
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in bits for crowds,</v>

3752
02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm mixed between either putting on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best show or doing bits that I think </v>

3753
02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:44.130
<v Speaker 3>this crowd won't like to see if I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it work here.</v>

3754
02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:47.040
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real dark joke and there's a real</v>

3755
02:41:47.041 --> 02:41:49.260
<v Speaker 3>conservative crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do my more conservative jokes,</v>

3756
02:41:49.261 --> 02:41:54.261
<v Speaker 3>but it's sort of rather work on this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of these people work in this </v>

3757
02:41:54.261 --> 02:41:54.330
<v Speaker 3>really harsh thing in front of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3758
02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:56.280
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like going to Australia and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Switzerland,</v>

3759
02:41:56.281 --> 02:41:59.700
<v Speaker 3>amsterdam doing shows and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries like I want to know what parts</v>

3760
02:41:59.701 --> 02:42:01.470
<v Speaker 3>of these really work in different </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments.</v>

3761
02:42:01.890 --> 02:42:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3762
02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:04.590
<v Speaker 3>a comedy on state has like a thursday </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

3763
02:42:04.591 --> 02:42:07.350
<v Speaker 3>like college night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's all college students,</v>

3767
02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>College kids are a different thing man,</v>

3768
02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:19.100
<v Speaker 3>because when you do like colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you realized </v>

3769
02:42:19.100 --> 02:42:20.490
<v Speaker 3>almost immediately is how little </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience a lot of them have in life.</v>

3770
02:42:20.850 --> 02:42:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of them are coming from their</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents houses,</v>

3771
02:42:23.970 --> 02:42:28.970
<v Speaker 3>protected environments of their whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>dorm to a dorm with a bunch of savage </v>

3772
02:42:28.970 --> 02:42:32.440
<v Speaker 3>hormonally charged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten is just sticking things inside their</v>

3773
02:42:32.441 --> 02:42:37.441
<v Speaker 3>parties all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's needles or dicks or just </v>

3774
02:42:37.441 --> 02:42:39.240
<v Speaker 3>she just fucking and doing drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting crazy.</v>

3775
02:42:39.690 --> 02:42:44.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean people are getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember how much fucking you did </v>

3776
02:42:44.690 --> 02:42:45.540
<v Speaker 3>when you were in college?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>

3777
02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it barely won.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3779

<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were a virgin religiously for </v>

3780
02:42:53.151 --> 02:42:53.240
<v Speaker 3>religious purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I dropped the religion is still</v>

3781
02:42:53.250 --> 02:42:56.740

<v Speaker 3>Tinder did not meet on tinder.</v>

3850
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:55.950
<v Speaker 3>It was the base level of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that old joke you add with </v>

3851
02:45:55.950 --> 02:45:55.950

<v Speaker 3>Just fucking.</v>

3856
02:45:59.330 --> 02:45:59.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

02:45:59.770 --> 02:46:01.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what tinder is like that you like</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

3858
02:46:01.971 --> 02:46:04.180
<v Speaker 3>I like you like each other looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this.</v>

3859
02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things that's kept </v>

3860
02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:10.921
<v Speaker 3>people from being more sexually </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberated is that people cling when </v>

3861
02:46:11.091 --> 02:46:14.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a shortage on when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to get sex.</v>

3862
02:46:14.810 --> 02:46:18.020
<v Speaker 3>People cling to each other when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to find partners,</v>

3863
02:46:18.021 --> 02:46:20.810
<v Speaker 3>difficult to find lovers and people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you enjoy being with.</v>

3864
02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:23.120
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to meet people when you find </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3865
02:46:23.121 --> 02:46:24.950
<v Speaker 3>they get together and they get married </v>
<v Speaker 3>real early.</v>

3866
02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:28.250
<v Speaker 3>But when people get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of playing musical chairs,</v>

3867
02:46:28.251 --> 02:46:33.251
<v Speaker 3>just grabbing onto the first chair and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on and you get us something like a </v>

3868
02:46:33.251 --> 02:46:34.670
<v Speaker 3>tinder or one of those little dating </v>
<v Speaker 3>websites or the books.</v>

3869
02:46:34.671 --> 02:46:39.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just meet a bunch of new people </v>

3870
02:46:39.671 --> 02:46:41.501
<v Speaker 3>and then find who you actually like and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he realized they're just meeting a </v>

3871
02:46:41.501 --> 02:46:42.310
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people too and everybody's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat and it's easy to hear.</v>

3872
02:46:42.311 --> 02:46:47.311
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like first day at dining hall of </v>

3873
02:46:47.311 --> 02:46:47.311
<v Speaker 3>the fucking college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>

3874
02:46:47.311 --> 02:46:47.311

<v Speaker 3>to them not even talking about your </v>

3947
02:49:22.461 --> 02:49:23.610
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when the stitcher awards came out,</v>

3963
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:05.630
<v Speaker 3>If you really think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your podcast has got to be filled with </v>

3964
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:08.541
<v Speaker 3>some nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what David Cross hated larry the </v>

<v Speaker 1>All these monarchs and all these kings </v>

4082
02:54:55.050 --> 02:54:58.981
<v Speaker 1>and all these people that run countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>are terrified of this kind of shit </v>

4083
02:54:58.981 --> 02:55:01.651
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these prime ministers or whatever </v>

4084
02:55:01.651 --> 02:55:05.191
<v Speaker 1>their title is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in positions of power call them </v>

4085
02:55:05.191 --> 02:55:05.191
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>terrified of losing this.</v>

4087
02:55:08.061 --> 02:55:13.061
<v Speaker 3>They're terrified of losing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability control to control these people </v>

4088
02:55:13.061 --> 02:55:14.840
<v Speaker 3>and they get used to that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

4089
02:55:14.841 --> 02:55:17.930
<v Speaker 3>They feel like they deserve it the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way we were talking about earlier,</v>

4090
02:55:17.931 --> 02:55:22.931
<v Speaker 3>like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Celebrities think that everyone is </v>

4091
02:55:22.931 --> 02:55:23.000
<v Speaker 3>supposed to kiss their ass because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't look at themselves.</v>

4092
02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:24.470
<v Speaker 3>These people don't look at themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

4093
02:55:24.471 --> 02:55:29.471
<v Speaker 3>Just dominate these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who support America going into </v>

4094
02:55:29.471 --> 02:55:29.471
<v Speaker 3>like Syria or something like that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

4095
02:55:29.471 --> 02:55:30.320
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to do something,</v>

4096
02:55:30.710 --> 02:55:34.640
<v Speaker 3>and my thought is if there were dirty </v>
<v Speaker 3>dishes in the dish in the sink,</v>

4097
02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:40.060
<v Speaker 3>you don't send a spastic toddler in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to watch it because they'll smash </v>

4098
02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:40.060
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of dishes and you're be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4099
02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:41.090
<v Speaker 3>we can't just leave the dishes dirty </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4100
02:55:41.091 --> 02:55:43.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we to send in somebody like that toddler</v>

4101
02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:44.300
<v Speaker 3>is the wrong guy to sit in.</v>

4102
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:47.920
<v Speaker 3>America is proven to have just no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no death,</v>

4103
02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:49.900
<v Speaker 3>but who else would you send in if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get rid of?</v>

4104
02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:53.450
