00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>she said let me call him and ask him if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay because I already knew it,</v>

10
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know the rest of the guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she called me later that day.</v>

11
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

21
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.273
<v Speaker 1>at the soundboard and then the next day </v>
<v Speaker 1>I flew to Kenya and so it was just a </v>

22
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.913
<v Speaker 1>that was a good chunk of travel and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up in South Africa after all of </v>

24
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that and said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

25
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to come to Africa once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just started picking out different</v>

26
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:14.934
<v Speaker 1>chunks of it and it just started going </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was 20 years ago and I've been </v>

27
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:19.501
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

28
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>like 20 sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

29
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you never don't learn it.</v>

30
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I call it the big book.</v>

31
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Speaker 1>It's where you learned about life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and Oh,</v>

32
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you can learn that anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see big stuff.</v>

33
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:34.254
<v Speaker 1>You see people who suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have no food or water </v>

34
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you and I,</v>

35
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>we talked about retirement and life </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance and vacation.</v>

36
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of tribes,</v>

37
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no words or even ideas in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

38
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.643
<v Speaker 1>Like I was hanging out with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>maturity people once in Uganda a few </v>

39
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I had a translators at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinka guy who spoke,</v>

40
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess whatever a truly people speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

41
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>can you ask them if they have any words </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their language for life insurance,</v>

42
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>retirement or a vacation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they understood retirement.</v>

43
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>You get too old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids take care of you,</v>

44
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.313
<v Speaker 1>but a vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said you leave somewhere and you </v>

45
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want to leave your home?</v>

46
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>It's where all your friends are in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and you.</v>

47
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Why would you ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like life insurance,</v>

48
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>like what the hell are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

49
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>And you start meeting people who their </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of time and space is,</v>

50
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some rice in it.</v>

51
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>So like today I got tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see where you and I think,</v>

52
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:27.204
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in December I'm going to do this and we </v>

53
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:29.034
<v Speaker 1>really have a realistic expectation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being alive and breathing in December </v>

54
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>and in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've no doubt thought of,</v>

55
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:35.544
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I retire or whatever that means to </v>

56
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>you money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of security up the road,</v>

57
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of the world where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>live their entire life 37 years and then</v>

58
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a day of that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

59
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:51.081
<v Speaker 1>They got the t shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stick and some shade and I try and not</v>

60
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:51.984
<v Speaker 1>as some voitier I'm trying to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and I can understand it by </v>

61
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>reading some books and seeing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries,</v>

62
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.913
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing getting out into </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Mark Twain called the territory of </v>

63
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>phrase I stole from David Lee Roth when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said it to me.</v>

64
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.183
<v Speaker 1>And David Lee was actually a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration to do a lot of traveling </v>

65
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>because one time we were talking and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just come back from open sea kayaking in</v>

66
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

67
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.324
<v Speaker 1>so why is it Henry is because don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten today is a great thing to have on </v>

68
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>your to do list every once in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

69
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is profound.</v>

70
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>You know what he was doing up until </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently he moved to Japan.</v>

71
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anybody there and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking Kendall lessons.</v>

72
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>So learning how to sword fight the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese master.</v>

73
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this dog.</v>

74
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:34.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

75
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called me one Sunday a while ago.</v>

76
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I helped him with this autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I worked with Dave really closely for</v>

77
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:41.741
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many months.</v>

78
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I met him when I was in black flag 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>some years ago.</v>

79
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked by him at an art gallery.</v>

80
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

81
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>And he went black flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the van Halen guy.</v>

83
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>We became best buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he called me from Japan and said,</v>

84
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>he's learning Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart.</v>

86
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.854
<v Speaker 1>And he was like learning Japanese and </v>
<v Speaker 1>started speaking Japanese and he's just </v>

87
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>taking lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>you said the sword guy was just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday just like,</v>

89
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just like,</v>

90
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>just breaking them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>And he just got an apartment there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:13.674
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's loving rockstar just gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this normal apartment with his dog </v>

93
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and just starts taking Kendo lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

94
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 1>David's always had a greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation of,</v>

95
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>that kind of discipline in me comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>through martial arts since he was a kid.</v>

97
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think as someone else in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>family's into it,</v>

98
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>but he's been that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that kind of discipline and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on stage.</v>

100
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>The guy is very physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming from a real disciplined,</v>

101
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>not messing around kind of aggression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and control.</v>

102
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.410
<v Speaker 1>And I dave really loves Japan and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says he called me and so I'm living in a</v>

103
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>small apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking my language lessons,</v>

104
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking my martial arts stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing sword stuff for quite a</v>

105
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>long time though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>He's always been involved in martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>

107
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>And even the way he sort of approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedonism,</v>

108
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like it was sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an applied approach to hedonism,</v>

109
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>like his rockstar lifestyle thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing.</v>

110
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

111
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of people get a chance to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

112
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.073
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>

113
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time he,</v>

114
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>when we were working on his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

115
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go home to Pasadena now.</v>

116
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And then were you born and raised in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of his high school buddies?</v>

117
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Seemingly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Dave,</v>

118
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be nice,</v>

119
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being David Lee Roth and he,</v>

120
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

121
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>on graduation day from high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all were on the same starting blocks.</v>

122
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>You chose the bank job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sure thing.</v>

123
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:37.130
<v Speaker 1>You're going to die in that cubicle I </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>

124
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>And he said to sail the seas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

125
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

126
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

127
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>that's daring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he won.</v>

128
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he said it pretty good ride.</v>

129
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I record and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in my own way,</v>

130
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from minimum wage work,</v>

131
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.344
<v Speaker 1>I'm nobody from nowhere and I got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>music via punk rock because the band </v>

132
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>black flag said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

133
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.370
<v Speaker 1>you're a crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to try out to be our singer.</v>

134
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I have to lose?</v>

135
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.294
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went for that and it led to </v>

136
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

137
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately why I'm here in this room</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you today.</v>

138
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you miss rock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you miss touring as a musician?</v>

139
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.191
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

140
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>because I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it really hard until I had nothing</v>

141
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:20.290
<v Speaker 1>left to give to it and so now if I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to it,</v>

142
00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>it would just be repetition and it might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fun repetition,</v>

143
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be meaningful in that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be putting out anything new and</v>

144
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.074
<v Speaker 1>for me the day I stopped doing music was</v>
<v Speaker 1>I woke up one day and I just sat up and </v>

145
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>he was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light bulb went on.</v>

146
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:36.381
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

147
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like,</v>

148
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:39.621
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

149
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well give me my scroll.</v>

150
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've graduated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was this?</v>

151
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.070
<v Speaker 1>A 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years that,</v>

152
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>and I just call it the manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

153
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with music.</v>

154
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 1>And he saw 15 percent of that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof.</v>

155
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

156
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.091
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

157
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:56.924
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

158
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got nothing new to add.</v>

159
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>These will then just go out and do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hits.</v>

160
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:01.304
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

161
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 1>that's not what coltrane would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

162
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not with miles Davis would've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>

163
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not artistically brave to me.</v>

164
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd much rather just try new </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

165
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>but thankfully by that time I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already doing talking tours all over the</v>

166
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>world and they do very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tons of acting,</v>

167
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>voiceover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all this other stuff I was doing,</v>

168
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>had the book company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a record company,</v>

169
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>music publishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all this other stuff and so I just</v>

170
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>kind of let all of that stuff fill in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it this way.</v>

171
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm busier now than ever and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>miss the music.</v>

172
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I see bands in the airport all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the laminates in road gear,</v>

173
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

174
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>rumble young man rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my fill.</v>

175
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful that you did it on your </v>

176
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:46.660
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You decided to do it.</v>

177
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.553
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like there's a lot of aging </v>

178
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:51.404
<v Speaker 1>rock stars that have that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence where they have to go out and </v>

179
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>do the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to hear.</v>

180
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 1>He knew shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of the problem.</v>

181
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And so they have to do that weird circle</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wagons thing,</v>

182
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:03.440
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to play this album in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its entirety.</v>

183
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to some of those shows,</v>

184
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

185
00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 1>throwing my money down and go see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>band,</v>

187
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>do that album in its entirety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool,</v>

188
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the stones still put on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome show.</v>

190
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the cool things about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

191
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mick jagger can still fucking do it.</v>

192
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>He still apparently works out twice a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

193
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing shame,</v>

194
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

195
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>there's some people and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're rare.</v>

196
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>They actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about money.</v>

197
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.770
<v Speaker 1>That's when I really start trusting </v>
<v Speaker 1>those old rock stars.</v>

198
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Like Rod Stewart doesn't need a dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

199
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>that guy can buy four countries right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

200
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 1>He's probably playing tonight and Las </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas or somewhere.</v>

201
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Elton John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just really liked doing the thing.</v>

202
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Mick Jagger and Keith Richards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be rocking.</v>

203
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>They'll die on stage and it's not money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

204
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might get populous like,</v>

205
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really want to play brown sugar.</v>

206
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I admired them.</v>

207
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it's what I'm saying is I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

208
00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm sure it is real.</v>

209
00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.993
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's real with a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I like with you with what </v>

210
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:03.234
<v Speaker 1>you're saying is that you had already </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out all these other paths in </v>

211
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>life that you were enjoying putting your</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative energy and just decided.</v>

212
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.821
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

213
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I know it was summer 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>84.</v>

214
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I was 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in black flag and we were touring.</v>

215
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:15.444
<v Speaker 1>We were staying out of California </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Olympics were coming and we </v>

216
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 1>knew the cops would just be looking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>smash down any supposed Ne'er do wells.</v>

217
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>So we just stayed on tour the whole year</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>

218
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.853
<v Speaker 1>And I noticed all these great bands </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the very talented people and </v>

219
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:29.994
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all broke between tours were like </v>

220
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:32.880
<v Speaker 1>living like sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't like tour,</v>

221
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>we don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And between tours,</v>

222
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the guys in that band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all waiters.</v>

223
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not putting that down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the music wasn't keeping you in rent</v>

224
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 1>12 months a year and I'm not nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented as any of them.</v>

225
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:45.871
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

226
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>if there those guys are struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what am I going to do?</v>

227
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I better get plans B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

228
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:50.971
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

229
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:51.804
<v Speaker 1>F and g together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in those days I just started my </v>

230
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 1>little book publishing company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to work harder on writing.</v>

231
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to become much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start doing the talking shows.</v>

232
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get much better at that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start saying yes to things </v>

233
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>when they come along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years later,</v>

234
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood started calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

235
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>can you act them because well as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sing and click,</v>

236
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>acting is crispin glover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actor.</v>

238
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 1>One day he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

239
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:18.771
<v Speaker 1>Henry as a just please consider acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like just if you get an audition,</v>

240
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily say no just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the music guy.</v>

241
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might really like it and you</v>

242
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:27.630
<v Speaker 1>could probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

243
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:28.464
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and within a year I was doing film and </v>

244
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:31.561
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

245
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>can you do a voiceover?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

246
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a voice.</v>

247
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And so I just started saying yes to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and that was the plan.</v>

248
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.113
<v Speaker 1>Just have more things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine because I don't like </v>

249
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>sitting around anyway and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically music ended up being very,</v>

250
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>very good in all of that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had plans,</v>

251
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>other plans and I've noticed that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of old geezers around my era,</v>

252
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>they didn't come up with something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just,</v>

253
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why and they didn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>another plan and they get put into those</v>

254
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:01.630
<v Speaker 1>weird tours were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

255
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring your kid all of that and it's </v>

256
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.863
<v Speaker 1>more that they got more than they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and I'd rather wake up wanting to do </v>

257
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:12.114
<v Speaker 1>stuff not having to do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like you were saying a while </v>

258
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:16.164
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like less obligation just so you clear </v>

259
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:21.330
<v Speaker 1>the deck so you can really do what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want because life is short.</v>

260
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean last week I was 20 and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>56.</v>

261
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean it goes by really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're in a cubicle</v>

262
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:29.820
<v Speaker 1>or a prison cell and then you wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>

263
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

264
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 1>that was fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you might as well make it as much</v>

265
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 1>as what you want it to be as possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all you're getting is older.</v>

266
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why people don't fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wake up every day,</v>

267
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:43.400
<v Speaker 1>but with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.260
<v Speaker 1>the grim reaper side whistling by my ear</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

269
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 1>you better get up man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all the up I need.</v>

270
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever sleep in.</v>
