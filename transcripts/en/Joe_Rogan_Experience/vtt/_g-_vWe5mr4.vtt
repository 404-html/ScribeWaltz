00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>the Ron Paul's of the world,</v>

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like to get to be a certain age where they're just,</v>

5
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a fuck.</v>

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.711
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you going to do?</v>

7
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:09.544
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to shoot him?</v>

8
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking 85 years old or whatever he is.</v>

9
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.231
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

11
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>he's last run for president has done now it's up to his son and his son.</v>

12
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he's been using cheat sheets.</v>

13
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Plagiarizing a lot of credit for that wonderful filibuster we did for the fourth</v>

14
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>amendment,</v>

15
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>got the best publicity,</v>

16
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>the fourth amendment's gotten in so long and then you go pull that on me.</v>

17
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Make me look like an idiot for beef.</v>

18
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>People don't know what you're talking about.</v>

19
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>It's apparently he had used some,</v>

20
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>some words from some various speeches.</v>

21
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same.</v>

22
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

23
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that he has writers and he doesn't know that's what his father</v>

24
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>shot the newsletters where that got his father in so much trouble.</v>

25
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>But remember Rand Paul who website nice things about also has his,</v>

26
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>one of his main advisors,</v>

27
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>that guy who did the southern Avenger,</v>

28
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>you know cafe.</v>

29
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

30
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>

31
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>one of his advisors was the southern Avenger and he wore a mask and had a</v>

32
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>confederate flag behind him,</v>

33
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>like a youtube show or something,</v>

34
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.981
<v Speaker 1>and then when they said it,</v>

35
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fire this guy.</v>

36
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:03.541
<v Speaker 1>He goes something like,</v>

37
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:03.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>that's all in his past and you just go ice.</v>

39
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>What's up with this?</v>

40
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Why are these people all crazy?</v>

41
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Talk about freedom in our constitution.</v>

42
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

43
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 1>That's adorable.</v>

44
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the southern Avenger.</v>

46
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:15.864
<v Speaker 1>Look at his photo.</v>

47
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait.</v>

48
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>If that guy's on your staff and somebody,</v>

49
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.051
<v Speaker 1>you could honestly say,</v>

50
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:22.231
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

51
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he was a southerner venture.</v>

52
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Once they tell you,</v>

53
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>don't you fire him five seconds later,</v>

54
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably a good move.</v>

55
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.411
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>

56
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:31.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:31.921
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

58
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:32.251
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

59
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for taking my pet issue of the fourth amendment and trashing it with your</v>

60
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>southern Avenger guy.</v>

61
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>What is the southern Avenger stance?</v>

62
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm on his team.</v>

63
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.991
<v Speaker 1>Hold on us.</v>

64
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I know I have never watched the southern event.</v>

65
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I just clips painting with a broad blush brush.</v>

66
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>The confederate flag does that for you.</v>

67
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

68
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>What could he possibly,</v>

69
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>he's confusing the shit out of me already.</v>

70
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.454
<v Speaker 1>Conservative,</v>

71
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.361
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian,</v>

72
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Independent.</v>

73
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>What he's done,</v>

74
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.941
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

75
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:56.241
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

76
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:56.421
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

77
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:56.740
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

78
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>he's destroyed conservative,</v>

79
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>independent and libertarian in one tag line.</v>

80
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>He's probably,</v>

81
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>working for a group whose design,</v>

83
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>who's trying to discredit all of those things.</v>

84
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised it doesn't have a TM at the end of it.</v>

85
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>it's the logo.</v>

87
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a better logo that a lot of people have.</v>

88
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

90
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.064
<v Speaker 1>what does he try to do?</v>

91
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Is this guy still like a wrestler?</v>

92
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't eat.</v>

93
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

94
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Is He still have a show?</v>

95
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.101
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

96
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>we works for Rand Paul now.</v>

97
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:20.454
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

98
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>They didn't fire him in.</v>

99
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Where's Brian?</v>

100
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.260
<v Speaker 1>He keeps supposed to look all that.</v>

101
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to look it up.</v>

102
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>He's just going to interrupt.</v>

103
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

104
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>he's been panic.</v>

105
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Temporary banishment but ran.</v>

106
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Paul still has this guy working for,</v>

107
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>

108
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't comment on that.</v>

109
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:35.371
<v Speaker 1>As we know,</v>

110
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>if the southern Avenger said anything bad,</v>

111
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.671
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

112
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>speak at the same conference as Rand Paul.</v>

113
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>After neoconservative alter ego was revealed.</v>

114
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Hunter left a post on the,</v>

115
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>as the Kentucky senators social media.</v>

116
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:49.824
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

117
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy that's southern or avenger please.</v>

118
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.261
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

119
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:52.801
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see it.</v>

120
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It looks like guys look at that photo over his right shoulder for the left</v>

121
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:57.991
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>

122
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>That's disturbing.</v>

123
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Is that I have no shirt on.</v>

124
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>There's like a bunch of people and one guy has no shirt on.</v>

125
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a gay orgy about a southern gay orgy.</v>

126
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.091
<v Speaker 1>They just said,</v>

127
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>we just have some chicken and we're fixing to fuck.</v>

128
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

129
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>The guy has no shirt on and a big chest tattoo.</v>

130
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>What if that chest tattoo was like some fucking conservative?</v>

131
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's on his bank statement.</v>

132
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>a big confederate flag.</v>

134
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the cover of the fucking,</v>

135
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>the roof of the general duty.</v>

136
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>

137
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you get someone who sang some important things in a halfway decent way,</v>

138
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.213
<v Speaker 1>they have to come.</v>

139
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

140
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>people say to me all the time,</v>

141
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.490
<v Speaker 1>well we vote all the time Dan.</v>

142
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>The of course the countries on.</v>

143
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Is it based on voters voting for people?</v>

144
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.881
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>

145
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>When we get somebody who would like to change course in a direction,</v>

146
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>most of us would like to see half of them is really fantastic and the other half</v>

147
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>of them is so crazy.</v>

148
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>You'd never elect a person like that in a million years.</v>

149
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we have somebody who has some common sense and it doesn't sound like</v>

150
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.621
<v Speaker 1>two words,</v>

151
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>my friend simulation theory and all guys back and diversify risk management</v>

152
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>diversification tool.</v>

153
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

155
00:03:59.051 --> 00:03:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I think he's hedging his bets in case white people take over the world again,</v>

157
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:03.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>in in,</v>

159
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.160
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

160
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>in a very dominant sort of way.</v>

161
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>We'll have the southern Avenger on staff.</v>

162
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.291
<v Speaker 1>He can advise us.</v>

163
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:12.480
<v Speaker 1>You ever watched those extreme preppers shows that little shows her dudes or,</v>

164
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>or fix into the preparing for the end of the world.</v>

165
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.170
<v Speaker 1>People stockpile and water and creating escape routes and battering rams.</v>

166
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>They're welding to the front of their pickup trucks.</v>

167
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 1>The hoarders because they're the porters that are doing it for a good cause,</v>

168
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

169
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>They believe that it's all going to come crumbling down and those,</v>

171
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's an mentality and the same kind of mentality that is the</v>

172
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>type of person that wants to get in this word rebellious position of power,</v>

173
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>rebellious position of,</v>

174
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>railing out against the government.</v>

176
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>They're very similar to these people that are prepping is very similar to the</v>

177
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>their extreme folks.</v>

178
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Like those are the only people that make it to the front of that crazy line.</v>

179
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They have to be a bit nutty.</v>

180
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the ideas aren't interesting to you or I when look at a guy like</v>

181
00:04:57.791 --> 00:04:58.331
<v Speaker 1>ran Paul,</v>

182
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>the things that he says that you agree with or his dad,</v>

183
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>the things that he says that you agree with,</v>

184
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's to get there.</v>

185
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 1>He's facing so much opposition.</v>

186
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>There's so much bullshit along the way,</v>

187
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>so much pressure,</v>

188
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 1>so much,</v>

189
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>so much back and forth debate.</v>

190
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>So much frustration,</v>

191
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>so much suppression of information.</v>

192
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>By the time he gets to a position where the world is listening to him,</v>

193
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>he's already broken.</v>

194
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>He like broke every bone in his fucking soul just to get to the front of the</v>

195
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

196
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:27.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

197
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>it's funny that people say to me all the time,</v>

198
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>can you get a staff together to do what you do so you can do better?</v>

200
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I want more history shows.</v>

201
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.001
<v Speaker 1>Can we,</v>

202
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:34.834
<v Speaker 1>can we help you do this?</v>

203
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>And I always say the same thing.</v>

204
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.311
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

205
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you can't help me because I can't watch y'all and I can't keep track of them.</v>

206
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what all these people do.</v>

207
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

208
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:41.960
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

210
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

211
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.941
<v Speaker 1>Paul said,</v>

212
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:43.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:43.961
<v Speaker 1>Ron Paul said,</v>

215
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:44.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

216
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:44.944
<v Speaker 1>this guy who wrote,</v>

217
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>he was doing my newsletter for me.</v>

218
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:47.141
<v Speaker 1>I was in Congress.</v>

219
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have time to do newsletters.</v>

220
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>So he did it and he wrote all this stuff and I didn't know what was happening.</v>

221
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.560
<v Speaker 1>That's my fear is that you can hire a bunch of people and then you're gonna turn</v>

222
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>around and go,</v>

223
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 1>what did you do for me?</v>

224
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>What you,</v>

225
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>which we started the southern Avenger show for you.</v>

226
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>We thought that'd be a good promotional vehicle for your show,</v>

227
00:05:59.091 --> 00:05:59.421
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

228
00:05:59.421 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

229
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

230
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

231
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's,</v>

232
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a catch 22 do you,</v>

233
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>do you give away some of your control or do you keep it,</v>

234
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>where you know everything's cool,</v>

236
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>but the minute you give it away,</v>

237
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you got rogue people,</v>

238
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you know with your name running around graffitiing the PSI,</v>

239
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Banksy and Carlin,</v>

240
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.454
<v Speaker 1>we're here.</v>

241
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So many isolated the photograph,</v>

242
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.581
<v Speaker 1>pull it.</v>

243
00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>This is the photograph.</v>

244
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>It's all a bunch of wrestlers.</v>

245
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Like a wrestler.</v>

246
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>These are like old school southern wrestlers that I was probably right.</v>

248
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>They probably buff fucked each other.</v>

249
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>As soon as this was over.</v>

250
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.590
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's got this in the,</v>

251
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:31.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

252
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

253
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>he's got it framed on his wall in the background of his fucking study.</v>

254
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>So yay.</v>

255
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Southern Avenger.</v>

256
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

257
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Simulation theory.</v>

258
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Does it say he parted ways?</v>

259
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.161
<v Speaker 1>So there so,</v>

260
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>so he got rid of him finally,</v>

261
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.571
<v Speaker 1>I guess the,</v>

262
00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>the hue and cry was a little too much for a sitting senator from Kentucky to</v>

263
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>have somebody named the southern Avenger on his staff.</v>

264
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

265
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>he was a cogo coauthor of the 2011 book with Rand Paul.</v>

266
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>The tea party goes to watch,</v>

267
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.813
<v Speaker 1>maybe forgotten,</v>

268
00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>blanked it out.</v>

269
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.591
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>

270
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

271
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>it is funny that these people,</v>

272
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 1>they have to be,</v>

273
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>we can't have a fourth amendment person who's not.</v>

274
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

275
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess you do,</v>

276
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you got guys like widen and you'd all in some of these people,</v>

277
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

278
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>but when you get somebody who's a real lightening rod for this stuff.</v>

279
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.131
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

281
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.731
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

282
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>we've been waiting for a guy like this forever.</v>

283
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>They come with these poison pills that you just can't swallow.</v>

284
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
