WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.020
I'll just kicked in.
Yeah.
Here we go.
We're live ladies.

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.840
Gentlemen.
Joe Rogan experience podcast.

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.990
That's why new opening.
Yeah.
Not just,
I'm just,

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.100
I'm going indeed
just Justin base behind it.

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.640
We have two sponsors right now,
ladies,
gentlemen and the sponsors are,
are,

6
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.650
are people that get behind us and financially support the show and,

7
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.560
and,
and then they become our friends.

8
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.280
So they are our sponsors but they are also our friends.
Um,

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.310
that's how we like to do business here over at the Joe Rogan experience podcast,

10
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.260
like friends with were sponsors.

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
This is a lot of noise going on about these things suck by the way.

12
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:48.420
I know they suck because no one uses them,
but us,

13
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.930
Adam Carolla has those like straight pipe things that never move,

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.150
which is the way to do it.
That Mike Arms.
Yeah,

15
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.490
they make it screeching noises like a horror movie.

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.690
I think it absolutely and kind of like it.
Oh,
you like it.
Okay.

17
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.530
The blog that is arguable.
This park has it brought to your voice squeaking?
Well,

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.690
it lets people know that this,
you know,

19
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.840
people will worried that as we move into this new studio,

20
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.110
we're just robots now on the big we're going to,

21
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.600
it's going to clean up too much and it's not going to,
you know what?

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330
I think what they like about this podcast is it's,

23
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.670
it's really obviously like a bunch of guys just sitting around shooting the
shit.

24
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.840
No,
we better we could spoke about while we're doing it.
Yeah.

25
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.370
Instead of having to like not well we could always do it while we're doing it.

26
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:27.570
As long as we don't do the video.

27
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
Did the real issue is the Ustream doesn't like to see that.

28
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.430
Even if it's legal for us,

29
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:36.240
even if we are technically legally do doing it in the state.

30
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.150
Oh I thought you were just worried about your kids coming by or something.
No,

31
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.150
no one.
I don't just don't do it in the house and doing the house at all.

32
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.330
I don't want my house smelling like weed.
You know what I mean?

33
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.590
Mine through layers like your car.

34
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.980
Did you ever have a car that you smoked weed in and the thing just starts

35
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.910
tanking?
Yeah,
that's not good.
Anyway,

36
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.310
this podcast brought to you by the fleshlight fleshlight.

37
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:01.050
This is the number one sex toy for men.
The only one that I know of by name.

38
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.620
How about that?
It's like the Kleenex of sex toys.
The rabbit.

39
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.300
That's the only other one.
That's girl one.
Dude,
don't use that.

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.180
Okay.
Um,
if you go to Joe rogan.net,

41
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.130
the liquid,
that was your reaction.

42
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.330
I fall down.
Disappointed father.

43
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.400
I turned out to be gay.

44
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:32.820
All of that to say is don't try to fuck me and everything will be exactly the

45
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:37.430
same.
That's all I have to say.
It's a no deal stuff yet is crazy.

46
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.860
I can't control my bonus.
Go

47
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.140
ask it.
A gay guy to control his bone.

48
00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:48.240
It's like asking a fucking straight guy to bodyguard girlfriend.

49
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.310
I mean if a girl or you thought was attractive,
said,

50
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:53.200
don't try to fuck me good to me.
They'd be like og,
definitely to try to fuck you.

51
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:58.080
Goddamn elephants in the room.
I just said,
how long is my trap?
Is it three years?

52
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.490
How wide is my net?

53
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.180
How slowly do you have to work your way in until she becomes the next message?

54
00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:09.060
Should fear you will get her.
You will pull her in the rear.

55
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.490
We got tired of waiting for girls that can just fuck me already.
Wow.
No,

56
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.100
I don't talk like that.
That's ridiculous.

57
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.340
This sounds a super selfish.

58
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.540
It doesn't seem like it would just like enough is enough.

59
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.080
Silently masturbated alone in the corner where the girl like looked out of the

60
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.070
corner of her eye.
You done.
Are you done?
I've been that guy.

61
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.290
He like,
I gotta I can't take anymore shit ever for a man.

62
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.610
You realize what you're doing and like,
oh my God,
he watches you.

63
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.610
And then once it's over it's over.

64
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:47.611
You feel like Saatchi Lou has such an insane loser.

65
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.650
Do you get a silence?

66
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:55.390
I shouldn't say I've only masturbated once with a girl in the same room and then

67
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:57.990
she masturbated ofso that's okay.

68
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.030
And then I just come down her ted talk.
It was kind of weird.

69
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.460
It was the only time I ever did it.
You know,

70
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.630
like we're both sitting there masturbating for some reason people are fucking

71
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:09.760
weird.
This is weird.

72
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.750
Just the fact that you were like magnetically attracted to other people.

73
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.400
We were like magnetically hormonally attracted to other other people and you

74
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:22.870
just try to navigate your way through that wave of humans and you know,

75
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.830
choosing very specifically which ones you interact with.
I mean,

76
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.150
you know what I'm saying?
I mean,

77
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.960
it's a strange thing when you really break it down and look at it objectively,

78
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:36.520
how weird the interaction is between human beings,
magnetic charge.

79
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.300
They're just like,
ah,
it's just intuit.
So bizarre man.
You know,

80
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:44.200
and look at how many of our friends have had like,
you know,
really bad ones.

81
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.620
You know,
Brian,
you've gone through a few fucking chaotic ones.

82
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.230
Well it's like all of a sudden you're dealing with all this craziness in your

83
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.340
life and most of it has started to happening with your physical interaction with

84
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:59.620
this person.
Like this person you,
you get into their world.

85
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.840
And if you don't look it in terms of the context of our culture and our language

86
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:07.480
and you know,
and then the shit we're used to seeing on the TV screen,

87
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.190
look at it as just like energy.
That energy is a weird thing,
man.

88
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.060
The men and the women coming together like getting close to each other,

89
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.530
but trying to control the situation.
So don't break up.

90
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.110
Oh my God.
Getting bought,
breaking up,

91
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:26.420
getting back together and breaking up again and it,
fuck it.
Wasn't that,

92
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.130
that brutal cycle.
Have you ever thrown out like Shale Mary?
I love you.

93
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.030
Like right at the end.
Fuck it.
I'll just brush.

94
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.340
I've thrown out a hail Mary.
Hail Mary.

95
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.880
I love you letters that we got for the shots right now.

96
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.560
Oh yeah.
I wish I had the letter.
It was so humiliating.

97
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.830
I swear I would have read it.

98
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.150
I was even saying to her that we should make babies.
It was so weird.

99
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.830
It was the Wiki shit cause she wouldn't have,
she was done with me,
man.

100
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.970
I went to visit her at work and I forget what we were talking about,
but uh,
she,

101
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.920
she goes,
was your nose always that crooked?
I was like,
Oh shit,
this bitch,

102
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.050
this bitch is not only,
she's like picking me apart.
Now you're hurting me.

103
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.040
Yeah.
Not only is she over me,
she's like breaking that.
Did you get shorter?

104
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.430
You know,
like,
she's like,
oh,
almost want to say

105
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.790
fucking lit.
It's weird ones.
It takes a while to now have some stranger said.

106
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.720
The second thing you'd be like,
no,
I don't know what forget.

107
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.640
It takes a while to navigate relationships,
man.

108
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.210
Especially when you don't have your shit together.
You know,

109
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.250
when I was a young man,
I,
who the fuck would have wanted to date me?

110
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:36.320
I wouldn't have wanted a date in May.
I was an idiot.

111
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.180
If someone said something to me recently,
yesterday,
my sister,

112
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.120
it goes and I sort of want an ugly choke because I want her to feel lucky to be

113
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.920
happening.
Ultimately,
trust me,

114
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.290
women who have power complexes,
they always get a Beta man.

115
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.920
They get a man who's below them on the food chain and then they control that

116
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:55.970
motherfucker on a leash.

117
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.020
We've all seen that guy who has to like pretend to be someone different and keep

118
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:04.050
his mouth shut and he's and his girl way too hot for him.
Hey,

119
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.370
stop talking about me.
I'm right here.
These,

120
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.940
how about these guys?
And I don't want to be mean,

121
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.740
so I'm trying to figure out how to say this that have wives that do porn and

122
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:20.240
they,
they sort of just sit back.
They're kind of cool with it.

123
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.420
That's just what she does.
Yeah,
I think it adds much.
Just shut off.

124
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.070
It'd be like that.
It's something that is a crazy thought process right there.

125
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:29.060
This is still the commercials.

126
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.290
That's fucking hustle brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com it's o.

127
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.100
N.
N.
I.
T.
A lot of this porn talk goes a lot with flashlight as well though.

128
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.110
Downplays the codename Rogan,

129
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:43.220
say 15% off on the flashlight and use a codename rogue and save 10% off any and

130
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:47.080
all orders on,
on at.com what's up on it when you get to catch up on it?

131
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.240
What's good?
15% oh yeah.

132
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:54.950
I know that we need to get them that it should be 15% right?
Just raise it $5,

133
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.120
raise it $5.
They're not the choice.
That price and then charge more percent.

134
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.900
That's rude.
No,
it's easy.
You know,
um,
I'm thinking into the mic.

135
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.790
I've been getting in way too many fucking arguments on the Internet a couple

136
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.770
days.
I just fielding Douchebag,
fight back.
There's so many do.

137
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.940
That's just a screaming and I,
you know,
I know,

138
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:16.980
but every now and then I can't help,
but I can't help it.
There's a,

139
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.440
there was people keep wanting.

140
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.300
Here's one of the issues is Alpha Brain Alpha brain is this cognitive enhancing

141
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:27.050
supplement that we sell and for whatever fucking reason people like to cry.

142
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:29.750
Bullshit.
They'd love it.
They love,

143
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.600
I'm saying you're bullshitting and love saying it's a placebo.

144
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:37.010
They love saying vitamins that enhance neuro function,

145
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.040
they enhanced your brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters as or as how

146
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:43.220
it's been explained to me.

147
00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:45.500
I'm going to be able to accept that I know none of this,

148
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.860
but I do know that there's all those tests that had been done and all the

149
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.800
different ingredients and you know,
it's all up on,

150
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:55.990
there's like there's an Alpha brain science link on,
on at

151
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.660
<v 1>Dotcom and explains all this shit.</v>

152
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.850
The impression that some people have is that this is um,

153
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.280
a,
a blend of different things that produces a sort of a synergistic effect and

154
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.880
that hasn't been proven that if,
even if that hasn't been proven,

155
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:14.310
even if this is just a theoretical synergistic effect,

156
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.800
each individual nutrient that's in Alpha brain is absolutely been to been

157
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.610
proven,

158
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.610
absolutely has been proven to have a positive impact on some function of either

159
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:29.070
the human body,
mind or athletic performance.

160
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.260
There's a lot of shit that's referenced,

161
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.590
a lot of studies that are referenced on the Alpha Brain Science link.

162
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:36.810
So just check that out if you have any questions about this stuff.

163
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.400
That's where he got in a fight.
So the people on the line,

164
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.320
that's just a little bit of it.
It's just,

165
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.680
it's annoying that people just get so candy,
like right away.

166
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.760
Like people were just so insulted in country right away that just sometimes you

167
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:51.240
cannot give your energy to.
Yeah.
But I like it sometimes.

168
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:55.140
I like it and sometimes it's fun.
I like to smack them down,
but I don't,

169
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:59.820
I don't do it because I want to put an idea in their head of how stupid it is.

170
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.190
No.
Do you think they're going to go away thinking,
you know what,

171
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:04.740
let me rethink that.
Or they're just going to go,
I don't give a fucking idiot.

172
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.800
Ooh,
cool food.
I don't care how they,
how they take it.
That's up to them.
Yeah.

173
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.940
It's just that they're there in the first place.

174
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.900
They should be ostracized from any online community.
That's what I think.

175
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.030
I think really country shitty people,

176
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.870
she'd be ostracized and I think we should only encourage the kind of

177
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.730
communication,
like turning your body.
Yeah,
it's fun.
So when people get kind,

178
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.220
I call him stupid or you know,
or I'll call them [inaudible] or whatever.

179
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:32.310
But yeah,
the reason why I dealers,
I want them to feel it,

180
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:34.470
I want them to know this is that you don't do this.

181
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:35.910
This is a stupid way to behave.

182
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.670
You don't have to communicate your thoughts like this,
you know?

183
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.120
But then it's kind of hypocritical on my part because I'm kind of lashing out at

184
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:44.370
them the same way they're doing it to them,
man.
Never going to learn that lesson.

185
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:48.450
Of course not.
I'm an idiot.
So it's like you're just wasting your time with them.

186
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.650
You make yourself feel worse.
It's fun though sometimes.

187
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.530
Sometimes it lets you realize though.

188
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:56.940
It's like they will not get what you are saying.

189
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.470
There's no moment where the book fuck you're right.
Yeah,
I know it is.
It's weird.

190
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.930
Um,
anyway,
uh,

191
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.460
go to [inaudible] dot com and check out all the different supplements.
The ones,

192
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.350

193
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:11.160
sport and Alpha brain or you shroom tech sport.
All the time.
Before I work out,

194
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:14.160
I take four of those bitches and have ferocious workouts.

204

Headlining cobb's in San Francisco this Wednesday night strap the fuck in San

205
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.520
Fran.
Yeah,
that's huge.
That was a humongous club that I was,
I wrote it.

206
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.920
It's one of those cups of wrote off my head where it's like,
I don't need to,

207
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:12.790
if need be nice.
These management people,
I'll never before me on my own.

208
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:17.080
I ain't come up with a future and I'm not,
and I'm not going to hit.
It's too big,

209
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.940
you know?
That's hilarious.
No one's going to bring you up there to feature,
right.

210
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.120
It's like they're not just gonna.
I'm out.

211
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.690
I'm not going to go like to Baird also to Tempe.
It was like,

212
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:29.570
am I going here for $100 who else have you ever worked with?
Unlike a,

213
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.790
have you ever worked with the other headliners besides me,
Ralph a few times.

214
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.820
Paulie a few times and then like here are there other people you know but not

215
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:40.840
like didn't nobody else by brought me.

216
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.340
Everybody's doing it wrong because the way to deal right as you,

217
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.370
you bring a bunch of guys who are really funny man.
I'm seeing it already.

218
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.080
It's like I'm fighting to get just my friends in just to see if like they're

219
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.050
from there and had to like plead my cause it won't cost you one extra penny

220
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.071
please.

221
00:12:57.071 --> 00:13:01.440
That's a comedy store comic that's going to be better than the guy you have like

222
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.110
pleased.
I think that's been,
it won't cost you anything.
And I'm like,
dude,

223
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.470
all right,
why don't they want you to do it?
They want to put their own guys,

224
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:13.150
which I get a lot of Neil in getting people to and also I can't,

225
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:14.260
cause I'm not a lot of costs.

226
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.720
I'm like anything extra now cause then it's like extra costs.

227
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.960
Well that's all that'll all change as long as he keeps selling tickets at all

228
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:22.900
changes.
But yeah,
there's,
there's a,
there's a,

229
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.340
there's like a growth period when you start working in clubs where you start off

230
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.180
and you know you have to work with their people and then you're maybe allowed to

231
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:34.600
suggest to people but they like bring the MC or something like that and then

232
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:38.430
eventually it gets to a point where you can control the whole situation.
Yeah.

233
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.210
It's even just to like give something back.
Like I'm going to Philadelphia,

234
00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:43.330
it was trying to get Eleanor Simona and just,
cause it's like,
hey,

235
00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:46.680
if you want it to Patriot home.
Right,
right,
right.
Some guys like having,

236
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.810
trying to get into that club.
Do you think you can tell them how about that?
Yeah.

237
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.130
And Eleanor Simona both.
Great.
Yeah,
that'd be perfect.
Yeah.
I mean don't,

238
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.120
do they accept a audition videos?
Do they except video?
I don't know.

239
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.190
It's just so much easier when they actually go see you.

240
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:02.080
So it's like it brings some money in and they performed for a week.

241
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:05.290
They kill and it's like,
oh see I can look good the way I do it.

242
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:07.790
I said I just sort of take over the um,
like,

243
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.490
especially if it's like a theater or something like that or not.
Yeah,

244
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.370
you just take over the night.
So you own it from eight to 10 or whatever it is,

245
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:16.840
name.
They work out where all the money goes.
You know,

246
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:19.960
my management and everything does.
But I bring on the show.

247
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.060
So when you do a comedy club,
man,

248
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.950
I like to treat a common club was same way as your theater.

249
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:25.650
I don't have to come in and bring the opening show.

250
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.120
I don't want to have to work with a local guy.

251
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:31.120
And it doesn't mean that I don't love local comedy because I fucking do,

252
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.900
you know?
But I don't want to have to guess as to whether or not on my life,

253
00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:35.710
the guy,
I don't know.

254
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.700
I have to guess as to whether or not he's crazy or he's really cool and
friendly.

255
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:41.530
A lot of them are going to be really cool and friendly.

256
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.830
Like we did this thing for the maximum tour where we went on the road.

257
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:48.100
We did like 22 gangs,
me and Charlie Murphy and John Half on.

258
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:51.950
And one of the cool parts about it was we met some really funny comics.

259
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.760
That's where we met Tom Segura.
Yeah.
Tom.

260
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.230
Josh McDermitt was a Phoenix guy.

261
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.530
We met him when we did the Tempe and we tried to get me into that.
Right.

262
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:04.190
And they were like,
fuck no.
They're like,
let's look him up.

263
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.580
And that I saw and they're like,
absolutely not.
Don't bring it up again.

264
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:12.450
It's not happening.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So in,
you know,

265
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.840
in the beginning it just,
uh,
it was,
uh,
it was great.

266
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.710
It was like a bunch of good guys,
like roof,
really funny,

267
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:23.660
local guys like Thompson girl.
But we had this one guy,
I think it was in Boston,

268
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.570
was it in Boston that we had that one guy who was an asshole.

269
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.420
There was like giving me the finger behind my back and he was,

270
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.620
he got really drunk and it was Boston.
It was Boston.

271
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.230
That guy was weird,
man.
He didn't do,

272
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.410
we got stuck in the green room with a crazy person.
He was,

273
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.060
the opening act was really weird.
I don't remember his name man,

274
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:47.780
but I remember getting him such weird vibe from everybody got these weird vibes

275
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:51.530
from him and he started getting really drunk.
I don't remember the dude,

276
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.740
I don't remember his name,
but I remember that was that possibility.

277
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.720
The possibility that it might not have been Boston.
Expound a fact.
I'm starting,

278
00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.920
I don't want to say it's boss.

279
00:15:59.921 --> 00:16:03.420
I can't remember what town it was now that I think there was so many in oven or

280
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.420
in a row.
It's really silly of me to say it was Boston.

281
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:08.000
If it was that it was not the Boston guy apologized.
Whoever it was.

282
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.450
When you think about people from Boston,
their minds,
your background.
Yeah,

283
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.230
maybe just
rolling eyes.
So many psychopaths.

284
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.150
I Dunno.
I don't mean it might not have been Boston.

285
00:16:18.151 --> 00:16:21.020
Another think about it for the first I played the buzzing with you at Faneuil

286
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:24.440
hall at a comedy.
What was it called?
Um,

287
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.950
common connection if hall and a,

288
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.790
and just seeing your friends show up and then like they're starting to Yap.

289
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:34.980
Louder and louder.
And I'm like,
wait,
no,
this can't be real good.

290
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.140
Made to each other.
I grew up with sat there.

291
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:42.960
The problem it was savages.
Yeah.
It's like,

292
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.130
do we tell them to be quiet Howard?
Yeah.
Just drunk

293
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.540
fucking Chinese food.
Yeah.
I'm fucking starving.
People turning,

294
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:56.570
looking at what?
Yeah.
Well it's mostly my pal.

295
00:16:56.571 --> 00:17:01.310
Jimmy did Telia Shimmy to Shelia gets a couple of drinks and then he gets crazy.

296
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.970
He's an awesome guy though.
They were fun people.
You know,

297
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.470
that's the thing about east coast people.
They,
there's a,
there's days,

298
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.880
an unmistakable extra energy that east coast people have,
you know,

299
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.810
whether it's Douchey or good or whatever it is.
There's a weird,
unmistakable,

300
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.640
little extra energy that east coast people trying to name it.

301
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:23.780
This weekend it was like to fucking whiteness.
It's just like,
no,

302
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.410
I don't know man.
It's a different thing.
It's a different,

303
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.470
people have a different attitude.
I don't know what it is,
man.

304
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.550
I wonder if it's the,
the,
the,
um,

305
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:37.160
I think one of the problems with La being so big and so it's really big,

306
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:42.020
but we all have cars and so we're not like interacting with each other.
No,

307
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:45.020
not at all.
Whereas New York City is really big,

308
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:47.540
but everybody melts with everybody.

309
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:50.580
Everybody's subway and cabs and walking

310
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.110
<v 3>and subway and calves at walking.</v>

311
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.680
So I think it becomes a more healthy blend of people and everybody sort of,

312
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.870
you know,
there,

313
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.940
I think it's probably passed out a little heightened little heightened to be

314
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.520
aware of all the boats.
Like everybody has to be aware of that bullshit.

315
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.430
Not just the,
not just poor people.
Everybody has to look at all times.
Yeah.

316
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.940
There's always could be someone walking the streets of New York City in any

317
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:20.670
given place and time that's not supposed to be there.

318
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.550
It's not like he's a fence around it,
you know?
You know what I mean?

319
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:25.680
Criminals can get to like,
we're really rich,

320
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:28.170
old ladies are stepping out of billion dollar apartment building.

321
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:30.840
I'll talk about,
yeah,
I mean,
what's to stop them?

322
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.340
What's to stop them from doing that.
I mean,

323
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.180
are there cops that are constantly patrolling those little that advertisers

324
00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.040
don't batches and the bus stops and park avenue there isn't.
Okay.

325
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.800
I don't want the homeless sleeping in them.
Whoa.
So let's say we're just,

326
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.760
none of us using anyway.
Wow.
That's where it's just a service I'm going to,
no,

327
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.170
I don't get it.
Oh my God.
That's ridiculous.
But that's what rich people get.

328
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.990
That's what they pay their taxes and stuff extra or whatever they pay.

329
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.900
That's why there isn't a real crime.
There was more cops presence.

330
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.020
Do they really have more cops though?
Is that legal?

331
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.680
So legal to have like more cops.
I don't know.
You're right.
It shouldn't be legal.

332
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:06.120
Right.
That seems weird.

333
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.120
But it's like they're the ones that get shit done to the donators and stuff,

334
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:09.870
but what is it?

335
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.460
Why do they have why given up on large portions of the city and it's okay.
Yeah.

336
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.290
That just didn't seem like it should be illegal,
right?
No.
They were like,

337
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:19.800
don't worry you guys here.
We'll,
we'll make sure to protect you.
Why am I,

338
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.120
why is their life worth more?

339
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.880
They always said that when the power went out that it would go back on in the

340
00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:27.360
nice neighborhoods first.
Yeah.
And then,

341
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.220
<v 4>yeah,</v>

342
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.210
<v 3>later downtown.</v>

343
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.693
<v 4>I don't know.</v>

344
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.410
<v 3>Yeah,
I don't know.
Um,
I don't know if they'll,
if they can actually do that,</v>

345
00:19:36.411 --> 00:19:38.780
can actually do that.
I don't know.
You'd think they would though.

346
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.110
I Bet I can get away with it.
How would they get away with it?
Well,

347
00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:45.800
there's less crime there.
So at the same amount of patrol would keep it,

348
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.153
I don't know.

349
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.023
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

350
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.450
<v 3>How do they damage?
I don't know.
I have no idea.
I just don't know if it's,</v>

351
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.630
it must be,

352
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.240
but then you go to like to pay more taxes in one area and then you,

353
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.320
the police get paid more as I show more police presence,
smart,

354
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.860
really strong fire departments.
So we're gonna let's all pay a little more.

355
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:09.890
We'll get a better to fire department.
I don't know if it works that way.

356
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.510
Did you hear about this tag?
Don't know.

357
00:20:11.511 --> 00:20:14.300
I'm an ignorant person when it comes to the allocation of taxes.

358
00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:16.670
When it comes to town that the uh,
the uh,

359
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.440
citizens paid for the fire department and they all had to kick in something Max

360
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.050
like a voluntary extra cause they weren't making it and White House said no,

361
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.630
I don't know where this was.
They said we just can't afford that extra,

362
00:20:26.631 --> 00:20:27.464
whatever it was.

363
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.400
The house caught fire and the fire department just put out the house that paid

364
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.510
and not the house that didn't pay.
Whoa.
Let it burn to the ground.
Oh my gosh.

365
00:20:35.511 --> 00:20:36.380
I know where that was from.

366
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.240
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

367
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.670
<v 3>So I'm,
we're in America though,
but like this year or last year,
that's fucked up.</v>

368
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.320
That's fucked up.
Where they're like,
nope.
Nothing.

369
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:48.130
A persons house burned to the ground when you could have stopped it.

370
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.830
<v 1>Could they have stopped it?
They could put it out somewhat.
Yeah.</v>

371
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.330
It seemed like that,
I don't want to say they saw it.
Facts.

372
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.500
I mean it could have been just complete coincidence or fucked up Karma,
you know?

373
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:01.960
We don't know.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

374
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.970
It might've been more fucked up by the time they got there.

375
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:07.630
Then the other house that was next to him,
maybe we don't really know.
Right.

376
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:10.120
We're talking shit.
Right.
That was the story though.
I read the story.

377
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.840
That's the problem is talking shit.
We all talk,
we're all talking shit.

378
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.950
There's a doctor that was talking shit on one of the UFC fighters.
What'd he say?

379
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.770
Well,
he's talking about a child son and,
and um,

380
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.470
I think he referenced Frank Mir as well.

381
00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:28.430
And I got into an argument with him about,
um,
on the underground with a,

382
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.630
with people about this argument about this article because he was saying that

383
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.820
these guys that are um,
the,

384
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.980
they need testosterone replacement therapy like that,

385
00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:43.110
it's likely that they abused their body was steroids and that's why the tests

386
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.940
shut down.
Which can be true.

387
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.000
It's absolutely true that that can be one of the reasons is that a lot,

388
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.960
it's only one reason.
Another reason is head trauma.

389
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.640
And for whatever reason this guy didn't,
it didn't factor that in.

390
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.650
You know,
when he's talking about Frank Mir,

391
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.500
he started talking about Frank Mir being 33 years old.

392
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:04.600
What is the average 33 year old need?

393
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:08.290
Testosterone replacement therapy for the amount of head trauma that guy has

394
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:13.291
taken is quite substantial and to not factor that in and just to make an an

395
00:22:13.681 --> 00:22:18.681
assessment on why someone needs and to only go towards the one possible

396
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:22.330
explanation like steroids,
which,
which is the sensationalistic,
uh,

397
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:25.000
explanation that's,
I think that's wrong and it's,

398
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:27.310
it's unfair to characterize fighters like that.

399
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.720
There's guys like James Tony for instance,
who had a real problem.

400
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:35.080
He was,
he had been hit in the head so many times.
It is.

401
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:39.850
Bonnie was like producing no testosterone.
It was trauma related there.

402
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.620
How do those travel or not?
Because they've no,
with him,
with James.

403
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:48.400
Tony didn't have a,
he didn't have a steroid issue.
I don't think it was just,

404
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:49.530
it was head Trump,

405
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.120
I mean steroids and that knocked the testosterone if you want to speak hi.
Yeah,

406
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.670
impact.
Like people have had it from car accidents.
People have had it from,

407
00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.040
there's a lot of studies that have been done on it.
I don't,

408
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.450
I don't want to quote anything,

409
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.450
but I know that there's a guy named Dr. Mark Gordon.

410
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:08.530
He's the guy who works tonnage of you that thinks that fighting should be

411
00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:12.700
illegal.
Not Illegal.
No,
but look,
I don't do it.
I mean,

412
00:23:12.701 --> 00:23:15.890
if you're putting those people in danger like this that you're talking about,
no,

413
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.820
know that it's a choice.
It's a personal choice.
You know?
Look,
I,

414
00:23:19.821 --> 00:23:23.110
I took that choice myself and I knew when I was 21 I was like,

415
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.020
I was in a weird situation.
There was nowhere to go with it.

416
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:30.400
I was competing and taekwondo and then I started kickboxing and once I started

417
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:33.760
kickboxing,
I realize that taekwondo was kind of bullshit.
It was,

418
00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:35.590
there was a lot of holes in taekwondo.

419
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.750
There's a few techniques that are really good,
but the,

420
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:40.950
no punching to the face part with it as much.
The fact you can kick the fence,

421
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.270
Zack kicked the body parts of the body.
The body.
Yes,
yes.

422
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.123
You can punch the body

423
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.380
<v 0>stupid.
You should be able to kick to the face.
No,</v>

424
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:50.690
you can't kick to the legs either.
So you,

425
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.760
you allow people to develop this amazing dexterity with their legs,

426
00:23:55.761 --> 00:24:00.350
this amazing ability to move with their legs and kick the kickers from taekwondo

427
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:03.220
or some of the most spectacular kickers.
But as a punch in the foot,

428
00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.150
exactly as a style,

429
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:08.680
it's all fucked up because it's a wide open the eye,

430
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.690
their idea was that the legs produced the most power.

431
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:14.570
So if you get really proficient at hitting someone with your left,

432
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.260
someone with a leg,
it's way better than getting good at anything else.

433
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.240
So they said just get really good at head kicks.

434
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:24.710
That was the idea of the TACO window guys.
And you know,
they're right man.
Jesus,

435
00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:28.080
sorry,
fuck son doing.

436
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.170
So their idea was that you just had to get really good at kicking.

437
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.780
A lot of people had a bottom wonky ideas about what was the best martial art

438
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.650
because the reality is the only way to tell was he fight.
And if you fight,

439
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:42.200
you're fighting most of the time to death back then.

440
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.850
So it was not a lot of information,

441
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.810
which it wasn't passed down like it is today with the UFC.
You know,

442
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:51.580
I'm sure if you went back in time and watch some fights from like a balance of

443
00:24:51.581 --> 00:24:51.831
the year,

444
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:56.831
so they must have known head trauma coming in and out of this fucking day when

445
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:57.680
you're talking about,

446
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.790
but the people that developed martial arts had developed them in under real hand

447
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:05.660
to hand combat situations.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,
sure.
There was a little training,

448
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:07.070
a little sparring and we'll practice.

449
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.670
Let's see how your Jujitsu helps you when a lion is attacking.
Well,

450
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.240
how about when a guy's coming to fucking raid your village?
Man,
you're,

451
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:18.620
you're fighting to the death.
You know,
a lot of,
uh,
Marshall back there,

452
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.060
a lot of martial arts,

453
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.920
we're sort of stuck in this sort of a period where they couldn't figure out
like,

454
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:27.680
what's the best shit.
Everybody had an argument.

455
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:30.300
Everybody was like really stubborn.
And it was almost,

456
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.730
it got to the point where people weren't even actively trying to find out what

457
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:38.300
the best stuff was.
They would just being zealots towards their style.
Perfect.

458
00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:42.540
Something.
Yeah.
And then use that really well.
Most people.
Yeah.
When I would,
uh,

459
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.300
if I would try to train with someone else,

460
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.070
whether it was karate guys or anyone else,
my instructor would get angry at me.

461
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.430
Acting classes are like that.
We're like,
this is the best training.
Like why?

462
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:56.840
Just because you took it,
you happen to randomly take the best one says,
Ooh man,

463
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.740
say your best is not his best is not,
you know,

464
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.640
there's a lot of different people out there,
folks,

465
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:05.150
and everybody's got a brain and everybody's got an opinion and it's not,

466
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:06.290
you're not wrong or right.

467
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.500
It's just we all have different ways of enjoying this world.

468
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.310
I think it's becoming obvious,
the most important martial art list.
The best.
Well,

469
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:16.340
it's a very important that to get really boring.
Well,
I don't,

470
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.150
I don't agree with that because this guys like Charles Oliveira who's a really

471
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:24.380
bad ass Jujitsu guy.
He'd take him down and he's fucking strangling you.

472
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.400
He strangling you quick.
Really catches guys and triangles like a motherfucker,

473
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:31.820
man.
It's just,
it's going to make guys have a guard.
Like that guy.

474
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:36.340
I got half guard.
Yeah,
exactly.
Like a shoe.
Like a Shinier,
yeah.

475
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.410
Like a guy like that.
It's going to,
it's going to take a guy like that.

476
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.650
Who's the guy that always goes for the fucking lick things.
I'm an Ra.

477
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.610
<v 1>He's terrifying.
Just go look as youtube clicks.
He just,</v>

478
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.850
he just grabs you.
People are standing up over him and all of sudden good.

479
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.520
He is horrifying.
His leg locks are so good.
He just,

480
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.760
he just rips your knee upon it and you don't even have people cripples.

481
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:02.460
People pops her knees apart cause the way here to tap just nope.

482
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.090
Takes you shit apart.
You scream tap at the same time.

483
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.140
There's so many videos of him just screamed.
Tapping people.
Yeah.
Yeah.

484
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.960
He's terrifying to me.
I would not want to roll with that guy.

485
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.880
I get so scared when I see guys going for an ankle locks or knee bars.

486
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:22.030
It's such a fine line between,
you know,
nothing too broken.
Yeah.
It is a,
there's,

487
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.090
especially when it comes to heal hooks,

488
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.300
heel hooks are ridiculously quick to tear and damage.
The,
the,

489
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.080
you don't have much time to fight them off.

490
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.630
Your leg doesn't have much strength in that direction.

491
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.230
And what guy gets your heel under his armpit and he wrenches.

492
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:41.580
He has his legs wrapped around the upper portion of your leg so it isolates your

493
00:27:41.581 --> 00:27:46.110
knee in between his legs and in between your upper arms and your upper arms,

494
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:51.111
have his heel hooked in the crook of your arm pit and you rip his knee apart.

495
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.440
You torque your body,

496
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.160
so body and a twisting action using your legs and your upper body.

497
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.200
It's your whole body against the really sensitive outer area of his joint and it

498
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:05.940
just tears the meniscus apart.
Snaps the ACL.
And how long did that take the hill?

499
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.940
Oh,
it's a fucking forever.
You might not ever be the same guy.

500
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.540
It's such a damaging,
wrenching way of tagging a neopod.

501
00:28:12.541 --> 00:28:14.460
They're going to have to scoop some meniscus out.

502
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.170
They're going to have to reconstruct her ACL.

503
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.590
That'll be six months before you can even roll again.
20 years ago,

504
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:22.650
you're just done.
20 years ago you were done.
My friend Steve Graham,

505
00:28:22.651 --> 00:28:24.480
you know Steve,
I love that dude.

506
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:28.400
He has had some ungodly amount of knee surgeries.

507
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.410
I think it's something like 18 he was on the US ski team back in the eighties

508
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.510
yeah,
that guy's great.
He ripped his knees apartment.
He went,

509
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.850
interviewed him for my podcast,

510
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.600
perfect guy and he told me so much fun stuff about doctors.
Yeah,

511
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.020
he's an awesome guy.
He is a,
I love that guy.

512
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:48.300
He's a one of my favorite human beings,

513
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.300
known him since the taekwondo days when I was a little kid.

514
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.760
He meant was really nice.
It's just nice and calm.
He's the best.

515
00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.090
He's a great dude and he's super intelligent.
He's just a fun guy to talk to,

516
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.070
but he's had a gang,

517
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:05.760
a knee surgeries man from his king and I'm from skiing initially and the way

518
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:09.630
they used to reconstruct the leg was like they would take your hamstring and

519
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:12.570
they would take a big chunk of meat out of your hamstring and then they would

520
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:17.571
open you up like a fish and then they like fucking staple this new piece of meat

521
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:20.140
in place of it.
It didn't always work like that.

522
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.710
It didn't always work and sometimes you know,

523
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:23.800
you would have it for a little while.

524
00:29:23.801 --> 00:29:25.800
It lasts for a little while and then a blow out again,

525
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:27.780
so he'd have to go back in,
they'd have to do it again.

526
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:31.320
So meanwhile they're taking it into that strip off your hamstring and maybe this

527
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:36.170
time it's your placement therapy.
Sort of like that show up.

528
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.870
Like that technology where you want to take a piece of meat from one spot and

529
00:29:39.871 --> 00:29:42.160
move it to another party.
Yeah,
that's essentially

530
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.120
<v 0>what they're doing.
Birth with my first one,
my first one,</v>

531
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:49.830
they took a piece of meat from my patella tendon.
Where's your pants?

532
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:53.410
How to create,
it's the front tendon.
The front tendon is really big.

533
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.950
It's really thick and wine,
so they take a little sliver of that,

534
00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.030
which is all you need for your ACL and they take a big chunk out of your kneecap

535
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:06.031
bone and your shin bone and then they drill holes in Saudi and screw that bone

536
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:10.810
into place.
Who just who?
That's the way to do these things.
Who was that?

537
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.050
Who was that guy that did that surgery?
Awesome,
dude.
Yeah,

538
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.690
it's amazing when you think about it.
I mean it's done now,

539
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:20.500
but who was the fourth test that an animal's fur.
Thank God for fucking doctors,

540
00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:20.770
man.

541
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.790
Thank God for dudes who have figured out how to fucking fix shit and put things

542
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:25.960
back together again.

543
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.310
Doctor Gettleman when he was and he did such a great job with both my knees.

544
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:31.450
He was looking at the MRI.

545
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.450
I tell you this and it's just where it takes you through it.

546
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.510
Three d image of what's going on if you need,

547
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.830
and he's like a see what the torn there we got as a peaceful and just,

548
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.700
it's all the way around.
It's awesome.
How's it,

549
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:42.310
did they have this when you were in medical school?
It was,
no,

550
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.940
it just had the theory of it.
Wow.
He goes,
I had to learn it all like later.

551
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.440
If it makes it so much easier,
that guy get them in,
stitched me up twice.

552
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.220
He did my meniscus on my left knee and reconstructed my right knee.

553
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.330
He's about to do my second.
I mean really,

554
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:02.380
if I lived a hundred years ago it'd be completely useless.
You'd be dead by now.

555
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:05.590
I'd be dead.
Yeah,
probably I would be,
first of all,

556
00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:08.680
I probably wouldn't have done all this stupid shit I did if I didn't think they

557
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:11.500
could fix it.
You know what I mean?
If that was your last straw,

558
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.310
every time I would've been like,
wait a minute man.

559
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.480
Good fucking make me a cripple.
You don't think about that shit though.

560
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:21.520
When you're young,
you don't think about it at all.

561
00:31:21.521 --> 00:31:24.970
I didn't think about anything until the first time I injured myself and I

562
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.180
started and I was like,
Whoa,
I could break my body.

563
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.070
Like I tore my ACL and I was like,
okay,
this is broken now.
Like this.

564
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.080
It was wobbly and shit.
I was like this.
That was a really fucking fucked it up.

565
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.730
You had this thing and you fucked it up.

566
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.820
It's a weird feeling when a part of your body doesn't work anymore.

567
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.910
It wobble and we'd give out on me and I'd be like,
Whoa,

568
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.350
my new reality forever.
Yeah,
so I would wear a knee brace.

569
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.300
Sometimes that would help a little bit,

570
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:54.880
but the reality as it needed to be reconstructed,

571
00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:58.940
it needed to be put back into place like Forrest Gump,
like Forrest Gump,

572
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:03.643
walking around

573
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.430
ACL brace.
It's actually pretty dope.
It's a,
it keeps your,

574
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:16.530
your knee and uh,
you know,
it's like,
it's a hard plastic thing that goes wrong.

575
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.310
Like a shell around your name.
Yeah.

576
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:22.810
It allows some guys who have torn ACL still even put off surgery for a little

577
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:25.540
while,
but eventually you're going to have to get it fixed.

578
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.530
They give you was talking about it keeps scrolling down after surgery.
Uh,

579
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:33.550
what a stocking stocking to keep the compression shorts when you're going to get

580
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:37.120
your knee operated on a week from today.
Fucking animal.

581
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.820
Tell everybody how you injured yourself standing up.
I uh,

582
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:45.230
I made the mistake of changing my shoes.
Then when I stood up was snap fluid.

583
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:50.180
Oh,
they told him he was just cartilage damage,
but she just stood up weird.

584
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.650
Just stood up playing basketball has changed my shoes,
stood up and just felt it.

585
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:58.070
Snap it.
She was saying that she was a failing body.

586
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.760
That's just something that shows it's time to trade it in.

587
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:05.000
So when you should get German engineering.
Yeah.
You know,

588
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:09.710
I just want to say because I'm in this sort of Internet thing about this Dr.

589
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:12.500
Benjamin Guy,
I have no ill will towards this man.
You know,
he uh,

590
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.700
he did write one thing saying that the UFC appeals to racism.

591
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.420
You wrote an article saying that heals to raise hills to racism.
Yeah.

592
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.220
Interesting.
Doctor wrote this.
Yeah.
Why doctor?
That's weird.
Yeah.
I love doctor.

593
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.180
Come on.
Jesus.
Damn good.

594
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.820
You have a mute button on your

595
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:38.720
head or thinks that to call someone like a week ago.
Um,
yeah,
I don't,

596
00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:40.760
I mean I know his argument was really weird.

597
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:44.450
It was at the faces of the UFC are all white and up until a certain amount of

598
00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:46.490
time there was no black ring card girl.

599
00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:50.390
And if that girl went online and saw the horrible things that people write about

600
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:53.930
her,
which is true,
but you know what man,
that's just the Internet.

601
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.800
That's not saying that the UFC appeals to racism.
That's ridiculous.

602
00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.180
Some of their biggest fans.

603
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.030
It was the biggest stars are black that appeals to racists.

604
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:07.250
It's doesn't appeal football,
racists.
It's a pocket court man.

605
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:10.900
It's a sport where you got culture mixing together with young athletes,

606
00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:15.710
sort of burgers and it doesn't,
it's not,
there's nothing racist about it.

607
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.740
You know,
there was no black green car girls.
And what else?

608
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.740
His argument was that all the phases of the UFC were white,

609
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:27.340
meaning me and Dana White and Mike Goldberg and Bruce Buffer that because we're

610
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.010
white and because I,
you know,

611
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.500
I'm not black so I have no idea what it's like to be a black man.

612
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.790
I have no idea what it's like.

613
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:37.280
I have no idea what it's like to experience that kind of racist.

614
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.640
I would never pretend to know it,
but I do.

615
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:42.470
I do know that you could be reaching,

616
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.560
maybe you can hire like Freddy Loc hard on Repatha.
That's region.

617
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.920
I try sometimes when I've right here,
a report or something,
some black professor,

618
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.810
you know,
talking about like how something is racist.
And I'm like,

619
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:53.340
well let me think.
Let me really put myself in the place.
And sometimes I'm like,

620
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.670
yeah,
I can see how that could be bad.
Um,

621
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.670
like the constant demand for birth certificates from Obama and stuff like that.

622
00:34:58.671 --> 00:35:01.970
It's like an stop enough that that can be construed as racism.

623
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.920
There's a guy who I'm hung in effigy of the president.

624
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.630
Did you hear about this fucking thing?

625
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:14.910
Some crazy motherfucker and mortal technique posted it on his Twitter and then I

626
00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:19.070
retweeted it and all these people that have been asking to get immortal

627
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.680
technique in the podcast and I'll get them on settle down what somebody got.

628
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.590
So many people got mad at me on my message board because I wasn't responding.

629
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.740
There's like a million threads on that message board and yeah,

630
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.270
I look at things sometimes,

631
00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:34.010
but sometimes when I get online and and look at things,

632
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.160
I'm in the middle of answering the phone and I'm trying to,
you know,

633
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.100
figuring out what the fuck

634
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.320
<v 1>I'm doing and someone is screaming at me in the background,</v>

635
00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.640
probably get it now when I got more messages and less time to deal with it.

636
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.610
And if it requires any sort of response back,
it's like,
I'll do that later,

637
00:35:47.611 --> 00:35:50.640
which means I might not do it at all.
Just forgot about it completely.
Yeah,

638
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:54.450
you get busy,
man.
Just too busy to do to deal with it,
you know,

639
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.700
so don't get shitty.
Especially people on my message board,
like,
you know,

640
00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:02.370
there was people were saying I was being childish and immature because they

641
00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:06.750
hadn't responded to their request to get it.
Mortal technique.
What does he say?

642
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.740
Huddle down.
That's never even heard of them.
I've heard of him.
I like him.

643
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.130
I like his rap.
You could probably put some of it,

644
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:17.550
you could probably put some of it online or you have a question to put on and

645
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:20.160
it's just like you're not interested.
Should you write back and say no thanks.

646
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:20.611
I mean,

647
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:23.100
I don't think he would be upset if we played a little bit of his music if you

648
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:25.650
want to play some of it.
But uh,
but I like it.
Shit.

649
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.160
He's like really like kind of a political radical,
very,

650
00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:33.090
very intelligent dude I think.
And in really very knowledgeable about like,

651
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:37.270
you know,
a different shit that's gone down in South America.
And I've,

652
00:36:37.271 --> 00:36:40.230
I've seen some of his interviews and,
uh,
he's,
uh,

653
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:44.090
he's a a pretty radical dude.
So,
uh,
I think,
uh,

654
00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:48.630
it'd be a really interesting conversation,
but just stop being conti people.

655
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.980
It's not necessary.
I'm overdoing it today.
Yeah.
I don't know what it is today.

656
00:36:52.981 --> 00:36:56.010
Let them get to you.
I'm so anti country,
but it started with this,

657
00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.270
it started with the goddess not contain all the doctor who I think just what I

658
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:03.030
was trying to say is I'm not black.
I don't know what it's like to be black.

659
00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:03.381
I wouldn't,

660
00:37:03.381 --> 00:37:07.110
it wouldn't imagine what that racism feels like that he must've experienced

661
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:10.140
growing up.
So I would never discount that.
I just say it's reaching.

662
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.130
I say the saying that the UFC appeals to racism is reaching down.
It's crazy.

663
00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:19.020
It's,
it's not right.
My friend Don came from Jamaica when it was 18,
maybe 17.
Uh,

664
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.290
came here.
So he wasn't raised with like the certain type of racism that we have.

665
00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.520
And he said he sees a lot of his friends.
He's racist and sometimes,
but he said,

666
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:29.340
he says a lot of sports claim racism when they're like,
hey,
come on man.

667
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.920
That has nothing to do with race.
Unquestionably happens.

668
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.970
It's unquestionable that people claim racism in an unfair way.
It's,

669
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.040
it's a bounce back.

670
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:41.520
It's a bounce back from the blatant racism of the 50s and the forties and

671
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:42.960
whatever the fuck the,
you know,
the,

672
00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:46.860
the entire generation of his ancestors had to go through.
I look,

673
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:51.270
I'm entirely sympathetic,
but I think as human beings,

674
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:56.130
in order to really grow,
we have to recognize what is and isn't racist.

675
00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.030
This is not racist.
This is not racist.

676
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:03.960
I don't believe the UFC has racist,
believe it appeals to racism.

677
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.160
I think it's a big stretch,
but so that I criticized,

678
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:11.320
I was minor league critical about that.
Really?
I just said it.

679
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.520
I thought it was a silly article and then there's this thing about saying that

680
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:17.400
these guys have done steroids and that's why they're balls of shutdown because

681
00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:20.680
that's not necessarily true.
What are the odds?
What are the percentage odds?

682
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.670
I don't know.
It's very high for a lot of athletes.
Athletics,

683
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.790
if it is very possible,
if you weren't talking about a combat sport,

684
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.000
I would say very likely.
But with a combat sport,

685
00:38:33.001 --> 00:38:34.950
you have to take into factor the very

686
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.220
<v 0>damage that happens to the brain and how that affects your body's production of</v>

687
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.820
testosterone and other hormones.
Human growth hormone,
it's the pituitary gland.

688
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:50.500
Pituitary gland apparently is easily upset by trauma.
And,
uh,

689
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:55.830
when people have had car accidents from trauma or from or from a steroid abuse,

690
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:59.650
stereotypical people who don't do steroids,
like a person in a car accident,

691
00:38:59.651 --> 00:39:04.570
a person with frequent concussions from playing backyard football.

692
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.560
You know,
people like to tell from a fighter who does some steroids.
I say,
well,

693
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:10.360
it's hard.
It's hard with you tell it with,

694
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:12.220
if it's a fighter who does some steroids,

695
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:14.410
cause when you fuck around with steroids,

696
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:17.410
especially if you're someone who's not doing it under the supervision of a

697
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:21.910
doctor and you don't know what you're taking or which most of them aren't.
Uh,

698
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:22.841
if you're,
you know,

699
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:25.870
if you're going to be a young kid and do something illegal like that,

700
00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:28.340
most of the time you're going to probably like get it from some guy.
You know,

701
00:39:28.341 --> 00:39:31.390
what the gym or something shady like that.
But if they,

702
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.380
if they did do it that way,
they could potentially shut down their testicles.

703
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.180
I knew a dude who was like trying to have a,
a kid with his wife.

704
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:44.940
He was like 27 years old and he was always trying to,
could,

705
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:49.270
was a bodybuilder professional bodybuilder.
And he was enormous.
And then,
um,

706
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.070
he was trying to,
um,
uh,

707
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:55.530
have a baby with his wife and he couldn't get pregnant.

708
00:39:55.690 --> 00:40:00.280
[inaudible] shit was done really 27.
They just shut the party down.

709
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:05.350
He overwhelmed his body was so much testosterone in being a pro bodybuilder and

710
00:40:05.351 --> 00:40:08.450
getting fucking monstrously huge.
I'm so jealous.

711
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.540
That sounds like a pro.
It was,
he was enormous.

712
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:18.100
He was enormous.
That guy.
But he had the balls of like a 75 year old man.

713
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:22.210
They were done.
There was no loads.
No swimmies.

714
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:24.430
It just shuts it cause it's like kicking so much that your body's like,

715
00:40:24.431 --> 00:40:25.960
well we don't need this anymore.
We don't need to make it.

716
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:30.310
Your body's completely baffled.
Your body's like,
what the fuck is going on?

717
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:32.470
Why do we have like 10,000 times

718
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.640
the amount of these motherfuckers I around us,
you know,

719
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:38.170
like imagine like what testosterone is.

720
00:40:38.171 --> 00:40:40.720
If testosterone was like thugs in your system,

721
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.950
on each red blood cell or each cell in your body is,
you know,
just uh,
you know,

722
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:48.460
they have different citizens and all of a sudden testosterone comes in.

723
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.420
Just thugs.

724
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:54.421
Just so much angry biker gangs with Mohawks and baseball bats and just

725
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.340
everything else.
Angels Gang.
Just flow.

726
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.730
Looks like that's slipping into your body and that mind movie or I'll come into

727
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:10.980
that village.
Oh,
what was that movie?
Mel Gibson.
Apocalypto.
Yeah.

728
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.090
They just come in and I'll one day,
boom,
that movie was fucking bad ass.
Oh yeah.

729
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:19.060
Mel Gibson is a crazy fuck,
but he knows how to make a movie that wasn't good.

730
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.840
My grandma knows how to make the a bit Braveheart too.
Yes,
he did.
Yes,
he did.

731
00:41:22.841 --> 00:41:24.970
Like he was like produced it or something like fuck.
Yeah.
I think,

732
00:41:24.971 --> 00:41:27.610
I dunno if he wrote it or did.
He had a lot to do with it.
I don't know.

733
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.390
The only one that he'd lost me,
I was the passion of the Christ.
I was like,
okay,

734
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:33.650
well I'm saying that you didn't see it.

735
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.890
<v 3>Oh my God.
It's fascinating.
I had a friend and said it wouldn't,</v>

736
00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.050
it wouldn't go see that or Apocalypto cause Mel Gibson was antisemite,

737
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.430
but he would go and pay for a ticket for happy feet and then walk over to that

738
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:48.080
one.
Ah,
that's hilarious.
Yeah.
Oh that's smart.
That's a good protest.
I liked that.

739
00:41:48.081 --> 00:41:50.580
That seems like a fair protest.
I'll see your money movie,

740
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.640
but you won't get the credit for it.
That's a good protest.

741
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:55.290
I agree with that protest.
You know,
I was like,

742
00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.030
get out of that deal from the antisemites to give it to the happy few people.

743
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.210
I think he's just crazy.
I think that's what it is.
Yeah.

744
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:03.830
I don't think it's an anti Semite.
Oh,

745
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:07.630
I think it's antisemitism is released by his craziness.
Oh yeah.

746
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.400
Like it's already there,
but just like,
just let it go.

747
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:14.060
Really grow up with a crazy dad too.
Isn't his dad like a Holocaust denier?

748
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.770
Something like that.
Something weird like that

749
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.960
sect of the Catholic church or something like that.
Man,
he would just always,

750
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.490
it's weird when you find these guys out to be just funked up regular people.

751
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.100
Yeah.
Somebody said to Mel Gibson,
they were like,
um,
uh,

752
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.520
something like someone compared his behavior to the Holocaust and he goes,
well,

753
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:34.130
let's not deal with hypotheticals.
Why?

754
00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.650
I didn't say that you have there that way

755
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:43.470
you can't say that.
Could you imagine?
Holy Shit.
All the writers would be like,

756
00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:48.860
what could you imagine?
Holy Shit.
That's where

757
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.250
I would love it.
It'd be wrong to say it,
but I'd be like,
oh my God.

758
00:42:55.550 --> 00:43:00.470
And there aren't a blatant like that.
Yeah,
that's ridiculous.
Jesus Christ.

759
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.260
Some people don't believe it happened.
Right.

760
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.300
There was some guy who makes his living as a Holocaust denier.

761
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.310
David something or I forget,

762
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.730
my dad works with the Holocaust museum in DC and he said the guy was trying to

763
00:43:10.731 --> 00:43:13.880
make an appointment to go in there and like check it out so we can deny all the

764
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:17.870
parts of it.
Really?
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

765
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.640
<v 1>Did you ever see that movie?
Uh,
about a guy who he was,</v>

766
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.220
I think it was called Dr Death.
He was a,
I'm a scientist that was uh,

767
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.760
he designed suicide,
uh,
assassination machines,
not assassination.

768
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:35.270
What do you call it if you kill some execution execution machines.

769
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.000
He designed his documentary on that.
Yeah.

770
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:42.710
And they brought him to one of the concentration camps.

771
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.800
I don't remember which one it was,
that,

772
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.210
where they claim to have Gad gas chambers.

773
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:52.211
And he was sort of like lending support to the idea that there was this,

774
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:58.310
these weren't capable of supporting the kind of a gas chambers that were

775
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.640
apparently he got misled this guy and he got used as a pawn in this weird

776
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.170
holocaust sort of it at least,

777
00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.110
I don't know if it's a Holocaust denial movement,

778
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.690
but a minimalizing of the Hawk Cross

779
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.960
<v 3>movement.
A lot of people say that it was like 50,000 people,
something like that,</v>

780
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.900
which is still a staggering number when you think about it.

781
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:21.190
If you thought of 50,000 people,
ten nine eleven's Chu,

782
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.490
<v 1>dude,
it happened just 1940s yeah,</v>

783
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:28.890
1940s millions of Jews were killed.
Wrap your head around that.

784
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.520
What does it awesome?

785
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.600
<v 0>What does that mean?
That he's had is good.</v>

786
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:38.700
That's the only German thing that I know.
How scary with those people.

787
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:41.940
Could you imagine if we were living in that time complete power that could have

788
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:43.770
easily happened during our life.

789
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:48.630
We could have gotten a shit roll the dice and we're fucking plopped out in 1935

790
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:51.270
and you'd be right in the heart of that shit.
When you're a little boy,

791
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.910
it's easily possible.
You,
you are.

792
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:58.650
I easily could have been born into that world as my dad.
It's your dad.

793
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.100
Yeah,
crazy.
You're going to second grade.
Then all of a sudden she'll change,

794
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.160
doesn't you're going to go some work,
some other ghetto.

795
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.180
They were ready for processing,
which Christ,

796
00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.820
<v 5>I've never seen any of their movie or done any like,
I don't know.</v>

797
00:45:12.821 --> 00:45:17.260
It's a zero about the Holocaust is as fucking sad as that sounds.
I like,

798
00:45:17.261 --> 00:45:21.250
what should I teach it in public high school?
Zero.
I don't remember any of it.

799
00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.880
Of course I could probably be sleeping through a lot of,

800
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.500
they might have taught you.
I know that Todd Fitzgerald,

801
00:45:26.501 --> 00:45:30.710
but I didn't read it until like way later.
I remember being

802
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.310
<v 0>in class and we were going over,
uh,
the,
uh,</v>

803
00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:39.140
the concentration camps and they were described in the concentration camps and

804
00:45:39.141 --> 00:45:42.530
they were describing what had happened.
And you know,

805
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.540
this was in the 1980s,
so it was only 40 years later,
40 years later.

806
00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.790
It didn't seem like I was,
I went to school,

807
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.380
I went to high school in [inaudible] 81.

808
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.860
That was my first year in high school for 40 years before there was still going

809
00:45:54.861 --> 00:45:57.050
on.
That's crazy.
So it was,

810
00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.400
it was a weird dark feeling to read that.
I remember reading that and be like,

811
00:46:01.401 --> 00:46:06.380
wow,
that's not that word.
I,
it's probably some of your mom's age was,
yeah.
Well,

812
00:46:06.381 --> 00:46:07.400
my grandfather,

813
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:11.540
my grandfather worked in a factory that made parts for the atomic bomb.

814
00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:15.050
I was like,
uh,
that's like,
that was the big thing around our house.

815
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:19.580
GRANDPA works in a factory that makes a part for the proud of that fuck.
Yeah.

816
00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:22.370
It was like an accomplishment,
right?
Fuck yeah.
They were like,
nobody was like,

817
00:46:22.371 --> 00:46:24.950
what are you doing?
You're going to kill so many humans with that.

818
00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:29.810
You have to sabotage that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They were happy that we won.

819
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:33.370
We dropped it on them.
We won.
Oh,

820
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.320
that's a fucking crazy time.
And that's not that long,

821
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.890
weird moral place to be in to say that it's our country.
So it's good.
It's weird.

822
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.260
The,
it's human.

823
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:47.240
It's weird to get shat out into the world where that's not going on anymore.

824
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.740
But it just went on.
So you,
your piece,
your,
you know,
everywhere you go,

825
00:46:51.741 --> 00:46:53.630
it's peace.
And you know,
I was living in Newton,

826
00:46:53.631 --> 00:46:57.170
Massachusetts and everything's pretty and nice houses and it's a nice

827
00:46:57.171 --> 00:47:00.020
neighborhood.
But the reality is that just,

828
00:47:00.021 --> 00:47:05.021
it was just a few decades ago that we were involved in some crazy war,

829
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:10.450
what they were dropping these things from the sky that harness the power of sons

830
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.900
and they just randomly dropped them down on cities like a socket randomly.

831
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.990
They just decided that's what they're going to use as their target.

832
00:47:20.991 --> 00:47:23.230
I don't know what their logic was.
I think it was just,

833
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:26.740
it's a big city and they knew,
you know,
big enough to make a name,

834
00:47:26.741 --> 00:47:29.030
not the biggest or something.
Or were they giant?

835
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.330
Just don't know about him any more because they've been wiped out.
I don't know.

836
00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.550
Mean maybe it's like,
why wouldn't they drop it right on Tokyo?
I don't know.

837
00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.650
Do people still live there?
Hiroshima there now?
I think so.

838
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.150
It's an habitable again,
I don't know.

839
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:44.130
I don't know how it works with nuclear energy as far as a bomb or what?
What?

840
00:47:44.131 --> 00:47:47.860
You know what carries radiation longer?
I know the nuclear power issue,

841
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:50.530
it's the worst.
Is that the,
um,
the,

842
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:54.940
the waste and the byproducts of the nuclear power that that's it's got,
uh,

843
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.500
it's,
it's toxic for like a hundred thousand years and haven't seen atomic bomb.

844
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:02.650
A nuclear bomb cause some point they just changed the name of that.
Hmm.

845
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.690
<v 5>Adam's Adam Energy and new use.
Nuclear energy.</v>

846
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.240
<v 6>Okay.</v>

847
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.790
<v 0>What do you,
what are you,
who are you?</v>

848
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.580
Who are you and what have you done with Brian?

849
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:16.220
I'm looking over the Stevie wonder.
Look in motherfucker.
I'm trying not to cry.

850
00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:20.440
What did you even say?
Yeah.
What did you say?
Isn't it?
What is the difference?

851
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.610
You know,
Tom?
Yeah.
I mean,
it's a nuclear energy splitting atoms.
I don't know.

852
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:27.370
I'm so stupid for this conversation.
Adam bomb a nuclear bomb.

853
00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.010
They only say we haven't nukes now that nobody could use the word.

854
00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:33.500
Maybe off I go to the Adam bumps face page says also known as the nuclear
button.

855
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:38.730
My space back slash slash also that points from nuclear.com and nuclear.com.

856
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.020
Do I officially need reading glasses?

857
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:49.640
<v 5>Bryant Tuckey knew I knew a imax her out.
What are you thinking?</v>

858
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.250
Or whatever they're called.
We don't even know what's going on.

859
00:48:52.251 --> 00:48:56.450
I was puking all morning,
so I didn't get to see any of it.
So Brian was bullshit.

860
00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:00.320
I think you either work but it got much or something's wrong with the computer.

861
00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:01.590
Cause there's no way you weren't looking at that.

862
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:06.860
I seriously had been puking rail since 10:00 PM last night.
Uh,

863
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.350
but it looks like that just,
I don't know,

864
00:49:09.351 --> 00:49:13.310
it looks like there's a new design with the retina display that's a lot
skinnier.

865
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.620
Yeah.
And it's a lot more expensive.

866
00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.510
Did you got somebody video of the beaten Barack Obama toy?

867
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.970
They're telling the what?
It's Barack Obama,

868
00:49:22.971 --> 00:49:25.930
a windup toy that jerks off.
Oh wait.
Oh,

869
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:30.690
<v 0>okay.
There are different here.
Here's this Obama thing that jerks off.</v>

870
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.250
They're just bright.
It's a little windup tool.

871
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.910
That's ridiculous.
There are a lot of sell that that's ridiculous.

872
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.610
Here's the answer to the atomic nuclear bomb.

873
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.260
A nuclear bomb means that all bombs that perform in a nuclear reaction,

874
00:49:48.261 --> 00:49:51.050
these nuclear bombs are also called thermo nuclear weapons.

875
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:55.880
And atomic bomb is a kind of nuclear bombs and atomic bombs do nuclear fission,

876
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.650
which is more powerful hydrogen bombs.
Oh,
wow.

877
00:50:00.651 --> 00:50:05.400
More powerful hydrogen bomb to do nuclear fusion.
Oh,
okay.
I see.

878
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.860
Uh,
I read the sentence wrong.
Atomic bombs do nuclear fission.

879
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:14.070
While more powerful hydrogen bombs do nuclear fusion and hydrogen bombs can be a

880
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.780
thousand times more powerful than an atomic bombs.
Oh,
okay.
Wow.

881
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.400
So it's a big jump up.
Jesus Christ.
1,000 times more powerful.

882
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.600
That's already pretty powerful.

883
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:27.890
That's so scary that that was,
we shouldn't have that kind of

884
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:31.910
<v 3>destruction.
We shouldn't have that at our fingertips.
I was in class,
I'll,</v>

885
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:32.840
I will not forget this.

886
00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:36.800
I was at Newton south high school in class and the history teacher was telling

887
00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:40.070
us about this shit and he was just weird dude.
Anyways,
real weird guy.

888
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.370
And as he's telling us about this shit and might not even been a history dude,

889
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.250
might have been a science guy.
And I remember thinking like,

890
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:51.050
what the fuck what they dropped one on who?

891
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.220
They just dropped it on the whole city.
I just blew up everyone.

892
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:58.580
Not like the police station.
It's hard to wrap your head around the farm.

893
00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:03.020
Army barracks.
Yeah.
Everyone in the whole study.
Like,
I mean,

894
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:06.410
I don't know how many people died.
Killed the cows to keep,
we're fucked.
Yeah.

895
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:08.810
Everything's fucked.
They just,
it just,

896
00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:14.140
it just dropped down from the sky and literally ended everything that was in

897
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:16.280
front of it.
What is that?

898
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:20.120
I wonder how many people that actually did kill look that up.
Yeah.

899
00:51:20.121 --> 00:51:24.170
We need to find that out.
Kind of horrifying.
Seven.
How many people,
Brian?
Oh,

900
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:28.420
you're one of those guys.
You mother fucker.
You one of those guys.
Um,

901
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:34.390
I wonder,
that's how Robert will remember by his father last night.

902
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:38.780
That was so awkward.
What Robert William Matt provides father's alive.

903
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.620
Then it came in to watch watching last night.
Yeah.
What?

904
00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.720
And they left like walking down the street like,
and he was,

905
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.800
it seemed like he was walking normal and stuff.
It's so weird.
Did you see any

906
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:52.670
hangs out at the comedy store?

907
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:57.671
66,000 people were killed in here of 66,060 6,000 people.

908
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:04.520
What about Nagasaki?
Cause they didn't get the message up to 66,000 no,
I think,

909
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.870
well yeah.
How many Nagasaki is

910
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.660
hundred.
I'm going to read that.

911
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:17.660
I was talking.
One's in a different page.
Let me find this here.

912
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.580
Your phone blows up a lot.
Ari.

913
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.970
Ari is at the COBB's in San Francisco.

914
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:30.320
Cops Comedies Day this Wednesday the 13th and then Sacramento right after that

915
00:52:30.321 --> 00:52:34.040
to the punchline.
I go straight.
Yeah,

916
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:38.300
please come out San Francisco.
Come on out.
You dirty bitches.
30 pitches.

917
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:42.680
I don't want to or it's too far to drive.
You don't have to come fucking drive.

918
00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:46.910
Do.
You can fly.
You could get there if you're close,
you could get there.

919
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.750
We've had people that flew out to the ice house shows for like from England.

920
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.420
Really has a fucking very strange.
It's weird because you're playing,

921
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:55.640
I'm like three days in advance.
Sometimes we don't.

922
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.040
Sometimes we do them like every Friday.
Oh yeah.

923
00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:04.090
80,000 between 60 and 80,000 for the second one in Nagasaki.

924
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:09.680
Yeah.
That's so many people.
So many people.
Holy Shit.

925
00:53:09.681 --> 00:53:12.680
That's scary.
It's just scary that it can happen just like that.

926
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:19.730
That's so many people.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,
that is,

927
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:23.120
man.
If you get 300 people to a club,
you're like,
wow,
nice.

928
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.410
This place is packed.
Yeah.
60,000 yeah.

929
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:32.930
All dead on dead.
It's like that.

930
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:37.740
What the [inaudible] suffering,
right?
They're just done.
Yeah.

931
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:43.110
If you,
I don't think we can really get our head around that pile of people.

932
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:48.060
60,000 I can't.
It's really hard to rectify those.
That's why this Holocaust,

933
00:53:48.061 --> 00:53:52.020
people say it's like a low number,
like that's still a lot of people.
It's insane.

934
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:57.230
It's insane.
It's more than a football stadium and you know what?
There's,

935
00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.530
it's hard to argue that we didn't have to do something to end the war.
You know,

936
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:04.650
when people start talking about well and ended the war and ended saved American

937
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:09.450
lives,
how many American lives that said,
I don't know.

938
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.450
I don't know.
What was the second bottle about?
Yeah.
I don't know.

939
00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:14.010
That's a good question too.
I don't know.

940
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:15.780
I don't have the answers to those questions,

941
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:20.310
but I do know that it worked and that we grew up in a really safe environment

942
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:21.250
because of that,
you know?

943
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.600
But I feel like we're all going to be safer for a little while until it just

944
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:28.650
complete destruction over at once.
You think so?
I mean at that,
if it starts,

945
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:31.110
it's not going to stop you.
Which,
which countries could be like,

946
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.230
let's not get involved.
We'll just let them seeing that we did that,
man.

947
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.480
We're the only country that's ever done that.
Yeah.
And we're like,

948
00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:37.800
we can't trust these other countries.

949
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:42.390
Like we have the only proven track record of not being like trustworthy to have

950
00:54:42.391 --> 00:54:46.900
one.
We certainly can't trust them to,
to drop too.
Yeah.
On Japan.

951
00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.160
So tiny.
Yeah.
Japan's on that bag.
Damn.

952
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:54.740
Japan has had a lot of nuclear shit go down and it's lifetime.
They'll just,

953
00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.650
the lifetime that we know about,
we dropped,
we dropped that stuff on Japan,

954
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.080
then put all the Japanese American citizens,

955
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:04.920
many concentration camps just to like,
yeah,

956
00:55:04.921 --> 00:55:07.190
just got to make sure they look different.
That's why I didn't do the Germany.

957
00:55:07.191 --> 00:55:11.220
It looked the same as us.
Wow.
That's crazy.
And then we can spot them.

958
00:55:11.221 --> 00:55:11.911
It can push them out.

959
00:55:11.911 --> 00:55:14.800
I'm sure Chinese people got put it in there to imagine what it must've been
like.

960
00:55:14.801 --> 00:55:19.320
Don't growing up a German kid in America during World War II guys.

961
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:23.040
Geez,
she has to him on your side here.

962
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.530
Just cause my uncle is fighting over there.

963
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:28.860
Those stupid motherfuckers back then people were so,
hey,

964
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:31.890
so what are you up to air?
What are you up to?
Kraut

965
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.760
those dummies back then.
Yeah,
like what do you mean?

966
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:38.070
Even now when you have better technology,
I have no idea how to,

967
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:41.880
how to help the other side.
Well,
how many people with turbans?

968
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:44.080
How many Sikhs got beat up after nine 11.

969
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:47.230
How many people that had nothing to do with it?

970
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:51.420
It started being an Indian Muslim.
Indian.
Exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.

971
00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:55.110
They're like,
what are you talking about?
I don't mind to racism.

972
00:55:55.111 --> 00:55:58.470
Just let it be about the thing I'm in.
People are so dumb.

973
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.930
There's so many dummies out there,
man.
We've got so many domains.

974
00:56:01.931 --> 00:56:04.560
It's weird though.
I get it though.
That week after nine 11,

975
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:07.350
whenever you saw like an American flag waving or something or heard the national

976
00:56:07.351 --> 00:56:11.220
anthem,
you get all choked up.
I didn't,
I got creeped out.
Oh,
I would get,

977
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:15.210
when I saw the baseball games stuff,
I was like,
I don't know.
Get to me.
I,
um,

978
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.980
I'll tell you what happened to me,
man.
I,

979
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:20.970
I remember thinking right away that like,
you know what?
All right,
Holy Shit.

980
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:24.550
Some shit is going down.
You know,
this is why we have a strong military

981
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.640
<v 0>and they're going to stop all this fucking thing.
But then,
you know,</v>

982
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.770
as things sort of settled in,

983
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.690
what really got me disturbed the most was that all of a sudden I saw American

984
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:39.460
flags everywhere,
everywhere,
and I,
it sounds ridiculous,
but I just,

985
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:43.150
I remember thinking they could get these fucking people to do anything right
now.

986
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.850
Oh yeah.
I just thought of,
it's like,
wow,

987
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:49.830
it's so nice to all get behind each other in times of crisis.
This is what they,

988
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:54.640
you know,
if you want to believe neo-con conspiracy theories,
that's the,

989
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:59.641
the scariest one of all is that they had said that they need a Pearl Harbor,

990
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.580
a Modern Day Pearl Harbor in order to get us into Iraq.

991
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:07.750
This is a statement that someone had said before September 11th ever happened.

992
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.520
When you start thinking about that,

993
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:12.760
that kind of shit really freaks me out and blows my fucking,

994
00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.200
when they realize they can get stuff done.
When I,

995
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:20.140
when I saw all those flags,
when even I remember thinking,
yeah,

996
00:57:20.141 --> 00:57:21.700
it does feel good to be American.
Yeah,

997
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:23.500
I do believe this is the greatest country of all time.

998
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:27.370
But if you let these mother fuckers know that you're their bitch like this,

999
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:29.790
they're gonna drag us into something.
You know?

1000
00:57:29.791 --> 00:57:33.880
You all of a sudden are just fucking,
I'm ready to go gung Ho and ready to go.

1001
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:35.560
You gotta be careful.
Easy.
Why?

1002
00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:38.230
Why is anybody blowing up the fucking towers in the first place?

1003
00:57:38.231 --> 00:57:40.700
Why are they mad at us?
What the fuck's going on?
You know,

1004
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.760
I'm just getting mad at us because they hate our ways.
Like what does that mean?

1005
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:50.150
Who's that angry over our ways.
It's ridiculous.
What are you ever wait?

1006
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.680
Someone's England.
So our ways of not being where we,
you know,

1007
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:54.660
being where we're not supposed to,

1008
00:57:54.661 --> 00:57:57.460
but that's the stuff they don't really care that we're not that were,

1009
00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:59.440
that were pagans.
It's how it's always been.

1010
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:02.410
It's like it's all done under the guise of protection.
You've been in Brazil?

1011
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:06.040
Yeah.
You're kidding me.
Like they don't care about that stuff.

1012
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:10.600
What do they care about that were in there?
I don't know,
man.
I don't know what,

1013
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.580
how,
how they keep this hustle role and

1014
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.240
it's quite impressive.
You know,

1015
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:20.350
it's quite impressive and now everyone's got to go to work and just deal with

1016
00:58:20.351 --> 00:58:22.570
the day to day stuff.
Most people don't have time to deal with me,

1017
00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.370
like saying what's up?
We're way too busy.
It's just a,
it's you wonder,

1018
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.550
you know,
there's so much shit's getting stirred up overseas.
You know,

1019
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:34.330
like a wonder how's it ever going to smooth out that was the world ever going to

1020
00:58:34.331 --> 00:58:37.390
come to peace?
How is Europe going to get his economic shit together?

1021
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:41.680
How is that gonna Fall Middle East?
Like what do they have to do to get it right?

1022
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.310
And I was like,
man,
you know what?
Honestly,
I can't see a way we could.
They do.

1023
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:49.570
What could they do?
It's going to take decades.
It's going to take generation,

1024
00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:54.060
much generations teaching less hate through each one are together and it's going

1025
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:54.903
to help them the most.

1026
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:59.110
[inaudible] the Internet is going to help them because time and time again,

1027
00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:02.320
they're going to realize that,
oh,
this is just something that you know,

1028
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:04.980
someone believes in and someone has it created.

1029
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:08.020
That's what took it off the Internet end and then it was done.

1030
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:11.380
Really shouldn't have to that people saw what was out there.
Dude,
when they,

1031
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.220
when that guy fucking stabbed a stick up,

1032
00:59:14.221 --> 00:59:18.730
his ass was stabbing his asshole with a stick in it.

1033
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.010
I don't think it was a band that was it.
A man that was a knife attached to.
I

1034
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.360
<v 3>thought they said it was a stick.</v>

1035
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:28.370
I'm sure the Internet will tell up close to something like,
did that dude,

1036
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:31.520
I gotta go pee out of my penis.
Okay,
go ahead.

1037
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:36.080
How would you a type that in on Google?
What did Kadafi have stuck off his ass?

1038
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:41.110
He asked that,
but stamp copy.

1039
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:48.070
This is one that you don't even need butthole.
Fort Brian into it.
Hm.

1040
00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.470
Uh,
wow.

1041
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:57.080
Gadhafi sodomized in his last moments.

1042
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.770
I felt like I sat in my eyes last night.
Yeah.
You last night,
you,
uh,

1043
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:06.920
had some bad Sushi and my frame.
What's happening,
what happened to you?

1044
01:00:06.921 --> 01:00:08.690
You got this sickness is the worst too.

1045
01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:11.840
It was one of those where you're shitting and then you need to puke.

1046
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.360
And so I didn't want to puke in my bath tub,

1047
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:18.500
so I had to like stand up real quick and turn around and then puke on my shit.

1048
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.970
And that's the worst.
Oh you pooped.
And then you had to puke on top of your poop.

1049
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.820
Whoa.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,

1050
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.890
ass smell to that.

1051
01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.450
And then I would go to sleep cause I,
I was shy.
I was freezing.

1052
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:36.860
It was like I was in sweatshirts and like blankets around me and stuff like
that.

1053
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:40.990
And then suddenly I start getting really hot and sweaty and I wake up and then I

1054
01:00:40.991 --> 01:00:42.320
was like,
oh my God,
I have to puke again.

1055
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:44.750
And I would stand up real quick and then I'd stand up too quick.

1056
01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:48.380
So I'd get fainty and then I'd have to lay down while puking on my bathroom

1057
01:00:48.381 --> 01:00:52.040
floor about puking on my,
on my face.
It was.
It was the most,

1058
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.950
it was the most disturbing horror movie I've ever seen in my life.

1059
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.820
Okay.
It was a stick.
It was thick.
It was a stick up his ass.
They got those pants.

1060
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.960
Well actually some people were saying it could be a stick or could be a knife or

1061
01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:07.220
it could be the end of a gun.

1062
01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:12.221
It's very blurry but more it seems like more people think it's a stick.

1063
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.600
This is a good investment.
Makes Sense.
You know why?

1064
01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:16.430
I think it's a stick cause he's still standing.

1065
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.600
I got get the guys like trying to shove the stick up his ass.

1066
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:24.230
Whereas if it was a knife,
if I didn't want,
the guy would be in massive agony.

1067
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:27.410
Somebody said like,
how did he shock that?

1068
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:28.850
It was just like it was already been stabbed a bunch.

1069
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.950
That was the weird moment when they caught him alive.
I was like,

1070
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:33.850
they caught him alive and then he was dead.
I was like,
hmm.

1071
01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.100
It feels not as satisfying.
Reeling.

1072
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:38.980
I was looking at satisfying.

1073
01:01:38.981 --> 01:01:43.470
That's the best way a guy like that could ever get it.
The guy would suppress.

1074
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.890
The people forever and they finally get ahold of them.

1075
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:49.280
They can't believe they actually have them.
They're going nuts.

1076
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:53.450
They're shooting the fucking air and then they stab him in the ass with a stick

1077
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:55.700
and then they fall.
Shoot him in the chest.
Are you kidding?

1078
01:01:55.701 --> 01:01:58.610
That's the most satisfying way that guy out it seems like,
all right.

1079
01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.290
Put it before stats.
I guess.
You're right.
It doesn't do anything better.

1080
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:06.170
They'd have to kill him,
right?
Yeah,
and who knows what they're going to find out.

1081
01:02:06.171 --> 01:02:09.840
If they do put them in front of that,
we might not even want to know.
You know,

1082
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.230
we might not even want to protect these generals or something like what,

1083
01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:16.970
what involvement our country's had with him and we'd always want to know,

1084
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.040
oh,
I think most people would sleep better if

1085
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.820
<v 0>they didn't know.</v>

1086
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.360
They didn't know the shit that we have to do just to keep this country running.

1087
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:30.000
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
I'm sorry.
I was careful about that.

1088
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.910
The other weird thing is though,
everybody's always been scared.

1089
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:37.710
I was listening to these tapes.
It was a hunters Thompson lecture from Boulder,

1090
01:02:37.711 --> 01:02:42.450
Colorado.
In the 70s.
And it's fun.
It's fun to listen to him.

1091
01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:45.930
He's a fun guy,
you know,
and I love her,
his,
uh,
his writing.

1092
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.260
So I always enjoyed hearing.
I'm getting interviewed,

1093
01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.620
but it was interesting that in 1970 when this was going down,

1094
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.360
whenever he had this interview,
um,
that was a long ass time ago.
Man,

1095
01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.140
who's,
you know,
talking about it dissolve.
The country's going to shit,

1096
01:03:01.141 --> 01:03:04.320
everything's falling apart.
And I guess he's right.
I mean,
it may be,

1097
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:06.570
it's a slow slide.
I heard something recently,

1098
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.240
anything that was invented after you hit 35 is ruining everything.

1099
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.810
You just can't accept this new technology in your life.

1100
01:03:15.811 --> 01:03:18.450
And it's always been that way and it always will be that way.

1101
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:22.660
That's a good point.
I don't buy it,
but that's funny.
I mean,

1102
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:26.910
I don't want to accept the Internet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
John Anthony West,

1103
01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:31.650
that Egyptologists Dude,
very controversial,
uh,
episode of the podcast,
by the way.

1104
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:36.030
Lots of chatter on the Internet.
Um,
anyway,
uh,
he,
uh,

1105
01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.170
that I could barely explain fram damn.
How key could see yes,

1106
01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.570
you had to go to Ustream.
I had to like spell it out,

1107
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:47.040
so really there's a link on my Twitter.
Go check that.
I couldn't do that.

1108
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.580
That bathroom fan sound that was going through the whole exhaust computer.

1109
01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:54.380
He had like a fucking 1984 at HP.
Yeah.

1110
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.940
With his crazy fan that would kick in.
I mean,

1111
01:03:56.941 --> 01:04:00.470
I've never had a cool him off the fan.
Yeah,
of course.

1112
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:05.230
It was ridiculous.
And that the advents in those,
yes.
To let the fan.
Yeah.

1113
01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.900
Shout yeah.

1114
01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:11.400
A lot of dudes had a water cooled machines to the slaughter and your computer.

1115
01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:15.150
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had one of those for a while,
but it kept fucking up.

1116
01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:19.050
Man Just wouldn't work.
Right.
I had to get it repaired and then I gave it to you.

1117
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:21.870
Right.
Or give it to you or.gov document went off with it.

1118
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.630
That was when I was trying to clear myself of gaming equipment too.

1119
01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.390
That's what you do.
You're like,
I can't trust myself.
Just get it away.

1120
01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.000
Just fucking,
I had a separate myself.
I your question go.
It's about,

1121
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:36.210
do you think people can outgrow and addiction,

1122
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.160
like have it less than in their older age,

1123
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.870
in the way that just like you were like super addicted to gaming and then at

1124
01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:44.700
some point you're like,
no,
I can handle this now.
Well,

1125
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:49.320
you know the alcoholics anonymous people have one very good point in that what

1126
01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:54.060
you do is you sort of separate your yourself from this one addiction that you

1127
01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:58.320
have and get addicted,
addicted to something positive instead.
You know?

1128
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:02.340
So it's like you have to have,
like for me,

1129
01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:05.490
I have to have something that I'm obsessed with our half day.

1130
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:10.970
I would prefer it to be life before it to be the intricacies of the universe and

1131
01:05:11.311 --> 01:05:15.360
the weirdness of the quantum world and the fucking strangeness of Outer Space

1132
01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:17.800
and Bacteria on life.

1133
01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:21.400
And I would prefer that to be what I'm fascinated by all the time.

1134
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.840
But every now and then something will divert my attention and I,

1135
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.560
my fucking stupid brain.
Someone's Twitter.
Well,
it could be that,
but that's just,

1136
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:33.040
that's just fun.
That's like sport or like what the stupid,

1137
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:36.790
like a game video games.
You know,
video games are big one.

1138
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:39.360
Jujitsu could be a big one.
She just as hard because of the fee,

1139
01:05:39.361 --> 01:05:40.660
it's so physically demanding.

1140
01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.400
It's hard to really get addicted to something you can play for 10 straight
hours.

1141
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.490
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
Video Games are fucking incredible,
man.

1142
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:52.900
Video Games today,
there's so involving,
you know,
there's so much to them.

1143
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.800
I feel like it's possible.

1144
01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:55.870
It'd be less than to have your addictions lessened over time.

1145
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.240
Just like just calming down in general.
Just saying like everybody,

1146
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.190
like everybody didn't know you.
I know it's not addiction,

1147
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:03.370
but we'd get tanked every Friday and Saturday or not.
Yeah.

1148
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.430
And then at some point people sort of grow up and they stop needing that.
Well,

1149
01:06:06.431 --> 01:06:09.340
I think so many people,
when you know,
you growing up,
especially,

1150
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:13.690
you're just so wound up and confused and you don't know what the fuck the future

1151
01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:17.210
holds and you can't even believe you're away from your parents yet.
No.

1152
01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:20.550
And you're drinking,
man,
you want a fucking woo.
You want to,

1153
01:06:20.551 --> 01:06:24.580
you want to be a goddamn person.
You know?
We're all suppressed by our parents,

1154
01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:28.810
except for Brian.
Brian was just loner free in the world.
He's sleeping.

1155
01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.470
He's just to eat shit til we can put Brian [inaudible].

1156
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.770
Brian,
are we doing a show at the ice house Wednesday night?
I have no idea.

1157
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:44.360
I say yes.
I say yes.
Let's make this happen.
I'll find the ice house ones.

1158
01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:46.660
Then I bill burns doing the podcast Wednesday too,

1159
01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:50.260
so I'll have him come down to the ice house before and we'll do that.
Stay.

1160
01:06:50.261 --> 01:06:52.480
You heard it ladies and gentlemen.
Boom.

1161
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.870
That's as crazy as it gets and I'll be in nor cal this weekend.

1162
01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:57.860
This whole weekend.
Yeah.
What are you doing?

1163
01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.140
You're doing cobb's on Wednesday night.

1164
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:03.790
I send you straight to Sacramento to the punchline.
Oh shit son.

1165
01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:08.700
That Sacramento punchlines bad ass.
That's a great club.
It's a cooling.

1166
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:13.330
It's perfect.
Perfect sized.
And they've got that outlet store.
I forget what now.

1167
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.350
It was like Neiman Marcus outlet or someone of those.
That's a Nordstrom rack.

1168
01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:19.740
That's what,
that's a shady little area though.
Yeah,

1169
01:07:19.741 --> 01:07:21.880
but now that 24 hour Starbucks that you love so much.
Yeah,

1170
01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.150
but that walk across the store feels dark.
Yeah.

1171
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:28.360
That walk across the street from the hotel to the,
to the comedy club.

1172
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:31.060
I saw somebody in Sacramento that's like a mathy area.

1173
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.150
We saw somebody was in the car with all of us,

1174
01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:37.900
but we saw somebody sitting on an embankment pissing like,
like up,

1175
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:41.910
like in an arc and then just running his hand through the,
and I'm like,

1176
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:45.640
wow.
Like it was like fire that he couldn't,

1177
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.710
you know how you run your hand over a flame?
Yeah.

1178
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:51.310
So he was doing that over the as if the piste wasn't touching his hand.
Wow.

1179
01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:54.460
But it was,
it was just pissing on his hand and the ground in front of them.

1180
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:58.150
That's ridiculous.
We tell the guy just like walking,

1181
01:07:58.151 --> 01:08:01.300
it was like 72 but just covered in sweat.
Oh,

1182
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:06.930
I forgot about that.
Mathie Mathie it's just math.
Yeah.

1183
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.640
There's some mathy Spock's man.
You know,

1184
01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:13.780
cause a lot of those weird California towns on the way to Vegas where you could

1185
01:08:13.781 --> 01:08:15.950
just take a,
you know,
let's go see there's food this way.

1186
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.160
<v 3>You know,
take a little ride off the highway.</v>

1187
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.790
I think I might start renting a car when I go to these places.
They're,

1188
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.850
they're not that expensive.
In Columbus.
My car was,
uh,
how much?

1189
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.380
$19 or $11 a day for the cheapest car.
Yeah.
And it's like,
all right that,

1190
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:35.040
that'll let me be mobile enough that I could go downtown Sacramento or like that

1191
01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:39.500
instead of being stuck in an area,
I always run a car.
Yeah.
It's worth it for me.

1192
01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:43.560
I just,
I don't,
I don't want to have to deal with being stranded.
I always,

1193
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.280
let's get out of here.
Okay.
Is escalades are expensive,

1194
01:08:50.610 --> 01:08:55.610
but you don't trust that he's got diarrhea and you say chest as far as like a

1195
01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.090
you son,
I'm going to ruin your underwear.
That's about what's going to happen.

1196
01:09:01.091 --> 01:09:02.780
The son of a bitch

1197
01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.750
never trust they got a man tampon in,
so just have to change that.

1198
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.660
How dare you?
How dare you?

1199
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.270
Oh my God,
I love my new car.
I got that Volkswagen beetle.
Yeah.

1200
01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:19.880
I didn't know that.
The Volkswagen beetle has the engine in the front now.

1201
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:24.050
It's cool looking car.
Have you seen it?
The beetle as soon as the cool.

1202
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.210
It's a dope little car man.
I'm like,

1203
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:31.150
that seat is surprisingly roomy as the old design.
They redesigned it and it,

1204
01:09:31.151 --> 01:09:32.380
cause I guess they,

1205
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.450
the old one used to have like a flower pot where you a little flower in it.

1206
01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:38.840
And I was like,
he designed for girl a vase.

1207
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:43.550
Like it was totally designed for girls and that's why I never really liked the

1208
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:44.091
beetle before,

1209
01:09:44.091 --> 01:09:46.460
but they redesigned it this year and they're trying to make was optional.

1210
01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.470
You have to get the,
why don't we all start saying,

1211
01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.050
why don't we all sorts say so the new one that I got,

1212
01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:57.170
it looks like a Porsche though.
Like in the inside.
Like it's very racy.

1213
01:09:57.171 --> 01:09:58.840
And what kind of containers does it have inside?

1214
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:02.420
It didn't have any of those vegetables.
Can you grow inside the car?
It doesn't,

1215
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:06.200
it just has a peacock feather tickling the balls with,
oh,

1216
01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:08.260
we had peacocks where I grew up and uh,

1217
01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.400
we had this lattice work in this coop that we had.

1218
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.350
Maybe I'll get two peacocks and a bunch of chickens

1219
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:17.210
and they would stick their head through the lattice work to eat the grass right

1220
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:21.380
outside.
And the foxes would just wait for it and swipe no head.

1221
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:25.280
So you'd find all these things with like no heads,
bodies head's gone.

1222
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:30.080
Balis was inside or bloody buried it in the back.
Wow.

1223
01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.900
There is all that.
I grew up in the farm.
I grew up in the suburbs.

1224
01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.740
They ate flamingo heads.
Bigdog peacock heads,

1225
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.390
Flamingo Flamingo.
That'd be weird birds,
man.

1226
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:43.490
That is why did we know what,
what?

1227
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.200
You know what caused them that developed and just the male to female,
right?

1228
01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:49.850
That's not,
I leave,
it's the male,

1229
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:52.400
the male to attract a female to attract the female.

1230
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:56.880
Can you just make a smell or something?
Fucking you put on a dope bash,
show that,

1231
01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.350
but that's
when I saw,

1232
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:05.380
I once saw a drunk semi homeless guy outside the s the saddle ranch at like one

1233
01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:09.320
30 in the morning.
And he was just like dancing or the drunk drunk dad.
Yeah.

1234
01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:11.470
It could be Hobo could not be.
And I'm like,
Oh,
you're,

1235
01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:16.170
you're peacocking they're trying to attract a mate right now and the only method

1236
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:20.550
you have.
Yeah,
that's what they look at.
What it's trying to do.

1237
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:24.560
Something to shine.
Yeah.
But the peak guy puts up this crazy fee.

1238
01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:28.980
Look at me.
Look how pretty you make a noise too.
I saw a Pika again,

1239
01:11:28.981 --> 01:11:31.650
a fight with a bumper.
Like attack her bumper.
Yeah.

1240
01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:36.360
It was a chrome bumper and he thought the promos another peacock fucking idiot

1241
01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:41.710
and make this road noise.
Donk donk just get smashed himself.
He,

1242
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:46.560
he dunked the bumper a couple times.
I couldn't figure out why.

1243
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:49.580
You know,
it was like a truck bumper.
So it was a pretty wide bumper look.

1244
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:50.280
A little,

1245
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:54.480
a little mirror coming out of him every time he headbutted his fucking mirror a

1246
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:57.930
few times a pecked at it.
It was just his instinct and he's like,
you win.
Yeah.

1247
01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:01.380
It's like not like that peacock in another dimension that's trapped inside.

1248
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:02.730
This mirror was fucking with them.
Also,

1249
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.160
the only way he would have read bad vibes and that peacock is if they were

1250
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:10.020
coming off himself.
That's right.
Yo maybe fast.
Right?
Yo and you pointed others,

1251
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:13.380
you'll go three fingers are pointing back at you.
I smell fear.
Desperation.

1252
01:12:13.381 --> 01:12:17.730
Y'All ain't even son.
I should've listened to you.
You guys.

1253
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:22.710
Did you show yourself?
Can I get him to the bathroom?

1254
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.460
You settled down.
You need to go to the bathroom.
I think I have a pretty good,

1255
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:29.580
it'd make poopy expected him pretty good.

1256
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:33.930
It's not talking about that anymore though.
Okay.
Silly Bitch.

1257
01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.190
Uh,
I listen to the recording from my city finally.
Yeah,
I'm scared.

1258
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:41.730
It's actually like a month.
Oh yeah.
It's weird.
Right?
Cause it is what it is.

1259
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:43.970
Right?
I'm so,
I was like,
felt like that's good.
But that might,

1260
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:48.460
but if I hear it and it's not,
I'll be just be so disappointed.
That's good.

1261
01:12:48.461 --> 01:12:51.700
And I look and the other sets,
the first set,
I thought it was like worthless.

1262
01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:55.770
It was like,
oh,
this is actually really good.
I always member like the last tower,

1263
01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:59.730
right?
Like end or just certain moments or one person's face,

1264
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.720
you know,
it makes me feel like
it just gets in your head.
So you're,
that's,

1265
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:09.090
it's weird.
Are you left with one memory of something?
Like what?
Well,

1266
01:13:09.091 --> 01:13:09.481
they did this.

1267
01:13:09.481 --> 01:13:13.140
I remember having a tape I open predict Johansen once or did a guest spot.

1268
01:13:13.141 --> 01:13:16.200
I believe I opened for him and I'm remembering,
I was like,
fuck,

1269
01:13:16.201 --> 01:13:18.750
that was a bad crowd.
And then heard the tape after the full tape,

1270
01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:22.290
I'm gonna get a tape change and it was kill,
kill,
kill.

1271
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.260
And then the last joke just was like,
so,
so,

1272
01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:26.940
and I just felt like what a wasted opportunity.

1273
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.320
But I forgot all about the first part of it.
Yeah.
When I say,

1274
01:13:30.321 --> 01:13:32.820
remember that last part,
if I have a joke that eats a dick,

1275
01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.770
that's all you sound wrong.
I already know the other jokes are good,

1276
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.170
but it's like infectious.
It applies to the other jokes now.

1277
01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:43.980
It's just a shitty set.
Well,
they hate it cause you don't ever want to be that.

1278
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:47.710
You don't ever want to have a set that's that sloppy or that's that,
uh,

1279
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.680
for failure.
You don't want to have a set where,
uh,
a joke,
major bombs.

1280
01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:57.030
It's like,
dammit.
Like,
especially if it's like,
as they were like,
great job.

1281
01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:59.280
You're like,
yeah,
but you didn't see,
what about the middle two minutes?

1282
01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.630
Look for when you're first creating a bit and um,

1283
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:07.130
you have like sort of a set order where you did the way you do the bit what

1284
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:07.480
folks,

1285
01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.260
a lot of folks who understand Ari and I have a real similar writing styles in

1286
01:14:11.261 --> 01:14:12.430
that we

1287
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:13.001
<v 0>do a,</v>

1288
01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:16.060
we have like a concept of shit and then a lot of times we just work it out on

1289
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:18.730
stage.
I feel like there's definitely weaknesses to that.

1290
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.070
I mean not being prepared as weak but like,
uh,

1291
01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.040
but I think it adds a sense of like,

1292
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:27.340
this is just me talking to you guys right now because you don't have to set or

1293
01:14:27.341 --> 01:14:31.240
it doesn't sound like,
so I was at the store today and I,
you know,
I think it's,

1294
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:36.130
I think it's good to do.
It's certainly good to write a,
I'm a big proponent of,

1295
01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:37.720
of actually just sitting down and writing.

1296
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.410
But I also think is also think it's good to fuck around on stage with an idea

1297
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:46.300
because it kind of under the gun.
Yeah.
You're already [inaudible] groove.

1298
01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:50.110
You already got people laughing at you and it's like you'll find the jokes in

1299
01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:50.410
there,
man.

1300
01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:54.040
Just let them empty yourself and find the jokes in there and now they're there.

1301
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:55.720
They're there,
they're there because you've already,

1302
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:59.230
you've already got the framework.
There's that moment of like of like a,

1303
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.030
and if people talk about this,
you know,

1304
01:15:01.031 --> 01:15:02.680
but it's like there's that moment of like,

1305
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:07.240
oh that needs a better laugh and you have a two second window in order to get

1306
01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:08.600
that laugh when you have one.

1307
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:13.210
But now it's like your brain is just overdrive all hands on deck.

1308
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:17.410
Let's get something heavy known then and just nail it.
Oh yeah.
And you're like,

1309
01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:19.240
that's keeping,
and you're like,

1310
01:15:19.241 --> 01:15:24.040
thank God I recorded this so I can go back and listen to that shit so many
times.

1311
01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:27.000
It's like a lot of the lines and we'll come to you when you're discussing,
uh,

1312
01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:31.030
like if,
if you put yourself under the gun like that,
you,
you,
you,
those,

1313
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:34.090
those lines,
they almost looked like gifts from the universe.

1314
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:37.570
It's like sometimes you'll say them and they'll come out as if you would

1315
01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:42.571
rehearse them as if you plotted it out and then it starts sounding worse.

1316
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:44.770
You know,
like,
let me go back to that first time I did it.
Yeah.

1317
01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:47.800
That's the problem though.
When when when I was kind of saying is like you'll,

1318
01:15:47.801 --> 01:15:51.420
you'll have a joke and you'll have a new joke and then you,
when you,

1319
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:54.940
when you start using it,
it becomes like sort of a tool in your act.

1320
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:57.760
At least for me it does.
And then I started fucking around with it.

1321
01:15:57.761 --> 01:16:00.640
Like how can I make this tool work better?
Well,
I might fuck up the tool.

1322
01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:04.240
I'm trying to make it work better.
I might break the tool.
I might go,
oh,

1323
01:16:04.241 --> 01:16:07.540
I can't say it that way because then this is make,
oh yeah,
exactly.

1324
01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:09.940
You mess up something else.
And so then I'll have to,
you know,

1325
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:13.960
then you have to correct.
I hate,
I don't like that when no one does.
When you,

1326
01:16:13.961 --> 01:16:14.351
when you,

1327
01:16:14.351 --> 01:16:17.770
I know you're just like me and that when people actually pay money to see you do

1328
01:16:17.771 --> 01:16:18.604
stand up,

1329
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.390
you want to be on the best fucking show you can put on because I think we're

1330
01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:26.140
both kind of blown away that people would pay to see us talk.
Yeah.
Every time

1331
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.690
I,
plus we've both done clubs for so long and then it's almost like,
you know,

1332
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:33.490
you can just get this for free every night.
Like we don't,

1333
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:35.230
but you can't really write.
They can't.

1334
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.450
Like I remember David Taylor had to explain to us like,

1335
01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.420
you know those free comedy star passes to other people,

1336
01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:44.350
that's actually worth something to us.
It's just stuff to put in your joints.

1337
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:47.140
Well they're like,
yeah,
the store is going to use it.

1338
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.820
The stories are real unusual example as is the seller and you know as as the

1339
01:16:51.821 --> 01:16:56.230
Improv on Melrose do so few clubs,
but it's like,
like man,
the store,

1340
01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:59.540
especially because the store doesn't do weekly headliners,
you know,

1341
01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:03.640
almost every other club does weekly headliners except actually I guess the laugh

1342
01:17:03.641 --> 01:17:06.200
factory.
They don't really do that.
I write,

1343
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.650
they have a weekly headliners situation when they have a market now.

1344
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.690
<v 3>So they have a showcase show very similar to the comic store show on Friday and</v>

1345
01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:16.450
Saturdays.
Yeah,
that's,
I think just ongoing.

1346
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.570
They'll have like a few different shows,

1347
01:17:17.571 --> 01:17:19.810
like you've got to clear out after awhile,
but in profit on that too,

1348
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:22.860
they clear out.
But the comedy store keeps it running.

1349
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:24.230
They're the only one that keeps it running.

1350
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:29.210
It's just really interesting and it creates an environment like no other because

1351
01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:29.590
you may,

1352
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:33.410
they very well go on stage at one o'clock in the morning to a group of people

1353
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:36.170
that have been there for five hours.
Yeah.
So tired.
And you're like,

1354
01:17:36.171 --> 01:17:38.040
why isn't this one?
It's like too,
there's another way to,

1355
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:43.250
it's so hard to connect with them at that stage.
It's,
it's a very,
um,

1356
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:45.400
it's a,
it's like running with weights on,

1357
01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.770
that's why everyone who comes out of there sounds like there really legitimately

1358
01:17:48.771 --> 01:17:50.930
talking to you because you have to be that connected.

1359
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:53.310
It's so hard to do a bit late at night.
Yeah.

1360
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:56.750
You know one time it's got to sound like you talk.

1361
01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.480
A lot of my favorite things about going to the comic store,

1362
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.740
I don't think I've ever talked to about this,

1363
01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.490
was that a Paul Mooney did not like me when he first met me.
Really?

1364
01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.510
He didn't talk.
He didn't,
it didn't not like me.
He just didn't take to,

1365
01:18:09.511 --> 01:18:12.590
it just didn't,
it just wasn't,
it wasn't cool to me for,

1366
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:16.310
I remember introducing them and I don't remember how I introduce him and I gave

1367
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:19.450
him this really nice introduction and when he wasn't flowery enough for him,

1368
01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.190
he looked at me like,
oh fucked up when it may is my act.

1369
01:18:22.191 --> 01:18:25.820
I Dunno who the fuck you know,
who the fuck knows whatever it was.

1370
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.370
But when I first,

1371
01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:33.320
I don't know what the word the phrase gained his respect or got them to laugh at

1372
01:18:33.321 --> 01:18:34.154
me or whatever it was,

1373
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.360
it was only like three people in the audience and he came up to me afterwards he

1374
01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:42.730
goes,
that's what I knew you was a real comic,
like three motherfuckers.

1375
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:45.590
You just went up there to three motherfuckers and you lit that place up.

1376
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.650
Paul Mooney with time and you and I was like,
wow,

1377
01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:50.930
I can't believe I'm getting a fucking compliment from Paul Mooney.

1378
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:56.090
You lit those motherfuckers up.
He was a fun guy to watch,
man.

1379
01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.120
That guy knows how to command a crowd.
Yeah,

1380
01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.350
he's the one thing I saw like work in that booth.

1381
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:03.200
You get to see a lot of comments to see the mistakes they make.

1382
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:07.010
See the things we're doing right.
I remember saying,
Ahhh,
who's Mr. Curry?

1383
01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:12.260
Uh,
Cooper.
No.
Hanging with Mr. Cooper.
Mark Curry Marker.

1384
01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:16.820
Mr Gary with Mr. Curry.
What he's on.

1385
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:20.540
What a fucking nice guy.
He is.
Mark Curry hanging with Mr Cooper's like the Nice,

1386
01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:23.050
Super Nice,
but I saw him three nights in a row and I,

1387
01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.340
the first night I just enjoyed it.
Like it came one day,
you haven't been there.

1388
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.930
And then he came,
I was like,
oh,
that was funny.
The second night,

1389
01:19:26.931 --> 01:19:28.580
like in Jordan again,
it was the same material.

1390
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.970
And third night I knew that I know the jokes so I just see the technique he was

1391
01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:34.820
using and I saw him like,
oh you missed a tagline there.

1392
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:37.280
And then he like stop for a second and be like,

1393
01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:41.300
oh you know what else I don't realize like Oh you,
you pretended to remember that

1394
01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:43.970
same thing.

1395
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:48.200
And with Mooney I saw him have a command over the audience like nobody else.

1396
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:50.480
I saw before we even touch the mic,

1397
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:53.090
everyone had this thing of like there were getting up to leave cause they all go

1398
01:19:53.091 --> 01:19:57.860
on after 1112.
Yeah.
But like start to stand up.
They'll go,
oh,
hold on a second.

1399
01:19:58.230 --> 01:20:01.130
And it's sit back down to watch him before we even says a word.

1400
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.280
I don't know how he did it was the first five minutes I'll always watch.

1401
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.710
It gets people,
it gets them,
he makes them operate on his level

1402
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.370
<v 0>for whatever reason he makes them.
Uh,
he makes them come to him.</v>

1403
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:15.180
He taught me this thing once where he said,
uh,
I saw him do a bit about,

1404
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.760
let's say Aretha Franklin a few times,
and every time it's like,
oh,

1405
01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:22.040
what's that pitcher's name?
Don't have to be told,
what's his name from,
you know,

1406
01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:25.170
from something.
And they'll say it.
The crowd will say,
Oh yeah,

1407
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.620
don't get me started on Teresa.
But I'm like,
why do you do that?
Do you remember?

1408
01:20:28.621 --> 01:20:32.260
Right.
He goes,
partially,
uh,

1409
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:35.310
to sound like I'm just thinking about it and partially to seem like I'm better

1410
01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:40.190
than her.
I can't be bothered to know her name.
It puts you in a power position.

1411
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:44.190
That's it.
He said,
yeah.
Oh,
that's funny.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1412
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.410
To The dad paid his bid about,
he got his nigger wakeup call.

1413
01:20:47.411 --> 01:20:51.480
They're gonna wake up.
God Damn,
that's a good,
holy shit.
That's a good bit

1414
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:55.950
about how you thought you were better than other elder,
the black people.

1415
01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:59.040
And then you've got your dude,
Paul Mooneys,
a motherfucker.

1416
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.830
Johnny Sanchez came in after him once and just did a Pomone impression.
He goes,

1417
01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.600
oh,
he goes,
he's been around for so long.
I knew it was barely,
it was old matches.

1418
01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.630
Matches.
Got the Nigga wake up,
call a blinking.

1419
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:14.250
You think you know that you're all going to sneak a wake up call.
Johnny Sanchez,

1420
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:18.210
he was at the,
uh,
um,
uh,
ice house.
He says,
hi.
If you want to see him,
it says,

1421
01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.480
he said,
oh,
it was cool to see him,
man.
Yeah,
it was fun to see him.

1422
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:26.400
He looked really happy.
He's got a kid.
Yeah.
Powerful.
Johnny Sanchez or Daddy.

1423
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:31.540
Jesus.
You say Jesus.
Um,
uh,

1424
01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.950
can't picture him as a father.
He was thinking,
it just seems like so much work.

1425
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:40.080
Uh,
it is a lot of work,
man.
There's no doubt about it.
You know,

1426
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:42.570
it's probably not for Ari.
Shaffir hyperventilate a little bit.

1427
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:44.520
Every time I think about it,
about having a child,

1428
01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:48.480
I think about the actual process of like having to run after one and pick it up

1429
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:50.520
for a second.
I'm do it.
It's a lot of work,

1430
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:55.521
but the reality of it is that the experience of raising children is incredibly

1431
01:21:55.651 --> 01:21:56.850
rewarding.
It's a,

1432
01:21:57.450 --> 01:22:00.960
it's a beautiful feeling to have like this little person that you love and that

1433
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:04.110
you play with and hang out with.
And I look after,
you know,

1434
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.720
as long as your check is into it and you're into her and you know,

1435
01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:09.960
you really love each other and you're financially stable mean if,
if you're not,

1436
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:11.550
I mean,
people get by when they're not,
but I mean,
the,

1437
01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:13.140
the ideal way to do it is to do,

1438
01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:16.230
what do you think of people who've been in their kids or what,
what does that,

1439
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:19.440
they don't,
they don't feel the same joy.
People are broken.

1440
01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:23.460
There's a lot of people.
It's a lot of people.
It's not like,
oh wow.

1441
01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:25.310
It's not the majority.
No,
it's not that majority.

1442
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.220
You got to think when you say a lot what that means because there's 7 billion

1443
01:22:29.221 --> 01:22:33.060
people on the planet.
Man,
there's so many to get information.

1444
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:34.740
It's happened a few times,

1445
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:38.520
but it's like thousands and thousands of people right now or I don't know what

1446
01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:41.170
the real numbers are.
Do you do,
you know,
um,

1447
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.980
I don't think we need to know him to know that it does.
Definitely happens.

1448
01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:46.380
I think so.
Do you think those people just don't broken?

1449
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:50.790
Just they don't get that rape?
Why do people commit murder?
Why do people,

1450
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:54.330
why do people become pedophiles?
Why do people rob banks,
you know,
why,

1451
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.170
why do people think the pedophiles,
I didn't want to call it a sickness.

1452
01:22:58.171 --> 01:23:01.890
I think that's just a detail to you that you're super into that society.

1453
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.860
Society has told you it's wrong and they would all agree that it's wrong,

1454
01:23:04.861 --> 01:23:07.060
but it's like fuck,
I'm still,
that's what I get.
Boners on.

1455
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:10.900
That is interesting you brought that up because there was a youtube video that

1456
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:14.340
somebody posted up on my board and uh,

1457
01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:19.410
it was asking the question of whether or not most men are pedophiles.

1458
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.190
And it's a really interesting,

1459
01:23:24.191 --> 01:23:28.690
is the dude who put it on a and z maybe cause you think they would be,

1460
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:32.120
if not Brian put that,
pulled this up because it's really kind of interesting.
Um,

1461
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:37.540
look on youtube for are all men pedophiles question mark.
Yes.

1462
01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:42.230
Exclamation point.
And it's this guy and it's a really interesting,
um,

1463
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
sort of a study that they've done about how man become attracted to women at 16.

1464
01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.720
And that's what your level always stays.
And it's because they reached puberty.

1465
01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.150
When they've reached puberty,
they reached the age of sexual maturity.

1466
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.420
Whereas men don't reach the age of puberty and sexual maturity,

1467
01:23:58.421 --> 01:24:03.070
whether until they're 18.
That's not it.
That's my friends.
People who cheat,

1468
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:07.480
they cheat with whoever they could get before they became famous bite when they

1469
01:24:07.481 --> 01:24:08.410
became sexualized.

1470
01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.590
So then you become famous all of a sudden your bank nines and tens,

1471
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:15.760
but the one who cheat with is just who you naturally innately you can get.

1472
01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:17.470
It's not tiger woods.
This case he was,

1473
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:21.550
he was going crazy with like the hottest girls in the world I suppose you get.

1474
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.500
Yeah.
I wonder if he was fucking high when he was young.
He wasn't,

1475
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.050
he wasn't like an amateur.
All Americans to the hottest girls in la,

1476
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.710
but there's some really hot girls.
Those are,
those are pretty,

1477
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:31.980
but he was also fucking a Denny's.
Wait,
listen,
listen,
listen.
Right.

1478
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:33.111
<v 7>My boy,</v>

1479
01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:38.111
j w e is just done a documentary titled all men pedophiles.

1480
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:45.320
I'm death.
What?
Go ahead.
Do this documentary.
Yes,
we,
oh,
okay.

1481
01:24:45.321 --> 01:24:46.790
Tell us what the documentary is about.

1482
01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:52.650
<v 8>Okay.
Well I just want to say the answer is yes and no.</v>

1483
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.760
The general pop,

1484
01:24:53.761 --> 01:24:58.440
the definition of a pedophile is somebody who's attracted to somebody under 18

1485
01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:01.470
and then yes,
uh,

1486
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.320
almost all men would fall under that category.

1487
01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:09.390
But to professional definition is someone who's attracted to children before

1488
01:25:09.391 --> 01:25:10.030
puberty

1489
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:13.840
<v 7>because in your documentary said that average mind,
I'm an average,</v>

1490
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:18.400
mine finds girls that are 16 years old.
I attracted,

1491
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.540
<v 8>yeah,
around the age of 16</v>

1492
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:27.350
<v 7>and then you went back into historical times then showing us that puberty</v>

1493
01:25:27.351 --> 01:25:30.310
usually happens for girls around 60,
they hit puberty.
So they,

1494
01:25:30.311 --> 01:25:34.310
they're physically ready to have sex and that's kind of what pulls us in.

1495
01:25:35.670 --> 01:25:39.720
<v 8>Yeah,
puberty actually finishes.
So it's already finished around exit.</v>

1496
01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:44.910
So there is nothing more physically that can happen sexually that will make you

1497
01:25:44.911 --> 01:25:49.320
better.
And reproduction.
Physically women are mature at 16,

1498
01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.160
but men are mature at 18 and it's a man's world.

1499
01:25:53.161 --> 01:25:56.160
So men rule apply to women as well.

1500
01:25:56.690 --> 01:25:57.970
<v 7>You don't find,
you don't think it's a</v>

1501
01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:03.610
25 30 man

1502
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.750
<v 8>positive,
but a 16 year old</v>

1503
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:11.520
<v 1>what men formed their sexuality later.
So,
so what does that mean?
Well,</v>

1504
01:26:11.521 --> 01:26:14.430
the age of consent is 18 because that's when a man's mature sexually.

1505
01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:21.000
Okay.
But a woman is mature sexually at 16 that's what he's saying.
Okay.

1506
01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:23.070
So what did the name,
it's a man's world.
What does that mean?
Well,

1507
01:26:23.071 --> 01:26:25.530
because we used that as the age of maturity for women

1508
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.150
to have sex before she's 16 they need ideas argument

1509
01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.980
until she essentially was 16 rather than 18 well it's 18 though,
right?
Yeah,

1510
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:38.550
she'll be 16 is that what you're saying?
Yeah,
because that's what own sexuality.

1511
01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.670
Well it should be.
Certainly if it's an 18 year old boy and 16 year old girl,

1512
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:46.580
but if it's a 40 year old guy in a 16 year old girl,
no,
I don't think so.
I think,

1513
01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:47.470
I think the,

1514
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:51.070
there's a an age span where shit gets paid 18 creepy and manipulative.

1515
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:53.360
Doesn't it feel like that at 18 to 50 year old guy?

1516
01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:56.710
I could bang an 18 year old or 18 year old also.
I think it should.

1517
01:26:57.190 --> 01:26:59.980
I think it should,
don't you?
I'm just going to certain percentage of year.

1518
01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:00.550
It's like,
I mean,

1519
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:02.950
I guess you should be allowed to make your own fuck ups in the slides.

1520
01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:03.940
There's an argument for that.

1521
01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:07.090
I that 18 year old girls going to suck that old man's Dick and she's going to

1522
01:27:07.091 --> 01:27:09.990
burn as hot as fuck up.
It's just like,
all right,
you want to do it?
Yeah.

1523
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.280
She just wasn't into it.
She gave it a shot.
You'd like to old men.

1524
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:16.270
She tried to do the old yeah,
just it's like daddy route.

1525
01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:20.320
But he's saying it's like at 16 you become a pretty much a woman.
Um,

1526
01:27:20.321 --> 01:27:25.010
I think you had an ac and you become a man.
Actually.
You are done re,

1527
01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:29.300
you know,
you're,
you've achieved your sexual readiness at six 16.
Yeah.

1528
01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.100
That makes sense.
Is that that should be the agent.
Yeah.

1529
01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.880
That's the age to where you,
nothing's going to change.
You're not going to,

1530
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.110
well is the age is 16 in some states it's even 15 to some style.
Yeah.
Well,

1531
01:27:38.111 --> 01:27:40.540
this is one of the things that he talks about backing up a little bit more cause

1532
01:27:40.541 --> 01:27:41.380
it was really interesting,

1533
01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:44.110
just a wee bit while [inaudible] was a asking that question.

1534
01:27:44.111 --> 01:27:47.170
There's another part that he's talking about like a 35 year old banging.

1535
01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.690
Like if you're a 35 year old bang in a 16 year old

1536
01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:54.210
<v 8>the world,
so men will apply to women as well,
but you don't find,</v>

1537
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:56.740
you don't think is it is cod the sick

1538
01:27:58.770 --> 01:28:02.820
25 30 year old guy to hook up with a 16 year old,

1539
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:05.790
even though biologically it seems,

1540
01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:12.420
it seems like a common thing to do.
Yeah.
It's just sign it off.
Yeah.

1541
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.660
I had the same thing.
Like I mean,
you know,

1542
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.070
I'm just like the average guy.
Like my father is actually your preachers.

1543
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.660
I was actually raised North Christian and I think conservative than most.

1544
01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.710
And um,
uh,
like I,
I noticed,
cause I,

1545
01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:32.460
at one time I was watching a play boys,
et cetera.
That is a new show.

1546
01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.100
And at one point a segment,
um,

1547
01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:40.200
they did research on their own viewers and they asked if he was at what age do

1548
01:28:40.201 --> 01:28:44.190
you find women the most attractive?
And the average answer was 16.
And I was like,

1549
01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:48.920
oh my gosh,
I had mentioned that their pen pals and then,
you know,
like,
uh,

1550
01:28:48.921 --> 01:28:51.050
a couple of years later,
well,
yeah,

1551
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:55.800
two years ago I started making this documentary and then I finally figured out

1552
01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:58.440
why that was and why that makes sense.
I mean,

1553
01:28:58.441 --> 01:29:03.390
we are so programmed in Western society,
we are so programmed then,
you know,

1554
01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:06.060
everything under 18 is to bu,

1555
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:10.890
but if you look at the world and you look at the age of consent,
you know,

1556
01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:13.790
it ranges from nine to 20.
Right?

1557
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:18.540
So that's an 11 year difference at which people can say,
oh,

1558
01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:22.260
it's okay to have sex.
What country is the age of consent?
Nine years old.

1559
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.220
Yemen.
Wow.
Nine country

1560
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.530
age of consent.
You can't have which countries then?
Yes.

1561
01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:39.430
<v 0>Wow.
Wow.
Wow.</v>

1562
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:44.170
I bet that what I want to hear what a weird world we live in and I understand

1563
01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:45.790
that.
It's like,
yeah.
You're said,
oh,
it's sick.

1564
01:29:45.791 --> 01:29:48.730
When you're attracted to a 17 year olds,
like it's not six it's everybody's body.

1565
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:53.050
That's everybody.
Since we were told it's below 18 is sick.
Why?

1566
01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:55.360
Cause that's some 19 year olds will look super young.
Oh,

1567
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.570
it's a 16 year olds who were on the cover of sports illustrated and I think 18

1568
01:29:58.571 --> 01:30:02.170
year old girls quite honestly are more mature than 18 year old boys.

1569
01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:05.980
Like generally speaking.
Oh yeah.
Quite a bit more.
Not just physically,

1570
01:30:05.981 --> 01:30:08.450
but mentally.
They usually like mentally more standup.

1571
01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.020
Used to have a joke about it.
But I was like,
where it's like,
oh,

1572
01:30:11.021 --> 01:30:15.560
they're not women.
He's like,
God disagrees.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Right.

1573
01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.400
You can have babies right away.
Yeah.

1574
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.780
You can have babies at like 13 what the fuck is all about?

1575
01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:23.710
What are the imperfect little situation?
Another fuck up.
Yeah.

1576
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:26.770
I guess that was for the days of when you want to go to 35 so I get on it.

1577
01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:28.810
Let's go.
Yeah,
maybe.

1578
01:30:28.811 --> 01:30:31.420
And I guess it was like days when we just hadn't done such a good job of

1579
01:30:31.421 --> 01:30:33.400
fighting off predators.
You know,

1580
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:36.550
we're so good at fighting off predators were way better than anything else.
Oh,

1581
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.370
they're so far removed from us.
Yeah.
I mean,
we're so good at it.
We don't,

1582
01:30:39.371 --> 01:30:42.430
we can't even fight them off.
Yeah,
we can just go outside.
You just separated.

1583
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.890
Yeah.
We don't have to worry.
We're all fleshy and shit.

1584
01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:47.620
We're sitting in front of my house with shorts on and flip flops.
And by the way,

1585
01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:50.450
I live in a neighborhood where they've spotted mountain lions.
No,

1586
01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:55.030
they spot of mountain lions,
but it's so unlikely.
Yeah.
I,
my dog's here,

1587
01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:59.350
I'll tell you why I didn't want it onto that.
That mud ice and Alaska mud ice.

1588
01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.930
It's like,
I forget what body of water it was at.

1589
01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:05.500
The place we played was a bundled up against,

1590
01:31:05.501 --> 01:31:10.390
and so you just take a walk along this like it's mud freezes over and it just

1591
01:31:10.391 --> 01:31:13.130
traps boats in there and you can't like,
oh gosh,
it's totally frozen.

1592
01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:17.290
But we were there in like march or April and it was beginning to thought,

1593
01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:19.810
but it happened.
There was a sign says don't go onto the mud.
But I was like,

1594
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:24.430
whatever.
Oh No.
Yeah.
And I walked out there like,
like 2030 yards.
Oh No,

1595
01:31:24.431 --> 01:31:28.990
the me just a big chunk of it just fell in.
Oh No.
And I was like,
Oh,

1596
01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.590
oh,
this is,
there's no rules here.
Like no one's here to protect me.
Yeah.

1597
01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.670
You could just die right here.
And it's like,
at this falls,

1598
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.513
that's what's going to happen.

1599
01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.400
You're going to be stuck in this freezing cold water and you might not make it

1600
01:31:39.401 --> 01:31:42.160
out.
Were you thinking,
I don't know.
I would go out there.

1601
01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:46.780
Fuck this Indian guy was looking at me the whole time.
Yeah.

1602
01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:49.000
When you're a young man,
especially,
you know,

1603
01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.760
it was just staring at it and you're young period.
But especially young men,

1604
01:31:51.761 --> 01:31:53.430
young men do law.
Stupid Shit.
Yeah.

1605
01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.090
I had to walk like a round it and then come back in like it was like in my path

1606
01:31:58.091 --> 01:31:59.950
got enveloped by fall.

1607
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.280
<v 1>Why is it that young men are so much dumber?
The young girls?</v>

1608
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:04.690
Is it a testosterone thing?

1609
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.840
Is it the testosterone comes in and just maybe come become this Dolby?
Yeah.
Nice.

1610
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:13.030
It's like Mongoloid it's amazing that that's how it's person has made,
you know,

1611
01:32:13.050 --> 01:32:15.490
the testosterone is introduced into the system and then the,

1612
01:32:15.491 --> 01:32:18.220
the female becomes a mail.
People don't know that.

1613
01:32:18.221 --> 01:32:22.300
Like every baby baby fetus starts off as female and somewhere along the line in

1614
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:24.900
the process it decides whether or not it's going to become male.

1615
01:32:24.901 --> 01:32:26.050
There's a reason why you have tits.

1616
01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:29.440
Dudes have tits because they started off as the that yeah,
get rid of them.

1617
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:33.010
How crazy is that?
We started off as girls and they grew up with grew up penis.

1618
01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.170
Yeah.
We're like dumb big girls.

1619
01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.250
It's something that I dealt with.
Men are dumb,

1620
01:32:39.251 --> 01:32:42.880
big angry girls for money or all Monday.
I look,
I mean you can't,

1621
01:32:42.881 --> 01:32:45.640
you can't be a man and hate women cause he used to be one.

1622
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.000
I mean literally all started off.

1623
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:54.080
You had your heart broken
Amala

1624
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.460
sort of d 12 songs.

1625
01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:11.290
I could see you eventually getting happy enough to settle down and have
children.

1626
01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.020
The problem is,
will you be able to do it?

1627
01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:17.460
Be gleaned where you get too old to have children.
Yeah.

1628
01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:22.030
Have just zero interest.
Yeah.
Then don't do it.
You don't have to do it.
You know?

1629
01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:26.830
That's one of the things that always really bothered me guy too.
But no children,

1630
01:33:26.831 --> 01:33:29.800
people would say,
oh,
you should have children and show children.
And I'd be like,

1631
01:33:29.801 --> 01:33:33.070
will you stop?
Like,
why are you telling you?
You know,
it would really bother me.

1632
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:38.190
But what really bothers me about it is sort of the ignorance that people express

1633
01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.630
when they try to tell you what you should do with your life.

1634
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:42.430
Because they tell you in a way like,

1635
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:44.680
you're not living your life the right way to do this.

1636
01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:46.660
You don't know what to going on in my head.

1637
01:33:46.661 --> 01:33:50.350
You don't know what I'm enjoying right now or what my fucking overall life plan

1638
01:33:50.351 --> 01:33:53.580
is.
Don't tell me.
Assume that you know what's house for me.
It's growth.

1639
01:33:53.581 --> 01:33:54.930
So we were like,
well,
I don't want to be,
I just,

1640
01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:58.150
it's studies by the way that older fathers live longer.
Really?
Yeah.

1641
01:33:58.210 --> 01:34:00.610
And have kids that live longer.
Why?
Because you have,

1642
01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:04.270
you develop something inside you that you can pass on genetically that younger

1643
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:09.190
parents cannot pass on.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Um,
well they worried about genetic,

1644
01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:12.370
like there's an idea,
not,
not,
we shouldn't say they worry,

1645
01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:15.070
but there's an idea that things can be passed down genetically.

1646
01:34:15.071 --> 01:34:19.330
Even things like racism that,
um,
hmm.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Yeah.
There's,

1647
01:34:19.331 --> 01:34:23.160
there's a study,
there's a study that showed that children have,
you know,

1648
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.880
really extreme racist parents,

1649
01:34:25.210 --> 01:34:29.560
even if they didn't have exposure to that parent had a tendency towards racism.

1650
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:33.200
Wow.
Well,
the idea is that all of our is something's genetic.
Yeah.

1651
01:34:33.201 --> 01:34:35.110
The ideas are all very instincts.
So really some,

1652
01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:38.410
some form of information that we've stored as experience,
you know,

1653
01:34:38.411 --> 01:34:43.030
so like the discount,
either nature or nurture.
It's like,
absolutely.
Who knows,

1654
01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:48.310
right.
Who knows.
These guys named Rupert Sheldrake who does,
uh,
this,

1655
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:52.870
uh,
he's,
I think he's an evolutionary biologist.
That's his,
uh,
his,
uh,
actual,
uh,

1656
01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:57.040
distinction.
But yeah,
he,
um,
does a sir,
uh,

1657
01:34:57.090 --> 01:35:00.780
a bunch of different tasks on different things.
Like it's called the,
uh,

1658
01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:04.420
the morphogenic field.
And the idea is like,
they,
they,

1659
01:35:04.421 --> 01:35:09.421
they test things like to see if your dog knows when you're coming home and shit

1660
01:35:09.801 --> 01:35:13.520
like that.
And,
um,
apparently his,

1661
01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:18.410
his reasoning is,
it might be,
what's that?
Is that the old white guy?
He's an old,

1662
01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:19.420
old English guy.
Right?

1663
01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:23.930
It might be that all of us have ideas in our head that came like passed down

1664
01:35:23.931 --> 01:35:26.360
through generations in biology.
Like the Frat,

1665
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:29.420
the fact that kids in New York City are afraid of monsters.

1666
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.450
They're afraid of big cats in the dark,
you know,
they were failing.
It's because,

1667
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:36.950
yeah,
exactly.
The idea is that that is somehow another,

1668
01:35:36.951 --> 01:35:41.050
a deep seated memories that existed.
Yeah.
That existed from w you know,

1669
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:45.080
wolves eating people and most of probably not earlier on in our development.

1670
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:49.610
It seems like that would stick longer than something that you get later.
Right?

1671
01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.820
If you relate it to like a human development,
like in one person,
well it's also,

1672
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:54.350
if you're the most vulnerable,

1673
01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:56.780
what are you going to be afraid of physically when you're a child?

1674
01:35:56.781 --> 01:36:01.490
Everything is so raw.
So create a monster's man like almost instantaneously.

1675
01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.550
They're afraid of monsters.
Monsters,
not monsters in New York.

1676
01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:07.370
No monsters in New York.
They're not.
It's not based on personal experience.

1677
01:36:07.371 --> 01:36:10.130
It's based in something in their head.
Yeah,
it's going to eat me.

1678
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:11.450
They worry about things eating them.

1679
01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:14.160
Kids have said that it's going to eat any of it too.

1680
01:36:14.190 --> 01:36:16.160
It's a weird thing when the kid says that too.

1681
01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:19.820
I'm worried a monster's going to eat me because in their world nothing needs

1682
01:36:19.821 --> 01:36:21.870
anything.
Yeah,
exactly.
Where the,

1683
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:25.340
where the fuck are they saying anything gets eaten.
Yeah.

1684
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:27.280
So his idea is not even be interested.

1685
01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:32.300
Somehow or another memories are transmitted through genetics and I think that

1686
01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:36.350
the idea is that as a really smart person,

1687
01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:41.351
you have earned the right to pass on some of that intelligence to your child.

1688
01:36:41.901 --> 01:36:45.200
So of your,
what makes you successful,
you're thinking irrational thing.

1689
01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:48.320
I mean I wonder if it's just something I notice or if it's something that's
real.

1690
01:36:48.321 --> 01:36:50.900
It's when you seen athletes,
children becoming athletes,
professionals.

1691
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.890
Well that's physical genetics for sure.
And why wouldn't we go to the brain?
Yeah.

1692
01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:59.000
I don't think they quite understand what information is being transmitted.

1693
01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:02.020
I think it's still a lot of,
there's still a lot of guessing going.

1694
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:04.640
This is why I think that's basic stuff though.

1695
01:37:04.670 --> 01:37:07.850
Difference between men and women where it's like if you take it to our muscles,

1696
01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.440
are muscular church shape differently?

1697
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:13.310
Why can't our brains be shaped differently?
Not better or worse,
just differently?

1698
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.540
Well we know that things change in the chemistry of the brain when testosterone

1699
01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:19.390
is introduced,
you know,
we know that,
you know,

1700
01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:23.510
that's something that happens and we know that men are better with three d

1701
01:37:23.511 --> 01:37:28.190
things were better with spacial differentiation's a measuring distances and

1702
01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:31.480
stuff.
But women are better at other things.
Like I,
you know,

1703
01:37:31.481 --> 01:37:35.540
like men have an advantage in games supposedly like geometrically and like pool.

1704
01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.000
Cause I've I've heard like said better.
Yeah,

1705
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.240
I dunno how that the fuck you could ever prove that.
I don't know if at the top,

1706
01:37:41.241 --> 01:37:42.200
but I know that,
like I said,

1707
01:37:42.201 --> 01:37:45.740
the studies where the blind was better or worse at math and they said no,
no,

1708
01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:49.040
it's only cause they were introduced to and that's why they weren't taught as

1709
01:37:49.041 --> 01:37:50.030
well.
But then it's like,
wow,

1710
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:54.860
now you're the one time when you really understand that human beings are,

1711
01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.810
there's no the man,
I used to always think that men were better than the women.

1712
01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:01.290
You know?
I just always think that women annoyed me.

1713
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:05.820
So either they were cool or they annoyed me.
It was like there was,

1714
01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:06.683
there was very few.

1715
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.590
You just don't noticing the stuff that the men do that annoys you as much.
Yeah.

1716
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.060
It doesn't mean there wasn't a bunch of cool girls and I knew,

1717
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:13.500
I certainly knew some cool people,

1718
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:18.501
but I didn't realize until I had been around a mother and children and seeing a

1719
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:23.010
woman have a baby and see the,
the,
the what,

1720
01:38:23.011 --> 01:38:24.690
what goes on and raising a child.

1721
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:27.570
Then you sort of understand how we have to be different.

1722
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:30.660
Then it sort of puts it all,
puts it all into perspective for you.

1723
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:35.550
Like this thing is you become so self centered in your life and thinking that

1724
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:38.400
your way of getting through this thing is,
you know,

1725
01:38:38.401 --> 01:38:41.070
it's like that's what's important and what's important.

1726
01:38:41.071 --> 01:38:43.500
As you get your shit done and you do this and you do that,

1727
01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:44.670
and I want to watch my show,

1728
01:38:44.671 --> 01:38:46.950
it's on eight o'clock and I want to let anybody interrupt me,

1729
01:38:47.290 --> 01:38:49.710
but alone every night.
Yeah,
let alone every night.

1730
01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:54.870
And that when you have a child that gets completely interrupted,

1731
01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.990
who stop living for herself in you,
you start,

1732
01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:02.520
you start living for yourself and for others it's,

1733
01:39:02.521 --> 01:39:05.370
it becomes a very different thing.
You still live for yourself.

1734
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:07.930
You're still enjoying it yourself,
but you just have to move backwards.

1735
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.880
You have to think about others.
It's like it's,
it's,
it's,
it's imminent.

1736
01:39:11.881 --> 01:39:13.800
It's important to huge.
It's everything.
It's true.

1737
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:18.630
It's the source of all your happiness.
It becomes a,
a new type of happiness.

1738
01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:20.700
It's greater than all the happiness you've ever experienced before.

1739
01:39:20.701 --> 01:39:24.540
I was like heroin addiction a little bit,
but it's a little person.

1740
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:29.160
You can talk to them and you can have the opportunity to raise good people.

1741
01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.950
It's a weird experience and I don't think everybody should have to do it.

1742
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:35.160
Just like I don't think everybody should be a fucking vegetarian.
And I,
you know,

1743
01:39:35.161 --> 01:39:39.690
vegetarians aren't as ruthless about it as vegans are,
but the push on,

1744
01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:43.020
they assume that everyone has to be a certain way.
You're like,
shut up now.

1745
01:39:43.021 --> 01:39:47.520
He makes me want to not like that.
By the way,
the dubious science behind the,
the,

1746
01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:51.360
the fact that it's a nutritional equal.
I don't,
I don't agree that it is,

1747
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.280
you know,
I don't think it's nutritionally equal.

1748
01:39:53.281 --> 01:39:56.970
I think you meant absolutely can be very healthy on an all vegan diet.

1749
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.040
I absolutely believe it.
I know people who do it,

1750
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:02.610
but I think there's a biological advantage to eating some animal protein.

1751
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.460
I just do.
I,
I,
I've,
I've tried it.
I've tried it.

1752
01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:06.960
I've experienced with a bunch of different ways.

1753
01:40:07.290 --> 01:40:11.550
I don't find very many top athletes I know of Mac Danzig and I know of a few

1754
01:40:11.551 --> 01:40:16.551
others that are actually vegans that are participate in high level a athletics.

1755
01:40:16.681 --> 01:40:21.000
And Mac is a fucking specimen and a half,
but in today's days with,
you know,

1756
01:40:21.001 --> 01:40:24.150
really balanced protein powders that are a vegetable based,

1757
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:29.850
you can do pretty fucking good on a,
on a Vegan Diet.
Yeah,
too.
Yeah.

1758
01:40:29.851 --> 01:40:32.640
I mean,
he's a look,
he's not abusing his body,
that's for fuck sure.

1759
01:40:32.650 --> 01:40:36.090
The guy eats super healthy,
he's shredded,
he's in great shape.

1760
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:40.530
But I think that um,
if you,
it's a moral issue with him,
I think physically,

1761
01:40:40.531 --> 01:40:44.040
you probably still have to argue with that when people bring that up,

1762
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:47.110
that's what everybody or whatever,
or I'm better than chicken,
but it's like,
yeah,

1763
01:40:47.111 --> 01:40:48.810
you know,
you're a little wrong.
You are better than a chicken,

1764
01:40:48.811 --> 01:40:49.990
but we shouldn't have to,
you know,

1765
01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:53.860
I would rather pay extra few dollars for chicken if I knew that it was just a

1766
01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:54.820
chicken that was hanging out,

1767
01:40:54.821 --> 01:40:57.710
living in a field or it's taking too long with no beak.
Yeah.

1768
01:40:57.730 --> 01:41:01.930
And born stuffed into a cage and stuffed with fucking hormones so that it's five

1769
01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:04.720
times the size of a normal check in that can't even walk.
Right.
Actually,

1770
01:41:04.721 --> 01:41:07.870
I heard that's not hormones and do that.
It's just selective breeding.

1771
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.980
So I should correct myself there.

1772
01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:14.110
Cause I said that once and some guy who was a actually a specialist contacted me

1773
01:41:14.111 --> 01:41:17.610
and explained to me the whole process.
It's pretty fascinating.
Yeah.

1774
01:41:17.630 --> 01:41:19.720
So it's more selective breeding than anything.

1775
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:22.960
And the only time they give him a hormones is when they got something wrong with

1776
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:25.720
them leased out.
So this guy said,

1777
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:29.110
but that could vary also from farm to farm.
And you know,

1778
01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:32.470
what type of chickens are they growing and shit and,
but you ever,
uh,

1779
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.510
you know when you ever go by like one of those places,

1780
01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:39.340
it's like a chicken factory chicken factory.
Now it's crazy,
dude.
I saw,

1781
01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:43.390
I worked in a chip in a Turkey coop in Israel,
but they were,

1782
01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:45.910
they were just all on top of each other.
Lights are out when they,

1783
01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:49.660
when they unload them so they can't really see anything and they're just stuck

1784
01:41:49.661 --> 01:41:52.390
on top of each other walk.
They can walk around.
But they're,
they're,
I mean,

1785
01:41:52.450 --> 01:41:57.190
they're all over each other.
Fuck what a crazy existence humans are.
So,
you know,

1786
01:41:57.191 --> 01:41:58.750
once agriculture came along,

1787
01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.650
once we figured out the way that we could store things and we could start

1788
01:42:02.651 --> 01:42:05.710
growing things,
we don't have to move everywhere.
Let's just make houses,
you know,

1789
01:42:05.711 --> 01:42:09.040
we can keep the wolves away if we have these big ass houses.
You know,
once,

1790
01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.530
once they started figuring out how to do that,

1791
01:42:11.531 --> 01:42:13.300
boy that was a dark day for animals.

1792
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:19.240
That was a dark day for cattle and fucking turkeys and chickens and anything

1793
01:42:19.241 --> 01:42:22.180
else we could corral up.
Wow.
That's,

1794
01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:27.330
I wonder if like the animal kingdom like recognizes that and it was just like a

1795
01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:30.070
few thousand years ago were all the animals are free and Roman [inaudible] and

1796
01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:34.120
one day these mother fuckers to start shackling us into cages.

1797
01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:37.690
How many thousands of years ago have we been doing that to animals?

1798
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:42.070
Just like let's save this one for later.
But it's the only way to do it.

1799
01:42:42.071 --> 01:42:45.590
To have them all first and then like try to save those and we're like,

1800
01:42:45.591 --> 01:42:47.440
oh that didn't work this way.
I don't mean it's the only way to do it.

1801
01:42:47.441 --> 01:42:51.040
As far as I'm torturing the animals and animal cruelty,
that's not what I mean.

1802
01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:51.560
I mean,

1803
01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:55.840
you can't have him a wandering free and then go get them when you need them.

1804
01:42:55.841 --> 01:42:58.750
If you're going to,
you know,
if you're going to satisfy cities,

1805
01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:03.190
you know you have to have a very large volume output places.

1806
01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:07.150
Not saying that they have to be inhumane,
of course they can be humane.
It's,

1807
01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:10.600
it just would be much more expensive,
but you're going to need farms.

1808
01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:13.850
You can't just have wild animals.
It's just too hard to feed.

1809
01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:17.290
How do you want a million people mean?
I guess.
Yeah,
at the end of the day,

1810
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.910
but that was way smaller.
Yeah,
way smaller.

1811
01:43:18.911 --> 01:43:22.150
If we had to like if we let all the cows free and we had to just go,

1812
01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:25.900
go hunt them down when we needed food and we ended up every animal,
the tone,

1813
01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:27.940
Jesus Christ.
That's all comes down to convenience.

1814
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:30.520
It all comes down to convenience.
We cannot,
we cannot,

1815
01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.250
we cannot go and actually hunter,
I've got too much to do.
Yeah,

1816
01:43:33.251 --> 01:43:35.620
it's too hard to hunt.
So the only other,

1817
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:40.240
the only other solution is to do a vegetable,
vegetable based diet,

1818
01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:44.380
a vegetarian based or Vegan based diet.
That's the only other alternative.
I mean,

1819
01:43:44.381 --> 01:43:45.820
otherwise you're going to,

1820
01:43:45.850 --> 01:43:48.510
you're going to have to accept the fact that some of your meat,
you know,

1821
01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:52.190
unless you're like really clean about your eating or you're one of those

1822
01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.890
<v 0>Steve Rinella,
Dude's who goes hunting twice a year and,</v>

1823
01:43:54.891 --> 01:43:58.780
and it comes back with a fucking Mousse and you just eat that until her exactly

1824
01:43:58.781 --> 01:44:01.640
like spring and then you salt it now freeze it.

1825
01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:05.580
They have like a freezer wrap and the deep freeze.
Those motherfuckers,
yeah.

1826
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.440
Curtis coming to visit.
He just got up and he was like,

1827
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.900
what do I eat?
What am I supposed to eat?
Why do I go?

1828
01:44:14.901 --> 01:44:17.000
What am I supposed to eat and I need,
what?
What's his name?
Who is it?

1829
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:20.900
Kurt Metzger.
Oh,
I know Kurt.
Yeah.
He's like,
I thought you said Curtis.
He's like,

1830
01:44:20.901 --> 01:44:21.970
I need pot.
What is,

1831
01:44:22.210 --> 01:44:25.160
what is in your fridge that's going to make me feel good and what's not?

1832
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:27.090
You shouldn't even talk about this on the air.
And Dude,
I was,

1833
01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.300
that guy doesn't have a license.
He doesn't live here.

1834
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:34.370
Careful the walls have ears chefy or what someone else.
No,
it shouldn't.
You know,

1835
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:38.600
after all you've been through your,
yeah,

1836
01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:42.500
I'll throw all your people have been through.
You still trust the man?
Um,
yeah.

1837
01:44:42.501 --> 01:44:44.360
I don't,
I don't,
I guess I don't worry about it.

1838
01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:48.650
It's going to come back at some point,
but I just don't worry about it.
You worry.

1839
01:44:48.651 --> 01:44:52.910
Yeah.
Don't giant smoke session after a show in San Francisco.
By the way,

1840
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:57.770
we're willing everyone with this prescriptions only.
It has to be,

1841
01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:02.240
I'm assuming everyone there will have their prescription.
Um,
so yeah,

1842
01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.060
after the shows,
so this is a story I was talking about.

1843
01:45:05.061 --> 01:45:08.120
The guy's name is Terry Jones and he's the Koran building.

1844
01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:11.810
He's the Quran burning pastor from Florida.

1845
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:15.290
Remember that?
Dual maker?
Yeah,
just this troublemaker.

1846
01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:19.910
Why are you looking for attention?
The dove world outreach center in Gainesville,

1847
01:45:19.911 --> 01:45:23.480
Florida has a hanged and effigy that has hanged.

1848
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:27.740
They have hanged in effigy of President Barack Obama from the gallows on the

1849
01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:32.540
front lawn and as a sign that says Obama is killing America.

1850
01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.960
This is fucking crazy.
There's a sign on the back of uh,

1851
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:41.660
the Obama trailer,
like a trailer behind them.

1852
01:45:41.661 --> 01:45:46.520
It says Obama's Obama is killing America and he's hanging,
man.

1853
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:50.090
You know what?
I saw one of the airports I want to tell us,
it says,

1854
01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.840
how do these tee shirts with George Bushes picture saying miss me yet.
Whoa.

1855
01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:59.770
Yeah.
And 2013,
the end of an error.
That's what it was.
Individually.

1856
01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.120
I've seen that on bumper sticker and it's like,
oh,

1857
01:46:02.121 --> 01:46:03.040
there's a lot of people are like,
yeah,

1858
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:06.830
how much racism is involved in this hatred of Obama?

1859
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:10.100
Definitely some definitely some definitely some.
Yeah,
I agree.

1860
01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.070
I think it's blown out of proportion and it makes the non racist who just don't

1861
01:46:13.071 --> 01:46:16.040
agree with policy feel really scared and really shitty all the time to have to

1862
01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:16.874
worry about it.

1863
01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:20.450
Like I just don't think economically that's the policy instead of this other

1864
01:46:20.451 --> 01:46:24.420
policy.
But they have to feel like they can't criticize.
Yeah.
That falling.

1865
01:46:24.450 --> 01:46:28.340
I'm going to be called.
I don't want that.
I want to be called a racist.

1866
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:30.320
I kind of held out hope that,

1867
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:33.840
I mean I didn't really blame him for the bail outs cause I didn't understand it.

1868
01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:37.280
I on amazing things.
But the real problem is the NDA,

1869
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:39.980
the national defense authorization act that treats the United States is a

1870
01:46:39.981 --> 01:46:40.700
battleground,

1871
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:44.510
allows the military to fucking go in and intervene and us streets and arrest

1872
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:48.110
civilians if,
what case?
Or was it just not ever,
for whatever reason,

1873
01:46:48.111 --> 01:46:50.160
they decide for whatever.
They just got all power

1874
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.310
<v 1>over to the military.
Exactly.
This is something that should have never been done.</v>

1875
01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.980
There's no reason to do it.
It's fucking rigid.
Why would he do that?

1876
01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:58.550
Knowing what not to do that because it's the people that put them in office

1877
01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.760
wanting me to do that on a sign over all power.
The idea is that in,

1878
01:47:02.761 --> 01:47:06.180
in the event of something fucked up that goes down a terrorist attack on

1879
01:47:06.181 --> 01:47:08.220
American soil,
especially a big one,
a nuke,

1880
01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:11.340
something along those lines on the president,
they can control the situation,

1881
01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.230
begin to control the situation.
They can,
um,

1882
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:17.640
go in and the military can arrest people.
I mean,

1883
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:20.040
what you don't have the crazy idea is that the military can arrest people.

1884
01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:23.160
The military is people.
Okay.
They're us.
Okay.

1885
01:47:23.161 --> 01:47:26.880
Then it's a volunteer army got damaged because people wanted a fucking job and

1886
01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:30.570
the idea that they can go around and arrest like their neighbors and shit,

1887
01:47:30.571 --> 01:47:33.360
they might have to do that.
I get,
I bet a lot of people are not going to do it.

1888
01:47:33.361 --> 01:47:36.420
You're going to have some red dawn motherfuckers going on in Syria.

1889
01:47:36.421 --> 01:47:39.550
The drafting people from those countries and make cities and making a fire and

1890
01:47:39.551 --> 01:47:41.790
the neighbors.
Yeah.
That's not gonna fly in America.

1891
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:44.490
There's one thing that if we do one thing that we don't want to do,

1892
01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:47.320
we don't want to kill Americans.
Yeah.
Okay.
Start to be devils out.

1893
01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.360
It really did that for the other way.
It's like,
what good would this be?

1894
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:56.550
What would this,
if it's abused,
I mean,
how could this be good?
Well,

1895
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:59.370
the idea is that it can be good in that they can,

1896
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:01.560
they would have the manpower to control a situation.

1897
01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:04.530
And if it's riding on the streets,
you'd want to be able to attain those people.

1898
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:08.790
Well,
they're also extrapolating from what's going on or what started out with

1899
01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:10.410
operation or excuse me,

1900
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:15.090
occupy Wall Street and seeing these massive protests where this big buildup and

1901
01:48:15.091 --> 01:48:15.690
this big,

1902
01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:19.680
the use of social media is people to organize a numbers has never been before

1903
01:48:19.681 --> 01:48:20.514
possible.

1904
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:23.370
And they have an ethic together and they have an idea together and they could

1905
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:26.280
get together and Mike Check Mike check and they chant and everybody gets,

1906
01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.770
that's scary shit to people that are in power.

1907
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.930
When you're got a bunch of people standing outside where you do business every

1908
01:48:31.931 --> 01:48:35.670
day,
you're in the business of fucking people over and removing rights and,
and,

1909
01:48:35.671 --> 01:48:36.161
and,
and,

1910
01:48:36.161 --> 01:48:39.960
and so patients that have got you in into power and that's what you're doing and

1911
01:48:39.961 --> 01:48:40.890
that's your job every day.

1912
01:48:40.891 --> 01:48:43.710
And out there on the fucking street is a bunch of people who are calling you out

1913
01:48:43.711 --> 01:48:45.300
on your bullshit every day.

1914
01:48:45.301 --> 01:48:50.250
There's screaming out what you've done in Nicaragua and Panama.
Yeah.

1915
01:48:50.251 --> 01:48:53.100
What you were trying to do to America and what you've done that you know,

1916
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:55.140
on and on and on and on and on.

1917
01:48:55.141 --> 01:48:58.380
Everything in the United States has ever done wrong over the history of the 200

1918
01:48:58.381 --> 01:49:01.560
plus years.
It was still alive,
has been shouted out of these people,
you know,

1919
01:49:01.561 --> 01:49:04.800
from the lawns all across the country.
And these people that have power,

1920
01:49:04.801 --> 01:49:07.830
they're like,
well this is what I have.
I can't punch you.
I'm going to,
I have,

1921
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:11.220
well,
they also,
they realize that something could be coming in.
You gotta be,

1922
01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:15.000
you gotta be prepared.
And the best way to be prepared is what the military,

1923
01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:18.960
it's not with,
you know,
using the coast guard or you know,
using,
uh,

1924
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.530
police like they did in the Chicago riots or anything along those lines.

1925
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:24.180
We would rather,
you know,

1926
01:49:24.181 --> 01:49:26.980
they would rather just bring in the fucking marines and just boom,

1927
01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:29.670
biggest power we have.
Just go for it.
Look what happened at Kent State,

1928
01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.680
but a lot of people have short memories and Kent State,

1929
01:49:31.681 --> 01:49:36.681
they had a antiwar protest and Nixon's sick the fucking national guard on on

1930
01:49:37.021 --> 01:49:41.910
American students.
Wow.
They got shot and killed on TV,
you know,

1931
01:49:41.911 --> 01:49:43.500
I mean at all.
I mean,
there's video of him.

1932
01:49:43.501 --> 01:49:48.130
That's a problem if you're trusting just from regular due to not start some 19

1933
01:49:48.131 --> 01:49:50.530
year old who is trained.
Exactly.
Well,
not only that,

1934
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:54.070
someone has told that regular due to shoot the 19 yeah,
he's told,

1935
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:56.320
they've told them to take action.
And by the way,

1936
01:49:56.321 --> 01:50:00.190
you're giving guns to people and and sending them against other people there.

1937
01:50:00.191 --> 01:50:03.460
You always run the possibility.
I mean,
if even if it's us against us,

1938
01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.000
run the possibility sewing pulled the fucking trigger.
You know,

1939
01:50:06.001 --> 01:50:10.090
it's a strange situation to be in your marching towards someone with a deadly

1940
01:50:10.091 --> 01:50:14.170
weapon,
a weapon that kills you.
That's a fucking,
anytime you do that,

1941
01:50:14.171 --> 01:50:16.840
it's not safe.
Anytime you do that,
anything can happen.

1942
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:20.290
You're sending the national garden and there's a bunch of students in the

1943
01:50:20.291 --> 01:50:24.320
national guard has guns on them.
Anything can happen.
Man.
Topic.

1944
01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:26.860
I don't think I should stop.
I think it was a runaway shaky.
Get crazy.

1945
01:50:26.861 --> 01:50:29.930
Someone could throw a rock at you and hit you in the head and then you fucking

1946
01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:34.120
shoot them.
And then the next thing you know,
all my God,
it's on.
It's on.

1947
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:38.960
I mean that it could becomes a war.
Your daughter could get shot.
Get shot.

1948
01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:43.700
I don't know.
Let's find out a couple of old ones with school there.
Really?

1949
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:47.840
Yeah.
Does he feel responsible?
Put proactively?
Yeah,
I think he should.

1950
01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.700
He's the opposite of Kent State Guide.
You think after mine.

1951
01:50:53.850 --> 01:50:57.400
Don't broadcast channel down guys.
Right for you Wednesdays.

1952
01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:03.640
Oh my God.
How many people?
Holy Shit.
You're telling me wasn't seven.

1953
01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.200
No.
Listen to this man.

1954
01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:10.240
They fired 67 rounds over a period of 13 seconds.

1955
01:51:10.691 --> 01:51:13.150
Killing for students and wounding nine others,

1956
01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:18.240
one of whom suffered permanent paralysis.
Holy Shit Man.

1957
01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.740
Oh,
67 fucking bullets,
man.

1958
01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:27.970
How many people shot?
Um,
total kid?

1959
01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:32.940
Four were killed and nine others were wounded.
Man.

1960
01:51:33.330 --> 01:51:35.700
Jesus Christ.
That's scary.
They just didn't,
were killed.

1961
01:51:35.701 --> 01:51:39.160
They were just taking be blowout about home,
about home.
It's Chris.

1962
01:51:39.170 --> 01:51:43.030
Where did shooting them,
man shooting them in a protest.

1963
01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:45.850
They were protesting ends.
The American invasion in Cambodia,

1964
01:51:45.851 --> 01:51:49.780
which President Richard Nixon announced in a television address on April 30th

1965
01:51:49.810 --> 01:51:53.220
other students who were shot had been working nearby or we're observing,

1966
01:51:53.221 --> 01:51:54.610
we're just protests.
Yup.

1967
01:51:54.670 --> 01:51:58.000
Other students were just observing the protest for a distance and they got shot.

1968
01:51:58.450 --> 01:52:01.030
He's got shot into a crowd.
Kids were standing outside.

1969
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:03.190
They weren't even protesting like what's going on?
Boom.

1970
01:52:03.191 --> 01:52:05.760
They get hit what they call it,
doing anything.
Their college or Kent State.

1971
01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:07.350
They're not like stopping at the airport.
Well,

1972
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:11.110
from like letting them go to Cambodia.
Yeah.
Like what do you mean?

1973
01:52:11.111 --> 01:52:13.960
Like why would that be B?
Why would they even worry about the protests?
Uh,

1974
01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:15.700
4 million or the TV,
by the way,

1975
01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:20.820
4 million students boycotted school all over the country after that.

1976
01:52:21.121 --> 01:52:25.510
Yeah.
Yeah.
There was a strike of a 4 million students.
They wouldn't go to jail.

1977
01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:26.470
They wouldn't go to schools.

1978
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:29.530
High schools and colleges and universities close throughout the United States.

1979
01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.440
That was early television due to a student's track,
a 4 million students,

1980
01:52:32.441 --> 01:52:36.040
while they had to organize that,
how it,
how the fuck did they organize that?

1981
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:38.720
4 million students had to do that with carrier pigeon back then.

1982
01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:44.500
How did they do it?
Wow.
That's,
that's how creepy our government was.

1983
01:52:44.501 --> 01:52:46.010
Just back then.
It was

1984
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.040
<v 0>so embarrassed.
I'm like,
look at all these students are on TV.
Like,
Oh boy,</v>

1985
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:53.030
we got to stop.
This is embarrassing.
That's so scary.
So scary that that happened.

1986
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:56.390
Nixon was a scary motherfucker.
Dude.
You know,
there's a book coming out.

1987
01:52:56.391 --> 01:53:00.920
It says he's gay.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Nixon gay lover,
which him let him everywhere.

1988
01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:03.790
The other professional football player came out of the closet.
Really?
Yup.

1989
01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.690
Every once in a while you get these professionals that come out,

1990
01:53:05.691 --> 01:53:07.490
they just can't do it and you're like,
oh,
they don't exist.

1991
01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:11.000
It's just not accessible.
UFC,
there's gotta be a gay one.
Oh yeah.
Well,

1992
01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:14.780
there was one dude who was on the reality show that had done a little gay porn.

1993
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:18.140
Oh yeah.
But he said that he was straight.
Was Nixon gay?
No,

1994
01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:22.100
but that doesn't stop the rumor mill.
I don't,
this ain't no,
he's not gay.

1995
01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:25.280
But the guy wrote a book on it.
And as long as you write that shit on paper,

1996
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:29.780
it's real.
If it's fun for him to be gay,
guess what?
He's gay.

1997
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.250
I don't care.
I don't care.
This study,

1998
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:36.150
these are all these scientific things to get this proven,
you know,

1999
01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.110
because sort of givens for awhile.
Then they get this proven,

2000
01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:43.460
people still quote them in their original context because scientists just don't

2001
01:53:43.461 --> 01:53:46.660
get,
but it's been turned over or it gets stuck in their brain.
Like what?

2002
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:49.280
Give me an example.
Um,
I'm trying,
I'm trying to think.

2003
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:52.130
This wouldn't be an example,
something that happened,
but like,
let's just say,
uh,

2004
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:57.560
uh,
the theory of relativity.
Has that been disproven?
No.
Um,

2005
01:53:57.561 --> 01:54:00.910
no.
I think it's been proven.
Oh,
really?
Yeah.
Um,

2006
01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.770
I don't know enough about it to explain it,
but,
no,
I don't,

2007
01:54:03.771 --> 01:54:06.380
I don't believe it's been disproven.
The idea is that,
okay,

2008
01:54:06.381 --> 01:54:07.700
how about your fast and the speed of light?

2009
01:54:07.701 --> 01:54:09.770
It's never been proven than anything was faster than the speed of light.

2010
01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:13.220
They had a subatomic particles travel faster than the speed of light,

2011
01:54:13.450 --> 01:54:16.490
but they believe that it was an error in the data.
Oh really?
Yeah.

2012
01:54:16.491 --> 01:54:19.590
Then there's a lot of speculation on that.
I don't know.
I don't know.

2013
01:54:19.930 --> 01:54:21.170
Someone's criminal intention.

2014
01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.530
We discovered from his brain a little bit bad because it was so,

2015
01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.980
it's proven so long ago,
so obviously hilarious now,
but she didn't,

2016
01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:30.800
after that years after it would be disproven.
They're like,
yeah,
but I still,

2017
01:54:30.801 --> 01:54:33.720
people would still,
scientists would still sort of quote that it like that.

2018
01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.610
He's got a big brain.
The real problem with like observing criminal intent.

2019
01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:40.190
Like what if you scan a guy's brain and go with the guy's got a criminal's
brain.

2020
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:43.190
Well what if he has morals and he leave?
We have criminal thoughts,

2021
01:54:43.191 --> 01:54:47.210
but he doesn't do it.
Every time he sees a guy,
he's like,
oh,
what does that mean?

2022
01:54:47.230 --> 01:54:50.280
Quotable this fucker and take a shit?
But he doesn't actually do anything.
Yeah,

2023
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.340
exactly.
What if he sees a girl?
I'm like,
fuck the shit,

2024
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:53.331
but he doesn't do anything.

2025
01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:56.420
And he goes home and he's a good guy and he just fucking lines his business.

2026
01:54:56.650 --> 01:54:59.630
You know those are the gym works at a stress.
How about that?

2027
01:54:59.631 --> 01:55:02.090
How about people that have criminal brains that can function,

2028
01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.820
they can figure their way through life.
People just shoplift once in a while.

2029
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:09.160
Like Richard Nixon had dirty birdie.
Hmm.

2030
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:13.280
Well,
yeah,
it seems like water.
Nixon's darkest secrets.

2031
01:55:13.281 --> 01:55:16.690
The inside story of America's most troubled president.
That's what I'm saying.

2032
01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:21.070
Saying these gang.
Really?
Yup.
He had a gay affair with Charles Bay Bay.

2033
01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:24.110
The Bozo a key Biscayne Florida banker.

2034
01:55:24.170 --> 01:55:28.760
I could 1000% so that any president was be gay.
Of course he could be gay.

2035
01:55:28.761 --> 01:55:32.120
He was so who would it surprise me more?
Uh,
uh,

2036
01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:36.710
if Clinton was gay or if Obama was gay.
Oh,
Clinton.
No question.
Right.

2037
01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.980
So that can see Obama.
You could seal all being good.
Yeah,
I can see that.

2038
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:43.740
I'm not saying that he's gay,
but it wouldn't be like,
well,
there's still go,

2039
01:55:43.741 --> 01:55:47.310
what like that.
So a lot of people that love to support Obama because he's black,

2040
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:50.550
you know,
that's the other part of it.
Whenever I see anything about Obama,

2041
01:55:50.551 --> 01:55:52.480
if I say anything bad about a violin anyway,

2042
01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:57.500
I get a lot of black people to get mad at me on Twitter.
Yeah.

2043
01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.670
They'll say you're,
you know that it's racist or something.

2044
01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:05.680
Cause sometimes we just laugh.
It's true,
right?

2045
01:56:05.681 --> 01:56:08.550
Yeah.
It's funny you can't,
you can't say anything bad about him.

2046
01:56:09.090 --> 01:56:12.080
I had to pay more.
I always got shit from that.
Yeah.
It's funny,
right?
Yeah.

2047
01:56:12.450 --> 01:56:15.130
If you say anything bad about Obama,
you're racing.
I just pay more insurance.

2048
01:56:15.131 --> 01:56:20.110
It's this,
this surgery,
it's going to cost me like $800 instead of nothing.

2049
01:56:20.170 --> 01:56:23.210
Good because of Obamacare.
They're putting in their plant.
Really?
How did,

2050
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:24.900
how did it affect you that way?
Well,

2051
01:56:24.901 --> 01:56:28.950
that because they had to hire two more people or whatever it is.

2052
01:56:28.951 --> 01:56:32.820
They only covered 90% of your stuff now instead of 100% with the copays,

2053
01:56:32.821 --> 01:56:35.520
we just paid less insurance to everybody.
But this is,

2054
01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:39.180
you have your own personal private insurance,
correct.
Through sac two.
Sac.
Yeah.

2055
01:56:39.190 --> 01:56:42.670
Okay.
And then you have a copay that became much larger.
Yeah.
They only,

2056
01:56:42.690 --> 01:56:45.570
instead of having a copay and then peg 100% of it,

2057
01:56:45.630 --> 01:56:49.470
they do the copay and then pay 90% of it.
You know,
Jacob Volkman,
the UFC fighter,

2058
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:52.590
who's the one who said he wanted to fight Obama,
like he's a chiropractor.

2059
01:56:52.650 --> 01:56:56.460
He said Obamacare is completely fucking up his business.
They visited them,

2060
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:59.940
the ca visited him.
Really the secret service rather.

2061
01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:05.890
Well,
I think he actually cost him like one of his jobs.
Uh,

2062
01:57:06.190 --> 01:57:07.830
a coach.
The secret.

2063
01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:10.650
I shouldn't say that cause I'm not exactly sure if that's true.
Yes,

2064
01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.230
I believe they did.
They had a conversation with him.
He's just,
he just won.

2065
01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:17.970
It was trying to talk shit after the,
um,
after the fight,
you know?
And then again,

2066
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:20.280
he was in another post fight interview.

2067
01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:24.600
I was interviewing him and he made a joke about Obama.
Yeah,
yeah.

2068
01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:28.800
And uh,
it was,
I don't remember the joke.
People follow and hate him blindly.

2069
01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:32.430
Obama.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's true.
I think you're right.

2070
01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:36.510
He's definitely inspired a lot of,
a lot of energy.
I feel a lot of feelings.

2071
01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:40.410
Yeah.
I don't know man.
I don't know what it's like to be president,

2072
01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:43.080
but I do know that someone was,
I forgot who it was,
was referencing,

2073
01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.720
I think it was Penn Jillette was talking to about a alpha.

2074
01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:49.470
I might not have been pendulum starting my al Franco,
even people randomly,

2075
01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:52.620
randomly.
Um,
and then he was saying that,
uh,
you know,

2076
01:57:52.621 --> 01:57:56.250
Al Franken is a politician now and just talking about how difficult it is to get

2077
01:57:56.251 --> 01:57:59.580
anything done and it's incredibly difficult to get anything done.

2078
01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:03.050
And a lot of times when people think it's like,
you know,
this big,
uh,

2079
01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:06.300
big mad conspiracy,
it's really just the fucking club stalker story.

2080
01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.560
It's just bureaucracy in general.

2081
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:11.610
But it is one of those in the Simpsons where they haven't tried to get them all

2082
01:58:11.611 --> 01:58:14.870
off those Springfield before,
uh,

2083
01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:18.510
fucking something hits on a comment,
hits them and they were like,
oh,
okay,

2084
01:58:18.511 --> 01:58:21.660
here's the bill to get everyone out of Springfield.
So then all die.

2085
01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:25.020
And somebody like,
oh,
I say we attach a free gay porn that bill.

2086
01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:29.600
And then I was like,
nope.
Rejected.
And it's over.
I think they have to um,
uh,

2087
01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:33.300
change everything over to the Internet,
including boxing scoring.

2088
01:58:33.930 --> 01:58:38.130
Did she did Manny Pacquiao,
fight,
fight.
Holy Shit.

2089
01:58:38.131 --> 01:58:41.860
That was a bad decision.
How was the fight?
It was a good fight.
The good fight.

2090
01:58:41.861 --> 01:58:43.630
Manny judges had it to,

2091
01:58:43.631 --> 01:58:47.440
judges had it to that Bradley guy who fought a good fight and he hurt his foot

2092
01:58:47.690 --> 01:58:50.290
um,
early in the fight too,
so that,
that perhaps that guy,

2093
01:58:50.291 --> 01:58:51.340
he might have broke his foot.

2094
01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:54.910
He like stepped over funny on his foot and cracked his toes and he was fucked up

2095
01:58:54.911 --> 01:58:58.000
after that.
But he still kept boxing on it.
Like,
like it was fine.

2096
01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:01.180
It was all my interest in boxing.
Well,
any last bit of it,

2097
01:59:01.210 --> 01:59:05.020
Manny Pacquiao completely out struck this guy.
I mean it was no doubt about it.

2098
01:59:05.021 --> 01:59:07.120
You look at the comp box scores,

2099
01:59:07.121 --> 01:59:10.810
he was swinging wildly and not connecting shit.
That's what that rep is.

2100
01:59:10.811 --> 01:59:12.880
That a [inaudible] was rough for boxing.
No,

2101
01:59:12.881 --> 01:59:15.730
the guys are good because a good raft,
but he's wrong.
Man.

2102
01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:18.520
He's just dead wrong man.
He was cracking that dude.

2103
01:59:18.521 --> 01:59:21.400
He wobbled him a couple of times.
The guy never hit Manny clean once.

2104
01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:23.980
He never hit Manny clean ones where like Manny was rocked.

2105
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:27.130
He got rocked a couple times.
He stumbled when he broke his foot.

2106
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:30.390
He broke his foot because he got cracked before that.
Oh really?
Gun.

2107
01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:33.340
He got nailed.
He got nailed a few times,
man,
cleanly.

2108
01:59:33.490 --> 01:59:36.940
We went back to his corner with like those eyes.
Ugh.
Of a guy who got hit.

2109
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:40.900
Manny Pacquiao is a bad motherfucker.
He touched that dude up.

2110
01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:43.870
He did knock them out though.
The guy is tough as shit.
Bradley is a tough,

2111
01:59:43.871 --> 01:59:44.681
tough motherfucker,

2112
01:59:44.681 --> 01:59:49.600
but the whole thing smells and then Bob Arum who's hilarious.
Bob Arum,

2113
01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:50.500
who was the promoter,
said,

2114
01:59:50.590 --> 01:59:53.770
I'm not going to do a rematch first I wanted an investigation.

2115
01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:57.430
That's what he said.
I demand an investigation.
Meanwhile,

2116
01:59:57.431 --> 02:00:00.370
he's me ever since both of them,
right?
Yeah.
I think he's the promoter,

2117
02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.800
but he's Manny Pacquiao is guy,
but I'm demanded an investigation.

2118
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:07.810
Mandan investigation.
Probably not going to happen as fuck.

2119
02:00:08.590 --> 02:00:12.190
He just would be hung in the wink gave the judges the wind.
Come on baby.

2120
02:00:12.191 --> 02:00:15.400
You know how much this fucker rematch is going to be worth.
Come on baby.

2121
02:00:16.050 --> 02:00:17.770
Come on baby.
I mean,

2122
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:21.400
you've got a guy who's just unstoppable guy like packy out and the way they beat

2123
02:00:21.401 --> 02:00:22.091
him as they fuck,

2124
02:00:22.091 --> 02:00:25.150
I'm out of it and then pack out vowels to come back and revenge.

2125
02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:27.810
I can't even into hands of the judges.
So he goes out there,

2126
02:00:27.811 --> 02:00:32.290
it just puts a painting or Bradley rises to the occasion and be fucking pen

2127
02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:34.840
Edgar's him and it comes back even stronger in the second fight.

2128
02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:38.410
Never takes away all doubt.
Who knows?

2129
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:40.780
It's my last bit of boxing was that one fight,

2130
02:00:40.781 --> 02:00:43.240
but they both had an not lose and now it's done.
Yeah,

2131
02:00:43.241 --> 02:00:46.750
that was another case that is waiting too long.
It was a bad fight.

2132
02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:51.010
It was bad fight.
Just,
I mean it was a good fight,
but it was a bad decision.

2133
02:00:51.011 --> 02:00:53.410
Rather it was a bad thing for boxing.

2134
02:00:53.650 --> 02:00:57.550
The idea that you could box a guy up like that and tag them,
rock them.

2135
02:00:57.730 --> 02:01:01.000
I had him winning.
Fuck man.
I watched it.

2136
02:01:02.170 --> 02:01:06.730
I watched it twice.
I had them winning.
No,
I didn't.
No,
I didn't want my line.

2137
02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:10.960
I didn't wash that twice.
What have I watched twice?
I watch something else twice.

2138
02:01:10.961 --> 02:01:13.560
It just happened.
Oh,
camp Ellenberger.

2139
02:01:13.610 --> 02:01:17.080
I watch that toys a bumpkin fused and so at the Cha,
the triple he was,

2140
02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:20.740
he said so by watching hockey and I was like,
you didn't watch it.
Yeah,
I,

2141
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:23.050
I thought I watched it twice but now I realize it hadn't.

2142
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:27.990
But when I was watching it,
I remember thinking towards the end like yeah,

2143
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.670
this guy might've won three rounds.
Wow.
Maybe,
you know,

2144
02:01:31.690 --> 02:01:35.330
some people had attended to pack out some people that had every round of pack

2145
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:36.970
yell.
Sometimes I go back when I see a rough,

2146
02:01:36.971 --> 02:01:40.250
make a crazy call in any sport like that,
a hard boundary.
You currently go back,

2147
02:01:40.251 --> 02:01:41.031
you're like,
oh yeah,

2148
02:01:41.031 --> 02:01:43.670
look at that in slow motion and you realize how great refs are.

2149
02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:45.350
I should go back and watch it again.
Yeah.

2150
02:01:45.351 --> 02:01:47.150
Cause sometimes after with emotion changed,

2151
02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:50.780
I did watch that fucking fight between Ellenberger and Cameron again.

2152
02:01:50.781 --> 02:01:54.980
Did you see that?
God,
that was crazy.
Good fight.
It's crazy fight.

2153
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:56.590
I can watch some of these in my hotel rooms.

2154
02:01:57.150 --> 02:02:00.170
<v 3>Somebody,
I think it was the Adam Hunter and I hope it was at a month.</v>

2155
02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:03.070
They said that that uh,
uh,

2156
02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:06.300
that Martin Kampmann comes from behind more than lance bass does.

2157
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:12.540
I say,

2158
02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:17.480
<v 0>I think it was Adam onto a job on her.
I'm pretty sure it was him.
If it's not,</v>

2159
02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:22.460
please forgive me.
He's the one biggest one.
Tried it consistently and make jokes.

2160
02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.110
He's doing a lot of those now.
He's,
I think it's MMA roasted.
I think that's his,

2161
02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:30.330
um,
his thing.
His Twitter account.
Yeah.

2162
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:33.530
But Dana thinks he's hilarious to triple is helping them write those.
Oh,

2163
02:02:33.531 --> 02:02:35.020
that's good man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2164
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:37.840
He knows a lot about MMA and he wrestled to the rest of them.

2165
02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:39.440
<v 3>Coaches,
coaches,
kid.</v>

2166
02:02:39.450 --> 02:02:41.940
Did he ever tell you he got in a fight with a friend of ours who will remain

2167
02:02:41.941 --> 02:02:45.370
nameless Marius,
and while they're in the fight,
the guy goes,

2168
02:02:46.110 --> 02:02:48.180
tonight we dine in Hell.

2169
02:02:48.650 --> 02:02:51.330
It's like in a fight with a guy and the guide says,

2170
02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.440
tonight we dine in Hell and rushes him.
The older guy said,

2171
02:02:55.441 --> 02:02:59.430
that guy's fighting with,
oh my God.
Oh,
hunter got in a fight with this guy.

2172
02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:03.750
By the way,
the guys that I liked,
the guy,
this is why I won't say his name.

2173
02:03:03.930 --> 02:03:08.580
I liked the other guy,
but
with these things,
I always think like,

2174
02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:13.050
just say it all the comics,
no cares.
No Way.
Rarely,
no,
I love the dude.

2175
02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:17.640
I'm not going to,
he got drunk.
Nope.
Can do it.

2176
02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:19.800
You know a lot

2177
02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:20.633
<v 0>of those,</v>

2178
02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:23.660
it's just a lot of dudes out there that don't take too well to be made fun,

2179
02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:27.660
unfortunately.
Yeah.
My Brian,
if any comments listening to this,

2180
02:03:27.661 --> 02:03:31.050
you're always able to quote me on anything.
Brilliant.
Just go for it.

2181
02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:36.670
Just go for it.
Although by the consequences,
I love it out there.

2182
02:03:36.690 --> 02:03:39.690
Live in chef here.
Are you excited about this?
A Wednesday night gig?

2183
02:03:39.930 --> 02:03:41.430
I'm super excited.
We bring in with you.

2184
02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:46.370
They have those guys in my lot to bring anybody.
I asked the one,
not one.

2185
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:52.050
They did that to me.
Once I get it,
it's like they're like,

2186
02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:53.580
they think they're taking a chance on me.

2187
02:03:53.610 --> 02:03:55.680
A lot of times they don't even know how to promote.

2188
02:03:56.290 --> 02:03:59.460
They tried to make up stories.
I'm like,
just say the Joe Rogan experience.

2189
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:03.630
Say I cook it.
No one's coming for these other things you would making up.
Yeah.

2190
02:04:03.631 --> 02:04:06.240
You got to take over the whole night bro.
You got to take over the whole night.

2191
02:04:06.241 --> 02:04:07.680
Once you do this and you it,

2192
02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:10.800
it shows that it's successful when you saw a lot of tickets,
cause I know,

2193
02:04:11.730 --> 02:04:13.530
look it's just a matter of time.

2194
02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:15.960
They said they're already happy was ticket sales.
We can advance.

2195
02:04:15.961 --> 02:04:19.100
So I'll literally be even better after the show.
You're,
you're killing him dude.

2196
02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:21.870
You're out there killing them.
It's going to be awesome.
It's great for sure.

2197
02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.300
And then once the next time you go,
listen man,
let me bring my friends,

2198
02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:26.640
like agent sends it goes,
Oh yeah exactly.

2199
02:04:26.641 --> 02:04:28.560
I did it in Dallas with Justin Lin and Shawn,

2200
02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:32.880
but it was like we could do like death squad tours where we have like the main

2201
02:04:32.881 --> 02:04:37.410
shows with all of us on it and then we do fucking satellite branches two hours

2202
02:04:37.411 --> 02:04:39.040
away.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

2203
02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:44.060
Like you are with Tripoli out in Sacramento and Joey.

2204
02:04:44.131 --> 02:04:47.050
It's with Josh McDermitt in San Jose.
You know what I'm saying?

2205
02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:50.550
Like you could do that and have shows like that all over the place.
Yeah,

2206
02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:55.860
there's a,
there's so much,
there's so many comedy fans out there.
So many.

2207
02:04:55.861 --> 02:04:58.920
It's because because of this you're able to find what your aesthetic would

2208
02:04:58.921 --> 02:05:01.350
naturally go to.
Yeah.
What's fun to listen to at work.

2209
02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:05.670
You know the type of people that talk shit about the things that you really care

2210
02:05:05.671 --> 02:05:06.241
what I mean?
Yeah.

2211
02:05:06.241 --> 02:05:08.300
But there's people in small towns that I've heard them say like,

2212
02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:09.880
I don't get to talk like that.

2213
02:05:09.881 --> 02:05:13.650
So like more than two people in my town or anybody try bringing shit up with
Bob.

2214
02:05:13.651 --> 02:05:16.240
The fucking guy runs a hardware store.
Who called the cops.
I'll think this ball.

2215
02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:17.073
I was on drugs.

2216
02:05:17.490 --> 02:05:21.420
I came over here talking to me about aunties and all this crazy shit and the

2217
02:05:21.421 --> 02:05:25.290
pineal gland.
Get the fuck out of here with that.
Had the stupid redneck accent.

2218
02:05:25.291 --> 02:05:29.070
It's always southern Neil plan tell you that,
man,

2219
02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:31.280
I don't know how to do a red neck.
That's not so,

2220
02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:34.440
but you know what they talk like that and like in like central Washington state

2221
02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.790
too.
Well not really.
You,

2222
02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.060
there's a little bit of a toying and there's the Michigan redneck.

2223
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:43.270
It's a different kinds of fuckers.
Main redneck.
Those like,

2224
02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:48.610
yeah.
But the same like I believe,
I believe there's sunlight.

2225
02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:53.640
Everything's slow as fuck up there.
Deep freeze,
eight months out of the year.

2226
02:05:53.641 --> 02:05:56.340
Everybody isn't it?
Oh well I'm blend has common.

2227
02:05:57.630 --> 02:06:00.120
I told Margie a stack up.

2228
02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:04.740
Someone knows they daily logs taking a weird accent,
you know.
Do you know,
um,

2229
02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:08.220
my friend,
um,
what the fuck was his name?
Bob Marley.
Do you know about my,

2230
02:06:08.221 --> 02:06:10.560
I've met him before.
I don't know if you don't know who Bob Marley.

2231
02:06:10.610 --> 02:06:12.270
Bob Marley is not the regular guy.

2232
02:06:12.271 --> 02:06:16.050
He's a stand up comedian from Maine and it's a,
he's a great guy.

2233
02:06:16.051 --> 02:06:21.051
I've known him since we were like open miker but Bob was like the comic in Maine

2234
02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:26.940
and their crushes in Maine
in Maine.

2235
02:06:26.941 --> 02:06:30.720
That motherfucker packs places.
He's like a huge,
huge star.
I mean,

2236
02:06:30.721 --> 02:06:32.430
he works everywhere.
I mean I've seen him at the,

2237
02:06:32.431 --> 02:06:34.210
on the list at the comedy works and uh,

2238
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:37.470
in Denver and he works all the national clubs but,

2239
02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:40.200
but in Maine he was a god damn superstar.

2240
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:43.080
He plays a city there every year like every,

2241
02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:45.930
and he'll just pack those in with so many big cities in America.

2242
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:48.720
I listened to some of this stuff too.
He's got so much main joke,

2243
02:06:48.721 --> 02:06:51.330
so much main human I malarious that's what I said.

2244
02:06:51.330 --> 02:06:54.510
A lot of comics have jokes about coffee shops because that's what I do.

2245
02:06:54.511 --> 02:06:56.530
Other the writing,
just sit there and write all the time.

2246
02:06:56.531 --> 02:07:01.470
That's why we saw jokes about airplanes too cause
that's what you write about.

2247
02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:04.830
Isn't it weird how God can just like,
just fucking take,

2248
02:07:04.831 --> 02:07:08.400
I mean he's a hilarious comic.
I could see Bob taken off anywhere.

2249
02:07:08.401 --> 02:07:10.380
He's a really nice guy too.
He's like look,

2250
02:07:10.381 --> 02:07:14.100
an easy guy to load that thing I heard where he writes in new hour or close to

2251
02:07:14.101 --> 02:07:16.980
it.
Yeah,
I believe it.
He's a funny dude,
but it's just,
it's,

2252
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:19.950
it's so weird that one state where he just talked to him.

2253
02:07:20.490 --> 02:07:22.920
They've never done it with any other comedian before.
It's not like,
oh yeah,

2254
02:07:22.921 --> 02:07:25.860
there was that other guy from Maine.
They used to tour the country.
Oh,

2255
02:07:25.861 --> 02:07:30.330
there's that guy from main news.
Count them.
Not really.
Not many,
man,
not man.

2256
02:07:30.331 --> 02:07:35.200
You're right.
Not many guys become like famous performing in Maine in any state.

2257
02:07:35.201 --> 02:07:36.040
Really?
Yeah.

2258
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.840
<v 3>It's real rare.
There's a few guys.</v>

2259
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:41.110
Larry Reed was a Chicago guy who was big [inaudible].

2260
02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:42.700
You'll have a couple of big guys sometimes.

2261
02:07:42.701 --> 02:07:46.840
I think Austin has a bunch of guys still to this day,
like Steve Sweeney,

2262
02:07:46.841 --> 02:07:49.920
if he does a show still to this day,
sales race is out on the weekends.

2263
02:07:49.921 --> 02:07:53.350
I'm really,
yeah,
he's been around forever.
He's awesome.
Still Hilarious,

2264
02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:55.870
but he's a little for a living now.
Usually he does ray,

2265
02:07:55.871 --> 02:07:59.140
he's been on a lot of radio shows.
He's does a morning radio,

2266
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:00.850
but he does stand up to,
you know,

2267
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:03.400
they can make enough money just doing a few gigs a week.

2268
02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:06.370
I always wonder what those guys do.
After a certain amount of time.

2269
02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:08.860
Big problem with those guys that you stay alive.

2270
02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:12.850
A lot of those guys get hit with taxes.
Uh,
because,
uh,

2271
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:15.400
during the heyday of the 80s,

2272
02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:18.410
the lot of those dudes were getting paid in cash and cocaine.

2273
02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:21.580
What's the percentage of pay when you have,
when you got that and coke?

2274
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:24.400
Nobody ever offered me the coke pay.
Nobody did.
No.

2275
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.800
To me it was always just a rumor.
I'd heard about the coke pay,

2276
02:08:26.801 --> 02:08:30.300
but I'd never actually seen it.
And the trust itself and the coat,

2277
02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:34.380
they wouldn't think.
Yeah.
Nope.
Never,
never did it.
So I didn't,
I never,

2278
02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.400
never saw it.
But man,
there was stories.

2279
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:40.150
There are stories of guys getting completely paid in coke.
How do you want it?

2280
02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:43.270
You know,
they'd ask you how you want it.
You want in coke?
They're like,
what?

2281
02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:48.760
Give it to you and go,
I couldn't believe the first time the club owner was like,

2282
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.680
Hey,
do you want me?
It's just like a future money.
It was like,

2283
02:08:50.681 --> 02:08:54.970
I'm gonna pay you off the books.
And I was like,
Oh yes,
you kidding me?
Wow.

2284
02:08:54.971 --> 02:08:57.670
They can do that.
How can they do that?
It's like petty cash or something.

2285
02:08:57.810 --> 02:08:59.350
Wasn't it enough to like really worn it.

2286
02:08:59.351 --> 02:09:03.360
It was only 500 bucks and when he does that disease I make an extra one 50 why

2287
02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:06.760
don't have to pay just like that?
Yeah.
She was like,
fuck you up.

2288
02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:08.260
You're saying it on the Internet.

2289
02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:13.180
I'll say the exact club catch a rising star Vegas.
It wasn't that.

2290
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:17.200
I think they're out of business.
It's actually perfect.
That's lasted.

2291
02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:22.430
You usually book catch what?
We used to go,
I made up capstone out of business.

2292
02:09:22.810 --> 02:09:26.020
The last stop in Houston was the fucking,
the best spot for that.

2293
02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:27.370
It was the same guy by the way.

2294
02:09:27.371 --> 02:09:31.600
Who did it as accused me of lying to him the next year I came back and they had

2295
02:09:31.601 --> 02:09:33.530
to put me on the phone cause they were like,
how much you get paid?
I'm like,

2296
02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:37.660
I told them how much it was like it's this much and then he goes and goes up.

2297
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:38.400
They put me on the phone with,

2298
02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.750
because I don't believe it was no way you got paid that much.
I'm like,

2299
02:09:40.810 --> 02:09:45.440
I got paid this much last year.
And he goes,
you're a liar.
You're lying to me one.

2300
02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:48.760
I was like,
all right.
I'm like,
Rogan will pay me either way.
When I got home,

2301
02:09:48.761 --> 02:09:52.510
I don't care.
Oh yeah,
you were the choker.
He does.
Yeah.
That was dumb.
Yeah.

2302
02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:55.150
And they looked it up.
They saw,
they pay me the exact same amount last year.

2303
02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:59.920
No apology.
Wow.
For calling me a liar.
No,
Paul.
Not like,
Oh man,

2304
02:09:59.921 --> 02:10:02.940
you're right.
I,
you got to understand.
I've never paid though people,

2305
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:04.740
people that much.
Why don't we weird?
Nothing.

2306
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:08.140
He's just so used to dealing with assholes.
Or is he just an asshole?

2307
02:10:08.170 --> 02:10:12.120
Which one is it?
What?
What are you doing is,
oh,
he's trying to figure out.
It is.

2308
02:10:12.130 --> 02:10:15.940
I thought you were talking about next.
My thanks.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I can't tell you.

2309
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:21.400
Yes.
Hi.
Um,
yeah,
he had a,

2310
02:10:21.401 --> 02:10:25.030
that guys had to answer.
Do you guys do around the issues?

2311
02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:27.250
He had issues with other people that I know as well.

2312
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:30.730
Did you hear about that guy from,
from Tempe?
Yes.

2313
02:10:30.731 --> 02:10:33.140
We've been talking about that at all.
No,
we haven't.
We should talk about that.

2314
02:10:33.141 --> 02:10:37.240
Yeah,
yeah.
Go ahead.
Tell the story.
This guy on the Tempe Improv.
Yup.

2315
02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:39.740
Mark Anderson.
Um,
I'll,

2316
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:43.340
I'll say his name because these facts don't matter anymore.
Not Anymore.
Um,

2317
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:45.500
he only tap him for a long time.
Big Christian.

2318
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:48.080
I believe he was one of the guys wouldn't let us drink on stage and we've said

2319
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:51.650
it was like state law and you're like,
state law really doesn't make sense.

2320
02:10:51.650 --> 02:10:53.870
It's so funny what your later like,
oh,
okay.
It's the Christian thing.

2321
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:58.700
You don't want me to drinking.
Staying up live came in the Improv.

2322
02:10:58.701 --> 02:11:00.870
People who won't stand up.
I've came in and said,
hey,
we're going to open up.

2323
02:11:00.871 --> 02:11:03.320
Do you want to go and visit with us?
He goes,
no,
I have a place ready.
And it goes,

2324
02:11:03.321 --> 02:11:03.561
okay,

2325
02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:05.930
well then we're going to open up and we're going to use all your stuff and he's

2326
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:10.430
took the hard line and then stand up.
I took all their business and he was upset.

2327
02:11:10.431 --> 02:11:12.710
They share proprietary information,

2328
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:15.410
which is pretty much just how much do you pay these comics?
Uh,

2329
02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:19.640
wrote this diatribe online saying we're shutting the Tempe Improv doors down as

2330
02:11:19.641 --> 02:11:23.160
of June 1st,
just 10 days ago.
Right.
Um,

2331
02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:24.740
and then promptly went missing

2332
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:31.250
for three weeks until
what happened?

2333
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:34.430
They found his body.
They found his body.
Where do they find it?
In a hotel room.

2334
02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.930
Yeah.
What happened to the definitely suicide when I,
when I said he was missing,

2335
02:11:38.931 --> 02:11:40.780
I was like,
that's a tough one more.
Oh,

2336
02:11:41.090 --> 02:11:44.150
we're both looking at each other a lot of mental problems.
He did.
Yeah.

2337
02:11:44.151 --> 02:11:46.130
He asks us a date.
He,
uh,

2338
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:50.930
like I forget he's somebody's first day there isn't or something that he said

2339
02:11:50.931 --> 02:11:53.610
that he,
he assassinated JFK or something.
Oh yeah.

2340
02:11:53.630 --> 02:11:57.020
He had some mental issues earlier.
Wait a minute.
What?
But traumatic experience,

2341
02:11:57.021 --> 02:11:59.000
I don't know if was that,
but he had some mental issues earlier,

2342
02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:02.210
psychotic breaks or small psychotic breaks that he's recovered from,

2343
02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:04.730
but big emotional,
traumatic experience.

2344
02:12:04.731 --> 02:12:08.330
Send people into these depressive moments that,
I don't know,

2345
02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:13.310
I don't like something like that.
That was so crazy that it was like,
whoa.

2346
02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:15.360
Oh Man.
As soon as anyone missing.

2347
02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:19.220
I was like definite suicide before they found up dead.
I wasn't surprised at all.

2348
02:12:19.230 --> 02:12:20.060
The,

2349
02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:24.950
the new club essentially just came in and just open up a better club,

2350
02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:29.510
bigger anyway and more modern,
better cooler part of town a little bit.

2351
02:12:29.630 --> 02:12:32.120
And they said,
come into business with us.
We're opening up this new thing.

2352
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:33.840
He said,
no.
Um,

2353
02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:36.350
so they got the other guy to come help them open when they fired him again,

2354
02:12:36.770 --> 02:12:40.250
I don't know.
It was just hilarious.
And then Dan Hill,
they're like,

2355
02:12:40.251 --> 02:12:43.340
come help us like gold.
Thanks for help by uh,
uh,

2356
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:46.250
but they opened up this beautiful good 600 seats instead of the four fifths of

2357
02:12:46.251 --> 02:12:47.150
the,
of the club had,
well,

2358
02:12:47.151 --> 02:12:49.310
they probably just dealt with them and realizing he was fucking,

2359
02:12:49.530 --> 02:12:52.700
but it was these people from la live where people who own the Improv's,
right.

2360
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:55.580
So they knew how much they were paying these comics.
So he's like,

2361
02:12:55.581 --> 02:12:58.040
you shouldn't have shared that with this new place.
Stand up live and look,

2362
02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:00.230
we're going to share it with ourselves.
And he goes,

2363
02:13:00.231 --> 02:13:02.240
that's how you were able to get these other acts cause you know how much they

2364
02:13:02.241 --> 02:13:05.630
were being paid.
But my theory is comics too.

2365
02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:07.370
You should all just tell each other how much you get paid.

2366
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:10.160
I want you to be secret about it.
If they ask,

2367
02:13:10.161 --> 02:13:11.810
if you want to know how much to ask for some club,

2368
02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:15.350
let me know what's a jumping off ground.
Well you need a booking guy,

2369
02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:18.110
do all that shit.
Really,
you shouldn't have to deal with it yourself.

2370
02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.160
That process of wondering how much you getting paid and thinking about money

2371
02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:26.130
that takes away from the creative process,
but early on we were like,
how?

2372
02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:31.130
How much do you charge for this?
Yeah,
it's hard when you're doing it yourself.

2373
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:32.130
Yeah.
You,
once

2374
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.830
<v 0>you develop a draw,
what you pretty much have now,</v>

2375
02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:38.490
then you should start negotiating door deals and he started in Nicole say like,

2376
02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:43.500
I'll take 60% or more depending on the place and what it is.
And the said it,

2377
02:13:43.501 --> 02:13:46.380
one of the places they were like,
okay,
we'll offer you this much.
He goes,
no,

2378
02:13:46.381 --> 02:13:48.660
it's okay if you can give you 60% of the door,

2379
02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:52.260
but I have my own guy clicking in every single person that comes in and they go,

2380
02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:56.790
no,
we'll give you your original
cause.
Like,
well under those rules,

2381
02:13:56.791 --> 02:14:01.320
how can we call it the head count?
Everybody?
Yeah,
on the level there's no way.

2382
02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:05.400
Well there was a guy who was at the,
uh,
I don't want to say the club.
And he said,

2383
02:14:05.730 --> 02:14:09.390
yeah.
So kind of protecting these people who are just robbing comics.

2384
02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:13.080
He realized that there was more people in there.

2385
02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:15.390
Then the club owner was telling him and he had a door deal.

2386
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:20.410
So he made everybody say a number one,
two,
three,
four,

2387
02:14:20.430 --> 02:14:22.790
all in once you said your number,
don't know what else.

2388
02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:25.530
Say a number and let's see how many people are here.
I think we could do this,

2389
02:14:25.531 --> 02:14:28.370
this will be fun.
So he did it as like a fun thing for the audience.

2390
02:14:28.371 --> 02:14:30.900
I mean I did the door,
it's like 500 he was like,

2391
02:14:30.901 --> 02:14:33.900
what the fuck are the 330 seat club?
He got,

2392
02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:39.140
this is like 500 plus people in there and he thought he got there.

2393
02:14:39.181 --> 02:14:40.950
I was like,
this is not 300 people.

2394
02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:43.760
Somebody got in trouble once for telling us how many seats there was like,
Oh,

2395
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:44.890
I'm actually not supposed to other comics.

2396
02:14:44.970 --> 02:14:48.480
Like why would you not supposed to tell the comics?
Yeah,

2397
02:14:48.481 --> 02:14:50.580
how many seats there are and the comedy club.

2398
02:14:50.610 --> 02:14:54.080
Well someone told me you told it to me.
It's sort of malicious,

2399
02:14:54.081 --> 02:14:58.690
only about a certain club you know and has more seats here than they say,
yeah

2400
02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:06.620
I should be running this beef.
That was another thing and thing with it.

2401
02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:11.520
You were gonna get some big bonus.
You get a bonus for sell out sometimes,

2402
02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:14.100
but everyone has and like a specific amount of people as a bonus,

2403
02:15:14.101 --> 02:15:17.100
you get an extra 500 extra thousand dollar temping and would give you that.
Yeah.

2404
02:15:17.101 --> 02:15:20.250
But they said no bonus one time.
And then Tate was whether it goes,
wait,

2405
02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:22.230
I had these eight friends that showed up and you said they couldn't come in

2406
02:15:22.231 --> 02:15:25.560
because there were sold out and now he didn't get a bonus for selling out which

2407
02:15:25.561 --> 02:15:29.790
one is it?
We for away what?
What?
What was it exactly?
And then they're like,

2408
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:33.570
oh yeah,
you're right.
That's a case I've heard a thousand times.
I'm not money.

2409
02:15:33.571 --> 02:15:36.480
But guys are like,
oh,
what about the bonus?
Like,
Oh yes.
Oh yeah,
we did a run.

2410
02:15:36.490 --> 02:15:40.020
That was back when that other dude was running it and he was crazy.
Yeah.

2411
02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:43.890
I don't know what was going on with that dude.
Don't do it.
Had issues.
Oh really?

2412
02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:48.010
Yeah.
Obviously,
you know,
and then,
you know,
that's why the Improv took him in and,

2413
02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:51.090
or the other Santa Clara took him in and then like,
get the fuck out.

2414
02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:53.310
But you think about it,
it's like,
what,

2415
02:15:53.490 --> 02:15:56.820
how would they benefit from stealing 500 bucks?
And you're like every week,

2416
02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:00.420
500 bucks to a club that might not be making as much money as you think.
Yeah.

2417
02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:02.700
Yeah,
it's usually a guy,

2418
02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:05.890
it's usually just going to make an extra 25 grand a year by just saying they're

2419
02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:07.470
honest and telling the improv chain they did.

2420
02:16:07.770 --> 02:16:11.630
There's a few guys in our reputations for being a little sleazy with money and

2421
02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:14.340
not telling the truth about sell outs and stuff like that,

2422
02:16:14.341 --> 02:16:17.090
but the thing is you can't pay attention all that shit.
You can't.

2423
02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.890
You got to just get to the point.
We were selling so many tickets.

2424
02:16:19.891 --> 02:16:21.930
Every show is a sell out so you don't have to worry about it.

2425
02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:25.720
That's what they told me,
not in Philadelphia about youth specifically were like,

2426
02:16:25.721 --> 02:16:29.070
he won't raise the ticket price so we know exactly how many seats we have.

2427
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:31.000
They will all be taken.
Then we can just say,

2428
02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:33.850
here's how much we're going to pay you.
There's no surprises there.
Yeah,

2429
02:16:33.851 --> 02:16:36.160
it's a good deal that Philadelphia places is awesome to,

2430
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:39.160
helium is one of my favorite places to do and then it's a good place to go and

2431
02:16:39.161 --> 02:16:43.210
fuck around there.
Like Fun,
lighthearted people in a fun way.
They're rowdy,

2432
02:16:43.211 --> 02:16:47.080
the smart.
That's a good place to go.
But yeah,
that's uh,
that's the way to do it.

2433
02:16:47.081 --> 02:16:47.321
I mean,

2434
02:16:47.321 --> 02:16:50.710
we've been doing it for so long that way where we just go and take over a place.

2435
02:16:50.711 --> 02:16:53.050
You kind of forget that this is not the way most places,

2436
02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.570
most places have their local guys.
That week is different week.
Yeah.

2437
02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:59.410
I was begging this guy last time I was there to take his girlfriend to go to the

2438
02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:02.740
bathroom to go fucker.
Whoa.
She wanted to so bad and was like,
we can,

2439
02:17:03.010 --> 02:17:05.630
she was like all over him drunk.
Just all,

2440
02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:09.130
it just kept kissing his neck in the front row.
I think I'll just go,
oh no,

2441
02:17:09.131 --> 02:17:12.190
you can't just take our crowd.
Why not just people.

2442
02:17:12.191 --> 02:17:17.060
Are People going to go jack off by the door or something?
Rose Man.

2443
02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:24.410
Do you imagine that they actually just get hung up and run out and actually go

2444
02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:26.530
somewhere and everybody cheered him on?
That'd be great.

2445
02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.830
He'd probably make the Huffington Post.
Oh,
that'd be nice.
The Huffington post.

2446
02:17:29.831 --> 02:17:33.400
That sounds true.
When they arrested you for participating in sex act,

2447
02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:36.840
you were the administrator or director of a subject.

2448
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:40.990
I'll be like with new monitor.
Lenny,
Bruce,
Fran,
San Fran.
He can get away with it.

2449
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:43.510
Oh yeah.
They have a lot of sex acts that they have sex acts there.
Yeah.

2450
02:17:43.511 --> 02:17:46.260
You can go and watch like girls jam dildos in themselves.

2451
02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:51.880
True Fest Is July 21st 20 seconds.
We went down.

2452
02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:55.900
This place wants me and Brian shroom fast.
Yeah.
Oh No.

2453
02:17:55.901 --> 02:17:58.990
I went to one of those took off places.
Oh,
and shrimp fest by the way,

2454
02:17:58.991 --> 02:18:03.570
is taking place while you and I are in Calgary.
Right?
Well,

2455
02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:06.000
they're not that type of perform.
Well,
not be for sure.

2456
02:18:06.001 --> 02:18:08.110
I'm first starting at midnight after we perform,

2457
02:18:08.111 --> 02:18:12.980
so the 21st it starts 21st 21st 22nd and 23rd that's what it is,

2458
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.801
but by all means,

2459
02:18:14.801 --> 02:18:18.400
if you were to take mushrooms before the show and just think it would continue

2460
02:18:18.401 --> 02:18:20.710
until after midnight,
that would totally count in my book.

2461
02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:23.530
I got this new bit on the nature of reality.
That might be a little too slippery.

2462
02:18:23.531 --> 02:18:25.460
If you come to the show on mushrooms.
I'm just going to really,

2463
02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:29.790
La Library Library.

2464
02:18:31.690 --> 02:18:34.760
Yeah.
Get yourself now,
celebrate all over the world.
Be a part of showing first,

2465
02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:36.010
I'll tell you what it is now a good movie,

2466
02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:41.120
but from atheist you didn't like it said it's like a soap opera,

2467
02:18:41.260 --> 02:18:42.520
like a girl,
a chick flick.

2468
02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:46.290
Saifai well a lot of people got mad at me so you don't understand it and this

2469
02:18:46.291 --> 02:18:47.111
and that.
There's,

2470
02:18:47.111 --> 02:18:50.740
there's a bunch of cut the shit scenes in that movie that I won't,
I won't.

2471
02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.770
Oilers [inaudible] a movie for me.
I really wanted to watch this movie.

2472
02:18:56.771 --> 02:18:57.610
I looked forward to it.

2473
02:18:57.611 --> 02:19:00.670
I was joking around that everyday was downtime to permeate came out.

2474
02:19:00.671 --> 02:19:03.820
I went on a double date with Mrs Rogan and her sister.

2475
02:19:03.821 --> 02:19:06.960
We had a great fucking time all night.
Went to that stupid movie and like just

2476
02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.650
really what happened.

2477
02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.970
Talk to me about the movie comes out cause they're all still so jack number,

2478
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:17.770
star wars one.
And that came out,
I've already for a week or two.

2479
02:19:17.771 --> 02:19:20.260
It was like that was awesome until it slowly started to seep into their,

2480
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:24.520
Brian's like,
no,
that was dog shit.
Star wars one was dog shit or whatever.

2481
02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:27.100
The new one came out 10 years ago.
Jesus Christ.

2482
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:29.810
Thought you were talking about when star wars came out.
Oh,
by the way,

2483
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:32.660
don't look at star wars again.
Oh,
it looks terrible.
No,
watch it.
Yeah,

2484
02:19:32.661 --> 02:19:36.140
it's terrible now,
but we horny acting weird.
A different Arab row.

2485
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:38.120
It's a completely different era.
But yeah,

2486
02:19:38.121 --> 02:19:41.480
those doors came out and it took two weeks before we were all like,
oh yeah,

2487
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:45.110
I didn't like the new star wars when then whatever it was the kid trying to be

2488
02:19:45.111 --> 02:19:48.190
like Yoda with the our banks and all that shit was light lightsaber right.

2489
02:19:48.191 --> 02:19:52.550
Wasn't that awesome?
That was Sorta,
it was wag.
So permit the same way.

2490
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:55.580
I think people are still trying to fuck.
I looked forward to this movie,

2491
02:19:55.581 --> 02:19:59.680
but there was so many scenes and then we like,
wait,
come.
What the fuck?

2492
02:19:59.810 --> 02:20:04.410
What are you doing?
You dirty rat?
Yeah.

2493
02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:05.300
It takes you out of it.

2494
02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:07.880
I don't want to say anything because I don't want to give away any spoilers,

2495
02:20:07.881 --> 02:20:10.010
but I,
I wanted a light to it takes you out of it.

2496
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:11.780
That's why waiting to talk about it.
Sorry,

2497
02:20:11.781 --> 02:20:13.780
I can't wait until everybody's seen it so we can dog them.

2498
02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:17.420
If you got like a month and you can just go after a month,
I can talk about it.

2499
02:20:17.421 --> 02:20:20.930
Yeah.
Okay.
That's enough of a spoiler time.
Brian,
does that sound right?

2500
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:23.660
How long would you say?
Not Years.
I don't know.

2501
02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:25.470
I'm just want to talk about karate right now.

2502
02:20:25.471 --> 02:20:30.320
You can talk about the end of karate kid.
You just got to say,
spoiler,
spoiler,

2503
02:20:30.321 --> 02:20:34.850
spoiler,
and then say it.
So listen folks,
this is a spoiler.
Spoiler,

2504
02:20:34.851 --> 02:20:37.420
spoiler.
Well,
don't tell him no.
Yeah,
but next time when you do it,

2505
02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:41.590
next time in a month,
I'm going to give it a month.
I got,
I like it.

2506
02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:44.540
It could have been great,
man.
It had some potential visually.

2507
02:20:44.541 --> 02:20:48.050
It's fucking stunning,
man.
I want the coupled with a great story.

2508
02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:53.180
I think it's really hard to make a big budget movie and not have it be dog shit.

2509
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:56.510
I think it's really hard.
I think you fight so many different people.

2510
02:20:56.511 --> 02:21:01.470
Some just wanting to,
nitric wanting to,
or Greg.
Yeah.
Hmm.
I wonder,

2511
02:21:01.471 --> 02:21:04.220
I wonder what happened,
but how bad was matrix three?
Right.

2512
02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:06.830
Kind of ruined the whole thing for you,
right?
It's like,
what happened here?

2513
02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:10.490
What did you guys do?
Did you just throw this one together?
It's so bad.

2514
02:21:10.491 --> 02:21:14.210
Some weird Jesus correlation thing that was going on.

2515
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:16.160
He didn't quite get what by the way,

2516
02:21:16.161 --> 02:21:19.970
there's a Jesus correlation thing going on in this movie as well.
Oh really?
Yeah.

2517
02:21:20.050 --> 02:21:23.540
Are a lot of people missed?
It's very baffling.
I,
there's a,

2518
02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:26.870
there's like interviews with Ridley Scott about the hidden symbols,

2519
02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:31.040
symbolism in the movie and what it really means of this movie.
Yeah.
What's the,

2520
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:32.500
what's the subtext?
Okay.

2521
02:21:32.580 --> 02:21:35.030
My feelings is you could have hidden symbolism if you want,

2522
02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:39.590
but the main text has to be true.
Yeah.
When you see a tanty no movie,

2523
02:21:39.591 --> 02:21:43.180
he might be saying shit about relationships and the power of one man opened up,

2524
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:45.800
but making it bad ass action scene and you know,

2525
02:21:45.801 --> 02:21:49.430
here's another part is a CGI works great for monsters,

2526
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:52.400
but they haven't quite got it together.
For people.
For humans.

2527
02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:56.300
They just have cartoonish.
Whenever they fly in job or wave their arms,

2528
02:21:56.301 --> 02:21:59.440
it looks like there was stretched out.
The movements are there.

2529
02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:03.680
They're not real weird.
It's weird.
Spiderman,
that's,
we weren't Spiderman for me,

2530
02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.200
like um,
land of uh,
no,
not land.

2531
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:10.910
The lost the fuck is walks fucking I am legend.

2532
02:22:10.970 --> 02:22:14.780
Oh yeah,
I am legend.
Those things there were obviously fake.
Yeah.

2533
02:22:14.890 --> 02:22:18.620
We kinda cool looking cool.
Looking from carrying the club.
We like,
come on man,

2534
02:22:18.621 --> 02:22:20.130
that's fake as fuck.
But I was willing to,

2535
02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:23.600
I was willing to accept that for the fun of the movie.
It was a great movie.

2536
02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:26.130
It was way better movie than this movie.
I am

2537
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:30.510
<v 3>legend.
I am.
Legend was a pretty fucking sporty movie.
It was a lot better than,</v>

2538
02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:31.643
in my opinion.

2539
02:22:31.860 --> 02:22:34.830
It just didn't leave me with so much behind at the end of it where I was like,

2540
02:22:35.390 --> 02:22:38.700
you got it.
You hope that girl makes it to where she's gone.
Why

2541
02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:44.970
legend?
But you're like,
but I get it.
You know,
it was cool.

2542
02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:47.520
He was a man living alone for a while.
Once you get to see a little bit.

2543
02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:51.780
It was great.
Yeah.
He was an awesome actor too.
He did a great job in that movie.

2544
02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:53.940
He's pretty much couldn't do anything right now.
Yeah,
he's great.

2545
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:56.200
When he was pretending to be going crazy,
you know,

2546
02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:59.220
because he wasn't talking to people.
Oh really?
Yeah,

2547
02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:04.020
and he was pretending he did a great job of it.
Oh yeah.
It was really good,

2548
02:23:04.050 --> 02:23:04.291
you know,

2549
02:23:04.291 --> 02:23:09.060
and the way he was protecting himself by hiding from these fucking things at

2550
02:23:09.061 --> 02:23:12.670
night and had everything rigged.
Oh yeah.
It was pretty bad ass,
man.
That was it.

2551
02:23:12.671 --> 02:23:16.110
That was a bad ass.
And you could only work during the day.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2552
02:23:16.111 --> 02:23:17.190
What's a good,
sorry?
Moving.
Yeah.

2553
02:23:17.191 --> 02:23:20.400
He'd go around the stores and take canned goods and shit and cook food and then

2554
02:23:20.401 --> 02:23:24.430
he would have to fuck him.
He's locked down at night and kind of bathtub.
Yeah.

2555
02:23:24.450 --> 02:23:28.320
What the fuck man,
that was like when he had to kill it.
Yeah.
There was like,

2556
02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:33.600
oh no,
there's only friend.
So bad ass fucking movie,
man.

2557
02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:37.740
That is a bad ass movie.
Yeah.
But the CGI sort of,
it gets to,
you know,

2558
02:23:37.741 --> 02:23:39.640
you're like,
okay I know I'm watching bullshit.
Yeah.

2559
02:23:39.641 --> 02:23:42.150
But the first two thirds of it,
when you didn't see any of those guys,

2560
02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:45.180
it was like fucking cool.
CGI is weird cause it's,

2561
02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:49.200
it'll work really good for like shit that's not real.

2562
02:23:49.410 --> 02:23:53.580
Like it works really good and call it monsters when they have the catsup

2563
02:23:53.581 --> 02:23:55.540
dripping of the parties that's dripping.
It's like,
yeah,

2564
02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:59.100
it looks like it's on purpose.
Falling like the too fast right away.

2565
02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:02.220
Then speed up at the right levels or something.
Son of bitches.

2566
02:24:02.250 --> 02:24:03.960
It looks right at first.
When you look closer,

2567
02:24:04.290 --> 02:24:08.800
how long before they've CGI support,
have they done that yet?
Well they had the,

2568
02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:12.090
not animated porn but you know the,
it's not that good luck.
No.

2569
02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:14.070
Have you ever beat off to that?
No.
Scared.

2570
02:24:14.071 --> 02:24:15.650
It's a new frontier for me that I don't want to get into it.

2571
02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:19.620
You know what I mean?
And I may point you got caught watching cartoons.

2572
02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.240
You got jaw jerk off watching porn.
Like what's next?
Right.

2573
02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:27.300
So it opens up a door for you.
Yeah.
You start jerking off the cartoons,

2574
02:24:27.301 --> 02:24:31.350
you've got a problem.
It's pretty hot though.
Have you jerked off to it?

2575
02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:32.920
Probably you would have to jerk off to it.

2576
02:24:32.930 --> 02:24:34.650
You will get a boner and you would jerk off to it.

2577
02:24:34.651 --> 02:24:38.070
You know if he did or didn't I,
you know,
I'm sure I did when I was younger.

2578
02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:41.230
You sure you did when you were younger?
Back in cartoons are cuter.
Yeah,

2579
02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:45.060
like when like when I was like the classic keen or so because I mean they have

2580
02:24:45.061 --> 02:24:48.990
like hot shit like tentacles and like fucking what do you think life would be

2581
02:24:48.991 --> 02:24:50.790
like if TV was like the Internet?

2582
02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:53.700
What are you just getting free walk if you can get whatever you want on it first

2583
02:24:53.701 --> 02:24:57.250
things first,
no more accents.
No more accent would all go away.

2584
02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:01.320
You become the sameness.
Sameness.
Wow.
Really?

2585
02:25:01.650 --> 02:25:04.440
Because everyone would get everything together so everything would just go away.

2586
02:25:04.470 --> 02:25:06.900
There wouldn't be regions.
You wouldn't talk like this in the south.

2587
02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:09.490
If all you're watching is southern stuff in Canada,
right.

2588
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:12.930
You will start talking like the south.
Everything would just meld together.

2589
02:25:14.010 --> 02:25:18.270
That's a theory,
right?
If everyone watched TV,
is that what he's saying?

2590
02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:24.040
But we have accents in America.
It's going to go away.
Really.

2591
02:25:24.041 --> 02:25:26.500
You think accents in America to go away.
They're all going to go away.

2592
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:29.390
How are we going to fucking find a middle ground?
How long is this going to take?

2593
02:25:29.391 --> 02:25:33.400
It's going to generations.
Probably generations.
That'd be one.

2594
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:37.600
Maybe two more cause you still have to talk about everyone around you and the

2595
02:25:37.601 --> 02:25:41.530
Internet and TV,
but soon it will be just as much internet TV,
like less and less.

2596
02:25:41.531 --> 02:25:44.390
People in the south will have accents and I will just lead to good geometric

2597
02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:46.780
rods and lab accent.
The tile and chicks have it.

2598
02:25:46.781 --> 02:25:50.260
I don't want them to lose that Shit,
man.
There's that and it's good movies,

2599
02:25:50.290 --> 02:25:52.060
especially cowboy movies.
I don't want to dude,

2600
02:25:52.061 --> 02:25:55.860
who doesn't have a fucking southern accent and a cowboy movie and that Bot to do

2601
02:25:55.861 --> 02:25:58.640
that.
If they're not to,
they'll do it.
Boston accents,

2602
02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.370
you get a girlfriend,
oh,

2603
02:26:04.430 --> 02:26:09.100
oh hey girl from Boston and Baltimore like having a conversation.

2604
02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:14.920
Baltimore in Wisconsin,
Girl.
Oh my God,

2605
02:26:14.921 --> 02:26:19.630
I did a 50 shades of gray.
Oh my God,
I was just going to bring that up.
Oh my God.

2606
02:26:19.631 --> 02:26:23.620
It gets me so hot right me toe.
How am I?

2607
02:26:23.621 --> 02:26:27.400
God Can I shut up?
Gets me hot and musty.

2608
02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:33.040
You heard of that shades of gray.
It's a new thing.
It's a new twilight.

2609
02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:36.130
Apparently it's like bondage and shit and chicks get hot and then the the

2610
02:26:36.131 --> 02:26:38.950
handsomest man in the world,
Ryan Gosling is going to be,

2611
02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:42.710
it's not one he's going to be playing up there from shades of gray.

2612
02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:46.990
Played them the main guy.
Wow.
Starting off.
I don't know who the fuck it is.

2613
02:26:46.991 --> 02:26:49.450
I don't know that works.
What if that was one of their names?

2614
02:26:49.451 --> 02:26:53.710
John Shade and that's the name of the book.
You've dummy girls dumb,

2615
02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:57.250
but you know how much faith do you have in them after twilight?
Very,
very little.

2616
02:26:57.251 --> 02:26:59.710
Very little.
That's nonsense.
They were like,

2617
02:26:59.711 --> 02:27:03.400
it's so wonderful because true love beats everything and you're like,

2618
02:27:03.401 --> 02:27:06.070
are you do you don't want realism at all and your stuff?
Huh?
New,

2619
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:10.840
but you know why he wants it made me laugh so hard and I thought about it for

2620
02:27:10.841 --> 02:27:13.570
years afterwards.
At the comedy store.
There's billboards.

2621
02:27:13.571 --> 02:27:16.570
It always gets sponsored by the same company and they'll change them and for

2622
02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:20.770
awhile,
whoever own lifetime by a calm had the one next to the house of Blues,

2623
02:27:20.771 --> 02:27:24.130
the billboard.
It was always lifetime shows and they were these cops.

2624
02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:27.040
He's like three chick cops with the holding guns up with dude.

2625
02:27:27.041 --> 02:27:29.290
Constant standing behind him and you were like,

2626
02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:33.680
lifetime is just Saifai for women.
It's just like,
what?

2627
02:27:33.681 --> 02:27:37.610
Well does this exist in three fucking tough and rumble cops?

2628
02:27:38.110 --> 02:27:41.470
The Charlie's angels like,
what are you talking about?

2629
02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:44.650
This is based on reality and she has time for a family.

2630
02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:49.180
We can do it ladies,
honey,
I'm getting my degree while I'm cooking breakfast,

2631
02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:54.640
going over papers.
I'm going to go get her woman.

2632
02:27:56.770 --> 02:27:59.320
That is,
it's real and it's like,
oh,
I love it.

2633
02:27:59.321 --> 02:28:04.090
If you would make love to a vampire,
he doesn't even have to die in the sun.

2634
02:28:04.091 --> 02:28:08.430
He just sparkles
this park on this time.

2635
02:28:09.570 --> 02:28:13.960
So beautiful.
Oh,
I think people can't trust themselves.

2636
02:28:14.050 --> 02:28:16.330
I think people need to be regulated.
When I think it is,
man,

2637
02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:19.600
this is what I'm thinking is I used to be judgmental like you are each sphere.

2638
02:28:19.930 --> 02:28:22.070
I say,
there it is.
I prefer the term

2639
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:26.390
<v 0>observant.
I like the Avengers,
Bro.
I know the Avengers is not real.</v>

2640
02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:30.680
I think when the hawk grabs Loci or Lodi or whatever the fuck his name is,
smash,

2641
02:28:30.681 --> 02:28:34.310
smash them in the ground.
My Dick grew an inch and a half.

2642
02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:40.180
It's,
I know.
I got so excited.
I was like,
yes,

2643
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:44.570
go get on the same thing,
but that violence,
real violence,
I can't even happen.
No,

2644
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:49.350
there's no pause.
There's no hulk.
You watching some fake fucking whole puny God.

2645
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:52.160
I love that shit.
It's fun.

2646
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:56.630
It brings me back to the days when I was a teenager and I was collecting comic

2647
02:28:56.631 --> 02:28:59.450
books and I'd sit around with my friends would talk about,
you know,

2648
02:28:59.451 --> 02:29:02.720
the new issues and I fucking loved comic book.

2649
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:07.750
Maybe that's why men react viscerally to twilight is because it was vampires and

2650
02:29:08.631 --> 02:29:11.360
werewolves.
That should be cool stuff.
She'll be amazing.

2651
02:29:11.361 --> 02:29:14.010
They fucked up vampires and werewolves,
so yeah,
we don't mind.

2652
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:16.760
It's okay with the long hair,
blond guy,

2653
02:29:17.930 --> 02:29:22.040
fucking fuck sharrow whatever his name is.
What's his name?
Fabio.
Fabio.

2654
02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:23.353
He comes along

2655
02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:28.220
where wasn't vampires,

2656
02:29:28.221 --> 02:29:31.580
but isn't it fascinating that it would be then it would be this morphing of a

2657
02:29:31.581 --> 02:29:34.400
man and a woman together.
It's a man with beautiful hair.

2658
02:29:34.650 --> 02:29:38.260
It's like that's what they really want himself and walked.

2659
02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:42.110
So on a muscular version of themselves,
they want you to have the same aesthetic.

2660
02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:45.020
They want you to have beautiful hair.
Then that's why they love days.

2661
02:29:45.050 --> 02:29:48.380
They want to love,
they want you to love romance.
The way a woman loves romance,

2662
02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:52.280
it's a different need to be desired than the men have.
It's completely different.

2663
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:57.050
It's amazing with men.
A lot of minutes.
Physical girls like,

2664
02:29:57.051 --> 02:30:00.420
can you take me out once forever?
And I'm like,
why would I,
what do you mean?

2665
02:30:00.620 --> 02:30:03.170
Where are we going?
Everything that's going on.
Yeah.
This is awesome.
Yeah.

2666
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:07.940
What are you talking about?
Why can't change things?
Yeah.
It's um,
it's,
it's weird,

2667
02:30:08.090 --> 02:30:11.930
but what I've learned is that you just got to deal with the fact that they like

2668
02:30:11.931 --> 02:30:15.800
different shit.
It's not you.
You can get upset.
Like when I was a kid,

2669
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:17.630
if you didn't like to kind of music that I liked,

2670
02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:20.360
we were probably going to get in a fucking argument.
You know what I mean?

2671
02:30:20.361 --> 02:30:22.460
Like if you'll look a other things though.

2672
02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:27.500
The who socks for the fucking who sucks.
Sucks you what?

2673
02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:32.750
How could you wait?
Well,
you see the who sucks.
It's not possible,

2674
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:36.470
but it's,
some people just say the who sucks and to them it sucks.

2675
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:39.770
I have friends who love the grateful dead.
I can't get into it.
I've tried.

2676
02:30:39.771 --> 02:30:42.050
I can't do it.
Here's where I'd just like rob women.

2677
02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:46.670
It's a sense of entitlement and a feeling of success that comes through.

2678
02:30:46.671 --> 02:30:49.200
No personal labor.
Okay?
Yes,
but

2679
02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:53.660
you're talking about idiots and those idiots could be women.

2680
02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:57.320
They can be Douche bag men.
They could be.
They just happen to be women.

2681
02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:58.580
You're talking about idiots.

2682
02:30:58.581 --> 02:31:00.590
There's a lot of cool chicks out there that there are there.
Are

2683
02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:05.930
they like all this shit?
It's not,
they're a damn vaginas.

2684
02:31:05.931 --> 02:31:10.400
It's a different setup.
I can't even imagine.
I don't understand it.
They like it.

2685
02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:14.690
They like it.
There's,
there's shit that people fucking liked it I don't get.

2686
02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:17.900
And somewhere along the line I've learned how to let that go and not be excited

2687
02:31:17.901 --> 02:31:21.750
about it.
It doesn't,
it doesn't matter if you like something that I don't like.

2688
02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:24.390
But when I was growing up,
man,

2689
02:31:24.391 --> 02:31:26.700
it was super important when I was growing up I was stupid.

2690
02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:29.400
We want everyone to like where you like and you also want it to be something

2691
02:31:29.401 --> 02:31:33.490
that no one else liked.
You want to be different to sort of not really.
Yeah.

2692
02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:39.330
I was too insecure to be in anything obscure.
Oh I was,
yeah I was,

2693
02:31:39.331 --> 02:31:43.390
I would like hide my obscure taste and all the information society.
No,

2694
02:31:43.420 --> 02:31:47.460
I was really insecure and I liked like kiss and some things that a lot of people

2695
02:31:47.461 --> 02:31:50.300
didn't like cause it was like bad to like that,
you know,
if you,

2696
02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:53.100
if you like kiss in the 80s you were,
you were a loser.

2697
02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:59.080
Meatheads were at their strongest and the Eighties Jersey kind of like guns and

2698
02:31:59.161 --> 02:32:02.580
roses,
just dumb rock,
you know,
van Halen.

2699
02:32:02.581 --> 02:32:06.160
It's just like with the cool people then.
Yeah.
But that's,

2700
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:10.830
you caught cut off.
He shows a meathead no,
but his fans,

2701
02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:14.610
the people that made up the metal lands when they watched the guns and roses

2702
02:32:14.611 --> 02:32:18.060
concert,
you would never want to hang out with them.
Yeah.

2703
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:21.860
Maybe just cut off Ocean Pacific tee shirts with net with like re like,

2704
02:32:21.930 --> 02:32:25.920
oh yeah.
But there's something about being in the presence.

2705
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:27.383
If I was a kid,

2706
02:32:27.610 --> 02:32:31.980
I have loved the opportunity just to be in the presence of a great band like

2707
02:32:31.981 --> 02:32:35.190
that.
How many great bands have you ever seen live?
Um,
not many.

2708
02:32:35.730 --> 02:32:39.470
I used to go to a lot of concerts,
believe it or not,
when I was a kid.
You know,

2709
02:32:39.471 --> 02:32:44.150
when I was in high school,
I got an in with a crowd of kids that,
uh,

2710
02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:48.310
we're really into going to concerts,
music festivals or music rather.

2711
02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:49.560
There's so much fun to watch.

2712
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:53.170
And I started working at a concert place just so you could watch more.
No,

2713
02:32:53.171 --> 02:32:54.740
because it was a good job.
Um,

2714
02:32:55.290 --> 02:32:58.500
me and a bunch of the dudes from my taekwondo school worked at great woods,

2715
02:32:58.501 --> 02:33:03.330
so I got to see a lot of concerts.
I'd be like out there in the,
in the like,
uh,

2716
02:33:03.390 --> 02:33:05.830
like the,
the,
there's like a,
an outside area.

2717
02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:09.240
Part of it was covered and then has a long area in the back.

2718
02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:12.630
You got to watch him here.
Yeah,
I'd watch it from their listening from there.

2719
02:33:12.631 --> 02:33:15.510
I'd go in,
I could go in sometimes and hide.
I'm like,

2720
02:33:15.511 --> 02:33:16.560
you're going to watch the concert.

2721
02:33:16.561 --> 02:33:20.160
It was like a band I wanted to see or like I saw Cosby performed there.

2722
02:33:20.161 --> 02:33:24.650
I saw Kennison performed there,
saw Rodney Dangerfield.
Rodney Dean shows,

2723
02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:29.490
went on stage with a bathrobe on naked in the bathroom and he's just hanging

2724
02:33:29.491 --> 02:33:31.140
around backstage with his bathrobe on.

2725
02:33:31.141 --> 02:33:32.690
It would go on stage with his bathrobe button.

2726
02:33:32.691 --> 02:33:35.850
That's how you would do stats because he didn't give up the ultimate,

2727
02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:39.180
it was just like,
I've got this presence that people don't judge me.

2728
02:33:39.210 --> 02:33:43.530
I hear to use to smoke pot all the time.
Cops for gave him for it.

2729
02:33:43.531 --> 02:33:46.540
Rodney Dangerfield man,
he's brilliant.
And he would,
uh,
up.
Yeah,

2730
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:49.260
he would be hanging out backstage is balls are hanging out and shit.

2731
02:33:49.261 --> 02:33:51.830
I didn't go backstage.
I didn't see him,
but they were telling me they're dudes.

2732
02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:55.740
We're calling the radio cracking up.
Rodney Dangerfield sat here,
balls,

2733
02:33:55.741 --> 02:33:59.520
ass naked as and nuts are hanging out and he's got a robot and he's about to go

2734
02:33:59.521 --> 02:34:02.370
rock 15,000 people.
There you have.
It was like,

2735
02:34:02.371 --> 02:34:04.410
why not just do it with your friends?
It's more fun that way.
He was like,

2736
02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:07.440
well I get dressed well I,
well,
yeah,
totally.

2737
02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:10.260
Well that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do with my friends cause I saw

2738
02:34:10.261 --> 02:34:13.430
Kennison there.
I saw Kennesaw and Greg Woods and he would do this,
uh,

2739
02:34:13.530 --> 02:34:16.700
the outlaws.
Wow.
I have one of these.

2740
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:19.480
I have a poster from outlasts.
Oh,
that's cool.

2741
02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:23.970
<v 9>Underneath the fridge.</v>

2742
02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:29.660
<v 0>It's hidden back there somewhere.
Oh,
that's really cool.
Yeah,
it does.
Outlaws.</v>

2743
02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:30.980
You hear that stuff about them.

2744
02:34:30.981 --> 02:34:33.830
I'll party and go and do whatever they want and taking over a town for a little

2745
02:34:33.831 --> 02:34:37.600
bit.
It was just like,
wow.
Just seems interesting.
Wow.

2746
02:34:37.610 --> 02:34:39.560
Well they seem like they had a lot of fun to me.

2747
02:34:39.561 --> 02:34:42.530
What I liked about it is it seemed like,
you know,
like that's how you do it.

2748
02:34:42.531 --> 02:34:43.940
You do it as a group.
You know?

2749
02:34:43.941 --> 02:34:47.930
That was one of the reasons why when I started taking guys on the road with me,

2750
02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:50.210
you know,
at one point in time we got really big.

2751
02:34:50.211 --> 02:34:51.210
Like I remember we were taking a look,

2752
02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:56.090
a ton of people in the road [inaudible] me take Eddie,
you Diaz,

2753
02:34:56.430 --> 02:34:59.750
we would have shows like it's not even enough room in the van.
Yeah,
it was new.

2754
02:34:59.751 --> 02:35:03.410
We have to get cargo vans and shit.
Well,
when we trimmed down,

2755
02:35:03.890 --> 02:35:07.520
it was a little more manageable,
but it's just way,
it's way more fun.

2756
02:35:07.850 --> 02:35:09.290
It's way more fun to do it that way.

2757
02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:12.620
I remember the first time when I started going,
okay,

2758
02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:16.390
how bad was I when I,
when I started going on the road with them,

2759
02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:20.800
because I see sometimes like newer comics are like five year comments that are

2760
02:35:20.801 --> 02:35:24.310
proficient but so fucking shitty.
At the same time.

2761
02:35:24.370 --> 02:35:26.050
You had some really good jokes,
man,

2762
02:35:26.210 --> 02:35:28.690
mixed in with some jokes where you were just reaching a little,

2763
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:33.160
but you figured it out.
You're a smart dude,
you will,
you,
uh,
you know,

2764
02:35:33.161 --> 02:35:36.400
you would analyze your material and you would try new shit and you would go

2765
02:35:36.401 --> 02:35:39.100
pretty far out there to try a bit.
And if it didn't work,
didn't work.

2766
02:35:39.101 --> 02:35:41.620
And now you know,
and start from scratch.
But you,

2767
02:35:41.621 --> 02:35:44.800
you had the most important things.
You had something,
you know,

2768
02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:48.700
you had something you could kill,
you could,
you could nail it.
I use words like,

2769
02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:52.390
I just use the awful segues there.
Just obvious.

2770
02:35:52.391 --> 02:35:55.630
And like you had to get comfortable.
It takes a while to get com.

2771
02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:58.450
It takes a while to really think about what you're actually doing to,

2772
02:35:58.480 --> 02:35:59.313
what are you doing?

2773
02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:04.360
Trying to introduce thoughts as cleanly and easily into people's heads and get

2774
02:36:04.361 --> 02:36:07.720
them to see your point of view on things while laughing.
And it has to be,

2775
02:36:07.721 --> 02:36:08.240
you know,

2776
02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:12.400
so you also have to understand yourself and how you come off to other people
too.

2777
02:36:12.430 --> 02:36:16.000
You know,
we can all come off kind of goofy and Douchey and so it's hard.

2778
02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:18.400
It's hard in that sense too.
You're,
you're just,

2779
02:36:18.460 --> 02:36:22.420
you're still insecure as a person,
you know,
you're coming into your adulthood,

2780
02:36:22.450 --> 02:36:23.470
you know,
your independence,

2781
02:36:23.471 --> 02:36:27.340
you're out there trying to make it as a comic at the same time and know dating.

2782
02:36:27.341 --> 02:36:31.090
So there's a lot of instability going on your emotions and everything is up.

2783
02:36:31.091 --> 02:36:35.440
Like it's in a toss and tumble world,
you know,
it's tricky.

2784
02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:38.110
It's a tricky thing to manage.
It's hard to be good as a comedian.

2785
02:36:38.290 --> 02:36:41.080
But you had potential,
you know,
you would,

2786
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:44.330
you would always nail like it would be like one or two like big laughs.
Well,

2787
02:36:44.331 --> 02:36:45.610
I mean if your flight's getting laughs,

2788
02:36:45.611 --> 02:36:48.190
I feel like when I watched some of the guys will open for me and it's really in

2789
02:36:48.191 --> 02:36:50.500
that four to six year range.
Right?

2790
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:55.090
It's like you know how to get laughs but it's just like they're obvious lines or

2791
02:36:55.091 --> 02:36:59.760
just sounds fake faking it a lot.
That's just because you have,
um,

2792
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:04.340
you have high standards for yourself.
You have a good work ethic and you,

2793
02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:07.240
but you can't be great from the beginning.
No,
you know,
it's just,

2794
02:37:07.241 --> 02:37:10.430
it is what it is.
But I remember when people are telling you like,

2795
02:37:10.450 --> 02:37:12.430
that guy's bad man.
No.

2796
02:37:12.431 --> 02:37:15.020
Well there was certainly some people that didn't think that you will or Dhea

2797
02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:18.410
were funny and uh,
I thought they were idiots.
Like,
you know,

2798
02:37:18.430 --> 02:37:19.930
I don't have arguments with them,
but you know,

2799
02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:21.800
they would discuss writing and it's,
and I'm going to look,

2800
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:24.980
I'm laughing so you're wrong.
You're wrong.

2801
02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:28.220
And you,
and I mean,

2802
02:37:28.221 --> 02:37:32.720
we had so many conversations about standup and about material and developing

2803
02:37:32.721 --> 02:37:35.450
material.
I knew it was just a matter of time for you to figure it out.

2804
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:38.840
You just started getting stronger and stronger once you started doing like those

2805
02:37:38.841 --> 02:37:42.020
regular sets you got,
you got way better and like a couple of months,

2806
02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:46.700
just the first from the first time you started working with me to like a couple

2807
02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:49.130
months later when we had done a bunch of big rooms or going on the road,

2808
02:37:49.131 --> 02:37:50.660
that was,
that was one of those things that people said,

2809
02:37:50.661 --> 02:37:52.970
you don't want to work on the road because it'll make you bad comment.

2810
02:37:52.971 --> 02:37:54.620
But then when I had never done it,
it was like,
well,

2811
02:37:54.621 --> 02:37:57.150
I'm only in La Comic and then I went on the road.

2812
02:37:57.260 --> 02:37:59.210
Really within a couple of months I people would be like,
all right,

2813
02:37:59.211 --> 02:38:02.440
you just stepped up a level,
like,
why don't you just move up like that?

2814
02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:03.980
It does not make you a bad comic.

2815
02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:07.820
[inaudible] can help you develop bad tricks if that's all you do,

2816
02:38:07.870 --> 02:38:12.440
if that's your mode,
if that's your mode,
but it's not my mode.
That's never been.

2817
02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:15.890
My mode is always been what is what is interesting to me?
You know,

2818
02:38:15.891 --> 02:38:20.120
and then let me,
let me try to explain that interest.
Let me turn it around.

2819
02:38:20.121 --> 02:38:23.270
La and sitting in La crowd,
you get a hipper,

2820
02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:26.750
more developed sense of how I can relate to people.

2821
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:29.500
You do until you develop your own crowd.

2822
02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:32.690
Our crowd is essentially the same crowd everywhere,
man.

2823
02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:36.370
We were talking about that Edmonton show that we did fucking awesome,

2824
02:38:36.430 --> 02:38:39.860
but it doesn't matter if you're in Edmonton or South Texas or Maine or wherever.

2825
02:38:39.861 --> 02:38:42.440
It's just these people that are into the same aesthetic.
Yes.

2826
02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:47.330
It's a bunch of likeminded folks that would be fucking supersite if aliens

2827
02:38:47.331 --> 02:38:50.660
landed or looking forward to seeing if GSP ever fights.

2828
02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:55.280
Anderson Silva probably high as fuck right now because not all the same,

2829
02:38:55.281 --> 02:38:59.560
but there's this range that they all fit into really similar.
We're,

2830
02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:03.290
we have a very specific crowd and it's the nicest fucking crowd.

2831
02:39:03.291 --> 02:39:06.380
One of the coolest things is when we perform places and they keep telling us

2832
02:39:06.381 --> 02:39:10.100
that like the people at the Ice House always say that because the Ice House is

2833
02:39:10.101 --> 02:39:13.460
nice people,
you know the owners are awesome.
Bob's awesome,

2834
02:39:13.461 --> 02:39:15.980
Sean's awesome that everybody works there is awesome.
They're just,

2835
02:39:15.981 --> 02:39:17.870
it's a real friendly environment.

2836
02:39:18.050 --> 02:39:20.750
So when they tell you you guys have the best crowds are so nice,

2837
02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:23.150
every one thing you always go,
I was always talk to the waitress,

2838
02:39:23.151 --> 02:39:25.850
especially renewing like two hours just sitting there.
I'd be like,

2839
02:39:25.851 --> 02:39:28.430
let's talk I guess,
but I was like,
how'd you do?

2840
02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:31.280
I'd always have to how they did tip wise and it was like,
it's amazing week.

2841
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:32.600
It's an amazing week.

2842
02:39:32.690 --> 02:39:36.050
And if like Asian comics or sometimes like Middle Eastern comments would go on

2843
02:39:36.890 --> 02:39:40.160
those people in general.
The cheap don't.
Yeah,
so it's like fraught.

2844
02:39:40.161 --> 02:39:43.430
So there's like opposite extremes and you were the high end.
Wow.
That's awesome.

2845
02:39:44.110 --> 02:39:46.910
Yeah.
And even where I am or I only get,
like I said,
like 20% of the crowd,

2846
02:39:46.911 --> 02:39:51.320
whatever it is,
whatever percentage it is,
it's still like overall.
They're like,

2847
02:39:51.321 --> 02:39:53.930
no,
I did really well tip wise,
percentage wise on my tips this week.

2848
02:39:54.020 --> 02:39:58.250
That's awesome.
So I feel good.
I'm like,
those are employees you want to do well.

2849
02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:01.630
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
it sounds Corny,
but we're all working together.

2850
02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:03.550
If you have asshole waitresses just to,

2851
02:40:03.551 --> 02:40:05.540
the crowd's going to feel shitty and they're not going to have fun.

2852
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:08.900
Nice waitress is make for a friendly crowd.
But comics,

2853
02:40:08.901 --> 02:40:11.660
different comics bring different crowds,
man.
It's just a fact.

2854
02:40:12.020 --> 02:40:14.340
We used to work places and they would say,
fuck,

2855
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:17.760
<v 3>this asshole just came through last week and it's crowded full of fucking
idiots.</v>

2856
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:21.050
They would,
they'd be really mad at certain people,
you know.

2857
02:40:21.490 --> 02:40:25.110
You know what I realized?
Yeah,
exactly.
He was the worst man.
That fucking guy.

2858
02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.480
I always hear that.
Hey,
I mean think one.
He is a rude,
selfish person.

2859
02:40:30.690 --> 02:40:31.710
I don't think it's related to that.

2860
02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:33.990
You don't think that just cause I've heard about some other people who were

2861
02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:38.340
super nice people.
Right.
But the crowds are off whatever TV show they're on.
Oh,

2862
02:40:38.370 --> 02:40:38.911
you know,
I mean,

2863
02:40:38.911 --> 02:40:43.110
let's say you got a job and you would have taken it early on if it was just WWF

2864
02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.080
correspondent shit,
I might take that shit tomorrow,

2865
02:40:45.570 --> 02:40:49.830
but that would get a fan base.
That might not be polite comedy type of people.

2866
02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:52.620
Yeah.
It might not be,
you know,
but it would be no fault of your own.

2867
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:57.450
Just some job.
They offered me a job in WWE and I had to wear like an outfit,

2868
02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:02.010
like a debate and a bottom,
and I did every show high as fuck.

2869
02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.790
That would be there.
It has to tell would be the,
uh,
the thing.

2870
02:41:05.791 --> 02:41:08.970
They would come to me,
I'd be in a lab concocting newer,

2871
02:41:08.971 --> 02:41:11.400
stronger marijuana that defies the test.

2872
02:41:14.370 --> 02:41:17.560
I'm screaming,
yelling,
I have tested negative again.

2873
02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:21.010
How's you to test?
Negative.

2874
02:41:22.290 --> 02:41:25.460
That'd be a whole new kind of villain and the WWE.
Yeah.

2875
02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.700
It doesn't have to wrestle any dudes.
I can be one of the outside guys.

2876
02:41:29.701 --> 02:41:30.900
I don't want to get thrown on my neck.

2877
02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:35.280
People don't realize how fucking hard that is on your body,
man.
That's fake.

2878
02:41:35.281 --> 02:41:39.510
Wrassling is super hard on your body through Piper's.
So toughened.

2879
02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:40.831
Oh yeah.
I'm sure.

2880
02:41:40.831 --> 02:41:44.060
It's like you don't have like old people's hands or like t his or her body's

2881
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:47.970
like,
oh yeah,
we got that fake fight for,
for AAA shell.

2882
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:52.080
You got to fake fight with Rowdy Roddy Piper.
Do you know?
Awesome.

2883
02:41:52.081 --> 02:41:55.200
That is so awesome to see it on TMZ later.
I was like,

2884
02:41:55.740 --> 02:42:00.570
just to say that you got to fight with Rowdy Roddy Piper.
It was so great.

2885
02:42:00.571 --> 02:42:04.260
I was crawling on my hands and knees.
The whole crowd was cheering Piper Piper.

2886
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:08.010
It was so much fun.
He played my piano with my head.

2887
02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:13.710
It was so great.
I'm so happy I was there.
Oh yeah.
Damn.

2888
02:42:13.711 --> 02:42:14.310
I missed that.

2889
02:42:14.310 --> 02:42:16.410
Did you know we're about to do or did you just see me like stand up and say

2890
02:42:16.411 --> 02:42:18.570
something?
You're like,
what are you doing?
Somebody who was right there.

2891
02:42:18.571 --> 02:42:21.210
So I'm like,
she said,
I don't know.
Yeah,
that's right.

2892
02:42:21.211 --> 02:42:23.730
You were sitting at my table and you didn't tell me about it.
And I'm like,

2893
02:42:23.731 --> 02:42:27.790
why is he standing up?
I have a question show.

2894
02:42:28.350 --> 02:42:32.520
Sam's Sam's nine shows so much fun.
He goes,
his only regret with that.
He goes,

2895
02:42:32.521 --> 02:42:33.450
I should have closed with it.

2896
02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.170
I didn't realize how much it would kill like two thirds of the way.
Another show.

2897
02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:40.710
Yeah.
It's tough to beat Rodney Roddy.

2898
02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:43.830
Defend Dana d Armand honor as a young woman.

2899
02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:48.860
Cause I as the amazing racist stuff is your or your parents rolling over in

2900
02:42:49.261 --> 02:42:52.350
their grave now cause you have sex with black eyes.
She goes,

2901
02:42:52.410 --> 02:42:57.110
my parents are still alive and you still act that way.
There's no excuses.

2902
02:42:57.780 --> 02:43:01.620
Sam's like,
we'll know and defend her.
Honor.
Hilarious.

2903
02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:04.380
She know you're going to do this.
You know,
worked it out.

2904
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:07.650
She didn't know where I was gonna say,
but she could joke wrong with you.

2905
02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:10.740
She's funny,
man.
I listened to her on Brian's podcast.
What does it now?

2906
02:43:10.741 --> 02:43:14.830
Triple squad.
Yeah,
just talking funny.
She's a funny kid.
She's funny.

2907
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:19.120
She's a weird,
she is.
She has herself.
You know what I'm saying?

2908
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:22.900
Like she's not pretending to be anything other than that.
That's be too slutty.

2909
02:43:22.901 --> 02:43:25.450
And I'm like,
you're putting on an act here.
You're right.
Yeah.

2910
02:43:25.451 --> 02:43:29.380
Your lunch and you're thinking about warm Cox and your ass at lunch.

2911
02:43:29.410 --> 02:43:32.250
Get some girls like the crusts are cut off of the sandwich that you're,

2912
02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:34.600
you're taking a picture of some girls like it though.

2913
02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.050
They really do like words on,
there are some girls that are Nymphos,

2914
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:41.520
but I know what you're saying.
Yeah.
She talks about that too.
Like she had the,

2915
02:43:41.521 --> 02:43:44.070
one of the things that she had on Twitter was a p.

2916
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:46.360
People ask me the strangest thing I've ever had in my aunts,

2917
02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:48.520
my ass answer cat toys.

2918
02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:55.330
What's that?
I don't want to touch you or do you pick your hot?

2919
02:43:56.290 --> 02:44:01.100
Yeah,
that's not good.
I'm dying.
Maybe you're becoming a firestarter.

2920
02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:04.800
Wouldn't it be awesome food poisoning,
Sun,
you know,

2921
02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:07.390
that's why I need my barracuda.
The sick fish.
Why?

2922
02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:10.960
Because I had linguine and clams and fucking Chicago.
You gotta pee again.

2923
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:14.110
Powerful.
Should for your bladder.
You and my goal boards get together again.

2924
02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.800
See who's got the stronger bladder episode?
Dehydrated from puking.

2925
02:44:17.801 --> 02:44:20.650
I haven't gotten the bathroom and I've had like a whole thing at PDL light,

2926
02:44:20.651 --> 02:44:22.960
a whole power,
Jamba juice,
the whole thing.

2927
02:44:22.961 --> 02:44:26.990
A C two o the pedialyte is the real shit.
That shit's good.

2928
02:44:26.991 --> 02:44:31.930
It's like Gatorade mix it.
It's really strong.
You know,
electrolyte replacement.

2929
02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:34.760
They use it for babies and just drink this whole thing.
Yeah,

2930
02:44:34.810 --> 02:44:38.200
you can drink the whole thing probably says though what the servings are.

2931
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:39.460
I mean I don't think it's dangerous.

2932
02:44:39.461 --> 02:44:40.990
You should drink water with it as well though.

2933
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:43.180
It's just an electrolyte replacement.

2934
02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.210
A lot of fighters drink that stuff right after they get off stage.
They,

2935
02:44:46.211 --> 02:44:48.610
a lot of them like to mix it like Dana drinks and stuff.

2936
02:44:48.611 --> 02:44:51.220
He mixes it water and that stuff.
So it's not too strong.

2937
02:44:51.790 --> 02:44:55.390
It says not to mix it on it.
So not to mix it really well.

2938
02:44:55.391 --> 02:44:57.880
I don't think he's doing it for babies for himself.

2939
02:44:58.010 --> 02:45:00.770
He's doing it for himself and I don't think he's doing it to like,
you know,

2940
02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:05.590
for health purposes.
I think it just doesn't like the taste wants too strong.

2941
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:10.390
You're going to be okay.
No,
no.
I'm gonna die.
I feel like I'm ready.
Die.
Well,

2942
02:45:10.430 --> 02:45:12.370
good news is,
you know,
got a nice new car.

2943
02:45:12.460 --> 02:45:14.530
So at least you'll be feeling good as you're driving home.

2944
02:45:15.610 --> 02:45:20.370
The good car feeling.
We'll sort of partially mitigate [inaudible].

2945
02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:23.920
I feel sick just driving around.
Yeah,
I'm trying to talk.

2946
02:45:23.921 --> 02:45:25.560
Ours should fear into eventually getting a nice quality.

2947
02:45:25.561 --> 02:45:29.320
You feel sick because her car was invented by Adolf Hitler.

2948
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:33.490
Unknown luck.
He made it.
He made it for,
there was no relation to that anymore.

2949
02:45:33.491 --> 02:45:37.260
I don't care at all.
I know is death squad made it for the Reich.
Whoa.

2950
02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:40.390
Don't confuse it too.
Don't even say that word.

2951
02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:43.240
What his death squad made it for the right answer,

2952
02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:46.480
but that's why I didn't make it.
It was for the people of Germany.

2953
02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:50.470
It wasn't for the right people going to think that you're some sort of a racist.

2954
02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:53.730
They'll know.
He's joking,
I think,
but some people will to do,

2955
02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:55.710
some people get confused.
Some people don't.

2956
02:45:56.290 --> 02:46:00.420
A lot of people don't know you're confused.
Um,
so you feel sick.

2957
02:46:00.430 --> 02:46:03.740
I got the meat sweats for the first time in Philadelphia.
What does that mean?
Uh,

2958
02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:06.520
when you just wake up,
I'll sweat.
There's just pouring sweat.

2959
02:46:06.700 --> 02:46:10.010
I feel like right now.
Have you never had it?
You've never had that meat sweats.

2960
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.150
<v 0>That's what they told me that what is in the radio the next morning?</v>

2961
02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:16.370
Are you thinking about,
I'm always thinking about cock.
So it's not that,

2962
02:46:16.850 --> 02:46:17.980
that's what gives you the needs where it's,

2963
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:19.790
can you imagine if it was just a cock thing?

2964
02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:23.950
It's like I get to tell why you sweating around us.
You're thinking about cock.

2965
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:28.210
Can you imagine if like,
if like gay men had logo of Turkey test,

2966
02:46:28.211 --> 02:46:31.460
her on the forehead will pop up when you're thinking about man,

2967
02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:33.500
like Pinocchio was the sweating thing.

2968
02:46:33.501 --> 02:46:35.240
Maybe instead of a Turkey testers just sweat.

2969
02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:38.240
They're like when they figured about managers starts pouring sweat and everybody

2970
02:46:38.241 --> 02:46:39.680
knows what the fuck man.

2971
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:43.010
That's why a lot of like weird gay shit goes down when guys are like playing

2972
02:46:43.011 --> 02:46:46.520
basketball cause everybody's sweating and you don't,
you can't detect.

2973
02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:49.760
This dude has got a boner and he's covering you from behind and he's really just

2974
02:46:49.761 --> 02:46:53.600
wants to fuck game.
Wow.
You feeling
when you're like,

2975
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:55.760
oh it's a spider sense.
I think she's bring this,

2976
02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.000
bring this pitcher home when we think this is a fun podcast to do.
Very Fun.

2977
02:46:59.510 --> 02:47:04.160
I just fucking around always same shit we wouldn't be doing anywhere.
Yeah,

2978
02:47:04.310 --> 02:47:05.000
exactly.

2979
02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:09.920
Except that it becomes someone another a show Wednesday cobb's San Francisco,

2980
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:12.500
ladies and gentlemen,
ours.
Your fears in his prime right now,

2981
02:47:12.501 --> 02:47:15.860
he's slaying them out there.
I've been working with her.
I would not,

2982
02:47:15.890 --> 02:47:18.290
I would not steer you wrong.
Go down there and check it out.

2983
02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:22.550
There's someone right fucking time.
No it wasn't.
It's a little worst thing to do.

2984
02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:23.930
Tell someone to go see someone who is not.

2985
02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:26.980
I do remember that when you use the lungs as a store and they're like an outlet

2986
02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.250
store,
it'd be like,
and they get the crowd be on your side,
you know?

2987
02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:33.740
And you'd be like,
guys,
listen,
I'm not going to lie to you.

2988
02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:38.540
There's a lot of shitty comics here,
but this next comic is not one of them.
Okay.

2989
02:47:38.541 --> 02:47:40.400
Later on I already seen a lot.
There's going to be some,

2990
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:42.470
but this guy is not one of them.
He's good.

2991
02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:46.730
And it makes people trust you more like yeah,
it's hard when you have to bring,

2992
02:47:47.090 --> 02:47:50.210
when you're doing the thing at the store where you tag team and you're going up

2993
02:47:50.211 --> 02:47:53.480
the next guy.
If you have to bring up someone to socks,
hey guys,

2994
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:57.740
well sit down cause there's a log of what you feel bad.
You know this is like,

2995
02:47:57.741 --> 02:48:01.190
especially those weird nine 30 spots.
We like,
what the fuck you get there?

2996
02:48:01.191 --> 02:48:02.160
You're like,
how'd that guy get in?

2997
02:48:02.170 --> 02:48:06.400
That's talk to get prime spots.

2998
02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:11.000
They're all nervous as shit going up.
Tough life.

2999
02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:13.640
Tough life was shit comic.
But are his fears not a shit comic?

3000
02:48:13.641 --> 02:48:16.010
He's fucking fabulous.
And you will go see him.

3001
02:48:16.850 --> 02:48:19.670
It was Wednesday and then this weekend sacrament.
I'm all over the country.

3002
02:48:19.671 --> 02:48:21.980
You guys go to already the great.com and see all my tour dates,

3003
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:26.270
Bang everywhere and we will find out tomorrow whether or not we're doing a show

3004
02:48:26.271 --> 02:48:29.000
Wednesday night.
You like,
there's no way Joe,
you're the one scheduled.

3005
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:32.100
You're not that crazy.
Yes.
There's the one scheduled.
No,

3006
02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:34.760
we don't necessarily have a long schedule.
No,
I mean on the ice house schedule.

3007
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:37.060
<v 5>Yeah there is.
Maybe.</v>

3008
02:48:37.150 --> 02:48:40.390
But we are definitely in the main room Friday at 10:30 PM

3009
02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:44.800
<v 0>yeah.
So suck that into that.
Sucked that and that's me.
I'm in town.</v>

3010
02:48:45.010 --> 02:48:48.850
So Friday 10 30 does it at the Oh great man.

3011
02:48:48.851 --> 02:48:52.930
I did an hour and seven minutes early night barbecued and I rescued some stuff

3012
02:48:52.931 --> 02:48:55.000
that I'd never done before.
It pulled it out like that.

3013
02:48:55.001 --> 02:48:58.930
I forgotten about turning a joke,
returning a joke,
turning,
turning a joke.

3014
02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:02.740
Tonya fruit.
It's like using it,
using it in a different context some other way.

3015
02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:03.731
It's not that.

3016
02:49:03.731 --> 02:49:08.080
It's some stuff that I never did before that I had written down into.

3017
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:09.750
So it wasn't,
I had to start from zero.

3018
02:49:09.751 --> 02:49:13.110
I had already written some stuff that I was dabbling with that I didn't record.

3019
02:49:13.290 --> 02:49:16.560
So a it out of an hour and seven minutes.
There's a lot of fuckery too.

3020
02:49:16.561 --> 02:49:19.350
A lot of crowd play and a lot of fun.
So it's probably,

3021
02:49:19.351 --> 02:49:22.600
I think I'm probably around a half an hour in new stuff.
Real solid new stuff.

3022
02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:25.530
Not that I can put it on an album or anything yet,

3023
02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:28.860
but stuff that I really like where it's going.
It was good enough for a crop.

3024
02:49:28.890 --> 02:49:32.290
Yeah.
Well it's going somewhere.
It's going somewhere.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
the,

3025
02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:35.730
the is not going to be released until it looks like September 1st is when the

3026
02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:38.940
new website is going to be done.
It's new website is building a new website.

3027
02:49:38.970 --> 02:49:41.700
DOPA malicious.
Ridiculous.
Yeah,
it's good.
It's of,

3028
02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:45.420
we also got to build the infrastructure to handle all the paperwork and all the

3029
02:49:45.421 --> 02:49:48.700
bullshit for the traffic.
Cause I'm gonna sell the special online.
Oh yeah.

3030
02:49:48.780 --> 02:49:51.020
Best Special I've ever done for sure.
No,

3031
02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.660
no doubt about it and hands down the first person that ever did.
I watched it.

3032
02:49:55.050 --> 02:49:59.100
The first thing that I've ever did where I,
I I know it was like a real show.

3033
02:49:59.130 --> 02:50:02.400
It wasn't like I was just filming anything and I think a big part of that is

3034
02:50:02.401 --> 02:50:05.520
this podcast.
That's cool.
I was in the middle of it.
I even said that.
I'm like,

3035
02:50:05.521 --> 02:50:07.950
I thought I was going to be nervous.
I go,
this is like a regular show for me.

3036
02:50:07.951 --> 02:50:11.820
This is,
it's weird,
but then I realized everything.
I'm filming everything now.

3037
02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:14.970
It's like I'm doing these crazy podcasts so many hours a week.

3038
02:50:14.971 --> 02:50:17.690
Then I don't even get a little bit nervous about filming filming.
Dot.

3039
02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:21.600
It's not like,
well,
I got to get this.
I got to nail it down.
I felt like I did.

3040
02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:24.120
I did all the work I do.
I work that whole month.

3041
02:50:24.121 --> 02:50:29.121
I worked really hard prior crowd of fans than just comedy people and I was a

3042
02:50:29.971 --> 02:50:33.930
high priest like that.
It's like they're with you on,
you can't go to a place.

3043
02:50:34.470 --> 02:50:37.020
Yeah,
it was good.
But like,
we're not going to go there with you.
It was 100%.

3044
02:50:37.021 --> 02:50:40.140
And I appreciate the fuck out of it.
And,
uh,
I,
you know,
I say it all the time,

3045
02:50:40.141 --> 02:50:43.540
but it's because I mean it all the time.
I don't take any of this for granted.
We,

3046
02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:45.600
none of us do.
Brian doesn't,
uh,

3047
02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:49.590
I know already Joey doesn't have a whole different world from his podcast.
Yeah.

3048
02:50:49.591 --> 02:50:53.790
Joey called me up to date and told me he sold 390 tickets on like a Tuesday in

3049
02:50:53.791 --> 02:50:58.320
San Jose.
If you don't know,
it's just unhurtable broke it on a Tuesday for that.

3050
02:50:59.250 --> 02:51:03.390
You wouldn't do that.
No,
I probably sell 300 or something or two 50 or Tuesday.

3051
02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:04.313
Maybe.
I would have,

3052
02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:08.580
maybe I would have to like go on radio stations and really promote the shit out

3053
02:51:08.581 --> 02:51:12.840
of it and make a big deal out of it.
Between Twitter and a,
this podcast,

3054
02:51:12.841 --> 02:51:15.330
everything has sort of changed.
And like,
we,

3055
02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:18.000
we love the fact that you guys are enjoying it.

3056
02:51:18.001 --> 02:51:21.270
And when we feel a hundred percent dedicated and,
uh,

3057
02:51:21.271 --> 02:51:26.250
we feel responsible and we feel like,
um,
you know,
we have,
uh,
we have,

3058
02:51:26.260 --> 02:51:28.740
uh,
we have a responsibility to keep this thing going.

3059
02:51:28.770 --> 02:51:30.360
And if you guys want to pick up on all of us,

3060
02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:35.490
then all you have to do is take mushrooms July 21st 22nd or 23rd for shrimp

3061
02:51:35.491 --> 02:51:37.110
fest,
2012.
If you do,

3062
02:51:37.111 --> 02:51:41.340
I guarantee you you'll understand things we talk about on this podcast a little

3063
02:51:41.341 --> 02:51:45.720
bit differently.
People be like,
Oh yeah,
I'm okay.
Maybe.

3064
02:51:46.020 --> 02:51:49.380
Maybe.
Okay.
That's it for this week.
Next week.

3065
02:51:49.381 --> 02:51:51.660
Thank you everybody who enjoyed the John Anthony West podcast,

3066
02:51:51.661 --> 02:51:52.980
very controversial podcast,

3067
02:51:52.981 --> 02:51:56.610
and I want to try to get him on in the future with an egyptologist and I'm

3068
02:51:56.611 --> 02:52:00.120
willing to pay to fly guys out and put them up in hotel rooms because it

3069
02:52:00.121 --> 02:52:02.970
generated so much interest if he's related to each other.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3070
02:52:02.971 --> 02:52:05.470
There's a dude on my message board.
I'm gonna see if we could possibly this out.

3071
02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:08.650
I need moderate.
He,
well,
yeah,
I would sort of like let them figure out like,

3072
02:52:08.890 --> 02:52:09.910
you know,
there's,
there's uh,

3073
02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:12.910
there's a big debate about a couple of different specific subjects that have to

3074
02:52:12.911 --> 02:52:15.410
do with ancient Egypt.
But either way,
thanks to John Anthony West,

3075
02:52:15.411 --> 02:52:16.420
it was an awesome podcast.

3076
02:52:16.750 --> 02:52:21.640
Thanks to everybody who tuned into the show and all these fucking weird things

3077
02:52:21.641 --> 02:52:24.610
that we're doing.
I don't know what we're doing.
We're just doing it.

3078
02:52:25.090 --> 02:52:28.510
It just happened.
And here it is.
Thanks to the fleshlight for sponsoring us.

3079

Thanks to on@dotcomgotojoerogan.net and click on a link for the flashlight and

during the code name Brogan and save yourself 15% off the number one sex toy

3081
02:52:38.010 --> 02:52:41.830
ferment the protein powders coming soon.
It will be within probably two months.

3082
02:52:42.140 --> 02:52:43.810
It's difficult,
difficult to get hemp hearts.

3083
02:52:43.930 --> 02:52:46.960
We're thinking about buying our own fucking hemp farm in Canada.

3084
02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:49.570
You should already have that.
Yeah,
we can.
Uh,
you can't,

3085
02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:54.850
it's hard to get him apparently hemp hearts,
so you can only buy 50 pounds a day.

3086
02:52:54.851 --> 02:52:57.730
Yeah,
it's a highly in demand,
really excellent source of protein.

3087
02:52:57.731 --> 02:53:01.570
But this protein powder is really delicious.
It's got Maca in it,
raw cocoa,

3088
02:53:01.571 --> 02:53:04.240
and it's flavored with a Stevia sweetened with Stevia.

3089
02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:05.930
So it's really good for you.
I,

3090
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:09.430
I've been really enjoying the fact that doesn't make me Fart.
It's a really,

3091
02:53:09.431 --> 02:53:12.940
it takes away your farts just doesn't crush me like a sum or some protein

3092
02:53:12.941 --> 02:53:15.970
powders crushing me.
He knows,
especially when you mix a banana in it.

3093
02:53:15.971 --> 02:53:18.970
Some of them are just ruthless.
Uh,
but uh,
that's coming out too.

3094
02:53:18.971 --> 02:53:21.970
