1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Straightening because nothing works</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.400
<v Speaker 1>There are no good mobile phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>boom miles only been here for five</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

4
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>We've already discussed cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical feminism,</v>

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>a radical progressive's that want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take over the world.</v>

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription drugs,</v>

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>tight shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gone the full gamut.</v>

8
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really have,</v>

9
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fresh.</v>

10
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>It's young and fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already gone the full gamut.</v>

11
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out about you,</v>

12
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was so many,</v>

13
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

14
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of interesting stuff tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 1>at me and,</v>

15
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read one of your Breitbart pieces and</v>

16
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this motherfucker out.</v>

17
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>And then I found out that you're gay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

18
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of this gamer gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're in the game.</v>

19
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>You're on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were on the side of the people that</v>

20
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>not the ultra progressive's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you were in these debates</v>

22
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>against these radical feminism chicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shutting them down.</v>

23
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were very kind about me.</v>

24
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Play some video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this motherfucker.</v>

25
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>You're a unicorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't like people like you.</v>

26
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not supposed to exist into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive rules of the universe.</v>

27
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I should not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to be like fairly</v>

29
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.791
<v Speaker 1>buttoned down and conservative and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fare well also factually correct.</v>

30
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Like all the stuff that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I'd seen,</v>

31
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten in his argument about why</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain women gravitate towards certain</v>

32
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>jobs and men gravitate towards jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that,</v>

33
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of this is just cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this is something that we're</v>

34
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>pushing upon young men and young women</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were like,</v>

35
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the case at all.</v>

36
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>They're just hilarious to watch someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted by.</v>

37
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Like they expect that to come from a me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They expected to come from some</v>

38
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like I ought to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting the exact and on paper like</v>

39
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.811
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>

40
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a metropolitan.</v>

41
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I would be a liberal,</v>

43
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm a homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen.</v>

44
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I'd like pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't really exist,</v>

46
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 2>but I do</v>

47
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>for that one 10th of your tweets are</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how fabulous your hair is.</v>

48
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So black,</v>

49
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:07.114
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 2>I of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those subjects,</v>

51
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hair or you know,</v>

52
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.670
<v Speaker 2>the men that I'm into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

53
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.890
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for them to beat me for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one simple reason,</v>

54
00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 2>which is they've never been questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been called in any of this</v>

55
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 2>stuff by anybody's serious or anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a,</v>

56
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't conform to the progressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules if identity politics.</v>

57
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 2>So when they come from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usual the usual response from a</v>

58
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 2>feminist to anybody bringing facts or</v>
<v Speaker 2>accountants as serious counter argument</v>

59
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 2>is simply to dismiss them as a sexist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bigot or a misogynist.</v>

60
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 2>It's really tough to make the allegation</v>
<v Speaker 2>against me.</v>

61
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I love women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my friends are women.</v>

62
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a dog in the fight sexually</v>

63
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if I don't,</v>

64
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to bang them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever size they are,</v>

65
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Speaker 2>however they behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they really don't,</v>

66
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that over me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

67
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to come up against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that you cannot make a convincing</v>

68
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.741
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

69
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 2>of bigotry again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to argue on the facts.</v>

70
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 2>And of course the facts are on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what the deal is.</v>

71
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 2>They dismiss</v>

72
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.310
<v Speaker 1>you instantaneously because of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent because what you represented</v>

73
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

74
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.060
<v Speaker 1>we got the dirt on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

75
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gay and he's fabulous shit,</v>

76
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.290
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

77
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 2>But once you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start to hit their radar,</v>

78
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you note that you get calls from friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>who say said this,</v>

79
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>this person I emailed me trying to check</v>
<v Speaker 2>you out.</v>

80
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 2>This happened to me about a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of hit an a journalist for 10</v>

81
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are some good staff?</v>

82
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn's a big stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never really,</v>

83
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I never really kind of crossed over into</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment into the mainstream and</v>

84
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 2>just started to happen about year ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started to get emails from friends</v>

85
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 2>and they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so what?</v>

86
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People keep emailing me,</v>

87
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>asking me about you like trying to ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in back in 2011 did he really do</v>

88
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I've realized is when they,</v>

89
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>when they recognize you as a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they identify you as somebody could</v>

90
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 2>do them damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start going on maneuvers,</v>

91
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:50.690
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out everything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

92
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out what the worst stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have on you is so that he can</v>

93
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neo Nazi or whatever.</v>

94
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>They can come up with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can grasp that because their</v>

95
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>strategy is to dismiss the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to dismiss the speaker by attacking</v>

96
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>the speakers credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that way they never have to even</v>

97
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 2>consider the merits of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't been able to do that with</v>

98
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.324
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

99
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 2>which is why feminists now refuse to</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat me up,</v>

100
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>debate me on TV because they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll lose.</v>

101
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't bring out all,</v>

102
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 2>they can't bring out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got this battery of dismissing</v>

103
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 2>their dismissal tactics that they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>amassed over the last 30 years and</v>

104
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 2>they've got so complacent because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never had,</v>

105
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Sassy gay person and come up and say</v>

106
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking bullshit and you're</v>

107
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>hurting men and here are the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never had it before,</v>

108
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 2>so they've never built up on arsenal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight it.</v>

109
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.630
<v Speaker 2>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why I went and while Cook I'll</v>

111
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 2>keep winning because they don't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how to deal with an argument on its</v>

112
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 2>own merits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in any case,</v>

113
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:42.600
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're on our so</v>

114
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also this conversation that we're</v>

115
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:49.460
<v Speaker 1>having right now is about war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying winning and losing and</v>

116
00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:53.360
<v Speaker 1>they're taking tactics and strategies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up dirt on the opposition.</v>

117
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.890
<v Speaker 1>They're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're treating.</v>

118
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:58.010
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an ideological war is not a</v>

119
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:01.490
<v Speaker 1>debate about the facts of the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of it because</v>

120
00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:02.750
<v Speaker 1>the left has always seen this as a war.</v>

121
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 2>And the gender warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 2>have always been warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've always seen this in strategic</v>

123
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 2>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure people on conservatives and</v>

124
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 2>naturally more self effacing</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives tend to be a little bit</v>

125
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more chill about things.</v>

126
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:15.184
<v Speaker 2>They kind of don't</v>

127
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.360
<v Speaker 1>do you really draw it though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you explain tape?</v>

128
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I think they get very angry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

129
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Explain Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I saying?</v>

130
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Old Conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he explained,</v>

131
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:23.614
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's her name?</v>

132
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>The Pailin chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Palin.</v>

133
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>How to explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the,</v>

134
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.890
<v Speaker 1>these are the outline is that Mike</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huckabee,</v>

135
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>even most conservatives find these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people a bit much.</v>

136
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>My car could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that guy's in isn't in the end.</v>

137
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how these cells fatter now he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was hopping around last time.</v>

138
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

139
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like the lazy got that cushion TV</v>

140
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>gigs so far he got so far I cannot vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for anyone.</v>

141
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>That phenomenon of rock and rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Want Marco Rubio just because he's</v>

142
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.624
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

143
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>if we call have Trump than I won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>regret it.</v>

144
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are silly.</v>

145
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So whether or not it's a conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or a liberal thing,</v>

146
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a vast majority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't not</v>

147
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 3>very good at looking at themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not very good at looking at the</v>

148
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 3>momentum of their actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just think that they're right</v>

149
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 3>because this is what they've been saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>for so long.</v>

150
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific things about these</v>

151
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 3>conversations with these women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get in with you about cause like when,</v>

152
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 3>when they're talking about what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>think are social constructs,</v>

153
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 3>things like gender identities and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way people be.</v>

154
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 3>And when you shatter that with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>

155
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 3>they're looking for some other weapons</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing there and you see it</v>

156
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.084
<v Speaker 3>in their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

157
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 3>cause it's not really a debate about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea itself.</v>

158
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just not what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not what it's about is gender will</v>

159
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people like Christina Hoff</v>

160
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 3>summers cold them gender warriors</v>
<v Speaker 3>because these aren't people who want any</v>

161
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 3>kind of social justice as they say.</v>

162
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.760
<v Speaker 3>These are people who just hate men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

163
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.650
<v Speaker 3>there's hate men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to hurt men.</v>

164
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to quality for women.</v>

165
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 3>They want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want superiority for women,</v>

166
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 3>whether it's architected into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>education system or you know,</v>

167
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 3>affirmative action or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want quality.</v>

168
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 3>They want superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fundamentally,</v>

169
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:57.231
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these crazy extremist,</v>

171
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

172
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 3>progressive third wave feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today's version of feminism.</v>

173
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 3>It basically boils down to messenger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a gay guy because it's so</v>

174
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 3>dangerous for men to even broach this</v>
<v Speaker 3>subject anymore.</v>

175
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 3>And any man with a mainstream job puts</v>
<v Speaker 3>that at risk by even talking on the</v>

176
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:13.170
<v Speaker 3>subject no matter what his opinion is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

177
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 3>it takes a gay guy to go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

178
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 3>Sky News in the UK and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

179
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 3>the facts are not on your side and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing is damaging to women.</v>

180
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to me really an indictment on a,</v>

181
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 3>on debate in our public square that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so dangerous for a man to even</v>

182
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 3>express an opinion on this subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it takes a fact they're going to</v>

183
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 3>stick up for heterosexuals.</v>

184
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if other men could say this,</v>

185
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:37.330
<v Speaker 3>they would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't because they would run</v>

186
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 3>the risk of their careers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What feminists always talking about</v>

187
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.360
<v Speaker 3>silencing people icy silence to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>

188
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 3>that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of doxing and going after</v>

189
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 3>people and a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of anger when it comes to all this</v>

190
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what you have in many cases</v>

191
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 3>when you see this kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>disjointed,</v>

192
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 3>illogical sort of way of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have people that are</v>

193
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:04.121
<v Speaker 3>assholes that find a cause that gives</v>
<v Speaker 3>him the green light to be an asshole.</v>

194
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.181
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written about this,</v>

195
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:05.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

196
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no disrespect to any particular church,</v>

197
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's reasonable to say 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago if you were a bully,</v>

198
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 3>if you are a sociopath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want us to take out in other</v>

199
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:13.670
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

200
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 3>You want it to Rick harm on the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you thought would hurt you?</v>

201
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Reasonably good way of doing that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be to join the clergy and many and many</v>

202
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 3>people did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think most of us who are</v>

203
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 3>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have religious families know stories</v>

204
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These days,</v>

205
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 3>you're better off getting a job at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gorka.</v>

206
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.711
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 3>if you want to bully somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to hurt them,</v>

208
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 3>if you have some sort of internal chaos</v>
<v Speaker 3>or damage and you want to impose order</v>

209
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 3>on the world outside because you feel so</v>
<v Speaker 3>confused and broken and messy,</v>

210
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to do it today,</v>

211
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 3>it's become a social justice warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because not only do you get the same</v>

212
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 3>kind of status in society the clergy</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have done 50 years ago,</v>

213
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 3>but you also get media platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get money,</v>

214
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 3>you get approval,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get applause.</v>

215
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 3>And if you layer on these new tactics</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

216
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake abuse and fake Harrison,</v>

217
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these terrible man,</v>

218
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these terrible men coming for me on the</v>

219
00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you can make quite a lot</v>

220
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 2>of money too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

221
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.970
<v Speaker 2>you can form a patrion page and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just sending the audio.</v>

222
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

223
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like a crowd fund me for my ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

224
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 2>So in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old days you'd have patrons of</v>

225
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>the arts and there would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.360
<v Speaker 2>like a prince or some rich guy or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

227
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little later in history it would</v>

228
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 2>be a mercantile patron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the way,</v>

229
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 2>in the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

230
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 2>many industrialists and bankers still</v>
<v Speaker 2>give a lot of money to their local opera</v>

231
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 2>house or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So patch on is a way of turning that</v>

232
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 2>open into crowdfunding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

233
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 2>your patron becomes a load of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of whom give you a little bit of</v>

234
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

235
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in theory quite a respectable and</v>

236
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 2>interesting way of funding the outs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In principle,</v>

237
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to become colonized by</v>

238
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 2>people who are raising money on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis of sympathy rather than anything</v>

239
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 2>they actually create.</v>

240
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's what I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've noticed in my reporting on</v>

241
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:54.201
<v Speaker 2>this is the vast majority of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>begging for money on Pantry on as far as</v>

242
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure Patrick and will tell me,</v>

243
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them went on their platform,</v>

244
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 2>goes creative projects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as far as I can tell,</v>

245
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.171
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 2>people bleating for sympathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 2>fishing for empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

248
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of women on there claiming</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

249
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>claiming that their lives are being</v>

250
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 2>ruined by manual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually look into it.</v>

251
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't find the tweets are talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

252
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.213
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a way for,</v>

254
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this great tweet by,</v>

255
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's an airport who is ochre gamergate</v>

256
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 2>supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't,</v>

257
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to remember it wrongly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something along the lines of,</v>

258
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day on the Internet,</v>

259
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 2>some goonie beard man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

260
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promises to be nice to a social justice</v>

261
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 2>warrior in the hope of a wink or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope of a blow job or something like</v>

262
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

263
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:30.911
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

264
00:10:30.911 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 2>it's these guys who were just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw a fiver or throw a tenner a month,</v>

265
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$20 a month to this video games</v>

266
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 2>developer who's never produced anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>in her life,</v>

267
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 2>but claims she's getting harassed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>claims are getting threats.</v>

268
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very weird,</v>

269
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological dynamic.</v>

270
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's quite,</v>

271
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.151
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

272
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 2>it's interwoven with the way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism has turned women into</v>

273
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 2>professional victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handed them this victim hood script.</v>

274
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 2>And most of these women are not really</v>
<v Speaker 2>to blame.</v>

275
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 2>They're not kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these aren't,</v>

276
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.680
<v Speaker 2>these aren't horrible sociopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

277
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Warmongers these aren't people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hate man.</v>

278
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 2>They're just a bit miserable and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>reached for the nearest victim hood</v>

279
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 2>script available to them because we live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a culture where,</v>

280
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a victim hood is the,</v>

281
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 2>is the most valuable currency that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

282
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can amass.</v>

283
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

284
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.410
<v Speaker 2>and so they go out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they advertise what a terrible life they</v>

285
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>have and how awful people ask them on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet.</v>

286
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:20.870
<v Speaker 2>And they ask men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly it's women asking for money from</v>

287
00:11:20.871 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

288
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively for sympathy dollars.</v>

289
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly demeaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly,</v>

290
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the human spirit,</v>

291
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aside from anything else,</v>

292
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically telling these women</v>

293
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:36.981
<v Speaker 2>that they have more value as winches and</v>
<v Speaker 2>liars and gender warriors than they do</v>

294
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 2>as creators or mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

295
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.630
<v Speaker 2>and I find that hugely destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what we're,</v>

296
00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about as far as like</v>

297
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>people that are assholes that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>launch off,</v>

298
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 2>latch onto a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that if you go to their page,</v>

299
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of them that write and</v>

300
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>you'd go</v>

301
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 3>to their blog and their blog is just an</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack blog.</v>

302
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just consistent attacks on people</v>

303
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 3>that don't share their ideas or don't or</v>
<v Speaker 3>have differing ideas of coined a term</v>

304
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 3>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

305
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.730
<v Speaker 3>I've coined sentence quantum superstate</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminism and it is an,</v>

306
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.360
<v Speaker 3>it is feminism that exists at once as</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressor and victim.</v>

307
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 3>It is simultaneously and at all times</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressor and victim.</v>

308
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 3>And it's describes these women who go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out lobbing shit at people,</v>

309
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then instantly turned into damsels</v>

310
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 3>in distress when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they see their own language</v>

311
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 3>returned in kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

312
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 3>quite often returned at greater volume</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what they're saying is</v>

313
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous and offensive and people get</v>
<v Speaker 3>annoyed about it perfectly.</v>

314
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:31.811
<v Speaker 3>Reasonably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>

315
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 3>if you create an environment in which</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine to say anything you want about</v>

316
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine to say kill white men.</v>

317
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.500
<v Speaker 3>It's fine to publish articles in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:40.810
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mainstream news media publications</v>

319
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:42.520
<v Speaker 3>about how to hurt man and all the rest</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

320
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Just sort of several years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was just the woman recently,</v>

321
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 3>the Google ideas woman that had the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweet about,</v>

322
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she eats men for breakfast.</v>

323
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's talking about Randy Harper.</v>

324
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.100
<v Speaker 3>If you imagine if a guy wrote that down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat women for Breck.</v>

325
00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:56.921
<v Speaker 3>What unit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

326
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:00.270
<v Speaker 3>Some men do speak to women like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the men's rights activists on</v>

327
00:13:00.271 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

328
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you know why men's rights</v>

329
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 3>activists are so rude to women because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're assholes?</v>

330
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what they're doing.</v>

331
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 3>It women have for 30 years said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treat us like men were just like,</v>

332
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just the same.</v>

333
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Treat us like men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do anything that men can do.</v>

334
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 3>You can do everything that men can do.</v>

335
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Men's rights activists just take them at</v>
<v Speaker 3>their word and the weight and taunting</v>

336
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:23.630
<v Speaker 3>is how many bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

337
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.540
<v Speaker 3>that's not what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they're doing.</v>

338
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 3>And they're not trying to bond with</v>
<v Speaker 3>these women.</v>

339
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.430
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to hurt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think what they're doing is</v>

340
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 3>taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking it at face value,</v>

341
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 3>this demand for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for us to treat women.</v>

342
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.440
<v Speaker 3>I see us for them to treat women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

343
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

344
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 3>just just like they would their buddies</v>
<v Speaker 3>down the pub.</v>

345
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Well if you ever actually been to a pub</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were hearing men like</v>

346
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 3>outplaying pain sneaker or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fucking awful to each other.</v>

347
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 3>But I think they're doing exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

348
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 3>They don't want these women doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's just being a cunt.</v>

349
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.640
<v Speaker 3>They just like take away the gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

350
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 3>men are being conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women are being cons.</v>

351
00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 3>People are reaching through these</v>
<v Speaker 3>internet lines turn to hurt each other.</v>

352
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's true and I'm not,</v>

353
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not totally on board with a whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

354
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 3>men in [inaudible] men's rights for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

355
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I think anybody who spends so much time</v>
<v Speaker 3>working on their like approval of their</v>

356
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 3>own gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like w w we're supporting our own</v>

357
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 3>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of dudes that are</v>

358
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 3>pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of women that are</v>

359
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Speaker 3>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

360
00:14:18.701 --> 00:14:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the problem is that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of become feminists in reverse and</v>

361
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 3>they use the same tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like to show large police.</v>

362
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 3>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's amazing.</v>

363
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 3>You go on some of these communities in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reddit and you read some of these blogs</v>

364
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.691
<v Speaker 3>and they're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

365
00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:30.850
<v Speaker 3>they're like fainting couch men's rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>activists.</v>

366
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have a friend Julie Bentall,</v>

367
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.410
<v Speaker 3>who's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very funny,</v>

368
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 3>she's a lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

369
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's basically this dike feminist.</v>

370
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 3>She hates men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She made this joke and it's kind of like</v>

371
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 3>the sort of joke I would make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

372
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should put all men and internment</v>

373
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:44.704
<v Speaker 3>camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

374
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 3>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can have visitation once a month,</v>

375
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 3>we'll have guards and they could just</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay in camps until they learn how to</v>

376
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 3>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'd said that about women,</v>

377
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 3>the whole is fear as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like applauding.</v>

378
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 3>They think it was hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because she said it in a similar</v>

379
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:58.230
<v Speaker 3>level of jest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

380
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 3>suddenly it was just disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outrageous thing.</v>

381
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists has,</v>

382
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 3>men should be put in concentration</v>
<v Speaker 3>camps.</v>

383
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitches really?</v>

384
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly what feminists do.</v>

385
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 3>You are taking a joke like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking a joke,</v>

386
00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 3>you're pretending to take it seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're starting an outrage</v>

387
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 3>circus about it.</v>

388
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for fuck's sake,</v>

389
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I am out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's recreational outrage.</v>

390
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.710
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that,</v>

391
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 3>isn't that what this is supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fighting against,</v>

392
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in this because I'm like a cultural</v>

393
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.930
<v Speaker 3>libertarian as my colleague Alan Bakari</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts it.</v>

394
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.831
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

395
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 3>I believe in classical liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech,</v>

396
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 3>freedom of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of expression.</v>

397
00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what you believe,</v>

398
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

399
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to be able to interrogate your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas in the public square.</v>

400
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

401
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.040
<v Speaker 3>this outrage circus that so many men</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to be getting involved in and the</v>

402
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:43.761
<v Speaker 3>way they treat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

403
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:46.820
<v Speaker 3>they call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call circumcision male genital</v>

404
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 3>mutilation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

405
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

406
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.483
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're coming,</v>

407
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.291
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

408
00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:52.851
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

409
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:53.684
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're one of those,</v>

410
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>

411
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

412
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.000
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to write it's cutting skin</v>

413
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 3>while I'm in favor of it purely on</v>
<v Speaker 3>aesthetic grounds.</v>

414
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I understand that these things in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

415
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand from your point of</v>

416
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:06.980
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand that your</v>

417
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 3>baby should be able to make a decision</v>
<v Speaker 3>on later in life.</v>

418
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

419
00:16:13.121 --> 00:16:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

420
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have a view,</v>

421
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 3>I know lots of men don't like on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue and it's simply that,</v>

422
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just good grooming.</v>

423
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women,</v>

424
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.490
<v Speaker 3>women go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women go onto,</v>

425
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women go on to the ninth.</v>

426
00:16:25.531 --> 00:16:29.960
<v Speaker 3>I have boob jobs and all the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why stop penises?</v>

427
00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexy procedure that comes close to the</v>

428
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 3>numbers of babies that gets circumcised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's done.</v>

429
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 3>The female girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these people.</v>

430
00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:39.344
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just</v>

431
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 3>like birth as they're just weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think I'm in the minority here.</v>

432
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to offend you,</v>

433
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 3>but I think I'm in the minority here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just can't imagine why any man</v>

434
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:51.530
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't want lots and lots of really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good blow jobs because,</v>

435
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently it feels better when the skin</v>

436
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 3>is on or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

437
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.730
<v Speaker 3>it's so much.</v>

438
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Speaker 3>How do you know unless you've done both?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

439
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Because I've got feedback from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

440
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I've a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all anecdotal evidence this way</v>

441
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a large sample size.</v>

442
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 3>You just liked the way they look better</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's all trimmed up nice.</v>

443
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Every other woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is telling you to choice based a</v>

444
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 3>lot on what we're used to having it done</v>
<v Speaker 3>later in life.</v>

445
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not nice if you're fucking dumb</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to get your Dick's getting cut</v>

446
00:17:20.521 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 3>off when you're 30 I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it hurts the camaraderie on this.</v>

447
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:24.980
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to suck one of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

448
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm going to say.</v>

449
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 3>We should leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have liked to believe that I</v>

450
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.640
<v Speaker 3>have the same approach that I do to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaginas.</v>

451
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Like if a girl at a big vagina lips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say d.</v>

452
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't have kept that shit cut</v>

453
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:38.030
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think bit what it looks now.</v>

454
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 3>It's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

455
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 3>we'll leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

456
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big nipples like,</v>

457
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 3>do you gonna get them shrunk down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking barbaric.</v>

458
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

459
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

460
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I there it,</v>

461
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there people aren't scrupulously cutting</v>

462
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick's is stupid.</v>

463
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 1>God Sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a baby's Dick.</v>

464
00:17:58.741 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to cut his deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

465
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 1>you know how many kids lose their dicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year because of infections and</v>

466
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.720
<v Speaker 1>because of the surgery goes wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot can't win.</v>

467
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to take this view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to take this line like</v>

468
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 1>cutting babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick's,</v>

469
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't win against that one's</v>

470
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 1>a surgical procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to be in the minority on this</v>

471
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pleasing surgical procedure.</v>

472
00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you might be cutting all you</v>

473
00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would want to keep you full scan.</v>

474
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

475
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give these world class blow</v>

<v Speaker 1>jobs to the juice instead.</v>

477
00:18:30.141 --> 00:18:32.730

<v Speaker 1>My favorite story was my least favorite</v>

478
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when my favorite story to bring up</v>

479
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:39.120
<v Speaker 1>was oil in New York who had herpes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

480
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 1>when they cut the baby's Dick in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional way,</v>

481
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 1>they actually suck on the baby's penis</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop the bleeding.</v>

482
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard articles about this.</v>

483
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

484
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the kid died cause a,</v>

485
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 1>the kid got herpes from the rabbi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oil,</v>

486
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck his name is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a great idea.</v>

487
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Cut and baby dicks could have grown up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve cancer or one of those things.</v>

488
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Either one of them can be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

489
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.210
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Baby.</v>

490
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone's going to disagree</v>

491
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>with you on that particular incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't cut baby dicks,</v>

492
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but they'll have the fuck did we get on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

493
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:17.950
<v Speaker 1>But it was inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

494
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

495
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely a bunch of horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that happens to women on a daily</v>

496
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

497
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:27.930
<v Speaker 1>every time you see these fucking Cosby</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

498
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.330
<v Speaker 1>these women that are coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere about bill Cosby,</v>

499
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:31.164
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

500
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 1>when women talk about worrying about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being drugged,</v>

501
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:38.340
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know anybody that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened to,</v>

502
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:40.190
<v Speaker 1>or someone close to you that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to,</v>

503
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.040
<v Speaker 1>that danger doesn't seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

504
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but you see this bill Cosby thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

505
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.580
<v Speaker 1>not only is it real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

506
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.590
<v Speaker 1>here's the guy that was America's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his voice,</v>

507
00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 1>the voice of Morality for a generation.</v>

508
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this becomes such a mania,</v>

509
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.920
<v Speaker 2>a moral panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a moral panics in history about</v>

510
00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:03.890
<v Speaker 2>this stuff that the genuine victims are</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to,</v>

511
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.040
<v Speaker 2>to be disbelieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is driven by,</v>

512
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the sort of progressive</v>

513
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.680
<v Speaker 2>narrative over fat kind of journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sabrina Erdely and rolling stone and all</v>

514
00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:15.350
<v Speaker 2>these rapes we hear about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all seem to unravel within a couple</v>

515
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.350
<v Speaker 2>of months.</v>

516
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that was the rolling stone was Uva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

517
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Which didn't have the virtuous girl at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia didn't happen.</v>

518
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.650
<v Speaker 1>A Jute Lacrosse didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

519
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things have happened.</v>

520
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

521
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:29.090
<v Speaker 1>but we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should</v>

522
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.620
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be working at how to solve and</v>

523
00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:33.080
<v Speaker 2>prevent these crimes better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the waste you that is not to erect.</v>

524
00:20:33.081 --> 00:20:35.270
<v Speaker 2>It is not to stage a moral panic in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

525
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing fingers at innocent people.</v>

526
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:41.240
<v Speaker 2>And when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you as was clearly the case with</v>

527
00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:45.080
<v Speaker 2>rolling stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of sweep under the carpet facts or</v>

528
00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.640
<v Speaker 2>omissions that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

529
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 2>that doubt on your story because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think this is just something we should</v>

530
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 2>be talking about anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether this specific case,</v>

531
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 2>whether we have the details right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this specific case,</v>

532
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 2>what happens is when all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when these rape stories or whatever it</v>

533
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:58.730
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

534
00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.620
<v Speaker 2>get ripped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

535
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>success is successive rape stories get</v>

536
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:07.981
<v Speaker 2>repudiated and debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It undermines confidence and trust in</v>

537
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 2>anyone who makes that complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who says this happened to me</v>

538
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 2>right in the back of their head.</v>

539
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I think perfectly reasonably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are thinking,</v>

540
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:15.740
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one.</v>

541
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 2>it's not a nice thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what this is.</v>

543
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 2>This can be the effect of a moral panic</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the media.</v>

544
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it damages the real victims,</v>

545
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most.</v>

546
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.361
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:27.550
<v Speaker 2>that's why I've written about this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past.</v>

548
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also why it's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important to tell the truth about</v>

549
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:30.551
<v Speaker 2>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

550
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:33.310
<v Speaker 2>feminists are always have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a complicated relationship</v>

551
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:34.200
<v Speaker 2>with the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

552
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 2>one is the one in four week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

553
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean this goes all the way up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

554
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Every time you hear it seems to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>

555
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we extrapolate out it's</v>

556
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 2>going to be like 50 women in five gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>raped within a second of stepping on</v>

557
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 2>campus by 2025.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

558
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets worse every time.</v>

559
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.020
<v Speaker 2>It's based on ridiculous studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

560
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.340
<v Speaker 2>the way I started I think Christina Hoff</v>
<v Speaker 2>Summers at the American Enterprise</v>

561
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Institute who I was site cause she's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>

562
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when other Unicorn,</v>

563
00:21:58.411 --> 00:22:03.340
<v Speaker 2>so on point of March is feminist</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist lever and she,</v>

564
00:22:03.341 --> 00:22:04.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just had some problems with um,</v>

565
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 2>with contemporary feminism and gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>warriors.</v>

566
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.241
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she does a great series of the factual</v>

568
00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:09.860
<v Speaker 2>feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a lot of your viewers are</v>

569
00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

570
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.951
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

571
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:12.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

572
00:22:12.481 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 2>she sort of tracked down the original</v>
<v Speaker 2>study for this,</v>

573
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:14.951
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:22:14.951 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 2>samples has about 70 people and an adult</v>
<v Speaker 2>education college,</v>

575
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 2>which is so eight to so completely alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>in character.</v>

576
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are like 20 years older,</v>

577
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course there's,</v>

578
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:25.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult education cultures,</v>

579
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:25.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

580
00:22:25.621 --> 00:22:26.321
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are different,</v>

581
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 2>there is a different set of social</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that go along with adult</v>

582
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:31.710
<v Speaker 2>education college then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then 20 year olds Undergrad,</v>

583
00:22:31.711 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call them?</v>

584
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Freshmen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

585
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:35.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] doing a regular degree in</v>

586
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:37.960
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sample size was ridiculous.</v>

587
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:40.960
<v Speaker 2>The university was atypical and this has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been extrapolated out to this,</v>

588
00:22:40.961 --> 00:22:42.820
<v Speaker 2>to this feminist myth that just won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

589
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the gender pay gap as well,</v>

590
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 2>how they define like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that want definition</v>

591
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 2>sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's actually a section of sexual</v>

592
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:54.070
<v Speaker 2>assault and sexual abuse has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadened so widely.</v>

593
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.730
<v Speaker 2>What's getting crazy regret in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities?</v>

594
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is part of the university's conduct</v>

595
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:05.200
<v Speaker 2>code that unwanted sexual advances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means me saying,</v>

596
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 2>you're really pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I buy you a drink?</v>

597
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Constitutes sexual harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is just,</v>

598
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have to close down every</v>

599
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 2>nightclub in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

600
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just extraordinary bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

601
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff.</v>

602
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.071
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 2>30 years unchallenged feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I do what I do,</v>

604
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:21.370
<v Speaker 2>because I think it matters.</v>

605
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Guy,</v>

606
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:23.830
<v Speaker 2>he's 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

607
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.030
<v Speaker 2>our age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

608
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how old you are,</v>

609
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:26.711
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

610
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:27.640
<v Speaker 2>you're 48.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

611
00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:28.331
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

612
00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:28.661
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're maybe my dad's almost at my dad's</v>

614
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.260
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyone your age,</v>

615
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 2>even right down to my age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 30.</v>

616
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 2>It would have been a bit ridiculous for</v>
<v Speaker 2>us to say that,</v>

617
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>society is architected against men.</v>

618
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were growing up,</v>

619
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 2>it just wasn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no point trying to pretend</v>

620
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.300
<v Speaker 2>that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I speak to boys all the time and</v>

621
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:43.901
<v Speaker 2>I've interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

622
00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 2>so many of them now have about 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do go through life experiencing this</v>

623
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

624
00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.613
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

625
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture,</v>

626
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against them,</v>

627
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 2>whether it's being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

628
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 2>wax on Adderall at school or more women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.010
<v Speaker 2>getting into university for no good</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason or women as in a Cornell to 2015</v>

630
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 2>studies show that women have to two to</v>
<v Speaker 2>one advantage going for a stem job in</v>

631
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 2>academia.</v>

632
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so being discriminated against because</v>

633
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:07.950
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

634
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.640
<v Speaker 2>20 year old boys do have some serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems now.</v>

635
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

636
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:13.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we risk not just one,</v>

637
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 2>but many lost generations of boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call this this exodus or a big</v>

638
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 2>two-parter about this that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people were very nice</v>

639
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:19.574
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

640
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.030
<v Speaker 2>seem to go down very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

641
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some really serious stuff to</v>

642
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 2>address,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I do one of the reasons I</v>

643
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 2>do what I do because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:26.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what journalism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be for.</v>

645
00:24:26.061 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking up for,</v>

646
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.630
<v Speaker 2>for people who don't have a platform</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and for,</v>

647
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:30.111
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

648
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the establishment has lost,</v>

649
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost sight of and it doesn't care about</v>

650
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think it's important to</v>

651
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:36.530
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth about statistics.</v>

652
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't help victims if you lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in your first sentence about what</v>

653
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 2>the problem is and there is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

654
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.940
<v Speaker 2>a systemic problematic gender pay gap in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States or in Europe.</v>

655
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.760
<v Speaker 2>There is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

656
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an epidemic of rape culture on campus.</v>

657
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.710
<v Speaker 2>There is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

658
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.500
<v Speaker 2>a problem in universities or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

659
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.190
<v Speaker 2>with not enough women going into stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>into science,</v>

660
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:03.191
<v Speaker 2>technology or mathematics subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these things are so subtle and</v>

661
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:05.600
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated explanations that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 2>when you were taken to account human</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature and the different choices people</v>

663
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:11.050
<v Speaker 2>make and what women want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

664
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 2>you realize that this stuff is bunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many of these myths simply won't</v>

665
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

666
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:19.010
<v Speaker 2>you also have to take into consideration</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of other variables,</v>

667
00:25:19.011 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like women leaving because they have</v>

668
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:25.150
<v Speaker 2>children and you have to factor that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the amount of income you can generate</v>

669
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 2>gap.</v>

670
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 2>This stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is based on a</v>

671
00:25:26.961 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding between earnings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay.</v>

672
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:31.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't take all the men in society</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the,</v>

673
00:25:31.361 --> 00:25:33.500
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get in society and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a two,</v>

674
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 2>two stage calculation and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

675
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 2>well there's 77% as much money on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

676
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

677
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.980
<v Speaker 2>That's not what people mean when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>say there's a page where you say that</v>

678
00:25:40.981 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 2>it's the way you tell it to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

679
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a wage gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What what they think you mean is women</v>

680
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:47.480
<v Speaker 2>get paid 77 cents on the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know if that's the phrase they</v>

681
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 2>use to a man's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>implying that women get paid less for</v>

682
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 2>the same work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the implication that they're</v>

683
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 2>making through all of this cause they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>confusing earnings with wages,</v>

684
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

685
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.620
<v Speaker 2>earnings with pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What actually happens is men work longer</v>

686
00:25:57.621 --> 00:25:58.920
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men take,</v>

687
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 2>even when you control for children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men take fewer,</v>

688
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 2>fewer holidays.</v>

689
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.910
<v Speaker 2>They take shorter holidays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work longer hours,</v>

690
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:07.070
<v Speaker 2>they make more money for their firms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the rest of it may just work harder.</v>

691
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have longer careers,</v>

692
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.213
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

693
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women prefer whether or not they have</v>

694
00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 2>children to have a more balanced life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They prefer not to work full time that I</v>

695
00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:16.860
<v Speaker 2>have to work part time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

696
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more of a rash generalizations</v>

697
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:23.240
<v Speaker 2>because of course it was on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know lazy,</v>

698
00:26:23.241 --> 00:26:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the way the left dog or is that</v>

699
00:26:24.831 --> 00:26:26.270
<v Speaker 2>not all women are giving me a break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but speak in generalizations if you've</v>

701
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 2>got to communicate how to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

702
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the term is to test</v>

703
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Stickley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are more men that are working</v>

704
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:39.320
<v Speaker 2>longer hours that are working harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that generate more money.</v>

705
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 2>But to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men do that well,</v>

706
00:26:41.331 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 2>we all know lazy fucks it just with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>man we do</v>

707
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

708
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason I phrase it exactly like that</v>

709
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 3>is that I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

710
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 3>let's not open up the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

711
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 3>this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all men stuff that the left and</v>

712
00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the,</v>

713
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 3>that's that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

714
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the route into this sort of</v>

715
00:26:57.301 --> 00:26:58.540
<v Speaker 3>social conditioning argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

716
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 3>Just objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

717
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the point I'm trying to make is</v>

718
00:27:04.201 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 3>that men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally men,</v>

719
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 3>men generally have the following traits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

720
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 3>And this is reflected in employment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have those traits.</v>

721
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.373
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

722
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.910
<v Speaker 3>we've got to come to the lazy lazy men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

723
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.401
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

724
00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some lazy men,</v>

725
00:27:18.331 --> 00:27:20.660
<v Speaker 3>but there were also men dropping out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>society because of,</v>

726
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

727
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel that there's just no place for</v>

728
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:24.421
<v Speaker 3>them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

729
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:26.340
<v Speaker 3>they've had their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they consider to be their role in</v>

730
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:27.520
<v Speaker 3>the family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

731
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 3>snatched away from them that I'll was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last two generations real issue.</v>

732
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.483
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

733
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.570
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think your generation is,</v>

734
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 3>my generation sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I speak to 20 year old boys all the</v>

735
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:39.690
<v Speaker 3>time who are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be bothered with women.</v>

736
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this movement and midtown men</v>

737
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:42.170
<v Speaker 3>going their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

738
00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.580
<v Speaker 3>they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she fuck is involved.</v>

739
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Will you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of guys know you say</v>

740
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 3>that 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago we took about five days</v>

741
00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years,</v>

742
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

743
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.990
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But today the numbers are below the</v>

744
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 3>blossoming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that blossoming.</v>

745
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.540
<v Speaker 3>It was so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

746
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.390
<v Speaker 3>the thing is men deal reasonably well</v>
<v Speaker 3>without women.</v>

747
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.560
<v Speaker 3>They don't like to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

748
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 3>people who people like us are not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to want for sex,</v>

749
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

750
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.550
<v Speaker 3>because we're outgoing and ballsy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>brash and self confident,</v>

751
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:12.384
<v Speaker 3>all the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

752
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to have it too much of a</v>

753
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:15.300
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are plenty of men who don't</v>

754
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:19.380
<v Speaker 3>have our self confidence and who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>being bullied and derided and ridiculed</v>

755
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 3>everyday in the media at this stuff gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>you people get depressed about this</v>

756
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

757
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.670
<v Speaker 3>This is the male suicide epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

758
00:28:23.671 --> 00:28:27.180
<v Speaker 3>this is a huge epidemic across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

759
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:27.691
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

760
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:28.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number,</v>

761
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.690
<v Speaker 3>the number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of female suicides.</v>

762
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's different statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different countries.</v>

763
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a different slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

764
00:28:33.481 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 3>the female numbers aren't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing.</v>

765
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Women are getting more unhappy a decade</v>
<v Speaker 3>after decade,</v>

766
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 3>but they don't actually commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never go through with it.</v>

767
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:40.830
<v Speaker 3>When they try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fail.</v>

768
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.980
<v Speaker 3>They can't even commit suicide probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>there four to seven covenant.</v>

769
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:47.520
<v Speaker 3>They kind of a killed themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

770
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.540
<v Speaker 3>They're forcing the men to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

771
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they often,</v>

772
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 3>well we've women often road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went off and write the suicide notes</v>

773
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 3>and then they try to kill themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fail or they call they or they</v>

774
00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 3>bottle it at the last minute and call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone said up taking some pills.</v>

775

<v Speaker 3>They never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never ended up dead.</v>

776
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but men just,</v>

777
00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:05.970

778
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.410
<v Speaker 3>just hang themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

779
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 3>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those numbers are going up.</v>

780
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.160
<v Speaker 3>The number of men who were just giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>up some relationships,</v>

781
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.340
<v Speaker 3>that number is going up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that.</v>

782
00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:17.160
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.201
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

814
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm a total sociopath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still preach a little sympathy on</v>

815
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:34.440
<v Speaker 3>this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

816
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

817
00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:38.010
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

818
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 3>the feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll call you that.</v>

819
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:41.680
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think has some terrible thing,</v>

820
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:45.100
<v Speaker 3>especially where the male feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but trying to get Brownie points.</v>

821
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>warm honey of the,</v>

822
00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.373
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war.</v>

823
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Male feminists</v>
<v Speaker 3>do their Twitter profile and,</v>

824
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 3>but I usually don't write male</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists.</v>

825
00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 3>They're just feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just feminist.</v>

826
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

827
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 3>how long has it been?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long does it,</v>

828
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.270
<v Speaker 3>they just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to ask them how long has it been?</v>

829
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Like two months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

830
00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:05.981
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

831
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:07.330
<v Speaker 3>How long has it been?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two years.</v>

832
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.770
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're a feminist.</v>

833
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.940
<v Speaker 3>But this is what they don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the kind of women they're sucking up</v>

834
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.440
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't even want them.</v>

835
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women don't want men to speak about</v>

836
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:18.460
<v Speaker 3>feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they don't want allies because no man</v>

837
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 3>is ever going to be good enough to speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>about women's issues is the crux of</v>

838
00:31:20.771 --> 00:31:21.520
<v Speaker 3>identity politics.</v>

839
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Modern feminists don't want men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hate man.</v>

840
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Stop sucking up to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way you're going to get them is</v>

841
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 3>to connect them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way you're going to get them is</v>

842
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:32.380
<v Speaker 3>to say you are a ridiculous fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>whore and I'm paying you no attention</v>

843
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever and that's how you get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

844
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.300
<v Speaker 3>it's worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works that way.</v>

845
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not that language,</v>

846
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 3>but you know you're addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're ridiculous woman.</v>

847
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying no attention whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that key second part of the phrase</v>

848
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.580
<v Speaker 3>was what I was really focusing on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>second part of that phrase.</v>

849
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:50.581
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes him come running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being shuttled games like a Turkey.</v>

850
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.574
<v Speaker 3>You got to know her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

851
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 3>No one to make the hand because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have skin in the game.</v>

852
00:31:55.841 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 3>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm able to analyze these things just</v>

853
00:31:57.551 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 3>passionately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

854
00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.890
<v Speaker 3>there's some truth to that.</v>

855
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely some truth to wise</v>

856
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.240
<v Speaker 3>gate uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who can just sort of from a</v>

857
00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 3>distance can tell you what's it telling</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

858
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.520
<v Speaker 3>what's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening.</v>

859
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just pathetic to watch those poor</v>
<v Speaker 3>men grovel.</v>

860
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Grovel for Social Brownie points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes it is.</v>

861
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.320
<v Speaker 3>And they're never going to get the hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

862
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 3>I'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to happen,</v>

863
00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:22.411
<v Speaker 3>but it's even that they can't see that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about feminism.</v>

864
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:26.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not about masculinism either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's a word.</v>

865
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.320
<v Speaker 3>It's about people not being full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

866
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not crying victim when you're not really</v>

867
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:37.810
<v Speaker 3>a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not pulling the fucking fire alarm on a</v>

868
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Pr Guy who's a that Toronto thing where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

869
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 3>the guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they totally misrepresented the position</v>

870
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 3>of his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misrepresented what his position was on</v>

871
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Speaker 3>women period and on men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was just essentially trying to</v>

872
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 3>highlight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some men have and they were calling them</v>

873
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call me.</v>

874
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 3>I quite like getting insults because I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to,</v>

875
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to rate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get them marks out of 10 and then I</v>

876
00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 3>come back to the troll and I explained</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they could've made it better.</v>

877
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:06.970
<v Speaker 3>How they could improve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

878
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.690
<v Speaker 3>so I like to take my tape to troll</v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

879
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people send you good things</v>

880
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:12.980
<v Speaker 3>like go take up off of the toaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite funny.</v>

881
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:13.814
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

882
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More people [inaudible] they just didn't</v>

883
00:33:17.841 --> 00:33:19.730
<v Speaker 3>circuit breaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I liked to joke anyway.</v>

884
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

885
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:23.360
<v Speaker 3>you deserve to die two out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

886
00:33:23.361 --> 00:33:24.194
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do better.</v>

887
00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is what they do and this is what</v>

888
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:26.981
<v Speaker 3>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

889
00:33:26.981 --> 00:33:27.291
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

890
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 3>the insults and ridicule and demean and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to discredit the speaker.</v>

891
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 3>And if they can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will do some other kind of</v>

892
00:33:33.021 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 3>silencing of no platforming and</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

893
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 3>So those opinions can never be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.530
<v Speaker 3>they do not want those opinions ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>aired in public because those opinions</v>

895
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:41.390
<v Speaker 3>and the facts that underpin them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

896
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.270
<v Speaker 3>the reasoning that underpins them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what people go to these talks</v>

897
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:46.700
<v Speaker 3>to here is so dangerous to feminist</v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative,</v>

898
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 3>which is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

899
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.000
<v Speaker 3>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on feeling and not fact based on,</v>

900
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:50.883
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

901
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.990
<v Speaker 3>bigotry and Kloss and gender hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not any kind of sensible analysis.</v>

902
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 3>The way the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got so many invitations to</v>

903
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 3>universities for the next six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

904
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:05.390
<v Speaker 3>this isn't an advertisement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 feminists listening,</v>

905
00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 3>but I know this is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

906
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.600
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the talks go on anyway,</v>

907
00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:10.640
<v Speaker 3>it just takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes up a whole day of your life</v>

908
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:11.480
<v Speaker 3>instead of an afternoon.</v>

909
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.171
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

910
00:34:12.171 --> 00:34:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I know it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got talk,</v>

911
00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:13.881
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm speaking at Universum swings at USC</v>

913
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:18.200
<v Speaker 3>a Republican's next week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm speaking,</v>

914
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

915
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 3>to a bunch of UK and US universities</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the next six months.</v>

916
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 3>And I just know what's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

917
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:26.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this extraordinary like a homeless</v>

918
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:27.261
<v Speaker 3>gay dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sky News now and again.</v>

920
00:34:29.931 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

921
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 3>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm like the scariest opponent,</v>

922
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:33.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have,</v>

923
00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 3>they've got real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

924
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.550
<v Speaker 3>but you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of what we highlighted earlier,</v>

925
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.370
<v Speaker 3>they can't dismiss it is semi joking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit.</v>

926
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:40.811
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:34:40.811 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 3>semi joking but I'm not kind of a game</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make your argument for God's sake.</v>

928
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 3>And why is it that for the last 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have been incapable or unwilling of</v>

929
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:52.190
<v Speaker 3>actually making an argument and instead</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do everything they can to simply</v>

930
00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:53.960
<v Speaker 3>get the speaker out of the public eye.</v>

931
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they exist in an echo chamber.</v>

932
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

933
00:34:57.091 --> 00:35:01.080
<v Speaker 3>the forums that they go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Twitter groups that they,</v>

934
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I've gone to people's pages cause I find</v>
<v Speaker 3>out they're ridiculous.</v>

935
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.920
<v Speaker 3>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read an article about this page and</v>

936
00:35:05.921 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 3>went to his Twitter page and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>already blocked.</v>

937
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I'd never even interacted with block</v>
<v Speaker 3>lists.</v>

938
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.030
<v Speaker 3>You want a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on a block list is probably cause</v>

939
00:35:13.031 --> 00:35:15.260
<v Speaker 3>you following me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seem to be,</v>

940
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.330
<v Speaker 3>I seem to like sort of Voldemort for</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys.</v>

941
00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Just had a few controversial things</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

942
00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:22.160
<v Speaker 3>It might just be thinking about saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wasn't as controversial thing.</v>

943
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 3>If it was at Tommy fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will take a long time.</v>

944
00:35:24.351 --> 00:35:27.020
<v Speaker 3>We'd have to get me through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

945
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of say that?</v>

946
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 3>You're saying if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a man,</v>

947
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you call yourself a feminist.</v>

948
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I hope you choke to death on Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pizza.</v>

949
00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:39.461
<v Speaker 3>Why crying to a lady Gaga Song is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>she upset with me.</v>

950
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Variable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that controversial?</v>

951
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it talking about death?</v>

952
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

953
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.500
<v Speaker 3>I prefer they get raped with wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Male rape is not as bad as female rape</v>

954
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:52.261
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

955
00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:55.020
<v Speaker 3>You could say like male rape to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pizza.</v>

956
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem as awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

957
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:58.230
<v Speaker 3>some of us go out and search with male</v>
<v Speaker 3>rape.</v>

958
00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a comical thing to say though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A man being raped by a pizza.</v>

959
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if a woman gets raped by pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just funny.</v>

960
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It's just so nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not well.</v>

961
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 3>You see hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>

962
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>

963
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I liked that you find it horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it shows to me that chivalry is</v>

964
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:17.630
<v Speaker 3>not dead and you have a decent respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

965
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

966
00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for women and for speaking about women</v>

967
00:36:20.191 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

968
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.700
<v Speaker 3>And I like that you're offended by what</v>
<v Speaker 3>offended because I like that you find it</v>

969
00:36:23.701 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 3>distasteful to speak of women in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>way because it speaks well of you.</v>

970
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what feminism is done,</v>

971
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.340
<v Speaker 3>I think what feminism has done is made</v>
<v Speaker 3>it very difficult to be nice about women</v>

972
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:34.230
<v Speaker 3>because the critic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this environment where there's so much</v>

973
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 3>hate and bile and ridiculed men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men feel like they've got to respond in</v>

974
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:40.690
<v Speaker 3>kind or just check out entirely and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

975
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.560
<v Speaker 3>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I don't buy.</v>

976
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:49.270
<v Speaker 3>I think you have a very small minority</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not very attractive who get really</v>

977
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 3>upset at men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have a theory about sociological</v>

978
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:56.340
<v Speaker 3>shit when it comes to these really</v>
<v Speaker 3>radical anti male feminists.</v>

979
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is a constant state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rejection,</v>

980
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.510
<v Speaker 3>but these disproportionate effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's on these,</v>

981
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.700
<v Speaker 3>these ugly women who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

982
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 3>there are all sorts of studies which I</v>
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

983
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 3>which show the ugly women are much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to be liberals.</v>

984
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course they make sense for all</v>

985
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:13.340
<v Speaker 3>the reasons you would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

986
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.640
<v Speaker 3>so they find feminism or perhaps they</v>
<v Speaker 3>start losing their looks in their</v>

987
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.080
<v Speaker 3>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they did.</v>

988
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:17.790
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

989
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slide back into feminism.</v>

990
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

991
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Speaker 3>women are gone at 30 on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

992
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:26.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

993
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

994
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:31.030
<v Speaker 3>I like sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the tip of gates that take,</v>

995
00:37:31.031 --> 00:37:32.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my eight 30 and I like to start</v>

996
00:37:32.821 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 3>requesting things in their forties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they'll leave and go to</v>

997
00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:37.410
<v Speaker 3>yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what the statistics show is that,</v>

998
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

999
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their thirties,</v>

1000
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 3>if they're still single stock a bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuts,</v>

1001
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 3>they report themselves as being</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally more unhappy with life,</v>

1002
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:47.600
<v Speaker 3>more likely to have contemplated</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide,</v>

1003
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 3>like pressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1004
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 3>men considered retreat into point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>video games.</v>

1005
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:53.850
<v Speaker 3>But women get women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women go nuts if they're single in their</v>

1006
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:53.930
<v Speaker 3>thirties.</v>

1007
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 3>So thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feminism,</v>

1008
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:56.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's all women.</v>

1009
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1010
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.300
<v Speaker 3>you don't know you it so much ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>already by allowing yourself to be taken</v>

1011
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Speaker 3>over by this leftist clap around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just being objective since we speak.</v>

1012
00:38:06.961 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 3>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a soft quantify.</v>

1013
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:09.060
<v Speaker 3>When you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1014
00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:10.760
<v Speaker 3>women are x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean most people next is,</v>

1015
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.740
<v Speaker 3>it is understood that you speaking in</v>
<v Speaker 3>generalities,</v>

1016
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:16.590
<v Speaker 3>it's annoying to women that aren't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that telling like shit,</v>

1017
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.550
<v Speaker 3>get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is understood that you're speaking</v>

1018
00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:23.310
<v Speaker 3>generalities without general assays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to communicate.</v>

1019
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a British thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>British thing.</v>

1020
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:27.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just a not being nit picky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick,</v>

1021
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.870
<v Speaker 3>there's a simple addition to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sentence.</v>

1022
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:32.470
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well understood there.</v>

1023
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:36.000
<v Speaker 3>When you say are many men who have gold,</v>

1024
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 1>men are leaving</v>
<v Speaker 1>language policing.</v>

1025
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 1>You've given it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given it over already.</v>

1026
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 1>You have a language policing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>halfway to feminism.</v>

1027
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy come in for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was ugly.</v>

1028
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:51.930
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he end,</v>

1029
00:38:51.931 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 1>he used to get rejected all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started getting really fucking angry.</v>

1030
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And as he got older we had to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with them because he would,</v>

1031
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would meet girls who've tried to hit</v>

1032
00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say no,</v>

1033
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:04.810
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lesbians.</v>

1034
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:08.750
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking cunt lessons and just work</v>
<v Speaker 1>out or funny or get money.</v>

1035
00:39:08.751 --> 00:39:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's any man can do at least one of</v>

1036
00:39:11.831 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 1>those three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can walk out,</v>

1037
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.750
<v Speaker 1>anyone can learn to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During that process,</v>

1038
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 1>during that process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have sexual needs.</v>

1039
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had not accomplished any of those</v>

1040
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was not,</v>

1041
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:27.070
<v Speaker 1>would not attractive to these women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because he wasn't attracted these</v>

1042
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:30.820
<v Speaker 1>women I witnessed over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing him for several years,</v>

1043
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed this massage Negro inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1044
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And it was based on the interactions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had with women that were all</v>

1045
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interactions he had with women.</v>

1046
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 1>He came away feeling bad about himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling rejected.</v>

1047
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.840
<v Speaker 1>And so he started to project that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the root cause of this issue.</v>

1048
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I had to seek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a lot of the same</v>

1049
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 1>phone as feminists.</v>

1050
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Problem is that society has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>architected in such a way that those,</v>

1051
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.750
<v Speaker 2>those outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those rejections are now not just the</v>

1052
00:39:57.751 --> 00:40:00.300
<v Speaker 2>norm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but almost enforced by a woman's need to</v>

1053
00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:01.680
<v Speaker 2>reject a man and to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:02.850
<v Speaker 2>look at this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.670
<v Speaker 2>unwanted advances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual Harrison,</v>

1056
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:05.910
<v Speaker 2>basically what it means,</v>

1057
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.690
<v Speaker 1>it's tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are the monsters,</v>

1058
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 1>the monster women who are trying to push</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're so small.</v>

1059
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:12.580
<v Speaker 1>It's such a small percentage.</v>

1060
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.480
<v Speaker 2>You grossly underestimate the influence</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people have on not just debate in</v>

1061
00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:20.000
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on policy and universities and even</v>

1062
00:40:20.001 --> 00:40:21.470
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at California.</v>

1063
00:40:21.471 --> 00:40:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes means yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Affirmative consent laws.</v>

1064
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:27.740
<v Speaker 2>This stuff becomes law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't California roll and when it,</v>

1065
00:40:27.741 --> 00:40:29.600
<v Speaker 2>when it starts in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's spreads elsewhere.</v>

1066
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Every unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

1067
00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:34.520
<v Speaker 2>every big American University has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous code of conduct that's got</v>

1068
00:40:34.521 --> 00:40:36.920
<v Speaker 2>this stuff embedded in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it comes from the,</v>

1069
00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1070
00:40:37.821 --> 00:40:39.920
<v Speaker 2>it comes from the crazies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I admit,</v>

1071
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I willingly admit that most of them were</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful and they don't buy into this</v>

1072
00:40:44.061 --> 00:40:45.830
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And indeed of course in just what does</v>

1073
00:40:45.831 --> 00:40:49.190
<v Speaker 2>it in just two years from 28% of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to 18% of them identify as</v>

1074
00:40:49.191 --> 00:40:50.720
<v Speaker 2>feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fewer than one in five women call</v>

1075
00:40:50.721 --> 00:40:52.190
<v Speaker 2>themselves feminists because they see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we see,</v>

1076
00:40:52.191 --> 00:40:54.560
<v Speaker 2>which is that these feminists are all</v>
<v Speaker 2>misaddressed lesbian,</v>

1077
00:40:54.561 --> 00:40:55.670
<v Speaker 2>manic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy people,</v>

1078
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.720
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1079
00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.650
<v Speaker 2>But those messengers lesbian at crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are effecting laws in this</v>

1080
00:41:00.651 --> 00:41:04.010
<v Speaker 2>country and in my country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're effecting conduct codes of</v>

1081
00:41:04.011 --> 00:41:05.690
<v Speaker 2>conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university that dictate a man's</v>

1082
00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:08.290
<v Speaker 2>entire future and a woman's entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>future for that matter and their</v>

1083
00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:11.370
<v Speaker 2>happiness and good sexual health and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the that you know,</v>

1084
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.660
<v Speaker 2>at the destination of the species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that men and women interact with</v>

1085
00:41:14.661 --> 00:41:16.550
<v Speaker 2>each other's becoming poisoned by these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1086
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.890
<v Speaker 2>You grotesquely underestimate their</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>

1087
00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:21.140
<v Speaker 2>If you write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write them off as a few mad crazies in</v>

1088
00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:26.030
<v Speaker 2>student unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have gigantic purchase on,</v>

1089
00:41:26.031 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 2>on the media and therefore on</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>

1090
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly do when it comes to</v>

1091
00:41:29.551 --> 00:41:32.970
<v Speaker 1>schools in schools to be repeating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of huge issue for,</v>

1092
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>for</v>

1093
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 2>women getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a sexually assaulted on campus.</v>

1094
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Listen though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your president is parroting these myths</v>

1095
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 2>from these pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1096
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Obama has repeated the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sexual harassment myth.</v>

1097
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Obama has also repeated the wage gap</v>
<v Speaker 2>myth.</v>

1098
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 2>You've dismissing these people are sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of powerless fringe crazies.</v>

1099
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.600
<v Speaker 2>The president of the United States is</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating their talking points.</v>

1100
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell me these people aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>influential.</v>

1101
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1102
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1103
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the president,</v>

1104
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 2>the president is really just a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to parrot what everybody else</v>

1105
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:06.610
<v Speaker 2>sort of already believes anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that's what the progressive</v>

1106
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 2>democratic person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if a republican president</v>

1107
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:11.300
<v Speaker 2>would be any different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be a lot more Jesus talk.</v>

1108
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 2>What else would be different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would tell the truth.</v>

1109
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Trump would tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really like Trump or it's a troll</v>

1110
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.100
<v Speaker 2>not accusing me of trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a horrible allegations.</v>

1111
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:23.961
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1112
00:42:23.961 --> 00:42:26.480
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a horrible whole remark to make.</v>

1113
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1114
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do really like him.</v>

1115
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I really want them in the White</v>

1116
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.990
<v Speaker 2>House?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can fill in the gap today,</v>

1117
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1118
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 2>but I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to in the race for as long as</v>

1119
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1120
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.660
<v Speaker 2>he taps into you and I both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1121
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I don't have a fraction of</v>

1122
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:42.900
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1123
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:43.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1124
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 2>reaching an extraordinary audience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fans.</v>

1125
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:50.660
<v Speaker 2>But we're both in our own ways kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>counter cultural figures and very</v>

1126
00:42:50.661 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 2>popular counter cultural figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that you may not like this,</v>

1127
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:59.501
<v Speaker 2>but I think Trump taps into a similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>vein of frustration and suspicion and</v>

1128
00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 2>hatred of the establishment of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>political media classes.</v>

1129
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I think you and I both benefit from</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture to the tonight,</v>

1130
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:10.670
<v Speaker 2>both benefit from some of the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts that make people quite like</v>

1131
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>

1132
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 2>They don't like Trump because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe what he has to say on about</v>

1133
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 2>taxation because they know he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>inconsistent on that.</v>

1134
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.800
<v Speaker 2>They might like what he says about</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration,</v>

1135
00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.370
<v Speaker 2>but they don't necessarily like the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>

1136
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a funder to Hillary and all he got</v>

1137
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:24.500
<v Speaker 2>out of it was her showing up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding in many cases,</v>

1138
00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 2>particularly like the way he speaks</v>
<v Speaker 2>about women.</v>

1139
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think Carly funeral was fearing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was magnificent in that debate.</v>

1140
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.280
<v Speaker 2>But what they do like is the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1141
00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give a shit.</v>

1142
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.600
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't apologize and give such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic,</v>

1143
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 2>brilliant bloody nose to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment that has drifted so far</v>

1144
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:40.280
<v Speaker 2>from ordinary people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I both,</v>

1145
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both net beneficiaries of that same</v>

1146
00:43:42.591 --> 00:43:45.110
<v Speaker 2>frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I like Trump because I</v>

1147
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:46.140
<v Speaker 2>think broader look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1148
00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him in the White House.</v>

1149
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.021
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1150
00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell anyone this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1151
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them in the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do understand why people like him</v>

1152
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 2>and the instinct that people have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like him,</v>

1153
00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:59.790
<v Speaker 2>that sort of sense of mischief and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gadfly Irishness.</v>

1154
00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.230
<v Speaker 2>The reason people want to vote for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes the establishment</v>

1155
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Republicans so angry and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it,</v>

1156
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:09.320
<v Speaker 2>and I totally get that and I have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sympathy for those people.</v>

1157
00:44:09.321 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I agree with those people on a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

1158
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I agree with them entirely about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>failings and a corruption of the,</v>

1159
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:20.810
<v Speaker 2>of the media and political establishment</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally.</v>

1160
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree with them on all of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1161
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 2>so I wouldn't call myself a Trump fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am a fellow traveler,</v>

1162
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 2>a fellow traveler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the politicians,</v>

1163
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.410
<v Speaker 2>it's the failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1164
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 2>When it comes</v>

1165
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.490
<v Speaker 1>to American politics and American</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

1166
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some parallels to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn and I think one of the parallels</v>

1167
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 1>is that any of these ancient systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were established back when the</v>

1168
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 1>world was completely different and</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the Internet,</v>

1169
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 1>they are no longer valid today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not.</v>

1170
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're clinging to these old ways of</v>

1171
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 1>operating that if you try to propose</v>
<v Speaker 1>them today,</v>

1172
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.370
<v Speaker 1>no one would buy into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one would buy into American</v>

1173
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you tried to propose the way you</v>

1174
00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:05.760
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you tried to propose the whole</v>

1175
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 1>educational system as it is today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you put people out of college when</v>

1176
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you release them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are hundreds of thousands of</v>

1177
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 1>dollars in debt with no fucking jobs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be seen.</v>

1178
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's wrong isn't that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anachronistic because there are</v>

1179
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 1>things that are not strictly justifiable</v>
<v Speaker 1>with logic,</v>

1180
00:45:22.741 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 1>which nonetheless work best.</v>

1181
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monarchy.</v>

1182
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1183
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.200
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make a plausible argument as</v>

1184
00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 1>to why we should have a test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

1185
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get them out,</v>

1186
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another established a new</v>

1187
00:45:34.141 --> 00:45:35.420
<v Speaker 1>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what happened,</v>

1188
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.000
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read anything that's anything</v>

1189
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a necessary condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>

1190
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:39.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1191
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 1>the Monica in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't make a,</v>

1192
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you can't make a plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational argument to establish a ruling</v>

1193
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 1>monarchy in United Kingdom today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it works best.</v>

1194
00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the best system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>works the best.</v>

1195
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 1>What's best for expressed for you means</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't get,</v>

1196
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a European style president with his</v>

1197
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:58.560
<v Speaker 1>retinue of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jaguars.</v>

1198
00:45:58.561 --> 00:46:00.210
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of the kind of pomp and</v>

1199
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:01.770
<v Speaker 1>circumstance and nonsense that goes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1200
00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the British people understand,</v>

1201
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:10.170
<v Speaker 1>United Americans understand this too</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the importance of significance,</v>

1202
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:15.171
<v Speaker 1>the binding power and the value of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition in institution and history and</v>

1203
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 1>it's something that progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive is hate.</v>

1204
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 1>All of the assumptions on which these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are based,</v>

1205
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 1>they hate all of the effects of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1206
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:22.710
<v Speaker 1>which is generally to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1207
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1208
00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 1>and I think British people instinctively</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the value of having a</v>

1209
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:31.050
<v Speaker 1>national icon of figurehead and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from all over the world because</v>

1210
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:32.850
<v Speaker 1>they record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they instinctively understand this too.</v>

1211
00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1212
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.480
<v Speaker 1>the monarchy just his works best for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that should be an earned</v>

1213
00:46:37.481 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 1>position though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1214
00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:41.840
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what we're all trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish in life is doing this.</v>

1215
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Speaker 1>This is why I don't believe in grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>internships because I think they</v>

1216
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:49.050
<v Speaker 1>introduced a dangerous element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism into the system.</v>

1217
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I think people were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terry is there</v>

1218
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.880
<v Speaker 1>jumbo shrimp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will take bread to rule and they</v>

1219
00:46:56.881 --> 00:47:00.330
<v Speaker 1>should be allowed to get on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Born and bred to rule.</v>

1220
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You're hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're fucking trolling now you're</v>

1221
00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:05.580
<v Speaker 1>trolling you son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>

1222
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.460
<v Speaker 1>you know why you're trying to introduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1223
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:12.470
<v Speaker 1>A real of a plausible dangerous level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian to colleges and the,</v>

1224
00:47:13.271 --> 00:47:13.631
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1225
00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 1>the system that was in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then obviously I do what my point,</v>

1226
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 1>my point which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a serious point is that,</v>

1227
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it's anachronistic doesn't</v>

1228
00:47:21.691 --> 00:47:23.650
<v Speaker 1>make it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are problems with the,</v>

1229
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.090
<v Speaker 1>with the university system in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think just because you</v>

1230
00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't construct it like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed today,</v>

1231
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 1>that means you shouldn't do it at all.</v>

1232
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monica is a good example of that.</v>

1233
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 3>No one's saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1234
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:35.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the Monica is a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>example of that because I think it's</v>

1235
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same Americans,</v>

1236
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Americans have the same [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans have the same reverence or</v>

1237
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 3>adjuster for the office of the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1238
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the office office of the president,</v>

1239
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reverence for the office.</v>

1240
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Not everybody in this country likes any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1241
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:54.260
<v Speaker 3>any given president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

1242
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.010
<v Speaker 3>but you will hear Republicans say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't say that about Obama.</v>

1243
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.570
<v Speaker 3>He's the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not my president.</v>

1244
00:47:58.571 --> 00:47:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is the president.</v>

1245
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:02.300
<v Speaker 3>So show him some respect for American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1246
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.950
<v Speaker 3>come on Americans that Americans do have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an understanding with him than I think</v>

1247
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 3>any president because he's just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking terrible obviously,</v>

1248
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:11.590
<v Speaker 3>but we'll do sad is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1249
00:48:11.591 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 3>he's reduced your standing in the world.</v>

1250
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.070
<v Speaker 3>So badly home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No idea.</v>

1251
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Please tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a foreigner on my soil,</v>

1252
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1253
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I love America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of those,</v>

1254
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.290
<v Speaker 3>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those Brits who repeated by</v>

1255
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 3>people when I'm not exactly sure if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a real stance on it.</v>

1256
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Like why is Obama so terrible in</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to other presidents</v>

1257
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.860
<v Speaker 3>kiss in Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen the future.</v>

1258
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Obama wants and we know it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen socialized healthcare.</v>

1259
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 3>We've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1260
00:48:40.721 --> 00:48:44.860
<v Speaker 3>in gorgeous of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen these crazy feminist ideas</v>

1261
00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:48.000
<v Speaker 3>about the wage gap and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1262
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and rapes on campus.</v>

1263
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 3>We have all this in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why America is great because</v>

1264
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 3>it's not Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything that I'd seen</v>

1265
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 2>here from Obama suggest to me that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to take America,</v>

1266
00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was used to be the case that Europe</v>

1267
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 2>follow America's lead in so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful things,</v>

1268
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:01.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's pop culture and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1269
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 2>and I personally think we'll lose all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those have been largely positive,</v>

1270
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imports.</v>

1271
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.910
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it now seems like America's</v>

1272
00:49:09.911 --> 00:49:11.740
<v Speaker 2>following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe's leading in censorship,</v>

1273
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:16.090
<v Speaker 2>in cracking down on free expression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity and all that kind of stuff</v>

1274
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:16.811
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 2>socialized healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things are disasters.</v>

1276
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will hear from Brits because it's</v>

1277
00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 2>the correct thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The NHS is the envy of the world.</v>

1278
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just encourage you where maybe</v>

1279
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

1280
00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't take any sick relatives but</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to an NHS hospital.</v>

1281
00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.430
<v Speaker 2>It is horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrendous conditions.</v>

1282
00:49:33.431 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Dreadful people die in them all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1283
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a scandal a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people dying and you know,</v>

1284
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:40.720
<v Speaker 2>some hospital and the Labor government</v>
<v Speaker 2>just didn't give a shit or didn't do</v>

1285
00:49:40.721 --> 00:49:42.700
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though knew this is not,</v>

1286
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a glittering utopia.</v>

1287
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some problems with American</v>

1288
00:49:46.181 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 2>model and healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trust me,</v>

1289
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:48.970
<v Speaker 2>you do not want the NHS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1290
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way that Obama is pushing</v>

1291
00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 2>America to be more like Europe I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>is some,</v>

1292
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:55.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to hasten its decline as a</v>

1293
00:49:55.211 --> 00:49:59.050
<v Speaker 2>world power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have seen your future as my colleague</v>

1294
00:49:59.051 --> 00:50:00.520
<v Speaker 2>at Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Telling Paul wrote a book,</v>

1295
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I think he called it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you called it a bomb Obama mania</v>

1296
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 2>and that we've seen your future and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>

1297
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.470
<v Speaker 2>And it was a sort of a love letter to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States explaining that,</v>

1298
00:50:08.471 --> 00:50:11.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen where Obama wants to go</v>

1299
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.840
<v Speaker 2>because we're living it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust me,</v>

1300
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:14.703
<v Speaker 2>it's not what you want.</v>

1301
00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.700
<v Speaker 3>But if the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that really what Obama wants to do</v>

1302
00:50:17.701 --> 00:50:19.620
<v Speaker 3>and where he wants to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that was the case,</v>

1303
00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:24.621
<v Speaker 3>like if you compare what Obama stood for</v>
<v Speaker 3>before he got into office and what he's</v>

1304
00:50:24.811 --> 00:50:26.320
<v Speaker 3>doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can anybody work?</v>

1305
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:27.154
<v Speaker 3>What that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that,</v>

1306
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1307
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 2>how about the hope and change website</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they talked about the actions</v>

1308
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:34.160
<v Speaker 2>against whistleblowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is hoping to change website were a</v>

1309
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:38.260
<v Speaker 2>big part of his platform was if the</v>
<v Speaker 2>routine morning whistle blowers actually</v>

1310
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 2>made evaporated as soon as he entered</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Oval Office,</v>

1311
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Guantanamo whistleblowers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the really important style,</v>

1312
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.640
<v Speaker 2>the morals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral statements that,</v>

1313
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it was,</v>

1314
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 2>is the kind of things that tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of man he is.</v>

1315
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whistle blower stuff,</v>

1316
00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 2>the Guantanamo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that give you a sense of</v>

1317
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 2>where his moral center is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were the things that he jettisoned</v>

1318
00:50:56.361 --> 00:50:59.140
<v Speaker 2>the minute he entered the Oval Office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I,</v>

1319
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.320
<v Speaker 2>why I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1320
00:51:00.321 --> 00:51:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

1321
00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:03.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1322
00:51:03.941 --> 00:51:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a manifesto and you try</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see as much of your manifesto</v>

1323
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 2>through as you can and people hold you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to account for any one person really</v>

1324
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:12.920
<v Speaker 2>truly has enough position.</v>

1325
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bullshit job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope pointed by the United States is</v>

1326
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 2>structured is to limit the power of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

1327
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1328
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.820
<v Speaker 2>that you have all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1329
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:22.250
<v Speaker 2>built into the system and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

1330
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 2>But he does have a huge influence on</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people talk about,</v>

1331
00:51:25.251 --> 00:51:26.940
<v Speaker 2>how they talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1332
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 2>he makes decisions about foreign foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy and war.</v>

1333
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.911
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1334
00:51:29.911 --> 00:51:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

1335
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.430
<v Speaker 2>that are a nation can decide about</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is who it's going to fight.</v>

1336
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:35.421
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
00:51:35.421 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 2>he does make those kinds of decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those kinds of decisions matter.</v>

1338
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.760
<v Speaker 2>And he also has the power to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say he does,</v>

1339
00:51:40.761 --> 00:51:44.420
<v Speaker 2>but he does based on what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on you seeing him talking on</v>

1340
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea what exactly is going on</v>

1341
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:47.970
<v Speaker 2>behind the scene.</v>

1342
00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:49.610
<v Speaker 2>It was the president has the executive</v>
<v Speaker 2>authority to,</v>

1343
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to launch whatever.</v>

1344
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.910
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm talking purely in</v>
<v Speaker 2>practical terms,</v>

1345
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy can send planes to places,</v>

1346
00:51:55.131 --> 00:51:56.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1347
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 2>but everything we've seen from Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests that,</v>

1348
00:51:58.611 --> 00:51:59.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants,</v>

1349
00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.290
<v Speaker 2>he wants to take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1350
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:05.150
<v Speaker 2>a sort of a sort of weird progressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialized pseudo European approach to</v>

1351
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.210
<v Speaker 2>domestic policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare taxation.</v>

1352
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 2>And this scares us in Europe because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

1353
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 2>we looked up to you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

1354
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:12.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1355
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:16.000
<v Speaker 2>you know what it was America for me as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>European and you,</v>

1356
00:52:16.001 --> 00:52:18.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your viewers are gonna pick holes in</v>

1357
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1358
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain is probably the greatest country</v>

1359
00:52:22.941 --> 00:52:26.330
<v Speaker 2>in the world because it didn't invent</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy or property rights or you</v>

1360
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those great values that,</v>

1361
00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:30.110
<v Speaker 2>that now the world basically revolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1362
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:31.690
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the best at spreading limit.</v>

1363
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1364
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.110
<v Speaker 2>England in particular spread democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>property rights,</v>

1365
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:39.440
<v Speaker 2>freedom around the world and everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Britain has been is a nice place to</v>

1366
00:52:39.441 --> 00:52:41.090
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anywhere that person hasn't been,</v>

1367
00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:42.740
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't want to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1368
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:47.860
<v Speaker 2>and America is sort of the distillation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the highest and best values of</v>

1369
00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Britishness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1370
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.640
<v Speaker 2>freedom and democracy and free speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this kind of stuff.</v>

1371
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:54.220
<v Speaker 2>America was America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1372
00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:55.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this petri dish of what,</v>

1373
00:52:55.251 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we take the very best of British</v>

1374
00:52:57.891 --> 00:52:59.870
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that we've spent centuries,</v>

1375
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>propagating around the world,</v>

1376
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.560
<v Speaker 2>making the world a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperous,</v>

1377
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:06.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fair place to live,</v>

1378
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.950
<v Speaker 2>what will happen if we take them and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut all the crap out and we make a</v>

1379
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:12.500
<v Speaker 2>country like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we did,</v>

1380
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 2>it was America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that Americans is that you said we</v>

1381
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1382
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.620
<v Speaker 2>America was established by people</v>
<v Speaker 2>fleeing Britain.</v>

1383
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.491
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1384
00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:23.690
<v Speaker 2>But then they enforce it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've been in decline for</v>

1385
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:24.650
<v Speaker 2>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1386
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:27.180
<v Speaker 2>but importing to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the values that Britain spread around</v>

1387
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 2>the world have a hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't the whole deal that we</v>

1388
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get the fuck away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you guys represented so far.</v>

1389
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:33.511
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1390
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Not everything is a misnomer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1391
00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:36.121
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1392
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1393
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is founded on British values.</v>

1394
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.930
<v Speaker 2>America was founded on values that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>British spread throughout the world.</v>

1395
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these values and those values and these</v>

1396
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:45.990
<v Speaker 2>institutions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking,</v>

1397
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:46.824
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1398
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1399
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 2>democracy specifically kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>parliamentary version of democracy</v>

1400
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:53.160
<v Speaker 2>rather than a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the particular model of democracy,</v>

1401
00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:57.140
<v Speaker 2>freedom and free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were profiting from the TV rights,</v>

1402
00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:58.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1403
00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 2>leave their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they were as these,</v>

1404
00:54:00.331 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 2>these values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1405
00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.270
<v Speaker 2>the Britains spread to Indiana spray to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1406
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bits of the Middle East that Britain</v>

1407
00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:08.270
<v Speaker 2>went to the nice places to live now</v>
<v Speaker 2>where women,</v>

1408
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.530
<v Speaker 2>women can dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they like Kuwait for example,</v>

1409
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 2>not terrible place to be where Britain</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't go.</v>

1410
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Saudi not a place you'd want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1411
00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any way that Britain has touched has</v>

1412
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 2>become better for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Japan.</v>

1413
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:18.570
<v Speaker 2>They were all suits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1414
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.310
<v Speaker 2>they talk our language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were our suits,</v>

1415
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.540
<v Speaker 2>the influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is it.</v>

1416
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:22.770
<v Speaker 2>This is Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its influence on the world.</v>

1417
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 2>No other country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else can touch it.</v>

1418
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Not Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Holland.</v>

1419
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else can touch Britain for just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheer global influence.</v>

1420
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

1421
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:32.671
<v Speaker 2>all places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain's,</v>

1422
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:36.600
<v Speaker 2>that Britain has touched are</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically better as a result.</v>

1423
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of highest distillation of</v>

1424
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:40.740
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those values that,</v>

1425
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:42.300
<v Speaker 2>that Britain was spreading around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1426
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>it was a America and Obama is tearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>America away from those values.</v>

1427
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said it was a terrible</v>

1428
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 2>precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I struggle with,</v>

1429
00:54:50.131 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 2>with him in that office because he seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me to be profoundly,</v>

1430
00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:55.770
<v Speaker 2>and I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this is something that sort of</v>

1431
00:54:55.771 --> 00:54:57.320
<v Speaker 2>crazy right wingers on the internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>always say,</v>

1432
00:54:57.321 --> 00:54:59.300
<v Speaker 2>but he just seems to me to be profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 2>on American,</v>

1433
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.420
<v Speaker 2>on American Pacific respect.</v>

1434
00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.870
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't share the values on which</v>

1435
00:55:06.871 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 2>America was founded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In what sense though?</v>

1436
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:11.820
<v Speaker 2>And what way doesn't believe in free</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech because they think it's free</v>

1437
00:55:11.821 --> 00:55:14.640
<v Speaker 2>speech should be curtailed to save the</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings of certain,</v>

1438
00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intro interest groups and minority</v>

1439
00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 2>groups who doesn't believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1440
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:19.910
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you saying that?</v>

1441
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Where have you heard him say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1442
00:55:21.291 --> 00:55:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effectively the,</v>

1443
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 2>the stuff he says about Harrison didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

1444
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:26.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1445
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:28.950
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's bought into this Harrison nonsense,</v>

1446
00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:32.890
<v Speaker 2>this stuff he said about net neutrality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff he said about the rape campus</v>

1447
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:33.733
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this,</v>

1448
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 2>all of these things are satellites of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free speech argument,</v>

1449
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:38.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Net neutrality being a satellite of the</v>

1450
00:55:38.191 --> 00:55:39.910
<v Speaker 2>free speech or was this all about free</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech?</v>

1451
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Net neutrality and what's about</v>
<v Speaker 2>government regulating the internet?</v>

1452
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1453
00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:44.780
<v Speaker 2>It's about regulating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the gut known.</v>

1454
00:55:44.781 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 2>It's about the government regulating the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>

1455
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.000
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it needed new channels is about the</v>

1456
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:50.850
<v Speaker 2>government regulating the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having control over what private</v>

1457
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:54.180
<v Speaker 2>companies can do about the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a private company has with its own</v>

1458
00:55:54.181 --> 00:55:55.014
<v Speaker 2>customer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1459
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.160
<v Speaker 2>You have a service firm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your providers like a</v>

1460
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Comcast or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1461
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:59.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1462
00:55:59.971 --> 00:56:01.530
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your relationship with Comcast is a</v>

1463
00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:03.870
<v Speaker 2>private business arrangement between you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that company.</v>

1464
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Net neutrality is about the government</v>

1465
00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:09.300
<v Speaker 2>trying to intrude on that relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dictating what kind of business</v>

1466
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 2>arrangement you can come to with con</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comcast and it's going to say Comcast,</v>

1467
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 2>you can not offer this package of</v>
<v Speaker 2>services.</v>

1468
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.000
<v Speaker 2>You cannot suggest to the customer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be uh,</v>

1469
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 2>a higher tier service for people who pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

1470
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 2>you can get a better car if you pay more</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can get anything else in life.</v>

1472
00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>If you've</v>

1473
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 3>got more money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a better version of it.</v>

1474
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do any of that.</v>

1475
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.320
<v Speaker 3>We're going to insist because we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got this crazy idea of the</v>

1476
00:56:29.321 --> 00:56:31.180
<v Speaker 3>internet is some kind of utility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1477
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a water or something.</v>

1478
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.970
<v Speaker 3>We're going to come in here and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to regulate and control the</v>

1479
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 3>relationship that you are a private</v>
<v Speaker 3>company have with you.</v>

1480
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 3>A private individual that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1481
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.670
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is at its essence of free speech</v>

1482
00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:46.600
<v Speaker 3>argument because of what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start regulating that traffic.</v>

1483
00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Now the Internet traffic that is split</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1484
00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it's for Netflix,</v>

1485
00:56:50.081 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 3>some of us for emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some it's whatever.</v>

1486
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 3>The way in which certain things get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1487
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:57.130
<v Speaker 3>what it wants to do is say the all</v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic is neutral.</v>

1488
00:56:57.131 --> 00:56:58.420
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is all equal.</v>

1489
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well do not see the benefit of that.</v>

1490
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Do not see that [inaudible] has no basis</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1491
00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 3>do you not see that people would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned with the government being able</v>

1492
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:10.560
<v Speaker 3>to throttle internet away and puts not</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's about.</v>

1493
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Managed operations have them have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to decide how much bandwidth</v>

1494
00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:18.700
<v Speaker 3>goes to meringues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans were worrying about the power</v>

1495
00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 3>of corporations as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just worrying about it.</v>

1496
00:57:21.191 --> 00:57:24.730
<v Speaker 3>It's knowing the fact that this has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>done illegally already without</v>

1497
00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.620
<v Speaker 3>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think for a second that if the,</v>

1498
00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:30.670
<v Speaker 3>if the government has given the power to</v>
<v Speaker 3>regulate how an Internet service</v>

1499
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:33.640
<v Speaker 3>provider delivers it's packets of data</v>
<v Speaker 3>to consumers,</v>

1500
00:57:33.641 --> 00:57:37.090
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to then start to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder what's in those packets and then</v>

1501
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 3>start to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually,</v>

1502
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The net neutrality thing was fine.</v>

1503
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a really good idea and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved it and we really haven't bring</v>

1504
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:44.440
<v Speaker 3>that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually we've decided that this</v>

1505
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 3>kind of data is more important.</v>

1506
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:46.750
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to let you do that all</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1507
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Or indeed we're going to insist that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>prioritize this kind of data and that</v>

1508
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:53.260
<v Speaker 3>has consequences for the free market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's conference consequences for</v>

1509
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:55.170
<v Speaker 3>businesses for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1510
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in forcing,</v>

1511
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:59.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's why an open internet where</v>

1512
00:57:59.741 --> 00:58:04.070
<v Speaker 3>everyone has access to the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>service is what everybody wants.</v>

1513
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.153
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1514
00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:08.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is an argument in America,</v>

1515
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.860
<v Speaker 3>there's an argument that in insisting</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all packets a day show on the</v>

1516
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Internet are treated equally favors new</v>
<v Speaker 3>startups into the market because they</v>

1517
00:58:16.541 --> 00:58:19.790
<v Speaker 3>don't have to compete with incumbents</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have privileged access to high speed</v>

1518
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:24.220
<v Speaker 3>an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's not just startups,</v>

1519
00:58:24.221 --> 00:58:26.770
<v Speaker 3>it's people like me that are able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast things.</v>

1520
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 3>People that want to set up their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>servers and put together their own</v>

1521
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:31.660
<v Speaker 3>website that does whatever the fuck they</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to do.</v>

1522
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:35.170
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that that is related in somehow</v>

1523
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.033
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>

1524
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.430
<v Speaker 3>It's not about regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the absence of I'm fine,</v>

1525
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1526
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am speaking for the absence of</v>

1527
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:44.980
<v Speaker 3>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying we should not regulate that.</v>

1528
00:58:44.981 --> 00:58:49.780
<v Speaker 3>We should allow private companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>private companies to do and have</v>

1529
00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:52.980
<v Speaker 3>whatever influence they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know,</v>

1530
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.610
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the market works in these,</v>

1531
00:58:54.611 --> 00:58:58.300
<v Speaker 3>in these situations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what happens when Isp is try to</v>

1532
00:58:58.301 --> 00:59:01.330
<v Speaker 3>manipulate Netflix traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Customers complain and they have to stop</v>

1533
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:05.170
<v Speaker 3>and they have to put it back again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The market works so well for this,</v>

1534
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:07.330
<v Speaker 3>for Internet stuff because everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>internet so vocal,</v>

1535
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:08.770
<v Speaker 3>they're online already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They complain about it.</v>

1536
00:59:08.771 --> 00:59:10.930
<v Speaker 3>It takes two clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The market works brilliantly for this</v>

1537
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:14.920
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why allow the government to come in and</v>

1538
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 3>dictate to private individuals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>private corporations what their business</v>

1539
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:20.860
<v Speaker 3>relationship should look like and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature of the services that they provide</v>

1540
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>or money they provide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One another</v>

1541
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 1>that's that's profoundly on American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1542
00:59:25.071 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large argument against net neutrality.</v>

1543
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a large argument online that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could spend hours going over the pros</v>

1544
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and cons of each side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think ultimately people have a</v>

1545
00:59:36.801 --> 00:59:41.780
<v Speaker 1>distrust in large corporations and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distrust in the government and either</v>

1546
00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:46.290
<v Speaker 1>one of them having control of what has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been like the one thing that's empowered</v>

1547
00:59:46.291 --> 00:59:51.291
<v Speaker 1>people in this country is the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put out a message and to get</v>

1548
00:59:51.471 --> 00:59:54.560
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you can do it now just</v>

1549
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could just be cause throttled.</v>

1550
00:59:56.721 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be limited.</v>

1551
00:59:58.191 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be blocked.</v>

1552
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>There's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously theory UN thing.</v>

1553
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you been paying attention to you as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went proposal the one who reported</v>

1554
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.620
<v Speaker 1>on at first it tell people then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1555
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:15.420
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UN broadband commission,</v>

1556
01:00:15.421 --> 01:00:17.430
<v Speaker 2>which is not one of the upper echelons</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the UN,</v>

1557
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he were the one who reported on the</v>

1558
01:00:19.321 --> 01:00:20.400
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd you get the information?</v>

1559
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1560
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:23.130
<v Speaker 2>so somebody else brought the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was the one that reports that are</v>

1561
01:00:23.131 --> 01:00:24.390
<v Speaker 2>linked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my story is the one that went around</v>

1562
01:00:24.391 --> 01:00:26.250
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tweet your story.</v>

1563
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1564
01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful neuron.</v>

1565
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1566
01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1567
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:33.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1568
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>explain the ridiculousness to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the UN thinks that they're going</v>

1569
01:00:37.871 --> 01:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1570
01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1571
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.310
<v Speaker 2>this is my argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this is the government getting</v>

1572
01:00:42.311 --> 01:00:46.720
<v Speaker 2>involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your say excited and the government</v>

1573
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:52.810
<v Speaker 2>people don't censoring the UN is saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and this is wacky crazy stuff,</v>

1574
01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:54.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This report from the UN broadband</v>

1575
01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:55.630
<v Speaker 2>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UN broadband commission,</v>

1576
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:57.580
<v Speaker 2>this is what we have in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want you to look from Europe.</v>

1577
01:00:57.581 --> 01:01:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Police have become Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have in in Europe Commission is</v>

1578
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>specifically set up to find ways it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid for by European payers and it's</v>

1579
01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:08.140
<v Speaker 2>purpose is to find ways of regulating</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet.</v>

1580
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what it's for.</v>

1581
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:10.241
<v Speaker 2>It is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1582
01:01:10.241 --> 01:01:12.490
<v Speaker 2>it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a brief to find ways of,</v>

1583
01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.120
<v Speaker 2>of cutting down on Internet freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the ways it's found to do that is</v>

1584
01:01:16.121 --> 01:01:20.290
<v Speaker 2>to get a lot of bat shit crazy feminists</v>
<v Speaker 2>in to say that people who ridicule or</v>

1585
01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:23.200
<v Speaker 2>criticize them on the Internet are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact guilty of harassment and abuse.</v>

1586
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.260
<v Speaker 2>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet services should be almost</v>

1587
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.590
<v Speaker 2>prescreened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1588
01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:30.350
<v Speaker 2>words should almost be prescreened</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the ever appear on the intentions</v>

1589
01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:32.740
<v Speaker 2>is the most crazy bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1590
01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:36.340
<v Speaker 2>only European come up with this and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>report came out and it was full of holes</v>

1591
01:01:36.341 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and we examined it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was with the first report when</v>

1592
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.710
<v Speaker 2>it's detail about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read about it once or twice and um,</v>

1593
01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.330
<v Speaker 2>and then I wrote about it a second time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the headline was,</v>

1594
01:01:43.331 --> 01:01:46.240
<v Speaker 2>am I the only responsible tech</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>

1595
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:48.990
<v Speaker 2>journalists left on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the only perhaps example self</v>

1596
01:01:48.991 --> 01:01:50.800
<v Speaker 2>congratulatory of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1597
01:01:50.801 --> 01:01:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually really modest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually really humble.</v>

1598
01:01:53.171 --> 01:01:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a very humble person naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my sub editors just bully me into</v>

1599
01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:59.290
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You understand how they got to get those</v>

1600
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.080
<v Speaker 2>clicks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this is not me at all.</v>

1601
01:02:02.081 --> 01:02:04.210
<v Speaker 2>If it were up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd just be at home anyway.</v>

1602
01:02:04.211 --> 01:02:06.610
<v Speaker 2>So what they want to do is sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre,</v>

1603
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:09.340
<v Speaker 2>pre brief all of this stuff a pre pre</v>
<v Speaker 2>check it.</v>

1604
01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to clamp down.</v>

1605
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:15.401
<v Speaker 2>And I ask what you're doing right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>your saying it's okay for the government</v>

1606
01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 2>to get involved in this of regulation</v>

1607
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 3>of what s of the private relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>RSPs have with the customers.</v>

1608
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.550
<v Speaker 3>But it's not okay for the government get</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in this kind of regular,</v>

1609
01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:30.551
<v Speaker 3>keep the pipes open decks open to all</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit they want on the Internet.</v>

1610
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.590
<v Speaker 3>No restrictions out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

1611
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.520
<v Speaker 3>nobody's giving you any different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They suggesting that that's not going to</v>

1612
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 3>be hazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you're not until it's already</v>

1613
01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:42.060
<v Speaker 3>in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1614
01:02:42.061 --> 01:02:44.430
<v Speaker 3>the UN thing is essentially a Trojan</v>
<v Speaker 3>horse,</v>

1615
01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:45.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

1616
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what was so disturbing about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the idea that the UN could get in and</v>

1617
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:55.240
<v Speaker 3>get involved and somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 3>punish a social media websites that uh,</v>

1618
01:02:55.241 --> 01:02:58.140
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make them responsible for what the</v>

1619
01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:00.540
<v Speaker 3>users' posts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You post some inflammatory,</v>

<v Speaker 3>typed a bunch of ridiculous shit about</v>

<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to leave a mark.</v>

1631
01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:35.090
<v Speaker 3>You're a Drury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nitpicking like to leave a mark on</v>

<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look this,</v>

1635
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:42.030
<v Speaker 3>there's actually an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion around around this and it's</v>

1636
01:03:42.031 --> 01:03:42.864
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1637
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 3>it's about comment sections and</v>
<v Speaker 3>commenting what people are allowed to</v>

1638
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:46.490
<v Speaker 3>say on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1639
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:50.390
<v Speaker 3>There's this huge trend at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and almost every progressive publication</v>

1640
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.830
<v Speaker 3>as either closed their comments section,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll indicated that they might,</v>

1641
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.300
<v Speaker 3>in the early days of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had these tech savvy progressive's</v>

1642
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:59.580
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately based on coastal</v>
<v Speaker 3>cities,</v>

1643
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.850
<v Speaker 3>coastal cities who said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the only people they knew who</v>

1644
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:05.250
<v Speaker 3>used the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like of them were hipsters and</v>

1645
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.173
<v Speaker 3>coastal types.</v>

1646
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Who said that the Internet was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create this extraordinary,</v>

1647
01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:13.120
<v Speaker 3>an amazing new world where everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>could express their opinions.</v>

1648
01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:15.390
<v Speaker 3>It was going to democratize knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and democratize power.</v>

1649
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the presumption they made was that</v>

1650
01:04:17.581 --> 01:04:18.960
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet was going to be nice.</v>

1651
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people aren't very nice and most</v>

1652
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:25.200
<v Speaker 3>people are particularly aren't nice when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in that as a compliment by the way,</v>

1653
01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:28.290
<v Speaker 3>cause I hate most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people hate nice people.</v>

1654
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.110
<v Speaker 3>It's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I let people who have vicious and bitchy</v>

1655
01:04:31.111 --> 01:04:32.180
<v Speaker 3>and mischievous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1656
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1657
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.610
<v Speaker 3>every time I do a show this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just comes back it Gavin McInnes did</v>

1658
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:41.400
<v Speaker 3>not even wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gavin McInnes did not even wait.</v>

1659
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.350
<v Speaker 3>I was on his show for three minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1660
01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.370
<v Speaker 3>you have any idea how gay you are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's Gavin style.</v>

1661
01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm a kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentler.</v>

1662
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.710
<v Speaker 3>You waited an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour and five minutes.</v>

1663
01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll skip.</v>

1664
01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Guess what you just said was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like people that are fishes and bitchy</v>

1665
01:04:59.541 --> 01:05:02.460
<v Speaker 3>and</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

1666
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Well there's plenty of assholes out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1667
01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.600
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have them sent to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice.</v>

1668
01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:11.260
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sure you get on tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tend to be very tentatively,</v>

1669
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.780
<v Speaker 3>pathologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Helen Dario,</v>

1670
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:15.030
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are a bit more dangerous.</v>

1671
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm always attracted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you like shitty people online.</v>

1672
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.980
<v Speaker 2>See people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people who are more interested.</v>

1673
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I like people to step outside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overton window.</v>

1674
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I like people who pushed the boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people who are dissidents.</v>

1675
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I like people who are disreputable and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mischievous and interesting.</v>

1676
01:05:29.711 --> 01:05:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm attracted to interest in people as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

1677
01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all during it because,</v>

1678
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1679
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I love people like that fascinated me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're the people who pushed</v>

1680
01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.250
<v Speaker 2>society for the people who come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great,</v>

1681
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 2>interesting theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just can't,</v>

1682
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they're just cans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that can be funny too,</v>

1683
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:44.194
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1684
01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1685
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1686
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to add to the sum total of</v>
<v Speaker 2>human knowledge.</v>

1687
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to wind a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>up for 30 years and hopefully something</v>

1688
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>good about yourself short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1689
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 2>and you're making some very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>

1690
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.983
<v Speaker 2>you are humble.</v>

1691
01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:02.170
<v Speaker 2>You make interesting points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to the point please.</v>

1692
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 2>The um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1693
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:05.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comment section stuff right there.</v>

1694
01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.520
<v Speaker 2>This was based on a presumption that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody on the Internet was going to</v>

1695
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:09.690
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1696
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.710
<v Speaker 2>like a Twitter employee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coco blogger.</v>

1697
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they come out of this idea,</v>

1698
01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as great Internet,</v>

1699
01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:15.730
<v Speaker 2>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social is gonna be the new thing.</v>

1700
01:06:15.731 --> 01:06:17.130
<v Speaker 2>We are the guardians going to throw it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to newsrooms,</v>

1701
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.420
<v Speaker 2>open to the public and the assumption</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1702
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1703
01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 2>the Guardian readers and people who live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in north London,</v>

1704
01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:24.460
<v Speaker 2>which is something like Portland or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn,</v>

1705
01:06:24.461 --> 01:06:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn or whatever sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1706
01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:29.160
<v Speaker 2>sort of north of London and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hipster enclave.</v>

1707
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:30.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more actually sort of like posh,</v>

1708
01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 2>rich liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1709
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not directly comparable,</v>

1710
01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:34.220
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1711
01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.053
<v Speaker 2>instead of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1712
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 2>roughly like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1713
01:06:36.461 --> 01:06:38.170
<v Speaker 2>they were going to be homogenous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice,</v>

1714
01:06:38.171 --> 01:06:40.000
<v Speaker 2>polite lefties with the correct opinions</v>
<v Speaker 2>about things.</v>

1715
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Actually what's happened is it took</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>

1716
01:06:42.491 --> 01:06:45.400
<v Speaker 2>It took longer than I anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's happened is that ordinary</v>

1717
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 2>people now can open Twitter accounts too</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not sufficiently technologically</v>

1718
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:51.670
<v Speaker 2>educated to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what all of these progressive media,</v>

1719
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1720
01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:54.980
<v Speaker 2>companies are discovering the Mike's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxes,</v>

1721
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.280
<v Speaker 2>the buzz feeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the caucus of this world are discovering</v>

1722
01:06:57.281 --> 01:06:59.890
<v Speaker 2>that most people don't agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are just,</v>

1723
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.600
<v Speaker 2>they've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's shocking,</v>

1724
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 2>but most people don't believe you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill all men.</v>

1725
01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't believe that white</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>

1726
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people can't be racist.</v>

1727
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't believe in this extra</v>

1728
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:15.070
<v Speaker 2>everything on salon.com nobody believes</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else down.</v>

1729
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't believe what's on salon.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1730
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to believe those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>in good faith because you have to lie to</v>

1731
01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:23.500
<v Speaker 2>make that you have to lie so much to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and to others in order to make</v>

1732
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 2>those arguments that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1733
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 2>it is one long practical joke.</v>

1734
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Speaker 2>That site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is just a gigantic,</v>

1735
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:31.750
<v Speaker 2>it's the Santa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced it's funded by the Koch</v>

1736
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:34.360
<v Speaker 2>brothers to discredit a liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced,</v>

1737
01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:36.490
<v Speaker 2>absolutely convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you trace,</v>

1738
01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.290
<v Speaker 2>if you trace the sell on money back far</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

1739
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you will discover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will discover the surname coke</v>

1740
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:46.060
<v Speaker 2>because it is the only explanation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>how badly sal on discredits</v>

1741
01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:49.840
<v Speaker 2>progressivism is the only exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just today they published another</v>

1742
01:07:49.841 --> 01:07:52.420
<v Speaker 2>editorial from this fucking pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1743
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>you know who I wrote about and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even dare bring my name up</v>

1744
01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:57.250
<v Speaker 2>because he's too scared to get into it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me cause he knows he will lose.</v>

1745
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1746
01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 2>he published this thing about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1747
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pdf farb I don't act on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1748
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.870
<v Speaker 2>right after I had exposed a pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Nyberg in Gamer Gate,</v>

1749
01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:06.280
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it went all over the world.</v>

1750
01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:07.670
<v Speaker 2>And it was this huge story that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought the,</v>

1751
01:08:07.671 --> 01:08:10.000
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop [inaudible].</v>

1752
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I exposed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a brand on file.</v>

1753
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I exposed this pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1754
01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:17.180
<v Speaker 2>she was backed up and they doubled all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social justice warriors.</v>

1755
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Doubledown protected her because she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1756
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on message.</v>

1757
01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had the right politics.</v>

1758
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>So they stuck around a kiddy fiddler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the state of the modern left,</v>

1759
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:26.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly after that with a coincidental</v>

1760
01:08:26.151 --> 01:08:28.070
<v Speaker 2>timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sal on publishes this thing by a</v>

1761
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.100
<v Speaker 2>pedophile saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1762
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit of hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't act on it.</v>

1763
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Which is precisely the defense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this person who used.</v>

1764
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I respond and I,</v>

1765
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1766
01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:37.580
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>

1767
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I did a very good piece of knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I urge all of your listeners to seek it</v>

1768
01:08:40.731 --> 01:08:42.290
<v Speaker 2>out because it really is excellent</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism.</v>

1769
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called something like,</v>

1770
01:08:44.991 --> 01:08:46.830
<v Speaker 2>this is why the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is why liberals,</v>

1771
01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.840
<v Speaker 2>this is why progressive's stick up for</v>
<v Speaker 2>pdf files explains why,</v>

1772
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pdf files can get away with this stuff.</v>

1773
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:56.630
<v Speaker 2>And why white progressives and liberals</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>

1774
01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think people back pedophiles or they</v>

1775
01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 2>make excuses for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make excuses for them as just</v>

1776
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:06.590
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today they gave us space to this guy who</v>

1777
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:09.470
<v Speaker 2>was a pedophile about whom there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific stuff online which hasn't come</v>

1778

<v Speaker 2>out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

1779
01:09:10.221 --> 01:09:12.170

01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:13.630
<v Speaker 2>some of it and sort of why,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1785
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.060

<v Speaker 2>This is how brazen they'll row a second</v>

1786
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:27.200
<v Speaker 2>piece for salon today playing the victim</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that he came out as a pdf file</v>

1787
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:31.390
<v Speaker 2>and he's been subjected to right wing</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate so that he says this is the right</v>

1788
01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On one hand I'm the creative file and I</v>

1789

<v Speaker 2>like came out and said that it was</v>

1791
01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 2>really supportive and it was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>great and that they help people to get</v>

1792
01:09:45.711 --> 01:09:48.140
<v Speaker 2>through their own experiences and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's really sympathetic except the</v>

1793
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:51.500
<v Speaker 2>right wing hate machine meaning me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they didn't dare mention me by</v>

1794

<v Speaker 2>name.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.440

<v Speaker 2>temerity to say we think pedophilia is</v>

1799
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.660
<v Speaker 2>role and why is that on giving a</v>
<v Speaker 2>platform for it to this guy when there's</v>

1800
01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:08.330
<v Speaker 2>so much dirt on the Internet suggesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he is physically touched young</v>

1801
01:10:08.331 --> 01:10:10.080
<v Speaker 2>girls for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the thing that you sell on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gave a platform to this guy in San Juan</v>

1805
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:19.010
<v Speaker 2>ought to have known about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegation.</v>

1806
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to make space on your</v>

1807
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:24.440
<v Speaker 2>platform for a self confessed pedophile</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will,</v>

1808
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.620
<v Speaker 2>you will only find this on the left is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I mean by the left.</v>

1809
01:10:26.621 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Sticking a couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make excuses when they try to</v>

1810
01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 2>legitimize them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to give it,</v>

1811
01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:34.480
<v Speaker 2>they tried to habilitate this as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an unfortunate sexual orientation</v>

1812
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:35.840
<v Speaker 2>rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1813
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.480
<v Speaker 2>these people being dangerous predators</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need to be protected from</v>

1814
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.450
<v Speaker 2>sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're saying all I've seen is</v>

1815
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.110
<v Speaker 2>discussing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1816
01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.700
<v Speaker 2>honestly all bullshit aside like</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists and sociologists and</v>

1817
01:10:49.701 --> 01:10:53.900
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists or tried to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is that causes someone to have</v>

1818
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:55.670
<v Speaker 2>these desires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we know from the transgender debate,</v>

1819
01:10:55.671 --> 01:10:57.830
<v Speaker 2>the left doesn't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it cares about is who it can,</v>

1820
01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:58.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1821
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.980
<v Speaker 2>where it can place people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression Olympics and the victim</v>

1822
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:03.160
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy and pet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm telling you I'm warning you now</v>

1823
01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:06.440
<v Speaker 2>is the worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm warning you now is that as the</v>

1824
01:11:06.441 --> 01:11:08.810
<v Speaker 2>native files,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pedophiles are going to be the next,</v>

1825
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.250
<v Speaker 2>transgender has been one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they've won,</v>

1826
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.360
<v Speaker 2>they've won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That battle is over.</v>

1827
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think so?</v>

1828
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1829
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 2>absolutely stay.</v>

1830
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.250
<v Speaker 3>It's done and dusted</v>
<v Speaker 3>by we,</v>

1831
01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean people who actually wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out what the science said to</v>

1832
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:23.540
<v Speaker 3>continue to invest in things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>now unfundable um,</v>

1833
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain bits of research that don't</v>

1834
01:11:24.961 --> 01:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>agree with a progressive consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which now can't get funding for that</v>

1835
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 3>consensus is what kind of research?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1836
01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:33.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so transgender,</v>

1837
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 3>the transgender question is complex and</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult and for example,</v>

1838
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Johns Hopkins doesn't do the surgeries</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1839
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.460
<v Speaker 3>The guy who used to run it there is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very outspoken critic of transition</v>

1840
01:11:41.461 --> 01:11:43.080
<v Speaker 3>surgeries is not the best treatment</v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway.</v>

1841
01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all end up killing themselves</v>

1842
01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:47.640
<v Speaker 3>anyway by most most metrics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no improvement in suicide rates.</v>

1843
01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my view on this is,</v>

1844
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:50.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're probably going to look back in 30</v>

1845
01:11:50.461 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 3>years and wonder how we could ever have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been so cruel as to allow somebody with</v>

1846
01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 3>a psychiatric delusion to start hacking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at themselves to make reality conform to</v>

1847
01:11:57.211 --> 01:11:58.044
<v Speaker 3>their own delusions.</v>

1848
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:00.360
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not but by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by we earlier,</v>

1849
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:02.940
<v Speaker 3>what I meant was people who want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>science lead on this and instead what</v>

1850
01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:04.170
<v Speaker 3>the left very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very,</v>

1851
01:12:04.171 --> 01:12:05.670
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were on the cover of Time magazine</v>

1852
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Trans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the,</v>

1853
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 3>the Trans thing is the next civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>frontier.</v>

1854
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.150
<v Speaker 3>They very clearly articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave us all the clues we needed to</v>

1855
01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:13.350
<v Speaker 3>work out how they were going to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one.</v>

1856
01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just didn't pay any attention at</v>

1857
01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:16.110
<v Speaker 3>the time or some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people didn't.</v>

1858
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they set it up as the next gay or the</v>

1859
01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 3>next bisexual or the next lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the next frontier in the civil</v>

1860
01:12:23.581 --> 01:12:25.050
<v Speaker 3>rights struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

1861
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the one after that.</v>

1862
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:32.030
<v Speaker 3>But don't you think that if you are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person and you are of sound mind and</v>

1863
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:37.200
<v Speaker 3>body and you have a desire to be a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've had this desire your whole</v>

1864
01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:38.760
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you were born a man,</v>

1865
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't you be able to do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck do you want to do other people?</v>

1866
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that really what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who wake up one day and</v>

1867
01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.430
<v Speaker 3>think their arm doesn't belong to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't cut their arm off because they</v>

1868
01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:50.560
<v Speaker 3>think it doesn't belong to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who believe that they</v>

1869
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:53.400
<v Speaker 3>have someone draw on you permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it looks hot.</v>

1870
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it too.</v>

1871
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:59.360
<v Speaker 3>How far?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far?</v>

1872
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.120
<v Speaker 3>The sleeves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sleeves.</v>

1873
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.540
<v Speaker 3>But you see my point like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1874
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why brain tattoo tattoos with being born</v>

1875
01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:08.990
<v Speaker 3>as long gender choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of personal permanent.</v>

1876
01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.910
<v Speaker 3>There is a view that you should be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do whatever you want to your body.</v>

1877
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.930
<v Speaker 3>My argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1878
01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.441
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

1879
01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:16.950
<v Speaker 3>but don't make the state pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to pay for your cock off</v>

1880
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.110
<v Speaker 3>because you're mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1881
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I will try to dissuade you from doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1882
01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.820
<v Speaker 3>I should have a right to say in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>national newspaper,</v>

1883
01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:26.310
<v Speaker 3>which now you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please don't do this.</v>

1884
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the argument,</v>

1885
01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 3>you can't get published in national</v>
<v Speaker 3>newspaper,</v>

1886
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:30.570
<v Speaker 3>this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot get published by saying,</v>

1887
01:13:30.571 --> 01:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>please don't do pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have transitioned surgery.</v>

1888
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.920
<v Speaker 3>It's the wrong treatment pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot get published because of</v>

1889
01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 3>public opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people were worried about the</v>

1890
01:13:36.961 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 3>blow back from the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1891
01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 3>And these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just dream left.</v>

1892
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I see,</v>

1893
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.020
<v Speaker 3>if ever you needed evidence that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trainees are mentally ill,</v>

1894
01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:44.490
<v Speaker 3>it's tranny campaigners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1895
01:13:44.491 --> 01:13:47.580
<v Speaker 3>the transgender lobby are nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason journalists don't want to</v>

1896
01:13:47.581 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 3>write about this stuff or don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>enter the dangerous territory,</v>

1897
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:52.830
<v Speaker 3>is that what they are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the receiving end of afterwards is</v>

1898
01:13:52.831 --> 01:13:53.551
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1899
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:54.384
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had it,</v>

1900
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had it to my,</v>

1901
01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:59.130
<v Speaker 3>my confrontation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1902
01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:00.183
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1903
01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1904
01:14:01.591 --> 01:14:02.311
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1905
01:14:02.311 --> 01:14:04.020
<v Speaker 3>you're right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so unfair.</v>

1906
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these women who are getting the crappy</v>

1907
01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:11.001
<v Speaker 3>now of them by somebody who's not only</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfair if you don't say that you used to</v>

1908
01:14:11.171 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 3>be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should have the ability to say</v>

1909
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:16.810
<v Speaker 3>yes for new option to opt out and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't.</v>

1910
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do?</v>

1911
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:21.490
<v Speaker 3>So any man who wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any man who wants to be a women's MMA</v>

1912
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:23.670
<v Speaker 3>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to basically give him a</v>

1913
01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.710
<v Speaker 3>gold line pathway to the championship</v>
<v Speaker 3>because nobody's going to a woman's</v>

1914
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:28.480
<v Speaker 3>gonna wanna get in a ring with him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>have her jaw broken.</v>

1915
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 3>That's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1916
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:31.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly reasonable to say if you</v>

1917
01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>weren't born a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to fight in a women's</v>

1918
01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:36.850
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's perfectly reasonable,</v>

1919
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.370
<v Speaker 3>perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1920
01:14:39.371 --> 01:14:42.830
<v Speaker 3>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the in scientifically valid too,</v>

1921
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.760
<v Speaker 3>but there's a science behind you and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>both on the wrong side of,</v>

1922
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 3>of popular opinion on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not,</v>

1923
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we often,</v>

1924
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not what ordinary people think,</v>

1925
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.850
<v Speaker 3>but the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media and political establishment of</v>

1926
01:14:54.851 --> 01:14:56.830
<v Speaker 3>made up their minds on this and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gone.</v>

1927
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did the writing this real</v>

1928
01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.340
<v Speaker 3>interesting that right gets this wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it gets this wrong everyday.</v>

1929
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.480
<v Speaker 3>The reason I win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's no repercussions in</v>

1930
01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:07.300
<v Speaker 3>supporting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why there's no repercussions in</v>

1931
01:15:07.301 --> 01:15:08.021
<v Speaker 3>supporting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1932
01:15:08.021 --> 01:15:10.660
<v Speaker 3>they're all trans gender to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ought to,</v>

1933
01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:11.494
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1934
01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.313
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying to me,</v>

1935
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:14.980
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a woman.</v>

1936
01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She should be able to fight men.</v>

1937
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 3>There's no repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you say you're out of your</v>

1938
01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:24.130
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind and because you're always</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to self determination and all the</v>

1939
01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:24.964
<v Speaker 3>rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1940
01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.600
<v Speaker 3>no that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that is entirely a construction of</v>

1941
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:31.450
<v Speaker 3>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely construction to the left,</v>

1942
01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.770
<v Speaker 3>the aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive,</v>

1943
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:34.060
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive and you know,</v>

1944
01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 3>and these people who you just missed</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier is fringe nutcases.</v>

1945
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:39.670
<v Speaker 3>They have entirely dictated what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were allowed to say on that subject.</v>

1946
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.500
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't say the right thing for</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1947
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.730
<v Speaker 3>what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes like this and then it</v>

1948
01:15:45.731 --> 01:15:46.440
<v Speaker 3>comes back.</v>

1949
01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now it's come and give me an</v>

1950
01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 3>example of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give an example of what's come back back</v>

1951
01:15:51.671 --> 01:15:55.090
<v Speaker 3>right now to progressive fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Progressive's have one,</v>

1952
01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:59.870
<v Speaker 3>a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a society aren't women shit often</v>

1953
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.060
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does progressives,</v>

1954
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.430
<v Speaker 3>they won gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will.</v>

1955
01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.780
<v Speaker 3>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely do you don't,</v>

1956
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:12.490
<v Speaker 3>you don't think,</v>

2100
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:22.261
<v Speaker 3>sure it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2101
01:22:22.261 --> 01:22:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a race thing or you were even</v>

<v Speaker 3>allowed to say that he liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2103
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:28.830
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to be really on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying men are different from</v>

2104
01:22:28.831 --> 01:22:29.820
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not really supposed to say any</v>

01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:30.151
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a certain,</v>

2107
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean I quite like it and I like those</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2108
01:22:33.691 --> 01:22:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm always asking if she's got hot suns</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she would never tell me.</v>

2109
01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering why I quite like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the area.</v>

2110
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:40.410
<v Speaker 3>But there is definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like if she's,</v>

2111
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:43.020
<v Speaker 3>if she's been in and she's been mopping</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever,</v>

2112
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:45.720
<v Speaker 3>you can smile and like two hours later</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I come home,</v>

2113
01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I know she's been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2114
01:22:47.071 --> 01:22:48.420
<v Speaker 3>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like a wolf.</v>

2115
01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Did you have really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have a really good sense of smell</v>

2116
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:52.740
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird for a gay guy.</v>

2117
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I would think dude smell like</v>

2118

<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No like stinky.</v>

2119
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I would think that would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they put flowers,</v>

2120
01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:02.880
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfume and women quite like how men</v>

2121
01:23:02.881 --> 01:23:03.960
<v Speaker 3>smells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He imagined men into men.</v>

2122
01:23:03.961 --> 01:23:05.290
<v Speaker 3>They quite like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh okay.</v>

2123
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 3>That does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.060
<v Speaker 3>So some guys like be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2125
01:23:09.061 --> 01:23:11.170
<v Speaker 3>some guys smell bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I perspire quite a lot,</v>

2126
01:23:11.171 --> 01:23:13.140
<v Speaker 3>but I don't smell like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I if,</v>

2127
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:15.760
<v Speaker 3>if I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get sort of grotesque,</v>

2128
01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:17.950
<v Speaker 3>but let's change the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2129
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I know women that like the way dude</v>
<v Speaker 3>stink when they get back from the gym.</v>

2130
01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:23.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quite like fucking stay quite like</v>

2131
01:23:23.681 --> 01:23:28.681
<v Speaker 3>they like it dirty bitches dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be such a such a whore.</v>

2132
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2133
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:30.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a bus,</v>

2134
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:33.190
<v Speaker 3>there was a study such a slot.</v>

2135
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I'd be pregnant at 12 I would have had</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many abortions by now.</v>

2136
01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a university of Rome,</v>

2137
01:23:39.311 --> 01:23:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a study on homosexuality and they</v>

2138
01:23:41.981 --> 01:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>had a theory that the reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2139
01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.750
<v Speaker 3>people became gay was a variation on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>x chromosome.</v>

2140
01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 3>And so because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate amount of homosexual</v>

2141
01:23:52.781 --> 01:23:56.530
<v Speaker 3>men that were birthed from women that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were promiscuous,</v>

2142
01:23:56.790 --> 01:24:00.490
<v Speaker 3>so just exceeding how terrible women</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2143
01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I think some men just see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see it really early and think that is so</v>

2144
01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:06.160
<v Speaker 3>much crazy just to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to come in something.</v>

2145
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:07.140
<v Speaker 3>I have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2146
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:08.170
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna go with boys.</v>

2147
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:11.440
<v Speaker 3>That's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming to you as a straight man and</v>

2148
01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:13.350
<v Speaker 3>you're talking nonsense for the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

2149
01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went gay to get it.</v>

2150
01:24:15.161 --> 01:24:17.200
<v Speaker 3>My mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it's revenge.</v>

2151
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of a revenge homosexual.</v>

2152
01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Like a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a werewolf.</v>

2153
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:22.400

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2154
01:24:22.401 --> 01:24:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like the full moon.</v>

2155
01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Your mother turned you right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2156
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tired.</v>

2157
01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2158
01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:31.870
<v Speaker 3>So I went and because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently scandalous that I lost my</v>

2159
01:24:31.871 --> 01:24:33.850
<v Speaker 3>virginity in a interracial five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the drag Queen,</v>

2161
01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.890
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started probably,</v>

2162
01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I started bringing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like 13,</v>

2163
01:24:38.441 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 3>maybe 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drag queens,</v>

2164
01:24:40.841 --> 01:24:42.320
<v Speaker 3>interracial drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some five.</v>

2165
01:24:42.321 --> 01:24:42.941
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was grass.</v>

2166
01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:44.380
<v Speaker 3>The first one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Well I was just fucked for life until</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get gone.</v>

2168

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2169
01:24:48.941 --> 01:24:51.160
<v Speaker 3>So I switched my home black boys</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead.</v>

2170
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.620
<v Speaker 3>And that she was upset about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2171
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.490
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it a racial thing that she was just</v>

2172
01:24:57.491 --> 01:24:59.470
<v Speaker 3>coming down and they was just these</v>
<v Speaker 3>black guys with like,</v>

2175
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:06.970

01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:09.760
<v Speaker 3>that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black guys a couple of years older,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And they went to,</v>

2178
01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:12.550
<v Speaker 3>they went to the bad schools.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what's the go down cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baddies can,</v>

2180

<v Speaker 3>blow and fucking their son.</v>

2181

2183
01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 3>and then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it just sort of,</v>

2184
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:25.180
<v Speaker 3>I just got stuck in a row and now it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a bad habit.</v>

2185
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:27.400
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a column about this like I'm so</v>

2186
01:25:27.401 --> 01:25:29.650
<v Speaker 3>bored of being gay and everybody took it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a joke.</v>

2187
01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:30.880
<v Speaker 3>It's actually one of my serious things</v>
<v Speaker 3>will ever,</v>

2188
01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:31.930
<v Speaker 3>ever written.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2189
01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm only really attracted to things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are transgressive that are naughty.</v>

2190
01:25:35.021 --> 01:25:35.970
<v Speaker 3>And I talked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you spoke about this earlier,</v>

2191
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.720
<v Speaker 3>like I like dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult people.</v>

2192
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I only really sexually excited by things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are forbidden and now gay people</v>

2193
01:25:42.491 --> 01:25:46.810
<v Speaker 3>are endlessly Molly cuddles and</v>
<v Speaker 3>flattered and sucked up to in society is</v>

2194
01:25:46.811 --> 01:25:49.000
<v Speaker 3>kind of the sexist lost its luster for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2195
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I thinking that I might go</v>

2196
01:25:53.951 --> 01:25:55.860
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>

2197
01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I might do something that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take you think I might do some things.</v>

2198
01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:03.220
<v Speaker 3>I might do something that you know is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to invite ridicule and criticism</v>

2199
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to make given me a more</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult life.</v>

2200
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 3>I might become a straight white male</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all due respect.</v>

2201
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll find it very difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find suitors that are worthy of your</v>

2202
01:26:12.111 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 3>appearance with us.</v>

<v Speaker 3>those worlds with little to no worries.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Now this,</v>

2262
01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:38.480
<v Speaker 3>is that what they're saying now when she</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted the correct way to describe,</v>

<v Speaker 3>athlete,</v>

2265
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:46.400
<v Speaker 3>the technically correct way to do it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use the new name and the past</v>

2266
01:28:46.401 --> 01:28:49.130
<v Speaker 3>accomplishments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She won the men's whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>supposed to be one of the guys he</v>

2268
01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:57.380
<v Speaker 3>competed in the Olympics with believes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this whole transition to him</v>

2269
01:28:57.381 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 3>becoming a woman had to do with taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids for the Olympics after he got</v>

2270
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 3>off the steroids.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>If you live in that family,</v>

2273
01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:07.810
<v Speaker 3>if you live in the Kardashian family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2274
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:11.160
<v Speaker 3>it is a war of attention seeking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is attention seeking something.</v>

2275
01:29:11.161 --> 01:29:12.650
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2276
01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:16.230
<v Speaker 3>and they're constantly trying to one up</v>
<v Speaker 3>one up each other and everyone thinks</v>

2277
01:29:16.231 --> 01:29:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Kim's got the lead and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.860

<v Speaker 3>I'll go Kim.</v>

2279
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.750
<v Speaker 3>And then Bruce comes out and says,</v>

2283
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.180
<v Speaker 3>analogy of choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2284
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>drops this bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2285
01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:34.043
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

<v Speaker 3>as a slot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chloe's fat.</v>

2299
01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:04.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim's a slot,</v>

2300
01:30:04.291 --> 01:30:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Chloe's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2301
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Calories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

2302
01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.890
<v Speaker 3>And Bruce is a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2303
01:30:07.891 --> 01:30:10.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like they all have something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2304
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he certainly does now.</v>

2305
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he may not have it anymore when with his</v>

2306
01:30:14.971 --> 01:30:18.300
<v Speaker 3>face at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he turns his face into a woman's face.</v>

2307
01:30:18.301 --> 01:30:18.901
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2308
01:30:18.901 --> 01:30:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to send it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make a serious point about</v>

2309
01:30:21.271 --> 01:30:22.920
<v Speaker 3>this section.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I love about the transgender debate</v>

2310
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 3>is how damaging it is to feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2311
01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:25.610
<v Speaker 3>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

2312
01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:26.351
<v Speaker 3>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

2313
01:30:26.351 --> 01:30:27.600
<v Speaker 3>it was my original point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2314
01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:28.500
<v Speaker 3>This is where you were going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2315
01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:30.573
<v Speaker 3>There's something that feminine,</v>

2316
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:33.990
<v Speaker 2>we say about transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly the male to female</v>

2317
01:30:33.991 --> 01:30:37.080
<v Speaker 2>transgender is why do they always choose</v>
<v Speaker 2>such classically feminine</v>

2318
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:39.180
<v Speaker 3>looks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they become what we want,</v>

2319
01:30:39.181 --> 01:30:43.920
<v Speaker 3>which is a sort of genderless fat blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>head on pip hell brigade.</v>

2320
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're going to go trends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they want is for you to cut,</v>

2321
01:30:46.891 --> 01:30:48.870
<v Speaker 3>become kinda queer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want you to become,</v>

2322
01:30:48.871 --> 01:30:50.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue allergic,</v>

2323
01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Chris asexual disaster of a human being</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather toenail high heels,</v>

2324
01:30:56.461 --> 01:30:59.340
<v Speaker 3>people who've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men who become women become women like</v>

2325
01:30:59.341 --> 01:31:02.430
<v Speaker 3>very stereotypically women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is interesting because this is</v>

2326
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:05.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a sort of physical manifestation</v>

2327
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.450
<v Speaker 3>of a psychological</v>

2328
01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:07.940
<v Speaker 2>cool problem for feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is this,</v>

2329
01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:12.290
<v Speaker 2>if you accept that people can be born</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the wrong brain,</v>

2330
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.110
<v Speaker 2>that a man can be born with a woman's</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain or a woman can be worn with a</v>

2331
01:31:15.111 --> 01:31:18.650
<v Speaker 2>man's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes a long way to destroying 40</v>

2332
01:31:18.651 --> 01:31:20.690
<v Speaker 2>years of gender politics and gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

2333
01:31:20.691 --> 01:31:23.810
<v Speaker 2>which says that all sexuality and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender is socially constructed.</v>

2334
01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Then that's why men behave like men do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And women behave like women do.</v>

2335
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:32.210
<v Speaker 2>If you accept and you put on the cover</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Time magazine in or Vanity Fair,</v>

2336
01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:37.550
<v Speaker 2>a person who has had the wrong brain in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong body and when they transition</v>

2337
01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:40.100
<v Speaker 2>they take on new characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new forms of behavior on all the rest of</v>

2338
01:31:40.101 --> 01:31:42.380
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are admitting that some of these</v>

2339
01:31:42.381 --> 01:31:45.620
<v Speaker 2>qualities are innate or biological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is such a thing as a male</v>

2340
01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:47.240
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a female brain.</v>

2341
01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:50.150
<v Speaker 2>This is something that feminists have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been denying for decades,</v>

2342
01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.840
<v Speaker 2>and it is incredibly damaging to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the feminist project,</v>

2343
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:56.870
<v Speaker 2>to the idea that everything is cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I want to break down the</v>

2344
01:31:56.871 --> 01:31:59.110
<v Speaker 2>gaps between men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to make girls play with</v>

2345
01:31:59.111 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man and boys or just boys up as</v>

2346
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:04.330
<v Speaker 2>princesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're suggesting is the all</v>

2347
01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:07.450
<v Speaker 2>gender is taught that it's a social</v>
<v Speaker 2>construct that we teach boys how to be</v>

2348
01:32:07.451 --> 01:32:09.190
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should teach boys to,</v>

2349
01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be nice instead of violent.</v>

2350
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is toxic masculinity thing.</v>

2351
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what transgenderism demonstrates quite</v>

2352
01:32:15.671 --> 01:32:18.940
<v Speaker 2>clearly if we accept it as face value as</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive's us too,</v>

2353
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:21.100
<v Speaker 2>is that there is indeed such a thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a male brain.</v>

2354
01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.750
<v Speaker 2>And there is indeed such a thing as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>female brain,</v>

2355
01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that being the case,</v>

2356
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.360
<v Speaker 2>ordinary people have them too.</v>

2357
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that explains why,</v>

2358
01:32:26.861 --> 01:32:28.510
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't as many women in stem</v>

2359
01:32:28.511 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 2>subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It explains why men have certain</v>

2360
01:32:30.191 --> 01:32:31.420
<v Speaker 2>behavioral characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2361
01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.270
<v Speaker 2>and all of this stuff that feminists</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been telling us is just society and</v>

2362
01:32:34.271 --> 01:32:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy and conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2363
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Hang on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't hold these two beliefs</v>

2364
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.260
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot believe both of these things</v>

2365
01:32:41.261 --> 01:32:42.670
<v Speaker 2>in tandem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to pick one.</v>

2366
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.661
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2367
01:32:43.661 --> 01:32:47.110
<v Speaker 2>the reason that some people on the quiet</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquaintances Yaz to get a on the</v>

2368
01:32:47.111 --> 01:32:50.200
<v Speaker 2>political right and quite enthusiastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the transgender thing is they know</v>

2369
01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:55.260
<v Speaker 2>it unravels the feminist project and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>unravels two generations of crazy</v>

2370
01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:58.810
<v Speaker 2>progressive feminism in one fell swoop</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it demonstrates,</v>

2371
01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by their own admission what total</v>

2372
01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.090
<v Speaker 2>bollocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of constructed gender as well.</v>

2373
01:33:04.091 --> 01:33:07.690
<v Speaker 2>It certainly is fascinating when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch people being celebrated for</v>

2374
01:33:07.691 --> 01:33:09.760
<v Speaker 2>traditional feminine appearances.</v>

2375
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely traditional accepted feminine</v>
<v Speaker 2>appearances dresses,</v>

2376
01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.490
<v Speaker 2>but they would kill to be fat blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

2377
01:33:15.491 --> 01:33:16.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're showing me.</v>

2378
01:33:16.541 --> 01:33:19.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the most durable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't have to be ugly like they are</v>

2379
01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Trans America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cover,</v>

2380
01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:23.640
<v Speaker 2>the vanity fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it Vanity Fair or New Yorker?</v>

2381
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Whichever one they want her to be ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they are ugly and they are ugly,</v>

2382
01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:31.540
<v Speaker 2>which is why they became feminist in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

2383
01:33:31.541 --> 01:33:32.820
<v Speaker 2>There are gauges why they're left wing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2384
01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:35.830
<v Speaker 2>My favorite feminist are the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>will never accept transcend</v>

2385
01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:36.780
<v Speaker 2>transgenders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2386
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 2>the tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2387
01:33:37.961 --> 01:33:40.210
<v Speaker 2>I love them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough,</v>

2388
01:33:40.890 --> 01:33:41.950
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman I told you about,</v>

2389
01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:43.720
<v Speaker 2>the concentration camp woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a tough,</v>

2390
01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I think all she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's accused of being a tough,</v>

2391
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.520
<v Speaker 2>these people who say that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender women or not women,</v>

2392
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:50.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they haven't had a woman's lived</v>

2393
01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:51.350
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2394
01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 2>all they're doing is acquiring the</v>
<v Speaker 2>victim hood mantle by which they sort of</v>

2395
01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:56.260
<v Speaker 2>admit the whole Jake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2396
01:33:56.261 --> 01:33:58.020
<v Speaker 2>in the courts of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to be a turf,</v>

2397
01:33:58.030 --> 01:34:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you have to sort of admit that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>such thing as a female privilege and</v>

2398
01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:03.070
<v Speaker 2>what they're basically saying it as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender person,</v>

2399
01:34:03.071 --> 01:34:05.560
<v Speaker 2>you can never acquire the full degree of</v>
<v Speaker 2>female privilege.</v>

2400
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't claim your oppressed</v>

2401
01:34:07.721 --> 01:34:10.810
<v Speaker 2>victimhood status and get special</v>
<v Speaker 2>dispensation or you can't do any of</v>

2402
01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:11.970
<v Speaker 2>those things because you're not a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

2403
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:13.780
<v Speaker 2>You never had a woman's experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want you,</v>

2404
01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:16.000
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love them because they're just the</v>

2405
01:34:16.001 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 2>most brilliant example of let's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional,</v>

2406
01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:19.810
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left on left violence.</v>

2407
01:34:19.811 --> 01:34:22.270
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or this sort of house of cards of</v>

2408
01:34:22.271 --> 01:34:24.650
<v Speaker 2>ludicrous theory that's totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>internally inconsistent.</v>

2409
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.680
<v Speaker 2>This is one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one of those times in which it just</v>

2410
01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:29.860
<v Speaker 2>implodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff's accelerated and they're</v>

2411
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:32.590
<v Speaker 2>eating themselves at a staggering rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I wrote about this,</v>

2412
01:34:32.591 --> 01:34:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about this in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in another great piece that you're,</v>

2413
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:36.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>

2414
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.490
<v Speaker 2>It's called minority wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my point in this was that,</v>

2415
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:40.301
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last,</v>

2416
01:34:40.301 --> 01:34:42.940
<v Speaker 2>if the last 10 years have been bit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>setting men against women and find,</v>

2417
01:34:42.941 --> 01:34:45.850
<v Speaker 2>you think men are just man the fuck up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know you're entitled to that view.</v>

2418
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:46.601
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2419
01:34:46.601 --> 01:34:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I taken a slightly more compassionate</v>
<v Speaker 2>view of this stuff.</v>

2420
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2421
01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:53.230
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people do the progressive</v>

2422
01:34:53.231 --> 01:34:55.150
<v Speaker 2>project has been sister set women</v>
<v Speaker 2>against men.</v>

2423
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.040
<v Speaker 2>The next 10 years is going to be even</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

2424
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 2>The next 10 years is going to set</v>

2425
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.870
<v Speaker 3>sexuality against sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race against race,</v>

2426
01:34:59.871 --> 01:35:01.120
<v Speaker 3>gender against gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2427
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 3>so you're gonna get Hispanics versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>blacks in America is Hispanic.</v>

2428
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Hispanics for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2429
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting because Hispanics</v>

2430
01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:09.920
<v Speaker 3>don't have the guilt about slavery that</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people do.</v>

2431
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 3>So when Hispanics or running cities like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore,</v>

2432
01:35:12.531 --> 01:35:14.970
<v Speaker 3>the policing is going to be brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is getting,</v>

2433
01:35:14.971 --> 01:35:16.430
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will never see.</v>

2434
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.040
<v Speaker 3>You will never have seen anything like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2435
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:19.911
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2436
01:35:19.911 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 3>what Hispanics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hispanics are going to be the going to</v>

2437
01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:24.920
<v Speaker 3>be the demographic majority in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

2438
01:35:25.150 --> 01:35:27.660
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2439
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.440
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the same guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the white guilt that</v>

2440
01:35:30.441 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 3>allows black lives matter to flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2441
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:34.820
<v Speaker 3>They only reason black lives matter is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is because of white guilt.</v>

2442
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:38.450
<v Speaker 3>You really think that you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of black people are getting</v>

2443
01:35:38.451 --> 01:35:40.520
<v Speaker 3>fed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they see people getting shot for no</v>

2444
01:35:40.521 --> 01:35:41.000
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

2445
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.140
<v Speaker 3>They see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely a pleasing,</v>

2446
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:44.840
<v Speaker 3>definitely placing form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can swap being teasers on their</v>

2447
01:35:44.841 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can in the black people as indeed I</v>

2448
01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:49.530
<v Speaker 3>do with my body and in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2449
01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:52.160
<v Speaker 3>and nonetheless not think the black</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives matter is the best thing for black</v>

2450
01:35:52.161 --> 01:35:56.030
<v Speaker 3>people with black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perpetuates a culture of victim hood,</v>

2451
01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:57.350
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do this.</v>

2452
01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:59.120

01:36:51.591 --> 01:36:54.960
<v Speaker 3>him as if he was black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it possible DNA.</v>

2482
01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:55.720
<v Speaker 3>Social.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2483
01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.770

<v Speaker 3>he didn't like,</v>

2484
01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.350
<v Speaker 3>didn't acknowledge it was a black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a black political,</v>

2485
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:01.490
<v Speaker 3>well this is what I was thinking.</v>

2486
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I was like kissing someone and get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cup.</v>

2487
01:37:03.861 --> 01:37:05.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they do in the movies where you</v>

2488
01:37:05.290 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 3>should put him on 23 and me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was a black political action</v>

2489
01:37:09.381 --> 01:37:11.060
<v Speaker 3>committee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said they'd give $25,000 a black</v>

2490
01:37:11.061 --> 01:37:12.650
<v Speaker 3>lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he submits to do a DNA test,</v>

2491
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:17.120
<v Speaker 3>did he wouldn't do it at black political</v>
<v Speaker 3>action committee said put this to rest.</v>

2492
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:19.430
<v Speaker 3>We'll give $25,000 a black lives matter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wouldn't do it.</v>

2493
01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.670
<v Speaker 3>So we're in the situation now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know these things.</v>

2494
01:37:22.671 --> 01:37:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Tell me all I need to know now we're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a situation with Shaun King has</v>

2495
01:37:25.971 --> 01:37:27.860
<v Speaker 3>pronounced Shaun King innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to ask any more</v>

2496
01:37:27.861 --> 01:37:29.300
<v Speaker 3>questions and you just got to take his</v>
<v Speaker 3>word for it.</v>

2497
01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:29.841
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's still going.</v>

2499
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:34.250
<v Speaker 3>The guy's white is still a big part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter.</v>

2500
01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.173
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the figureheads.</v>

2501
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:37.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think he's a thing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't you be white?</v>

2502
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:40.700
<v Speaker 3>And also think that black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the end</v>

2503
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:44.240
<v Speaker 3>piece is identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want you,</v>

2504
01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.740
<v Speaker 3>they don't want you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2505
01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:47.290
<v Speaker 3>you have no village to speak on those</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2506
01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:48.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was just no,</v>

2507
01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:48.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speak about feminism.</v>

2508
01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:49.761
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2509
01:37:49.761 --> 01:37:51.710
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why it's so damaging to black</v>

2510
01:37:51.711 --> 01:37:52.730
<v Speaker 3>lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that,</v>

2511
01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:55.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of their figurehead seemed to end up</v>

2512
01:37:55.171 --> 01:37:57.420
<v Speaker 3>either being lunatics or being white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

2513
01:37:57.421 --> 01:37:59.430
<v Speaker 3>what was wrong with this movement that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that no,</v>

2514
01:37:59.431 --> 01:38:01.650
<v Speaker 3>authentically black people seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to lead it.</v>

2515
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there must be this.</v>

2516
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong.</v>

2517
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:06.300
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deray?</v>

2519
01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be gay,</v>

2520
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:17.001
<v Speaker 3>but that's still it feel like he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just so odious and unbearable.</v>

2521
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:18.420
<v Speaker 3>And I loved also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved,</v>

2522
01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:19.830

2523
01:38:19.831 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 3>in America that meets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>

2524
01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he is give these</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews.</v>

2525
01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:27.060
<v Speaker 3>I think he's intelligent and well</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoken.</v>

2526
01:38:27.061 --> 01:38:29.700
<v Speaker 3>So nice about everyone except the men</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2538
01:38:55.970 --> 01:39:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I find him so what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you sort of like sort of</v>

2539
01:39:00.091 --> 01:39:01.920
<v Speaker 3>preening comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Homo,</v>

2540
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2541
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:08.210
<v Speaker 3>sort of prancing around in his ones is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that often it's just dreadful,</v>

2542
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:11.040
<v Speaker 3>but he's a product of this terrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>political assumption.</v>

2543
01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.910
<v Speaker 3>You got to be black and gay in a rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>protester and another,</v>

2544
01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:18.910
<v Speaker 3>the black lives matter leaders is white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the NAA NAACP chapter heading and</v>

<v Speaker 3>bought in the Washington in Spokane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Washington is white.</v>

2546
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she resigned on what's wrong with this</v>

2547
01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:25.561
<v Speaker 3>movement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2548
01:39:25.561 --> 01:39:27.450
<v Speaker 3>she's still in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or She just resigned from something's</v>

2549
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:28.420
<v Speaker 3>been all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2550
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with this movement that no</v>

2551
01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:32.670
<v Speaker 3>black people see me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're able to lead it.</v>

2552
01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.550
<v Speaker 3>And the reason is that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

2553
01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.250
<v Speaker 3>this is fueled a source thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2554
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:38.120
<v Speaker 3>it's fueled by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2555
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 3>white guilt and progressive liberal</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment,</v>

2556
01:39:40.261 --> 01:39:43.500
<v Speaker 3>which is incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one could not exist without,</v>

2557
01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:47.640
<v Speaker 3>but he's not a real black is</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2558
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just said it to annoy people.</v>

2559
01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twitter is going to be ridiculous now.</v>

2560
01:39:53.971 --> 01:39:54.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what I mean by that.</v>

2561
01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:00.770
<v Speaker 3>I guess I just don't like the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people can be homosexual.</v>

2562
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked,</v>

2563
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I liked the idea that everybody's black</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

2564
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:07.530
<v Speaker 3>the idea that I'm sort of talking them</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of their heterosexuality for one</v>

2565
01:40:07.531 --> 01:40:08.660

2570
01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:19.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the idea of black people as</v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexuals.</v>

<v Speaker 3>how they dress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they speak,</v>

2592
01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.570
<v Speaker 3>and worst of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really fucking annoys me.</v>

2593
01:41:14.571 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 3>It drives me absolutely crazy the way in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which gay people have now become such</v>

2594
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.590
<v Speaker 3>bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're using all the tools,</v>

<v Speaker 3>used against them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gay people have become the worst kind of</v>

2598
01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:30.730
<v Speaker 3>sanctimonious bullies and it makes me</v>
<v Speaker 3>ashamed to be a homosexual when I see</v>

2599
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:31.670
<v Speaker 3>the way that they bully other.</v>

2600
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.850
<v Speaker 3>My other minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they bully religious minorities.</v>

2601
01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:35.860

<v Speaker 3>this was gaze.</v>

2602
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:37.320
<v Speaker 3>When I see the way that gay people</v>

<v Speaker 3>when I see that couple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gay couple who went to memories</v>

2659
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:16.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the early stages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know like the first,</v>

<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

2664
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:28.490
<v Speaker 2>first stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first gay couple this week.</v>

2665
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:30.000
<v Speaker 2>And then I promise I'm going to give</v>
<v Speaker 2>this subject up,</v>

2666
01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.750
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay couple this week decided to renew</v>

2667
01:44:32.751 --> 01:44:35.270
<v Speaker 2>them at renew their wedding vows.</v>

2668
01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go to memories pizza and they</v>

2669
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:39.920
<v Speaker 2>pick up pizza and they stop parading</v>
<v Speaker 2>around on stage.</v>

2670
01:44:39.921 --> 01:44:42.510
<v Speaker 2>How they got memories pizza or they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing those nasty Christians who don't</v>

2671
01:44:42.511 --> 01:44:44.660
<v Speaker 2>wanna cater gates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought to myself,</v>

2672
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:46.970
<v Speaker 2>and then the NATO sent these pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press or whatever,</v>

2673
01:44:46.971 --> 01:44:48.410
<v Speaker 2>and I thought said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a nasty,</v>

2674
01:44:48.411 --> 01:44:49.880
<v Speaker 2>vindictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter,</v>

2675
01:44:49.881 --> 01:44:54.881
<v Speaker 2>soulless way to treat your own wedding</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your vowel renewal or whatever.</v>

2676
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Turn it into this triumphalist bitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>public political stumped.</v>

2677
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:04.130
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was so cheap and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>classless and it represented everything</v>

2678
01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.690
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong with the gay establishment</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2679
01:45:05.691 --> 01:45:07.700
<v Speaker 2>And it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw that and I thought,</v>

2680
01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:09.320
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope people don't think that about me</v>

2681
01:45:09.321 --> 01:45:10.320
<v Speaker 2>when they know I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2682
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:11.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2683
01:45:11.511 --> 01:45:13.970
<v Speaker 2>these preening bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiteful,</v>

2684
01:45:13.971 --> 01:45:16.460
<v Speaker 2>nasty queers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought to myself,</v>

2685
01:45:16.461 --> 01:45:18.320
<v Speaker 2>in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking idiots.</v>

2686
01:45:18.330 --> 01:45:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Like you are doing so much damage to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>public view of homosexuality.</v>

2687
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:23.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making people think that [inaudible]</v>

2688
01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.180
<v Speaker 2>spiteful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter behavior is how we all behave</v>

2689
01:45:26.181 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 2>when we get a taste of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of course how we judge people.</v>

2690
01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:30.230
<v Speaker 2>We judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways we judge people's,</v>

2691
01:45:30.231 --> 01:45:33.560
<v Speaker 2>how they behave when they're in power</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now gays or the establishment,</v>

2692
01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiring gazer power,</v>

2693
01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:37.700
<v Speaker 2>look at the disproportionate important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2694
01:45:37.701 --> 01:45:39.350
<v Speaker 2>a disproportionate numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals in,</v>

2695
01:45:39.351 --> 01:45:40.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in employment,</v>

2696
01:45:40.011 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Speaker 2>in the media or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly fated and</v>

2697
01:45:42.261 --> 01:45:45.020
<v Speaker 2>mollycoddled and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and celebrated and all of that is good.</v>

2698
01:45:45.021 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Like the quality is great and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that's all that's important,</v>

2699
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's really telling how they behave</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get to that position.</v>

2700
01:45:51.130 --> 01:45:54.470
<v Speaker 2>See this aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one couple that you're talking</v>

2701
01:45:54.471 --> 01:45:56.810
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Davis,</v>

2702
01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:59.050
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happened to that other</v>

2703
01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:00.770
<v Speaker 2>that they know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it like three or four bakeries</v>

2704
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:03.920
<v Speaker 2>and pizzerias in the u s now the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing's happening in Ireland,</v>

2705
01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:05.600
<v Speaker 2>in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2706
01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:06.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2707
01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.100
<v Speaker 2>all over the place.</v>

2708
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Gays are becoming bullies and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like seeing it.</v>

2709
01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:14.870
<v Speaker 2>I think what's happening is it's you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people who are unhappy that</v>

2710
01:46:14.871 --> 01:46:18.500
<v Speaker 2>know that they can have an impact by</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a something and they know they</v>

2711
01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:21.860
<v Speaker 2>have a green while they're obviously on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't behave like this,</v>

2712
01:46:21.861 --> 01:46:23.540
<v Speaker 2>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't do a something.</v>

2713
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Then they're giving you something as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can protest in this fashion and we will</v>

2714
01:46:27.471 --> 01:46:30.200
<v Speaker 2>get a pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they've been given carte blanche to</v>

2715
01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.240
<v Speaker 2>go after religious minorities because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2716
01:46:32.241 --> 01:46:33.980
<v Speaker 2>the media establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>

2717
01:46:33.981 --> 01:46:36.050
<v Speaker 2>all the rest of it continually give the</v>
<v Speaker 2>signals.</v>

2718
01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Are you on Kim Davis Society?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2719
01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't look,</v>

2720
01:46:40.241 --> 01:46:41.960
<v Speaker 2>she can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can't do the job right.</v>

2721
01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:43.850
<v Speaker 2>She can't do the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she probably shouldn't be in her</v>

2722
01:46:43.851 --> 01:46:46.160
<v Speaker 2>posts cause she can't perform the</v>
<v Speaker 2>functions of her job,</v>

2723
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:47.180
<v Speaker 2>her beliefs.</v>

2724
01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:50.550
<v Speaker 2>If she refuses to issue those licenses</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the law,</v>

2725
01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can't be in her job.</v>

2726
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:56.520
<v Speaker 2>But you know what's interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's these days,</v>

2727
01:46:56.580 --> 01:47:00.750
<v Speaker 2>the example of a conscientious objector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an example of somebody sticking up</v>

2728
01:47:00.751 --> 01:47:04.470
<v Speaker 2>for their beliefs or their political</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions or their life or their life</v>

2729
01:47:04.471 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 2>choices or their faith or whatever in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of the law,</v>

2730
01:47:07.261 --> 01:47:10.080
<v Speaker 2>in the face of public opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the face of,</v>

2731
01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:11.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2732
01:47:11.101 --> 01:47:12.300
<v Speaker 2>received wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consensual,</v>

2733
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:14.940
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is doing what gate can rights</v>

2734
01:47:14.941 --> 01:47:18.360
<v Speaker 2>campaigners were doing 50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's very telling now.</v>

2735
01:47:18.361 --> 01:47:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Gay people are mollycoddled and</v>
<v Speaker 2>protected.</v>

2736
01:47:20.221 --> 01:47:21.570
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been a beneficiary of that.</v>

2737
01:47:21.571 --> 01:47:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it in action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2738
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:27.540
<v Speaker 2>the way that now they can turn around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bully religious minorities solely to</v>

2739
01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:30.360
<v Speaker 2>feel better about themselves in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible bitter way that they do.</v>

2740
01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lesbians the worst by the way.</v>

2741
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they can now do that to people</v>

2742
01:47:35.671 --> 01:47:37.930
<v Speaker 2>who have faith to religious people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2743
01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:40.950
<v Speaker 2>makes me slightly feel slightly ill and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>

2744
01:47:41.110 --> 01:47:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I really object to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's slow down.</v>

2745
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:47.700
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that she is doing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>what gay activists were doing 50 years</v>

2746
01:47:47.701 --> 01:47:49.040
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is make brief stands.</v>

2747
01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:51.030
<v Speaker 1>They get them in prison to get that go</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the law.</v>

2748
01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:56.031
<v Speaker 1>Go against gay activists were never in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>position to alter other people's lives</v>

2749
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 1>or deny them of a public service that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the books.</v>

2750
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.840
<v Speaker 1>See the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that she used her own,</v>

2751
01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:06.810
<v Speaker 1>she should've never been put in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't compare her to any form of</v>

2752
01:48:06.811 --> 01:48:09.510
<v Speaker 1>an act as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you possibly do that?</v>

2753
01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Because she's affecting other people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives that have nothing to do with me,</v>

2754
01:48:13.201 --> 01:48:15.480
<v Speaker 1>that she shouldn't be in her because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do her job.</v>

2755
01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.370
<v Speaker 1>While the entire time being guilty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>several sins,</v>

2756
01:48:20.610 --> 01:48:22.810
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that she's being a demo course,</v>

2757
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:28.490
<v Speaker 1>the primary sin of a swinging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>switched out surprised after she still</v>

2758
01:48:29.641 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 1>won't happen.</v>

2759
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.780
<v Speaker 1>This is how the Democrats treat their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own well,</v>

2760
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and the GOP came and supported and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course the pneumococcal be flew in a</v>

2761
01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:37.620
<v Speaker 1>private jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2762
01:48:37.621 --> 01:48:41.070
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>published that she was a Republican.</v>

2763
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a terrible Ms Democrat you mean?</v>

2764
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:43.741
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2765
01:48:43.741 --> 01:48:45.080
<v Speaker 1>They published that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a republican.</v>

2766
01:48:45.081 --> 01:48:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Well and there was a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a democrat.</v>

2767
01:48:47.001 --> 01:48:52.000
<v Speaker 1>It was guilt times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just assumed without checking what</v>

2768
01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:52.711
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2769
01:48:52.711 --> 01:48:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I said they printed in the newspaper</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was a republican because I was</v>

2770
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:57.330
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times did and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh sorry.</v>

2771
01:48:57.340 --> 01:48:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Made a mistake about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course no one ever sees the</v>

2772
01:48:58.921 --> 01:49:00.840
<v Speaker 1>corrections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now every lesson that would fox news</v>

2773
01:49:00.850 --> 01:49:02.460
<v Speaker 1>always does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone does something creepy,</v>

2774
01:49:02.461 --> 01:49:06.980
<v Speaker 1>they put d next to their name and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out fair and balanced and they find out</v>

2775
01:49:06.981 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 1>all those really are Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2776
01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I love Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say a bad word about Fox</v>

2777
01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:14.790
<v Speaker 1>was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the gut is good friend</v>

2778
01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:18.870
<v Speaker 1>nearly that the comparison is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous to say that she is doing what</v>

2779
01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:21.390
<v Speaker 1>gay activists were doing in the 1950s.</v>

2780
01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2781
01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:25.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my point of view as somebody who is</v>

<v Speaker 2>both religious and homosexual,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm Jewish,</v>

2786
01:49:31.301 --> 01:49:32.680

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2788
01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:39.010

<v Speaker 1>If it hadn't been for Michael,</v>

2792

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2800
01:49:59.310 --> 01:50:01.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm I believe I don't necessarily go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass all the time,</v>

2801
01:50:01.481 --> 01:50:03.790
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

<v Speaker 3>idea to have confession and you have a,</v>

2809
01:50:18.761 --> 01:50:22.260
<v Speaker 3>a dude who never had sex ever listen to</v>

2813
01:50:31.601 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 3>like a wizard sitting on the golden</v>
<v Speaker 3>throne.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to Catholics.</v>

2817
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:40.420

2818
01:50:40.421 --> 01:50:43.000
<v Speaker 3>with a bit more pomp and circumstance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit more a drama.</v>

2819
01:50:43.001 --> 01:50:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And it could be the man who supports the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking matriarchy.</v>

2820
01:50:46.001 --> 01:50:47.520
<v Speaker 3>She knew what this work could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could do with it.</v>

2821
01:50:47.521 --> 01:50:48.490
<v Speaker 3>A little bit more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2822
01:50:48.491 --> 01:50:52.320
<v Speaker 3>just look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the dreary hell of the atheist</v>

<v Speaker 3>atheist,</v>

<v Speaker 3>civilization and knowledge in the way</v>

2836
01:51:23.981 --> 01:51:27.370
<v Speaker 3>that anyway,</v>

2841
01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:39.610

<v Speaker 3>You need religion to be a good person,</v>

2842
01:51:39.930 --> 01:51:42.040
<v Speaker 3>but you especially need rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the religion,</v>

2843
01:51:42.041 --> 01:51:44.860
<v Speaker 3>to be a good artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to pick and choose what you do</v>

2844
01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:49.360
<v Speaker 3>that you decide is religious and isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>same as his Kim Davis lady deciding that</v>

2845
01:51:49.361 --> 01:51:53.830
<v Speaker 3>the sins of these men were more</v>
<v Speaker 3>important than their own sins or the or.</v>

2846
01:51:53.831 --> 01:51:56.770
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you want to do ketamine and</v>

2847
01:51:56.771 --> 01:52:01.771
<v Speaker 3>amphetamines and have just speaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>purely here about five at the age of 13</v>

2848
01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:06.520
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are all not in the Bible all day.</v>

2849
01:52:06.521 --> 01:52:08.810
<v Speaker 3>You'll never find hat drag queen</v>
<v Speaker 3>fivesome.</v>

2850
01:52:09.730 --> 01:52:14.730
<v Speaker 3>None of the minute</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to go to the Old Testament.</v>

2851
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I think you know you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at King James on you.</v>

2852
01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:17.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2853
01:52:17.650 --> 01:52:18.950
<v Speaker 3>if you actually chat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Baltimore.</v>

2854
01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.960
<v Speaker 3>It's right there in Leviticus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read her the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>

2855
01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Christian lie with interracial</v>
<v Speaker 3>crossdressing orgies.</v>

2856
01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:26.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2857

2859
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:31.000
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

2860
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:35.500
<v Speaker 3>if you say you're Christian and you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be on that team to kind of say it</v>

2861
01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Badri veteran than you all aspire to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than you are.</v>

2862
01:52:39.061 --> 01:52:41.030
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you believe in Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 3>zombies.</v>

2863
01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.080
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to win this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to win this one.</v>

2864
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:45.531
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

<v Speaker 3>was flat and the sun was 17 miles away</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2869
01:52:55.161 --> 01:52:56.570
<v Speaker 3>that's going to make you a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

2870
01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:57.920
<v Speaker 3>It's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2871
01:52:57.921 --> 01:53:00.440
<v Speaker 3>They found it in clay pots and Qumran</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2872
01:53:00.441 --> 01:53:01.211
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and scroll,</v>

2873
01:53:01.211 --> 01:53:06.211
<v Speaker 3>they had to DNA test to find out which</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of fucking Yak ass on.</v>

2874
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:08.780
<v Speaker 3>I feel sorry for people who have a sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of bleak,</v>

2875
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:12.950
<v Speaker 3>empty existence that atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just so boring.</v>

2876
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:16.770
<v Speaker 3>Terrible nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way to look.</v>

2877
01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:20.420
<v Speaker 3>A lack of belief in nonsense is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>bleak.</v>

2878
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:21.860
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plenty of nonsense.</v>

2879
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Name one thing?</v>

2880
01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2881
01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:26.320
<v Speaker 3>you're so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a silly view on circumcision.</v>

2882
01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:31.730
<v Speaker 3>As soon as we've discovered as baby dick</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting my God,</v>

2883
01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:36.080
<v Speaker 3>free agree or disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very nit picky.</v>

2884
01:53:36.081 --> 01:53:39.650
<v Speaker 3>You're a hell of a fucking drama queen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an Ab Dick Cutting.</v>

2885
01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:42.980
<v Speaker 3>You tell me what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give tell them what is it.</v>

2886
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:45.620
<v Speaker 3>If it's not baby Dick Cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you just look.</v>

2887
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:47.560
<v Speaker 3>You win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna give it too much and you</v>

2888
01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:48.680
<v Speaker 3>want to brought up the baby.</v>

2889
01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Didn't cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call it.</v>

2890
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Call it something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2891
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good grooming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If aliens from another planet and so I</v>

2892
01:53:56.411 --> 01:53:58.100
<v Speaker 3>had cut all the baby Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>

2893
01:53:58.101 --> 01:54:00.590
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just good.</v>

2894
01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:03.080
<v Speaker 3>It's just good grooming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2895
01:54:04.610 --> 01:54:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What other ridiculous shit do I believe</v>

2896
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:13.360
<v Speaker 3>that's a kin to Jewish zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're taught say off at a water.</v>

2897
01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:18.590
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing more depressing than</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing somebody who you admire who's</v>

2898
01:54:18.591 --> 01:54:23.591
<v Speaker 3>obviously smart and clever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old Fairy Tales to speak so</v>

2899
01:54:24.351 --> 01:54:29.351
<v Speaker 3>disparagingly about such a complex and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating part of who we are.</v>

2900
01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:33.350
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2901
01:54:33.351 --> 01:54:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you take the view,</v>

2902
01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:35.870
<v Speaker 3>let's say living flowback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2903
01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Even if you take the Foi Bucky end view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2904
01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:41.300
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in any of these</v>

2905
01:54:41.301 --> 01:54:42.510
<v Speaker 3>religions say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2906
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:45.650
<v Speaker 3>but if we look at what they have in</v>
<v Speaker 3>common and what that says about the</v>

2907
01:54:45.651 --> 01:54:47.570
<v Speaker 3>human spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we aspire to,</v>

2908
01:54:47.571 --> 01:54:48.800
<v Speaker 3>what we consider most important.</v>

2909
01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:50.150
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

2910
01:54:50.151 --> 01:54:52.700
<v Speaker 3>we might consider self sacrifice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>love the most important things because</v>

2911
01:54:52.701 --> 01:54:53.031
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2912
01:54:53.031 --> 01:54:57.560
<v Speaker 3>self sacrifice and love are the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>central instincts that the red threads</v>

2913
01:54:57.561 --> 01:55:00.200
<v Speaker 3>that run through the Christian Canon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monster Christian literature run to</v>

2914
01:55:00.201 --> 01:55:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Christian history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the most important say is this,</v>

2915
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:05.750
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in this stuff,</v>

2916
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but this is an essential human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human artifact of human culture and</v>

2917
01:55:11.241 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 3>history because it teaches us more about</v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves than anything else,</v>

2918
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It teaches us over centuries,</v>

2919
01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:17.930
<v Speaker 3>centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is evolved to teach us what we find</v>

2920
01:55:17.931 --> 01:55:21.320
<v Speaker 3>most important and different religions</v>
<v Speaker 3>in different places are fascinating</v>

2921
01:55:21.321 --> 01:55:26.240
<v Speaker 3>because they illustrate the different</v>
<v Speaker 3>emphases on those core values of love</v>

2922
01:55:26.241 --> 01:55:29.480
<v Speaker 3>and charity and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different societies place on things.</v>

2923
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not asking you to believe that,</v>

2924
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:34.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you take holy communion,</v>

2925
01:55:34.641 --> 01:55:35.910
<v Speaker 3>you are ingesting the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2926
01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:38.330
<v Speaker 3>the body and blood of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not going to happen.</v>

2927
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:41.970
<v Speaker 3>But what I am suggesting that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be such a dismissive asshole</v>

2928
01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:44.410
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2929
01:55:44.410 --> 01:55:46.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such an integral,</v>

2930
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 2>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and crucial part of human</v>

2931
01:55:48.751 --> 01:55:50.640
<v Speaker 2>history that teaches us so much about</v>
<v Speaker 2>who we are.</v>

2932
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all cases a disingenuous</v>

2933
01:55:54.450 --> 01:55:57.730
<v Speaker 2>disingenuine sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were mocking me about [inaudible]</v>

2934
01:55:57.890 --> 01:56:01.950
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming back from the dead healing people</v>

2935
01:56:01.951 --> 01:56:04.950
<v Speaker 2>turning wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is even if you only</v>

2936
01:56:04.951 --> 01:56:07.260
<v Speaker 2>believe their stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the most important stories</v>

2937
01:56:07.261 --> 01:56:10.570
<v Speaker 2>that were the western tradition</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolization stories,</v>

2938
01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:12.930
<v Speaker 2>the most important stories that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been told about folklore.</v>

2939
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Even if you believe that they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something deep and profound about who we</v>

2940
01:56:17.011 --> 01:56:19.680
<v Speaker 2>are and about what we care about most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about our anxieties,</v>

2941
01:56:19.681 --> 01:56:22.420
<v Speaker 2>about our beliefs and about our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2942
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our sympathies,</v>

2943
01:56:23.461 --> 01:56:25.650
<v Speaker 2>the way we relate to one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that that's adorable.</v>

2944
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:37.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm presenting one reason why you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be less flippant and dismissive about</v>

2945
01:56:37.021 --> 01:56:40.290
<v Speaker 2>religion because you are too smart to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>that much of a covenant religion.</v>

2946
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are far too smart.</v>

2947
01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:48.960
<v Speaker 2>You are far too intelligent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual to treat religion with the</v>

2948
01:56:48.961 --> 01:56:51.480
<v Speaker 2>amount of contempt you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is more assholes too.</v>

2949
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:54.930
<v Speaker 2>This is not what asked mediocre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mediocre intelligence,</v>

2950
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:56.050
<v Speaker 2>zealots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>APS,</v>

2951
01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminists of doing distorting the</v>

2952
01:56:58.861 --> 01:57:00.780
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What my reality is,</v>

2953
01:57:00.781 --> 01:57:03.420
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about myths and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about Penn.</v>

2954
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm saved those myths so much that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't let people get married because it</v>

2955
01:57:07.981 --> 01:57:11.940
<v Speaker 2>goes against their myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying I can disagree with them and</v>

2956
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:13.560
<v Speaker 2>that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can disagree with,</v>

2957
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:17.190
<v Speaker 2>you can just pull it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the love and the Davis.</v>

2958
01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:19.470
<v Speaker 2>You can disagree with everything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they teach.</v>

2959
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:22.170
<v Speaker 2>You can say that it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can agree that you can,</v>

2960
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:24.540
<v Speaker 2>if you want to agree that it has bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences in society,</v>

2961
01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:30.510
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't do is ridicule and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismiss,</v>

2962
01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:31.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the,</v>

2963
01:57:31.570 --> 01:57:32.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish Zombie Shit,</v>

2964
01:57:32.851 --> 01:57:33.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2965
01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 2>You're just doing it to be outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just doing what you shouldn't do.</v>

2966
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:37.794
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a good</v>

2967
01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:41.040
<v Speaker 2>place for it for outrageousness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>provocation.</v>

2968
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not trying to put you on trial</v>

2969
01:57:42.421 --> 01:57:45.180
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying is you're too smart to</v>

2970
01:57:45.181 --> 01:57:47.370
<v Speaker 2>fall into this habit and it's a leftist</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2971
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.660
<v Speaker 2>This militant atheism crap or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismiss the central importance of</v>

2972
01:57:51.690 --> 01:57:56.690
<v Speaker 2>religion to our culture is the central</v>
<v Speaker 2>importance through barbaric days with</v>

2973
01:57:57.901 --> 01:58:00.270
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we worried about the consequences</v>

2974
01:58:00.271 --> 01:58:03.210
<v Speaker 2>of God's punishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of our laws are based on religious</v>

2975
01:58:03.211 --> 01:58:04.530
<v Speaker 2>prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get down to it,</v>

2976
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:09.840
<v Speaker 2>most of the way society is</v>
<v Speaker 2>organized is based on what's ultimately</v>

2977
01:58:09.841 --> 01:58:13.890
<v Speaker 2>religious prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is simply and only that if</v>

2978
01:58:13.891 --> 01:58:18.150
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be a flippant asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least acknowledge that first of all,</v>

2979
01:58:18.151 --> 01:58:19.260
<v Speaker 2>half the population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2980
01:58:19.261 --> 01:58:21.240
<v Speaker 2>it does take this stuff seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second of all,</v>

2981
01:58:21.241 --> 01:58:23.640
<v Speaker 2>this is important stuff that tells us</v>
<v Speaker 2>about who we are.</v>

2982
01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's beneath you to be so</v>
<v Speaker 2>flippant about it.</v>

2983
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:29.580
<v Speaker 2>It's about feminism because feminism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as important.</v>

2984
01:58:29.581 --> 01:58:34.581
<v Speaker 2>Stein tells us about flippant and cruel</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vindictive and spiteful and horrible</v>

2985
01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:37.080
<v Speaker 2>about crazy feminists because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2986
01:58:37.081 --> 01:58:40.080
<v Speaker 2>And because what they do is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think whether or not you're an</v>

2987
01:58:40.081 --> 01:58:41.950
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that religion is ridiculous and I think</v>

2988
01:58:41.951 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

2989
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.990
<v Speaker 1>deserves a bit more respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's fine.</v>

2990
01:58:43.991 --> 01:58:45.970
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just because you think it doesn't</v>

2991
01:58:45.971 --> 01:58:48.970
<v Speaker 1>mean it's right and the idea that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you a flip an asshole because</v>

2992
01:58:48.971 --> 01:58:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you're unwilling to accept myths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're unwilling to accept things that</v>

2993
01:58:52.451 --> 01:58:55.750
<v Speaker 1>make no sense whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're unwilling to accept things that</v>

2994
01:58:55.751 --> 01:58:59.380
<v Speaker 1>are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not acknowledging the extent to which</v>

2995
01:58:59.381 --> 01:59:01.000
<v Speaker 1>religion has made you who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2996
01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you know from the speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rejection codes that you grow up</v>

2997
01:59:05.261 --> 01:59:09.690
<v Speaker 1>with your moral code spaces doesn't mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

2998
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that</v>

2999
01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:17.060
<v Speaker 1>what got us to here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see ball,</v>

3000
01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:20.340
<v Speaker 1>your senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sense of right and religion,</v>

3001
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:24.210
<v Speaker 1>which was created by people's sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong bull shit</v>

3002
01:59:26.490 --> 01:59:30.280
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting he's not come from</v>

3003
01:59:30.281 --> 01:59:31.780
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not very angry.</v>

3004
01:59:31.781 --> 01:59:34.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sense of right and wrong comes from</v>

3005
01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:35.153
<v Speaker 1>Judy.</v>

3006
01:59:35.210 --> 01:59:37.390
<v Speaker 1>You got to stop saying that because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

3007
01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:43.240
<v Speaker 1>This cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's right and wrong and other</v>

3008
01:59:43.241 --> 01:59:45.850
<v Speaker 1>cultures had to completely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what we consider.</v>

3009
01:59:45.851 --> 01:59:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Right and wrong in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look in New Guinea.</v>

3010
01:59:48.190 --> 01:59:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what about the sperm</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors in New Guinea?</v>

3011
01:59:50.261 --> 01:59:54.250
<v Speaker 1>These men that take these young boys</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're young and inseminate them,</v>

3012
01:59:54.251 --> 01:59:56.890
<v Speaker 1>put common their mouths and their acids</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them grow.</v>

3013
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:58.530
<v Speaker 1>They do that from the time they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3014
01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:02.780
<v Speaker 1>isn't that great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their culture.</v>

3015
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what's right and what's wrong for</v>

3016
02:00:04.961 --> 02:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that would be absolutely illegal</v>

3017
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:10.660
<v Speaker 1>would lock you up in jail for in America</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Europe,</v>

3018
02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>in New Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a great long tradition of this</v>

3019
02:00:14.531 --> 02:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>part and then out your day a Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cultural.</v>

3020
02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:18.913
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3021
02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Christian cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things that you have good values</v>

3022
02:00:23.381 --> 02:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>that I agree with the call Shit Bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

3023
02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:28.723
<v Speaker 1>I just made it.</v>

3024
02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You grew up in a basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

3025
02:00:30.221 --> 02:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>You're a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This place where there's no</v>

3026
02:00:31.781 --> 02:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come and boys mouths.</v>

3027
02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>There's one place that has a fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at things.</v>

3028
02:00:37.210 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a cultural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have it everywhere.</v>

3029
02:00:40.571 --> 02:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't have a strong Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heritage is a fucked up place with bad</v>

3030
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>with bad morals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a ridiculous statement.</v>

3031
02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a ridiculous statement everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have jail,</v>

3032
02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucked up place.</v>

3033
02:00:53.710 --> 02:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3034
02:00:54.911 --> 02:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be perfectly</v>

3035
02:00:56.681 --> 02:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>reasonable respectful thing to say our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is better.</v>

3036
02:00:58.841 --> 02:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe our culture is better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture of Christian European shares,</v>

3037
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ph,</v>

3038
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>other European and American culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is based on Judeo Christian values</v>

3039
02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>is better than other cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's uncontroversial to say so,</v>

3040
02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>but what's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on Judeo Christian values about</v>

3041
02:01:15.551 --> 02:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>being a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately all us from the Bible,</v>

3042
02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes from the Bible.</v>

3043
02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately our sense of right and wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the Bible,</v>

3044
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>our sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3045
02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I think you also see the only way that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person could have ethics and morals and</v>

3046
02:01:31.121 --> 02:01:32.140
<v Speaker 1>treat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say the</v>

3047
02:01:34.850 --> 02:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

3048
02:01:36.030 --> 02:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to have a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't keep talking over each other</v>

3049
02:01:38.321 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone's trying to make</v>

3050
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.200
<v Speaker 3>a point about something that's complex</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

3051
02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:45.800
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think that the only way for a</v>

3052
02:01:45.801 --> 02:01:48.560
<v Speaker 3>person to have ethics or an</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of each other or</v>

3053
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:52.430
<v Speaker 3>compassion for each other is to rely on</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient myths that are easily,</v>

3054
02:01:52.431 --> 02:01:54.140
<v Speaker 3>scientifically disproven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3055
02:01:54.141 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 3>that's what Christianity is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3056
02:01:55.611 --> 02:01:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Bible said.</v>

3057
02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:01.430
<v Speaker 3>This is the specific set of values that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have is influenced more than you</v>

3058
02:02:01.431 --> 02:02:04.730
<v Speaker 3>would like to admit by your Judaic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian influenced by</v>

3059
02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:07.173
<v Speaker 3>all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have,</v>

3060
02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3061
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I think that some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of what we would call morality</v>

3062
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:13.280
<v Speaker 3>obviously comes from natural revulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is more like biological,</v>

3063
02:02:13.281 --> 02:02:13.881
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then this is,</v>

3064
02:02:13.881 --> 02:02:15.980
<v Speaker 3>this is some of the prescriptions</v>
<v Speaker 3>against perhaps against murder,</v>

3065
02:02:15.981 --> 02:02:17.630
<v Speaker 3>perhaps against child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff.</v>

3066
02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes from instead of natural</v>

3067
02:02:19.191 --> 02:02:21.770
<v Speaker 3>revulsion and it may be an evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological imperative.</v>

3068
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:23.510
<v Speaker 3>There's certain things that we just know</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't do.</v>

3069
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's our body's saying no,</v>

3070
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.761
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3071
02:02:25.761 --> 02:02:27.250
<v Speaker 3>like the smell of rotten food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3072
02:02:27.251 --> 02:02:28.140
<v Speaker 3>it was stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3073
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are other things that,</v>

3074
02:02:30.561 --> 02:02:32.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the definitely come from the,</v>

3075
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:36.740
<v Speaker 3>from the Judaic Christian tradition has</v>
<v Speaker 3>defined most of what we consider to be</v>

3076
02:02:36.741 --> 02:02:39.230
<v Speaker 3>right and wrong in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think our society is the better</v>

3077
02:02:39.231 --> 02:02:40.220
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3078
02:02:40.221 --> 02:02:42.680
<v Speaker 3>and I think that our society is better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than elsewhere in the world.</v>

3079
02:02:44.230 --> 02:02:49.230
<v Speaker 3>And your lifestyle is proof positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's the evolution of what this</v>

3080
02:02:49.701 --> 02:02:52.670
<v Speaker 3>used to be or what it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Early speaking,</v>

3081
02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:55.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm an outlier because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

3082
02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:58.880
<v Speaker 3>gay people generally test hire for Iq</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the rest of the population and lots</v>

3083
02:02:58.881 --> 02:03:02.570
<v Speaker 3>of evolutionary biologists and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest that that gate people with high</v>

3084
02:03:02.571 --> 02:03:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Iq is tend to engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3085
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:09.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissident or unusual habits and</v>

3086
02:03:09.411 --> 02:03:11.240
<v Speaker 3>practices in general because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

3087
02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:13.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where mother nature does her</v>

3088
02:03:13.281 --> 02:03:16.130
<v Speaker 3>experimentations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where she tests the limits of,</v>

3089
02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:17.360
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3090
02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.080
<v Speaker 3>of the species.</v>

3091
02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:21.170
<v Speaker 3>So people with very high Iq are more</v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to be homosexual goes the</v>

3092
02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:25.820
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary biology argument because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in those very smart people that the</v>

3093
02:03:25.821 --> 02:03:29.150
<v Speaker 3>sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transgression and transgressive</v>

3094
02:03:29.151 --> 02:03:31.010
<v Speaker 3>dissidents stuff has tried out by mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

3095
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.880
<v Speaker 3>So I would say I'm probably an outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a very small homosexual.</v>

3096
02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I'm not typical of of sort of</v>

3097
02:03:38.031 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 3>mainstay of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of of the kind of bulk of the species.</v>

3098
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you are,</v>

3099
02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:48.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean I might take it to whoever you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are but who you are being a gay man who</v>

3100
02:03:48.070 --> 02:03:51.700
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I do that is this right here but it</v>

3101
02:03:51.701 --> 02:03:53.720
<v Speaker 3>in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3102
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:57.170
<v Speaker 3>but I agree that it would be better if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't behave like this and if I could</v>

3103
02:03:57.390 --> 02:04:00.650
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3104
02:04:00.670 --> 02:04:03.550
<v Speaker 3>And I wouldn't have this you need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>read is wonderful essay by Bernice.</v>

3105
02:04:03.550 --> 02:04:06.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to read shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck you're saying.</v>

3106
02:04:06.110 --> 02:04:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So goes what you're saying is who you</v>

3107
02:04:08.691 --> 02:04:13.691
<v Speaker 3>are is prohibited in the bylaw because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think my sexuality is an important</v>

3108
02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:16.400
<v Speaker 3>component part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk about it all the time.</v>

3109
02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:20.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive part of what we've talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about on this show I think comes up</v>

3110
02:04:20.721 --> 02:04:25.690
<v Speaker 3>anytime you want to make a funny point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes up anytime you want to do malty</v>

3111
02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:30.300
<v Speaker 3>or your urges or do well on a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people,</v>

3112
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:33.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I think people leap to the most,</v>

3113
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:34.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most different thing about</v>

3114
02:04:34.851 --> 02:04:36.800
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most unusual thing about themselves.</v>

3115
02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Anytime they want to be funny or be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3116
02:04:38.850 --> 02:04:40.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's black versus white.</v>

3117
02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Black comedians talk about being black a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

3118
02:04:42.121 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Chris rock always talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3119
02:04:43.321 --> 02:04:44.690
<v Speaker 3>blacks and inward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3120
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:45.990
<v Speaker 3>it's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3121
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim comedians only ever talk about</v>

3122
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:47.730
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

3123
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:48.061
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3124
02:04:48.061 --> 02:04:49.740
<v Speaker 3>gay comedians talk about being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>

3125
02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:52.770
<v Speaker 3>you go to that because it's the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>different funny thing about you.</v>

3126
02:04:52.771 --> 02:04:53.461
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a sort of,</v>

3127
02:04:53.461 --> 02:04:55.170
<v Speaker 3>sort of a form of laziness I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3128
02:04:55.190 --> 02:04:56.790
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know that's particularly</v>
<v Speaker 3>relevant,</v>

3129
02:04:56.791 --> 02:04:57.420
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3130
02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:58.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3131
02:04:58.381 --> 02:05:02.700
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make it bounce to the jokes and a lot of</v>

3132
02:05:02.701 --> 02:05:05.370
<v Speaker 3>cultures and Muslim culture is not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use no announced.</v>

3133
02:05:05.670 --> 02:05:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

3134
02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:08.820
<v Speaker 3>it's any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the Muslim world that does that.</v>

3135
02:05:08.821 --> 02:05:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>11 countries continue the grand old</v>

3136
02:05:12.091 --> 02:05:15.630
<v Speaker 3>tradition of killing gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that shit's been around forever.</v>

3137
02:05:15.631 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it say in the Bible about a</v>

3138
02:05:18.301 --> 02:05:20.640
<v Speaker 3>man lying with another man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if I could,</v>

3139
02:05:20.690 --> 02:05:22.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could change,</v>

3140
02:05:23.250 --> 02:05:25.050
<v Speaker 3>if I could choose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be homosexual.</v>

3141
02:05:25.590 --> 02:05:26.640
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make me self loathing.</v>

3142
02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:30.210
<v Speaker 3>So if someone came out and it just made</v>
<v Speaker 3>me so Pfizer came out with a pill to</v>

3143
02:05:30.211 --> 02:05:31.380
<v Speaker 3>make me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3144
02:05:31.381 --> 02:05:32.011
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3145
02:05:32.011 --> 02:05:36.720
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make you self loathing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate a part of what you are a part of</v>

3146
02:05:36.721 --> 02:05:37.890
<v Speaker 3>what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love all of me,</v>

3147
02:05:37.891 --> 02:05:40.050
<v Speaker 3>but if I could choose to be even better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I would be.</v>

3148
02:05:40.051 --> 02:05:41.940
<v Speaker 3>So you'd be better if you were straight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3149
02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody would be,</v>

3150
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:48.390
<v Speaker 3>if Johnson would be better if he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong and had an anti gay pill.</v>

3151
02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would take it.</v>

3152
02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:51.480
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be curious suicide,</v>

3153
02:05:51.481 --> 02:05:52.314
<v Speaker 3>but I probably would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3154
02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Would it be career suicide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that you could</v>

3155
02:05:54.151 --> 02:05:57.420
<v Speaker 3>transition into the straight world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would be the poster boy for</v>

3156
02:05:57.421 --> 02:05:58.254
<v Speaker 3>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3157
02:05:58.320 --> 02:05:59.510
<v Speaker 3>They would love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tru,</v>

3158
02:05:59.690 --> 02:06:01.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I were to pray the gay away,</v>

3159
02:06:01.051 --> 02:06:02.370
<v Speaker 3>I'd be so popular.</v>

3160
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Super popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's holding you back is the</v>

3161
02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 3>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

3162
02:06:06.630 --> 02:06:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're intelligent.</v>

3163
02:06:07.981 --> 02:06:09.720
<v Speaker 3>You're good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're well dressed.</v>

3164

<v Speaker 3>sub men,</v>

<v Speaker 3>male prostitutes see black male</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on there.</v>

3197
02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:32.730

<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe that you would,</v>

3198
02:07:32.731 --> 02:07:35.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would decide to not be gay if you</v>

3199
02:07:35.921 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>

3200
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:38.340
<v Speaker 2>And is that because of Christian values?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3203
02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's self loathing to</v>

3204
02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:48.340
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that being homosexual is</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a sort of aberrant sexuality.</v>

3205
02:07:48.341 --> 02:07:50.590
<v Speaker 2>It's something that Mother Nature does</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the fringes and nobody really knows</v>

3206
02:07:50.591 --> 02:07:51.550
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it could be,</v>

3207
02:07:51.551 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elegant variation and the evolutionary</v>

3208
02:07:53.711 --> 02:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be all sorts of things.</v>

3209
02:07:56.050 --> 02:07:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Who knows the variation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3210
02:07:58.840 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3211
02:07:59.981 --> 02:08:02.260
<v Speaker 2>from a Christian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a test from the evolutionary</v>

3212
02:08:02.261 --> 02:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a Christian perspective.</v>

3213
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Some Christians believe that you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things in life as tests and they</v>

3214
02:08:10.541 --> 02:08:12.820
<v Speaker 2>don't judge the sinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They judge the sin and what they mean by</v>

3215
02:08:12.821 --> 02:08:15.430
<v Speaker 2>that is you can be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you act on it,</v>

3216
02:08:15.431 --> 02:08:17.410
<v Speaker 2>that's when you become sin so they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay.</v>

3217
02:08:17.411 --> 02:08:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Don't blame you for who you are.</v>

3218
02:08:18.670 --> 02:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>They believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wonder what you'll do is bullshit.</v>

3219
02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:24.040
<v Speaker 2>You're gay is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Presenting the argument,</v>

3220
02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3221
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:29.920
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a God damn choice in the</v>

3222
02:08:29.921 --> 02:08:34.080
<v Speaker 2>world for you other than being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're the perfect example of this</v>

3223
02:08:34.081 --> 02:08:36.700
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shipping nonsense that it's a</v>

3224
02:08:36.701 --> 02:08:40.150
<v Speaker 2>choice that somehow or another you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>presented [inaudible]</v>

3225
02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 2>you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on that because I'm actually born</v>

3226
02:08:44.441 --> 02:08:45.880
<v Speaker 2>this way is an invention of the gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobby.</v>

3227
02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Once you go back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>science for this,</v>

3228
02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:54.940
<v Speaker 2>as you guys know base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a broad spectrum.</v>

3229
02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:56.650
<v Speaker 2>There is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually what I'm going to be very</v>

3230
02:08:56.651 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 2>specific because I know you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>specificity.</v>

3231
02:08:59.890 --> 02:09:03.220
<v Speaker 2>There is no basis in science for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>born this way argument.</v>

3232
02:09:03.221 --> 02:09:05.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no basis in science that you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply born gay and that's all there is</v>

3233
02:09:05.891 --> 02:09:08.740
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the science suggests is that it is</v>

3234
02:09:08.741 --> 02:09:11.230
<v Speaker 2>very much nature and nurture and it can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as much as 50,</v>

3235
02:09:11.231 --> 02:09:12.910
<v Speaker 2>50 in nature and nurture.</v>

3236
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gay lobby in the 1980s was worried</v>

3237
02:09:15.941 --> 02:09:17.150
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I finish this one,</v>

3238
02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:21.040
<v Speaker 2>the gay lobby in the 1980s was worried</v>
<v Speaker 2>because religious people were saying</v>

3239
02:09:21.050 --> 02:09:24.040
<v Speaker 2>that the gay lifestyle lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a sinful choice,</v>

3240
02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:26.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they came up with this thing in the</v>

3241
02:09:26.111 --> 02:09:30.460
<v Speaker 2>gay gene and it is an invention of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay lobby designed to get around</v>

3242
02:09:30.490 --> 02:09:32.650
<v Speaker 2>religious bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's designed to,</v>

3243
02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:36.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wrong foot to the religious right and</v>

3244
02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:39.880
<v Speaker 2>suggest that people's sexuality has no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no element of choice and people</v>

3245
02:09:39.881 --> 02:09:43.090
<v Speaker 2>sexuality born this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hearing lady Gaga Song and we</v>

3246
02:09:43.091 --> 02:09:46.030
<v Speaker 2>take it as good as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as granted as you obviously had no idea</v>

3247
02:09:46.031 --> 02:09:49.600
<v Speaker 2>that it was even real until you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said the lady Gaga was born this way.</v>

3248
02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of her biggest hits,</v>

3249
02:09:52.090 --> 02:09:53.500
<v Speaker 2>never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed.</v>

3250
02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of her biggest hits is based on an</v>

3251
02:09:55.661 --> 02:09:56.020
<v Speaker 2>invention.</v>

3252
02:09:56.020 --> 02:10:00.280
<v Speaker 2>The gala with no basis in science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the science says is it's a mixture.</v>

3253
02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:03.310
<v Speaker 2>So it simply isn't true to say that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3254
02:10:03.311 --> 02:10:05.140
<v Speaker 2>you're just born gay and that's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is to it.</v>

3255
02:10:05.141 --> 02:10:09.940
<v Speaker 2>For most people it is a mixture of early</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental factors and natural</v>

3256
02:10:09.941 --> 02:10:12.460
<v Speaker 2>predisposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most we can say that's the</v>

3257
02:10:12.461 --> 02:10:14.290
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's with any confidence and with any</v>

3258
02:10:14.291 --> 02:10:16.060
<v Speaker 2>surety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most that we can say from the</v>

3259
02:10:16.061 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 2>available science born this way is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>marketing gimmick.</v>

3260
02:10:19.090 --> 02:10:21.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3261
02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:23.950
<v Speaker 2>But when you say that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about,</v>

3262
02:10:23.951 --> 02:10:26.470
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a broad spectrum of human sexuality.</v>

3263
02:10:26.471 --> 02:10:30.250
<v Speaker 2>So some people come part going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more nurturing.</v>

3264
02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Some people it's going to be much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature are born gay.</v>

3265
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking kid that lives down my</v>
<v Speaker 3>street,</v>

3266
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.850
<v Speaker 3>he's five years old and he's gay gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

3267
02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:39.950
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might like to play with Asian man,</v>

3268
02:10:39.951 --> 02:10:41.990
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not necessarily gonna be gay.</v>

3269
02:10:41.991 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 3>And I have a problem with you ascribing</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexuality to a five year old boy because</v>

3270
02:10:46.221 --> 02:10:48.200
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what the transgender</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents do.</v>

3271
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:49.970
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly when the transgender</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents say,</v>

3272
02:10:49.971 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 3>my five year old was really supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a girl.</v>

3273
02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:55.010
<v Speaker 3>You're doing exactly the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying he's five years old.</v>

3274
02:10:55.011 --> 02:10:58.040
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't even hit puberty yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has no idea who he is.</v>

3275
02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:01.310
<v Speaker 3>No idea what he's going to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No idea who is going to want to fuck</v>

3276
02:11:01.311 --> 02:11:03.350
<v Speaker 3>when he's older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's nowhere near puberty and your</v>

3277
02:11:03.351 --> 02:11:06.020
<v Speaker 3>saying this kid is gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are doing exactly the same thing as</v>

3278
02:11:06.021 --> 02:11:08.990
<v Speaker 3>these Canadian parents who say that my</v>
<v Speaker 3>five year old girl should be a boy.</v>

3279
02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Please give them hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be exactly the same.</v>

3280
02:11:11.061 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Certainly not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not because I don't want</v>

3281
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:15.260
<v Speaker 3>to give anybody hormones and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to influence this guy's life in any</v>

3282
02:11:15.261 --> 02:11:19.640
<v Speaker 3>way so I'm going to hang back and watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking apologize.</v>

3283
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:22.080
<v Speaker 3>I will come back to you in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will come back on this show.</v>

3284
02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:27.370
<v Speaker 3>You get him on cause his mom calls him</v>
<v Speaker 3>go well his mum is wrong and his mom,</v>

3285
02:11:27.371 --> 02:11:30.200
<v Speaker 3>his mom is just random everyday</v>
<v Speaker 3>Schweppes his ass.</v>

3286
02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:34.520
<v Speaker 3>She might know he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows all the things say is up</v>

3287
02:11:34.521 --> 02:11:36.200
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not a bad person.</v>

3288
02:11:36.230 --> 02:11:38.360
<v Speaker 3>She's not a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's finding things he's put up.</v>

3289
02:11:38.361 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 3>There are all black dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't say it in a in a bad way.</v>

3290
02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:44.900
<v Speaker 3>She just said she's just pretty sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gay.</v>

3291
02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:46.700
<v Speaker 3>You know what actually think he's seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3292
02:11:46.701 --> 02:11:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't particularly like that line of</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

3293
02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Ascribing sexualities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that haven't even hit puberty</v>

3294
02:11:50.931 --> 02:11:51.860
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems a bit much to me.</v>

3295
02:11:52.050 --> 02:11:55.910
<v Speaker 3>You'd think that with a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are gay.</v>

3296
02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:59.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jen is just what they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

3297
02:11:59.601 --> 02:12:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Some people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3298
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:02.750
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely for you made a choice.</v>

3299
02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Definitely 50 50 50 50 so you're well</v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of the fact that there is an</v>

3300
02:12:05.961 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 3>element of deliberation in my sexuality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things that annoys</v>

3301
02:12:10.191 --> 02:12:14.810
<v Speaker 3>me about the establishment gay left</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they insist born this way is on</v>

3302
02:12:14.811 --> 02:12:18.460
<v Speaker 3>placards and banners and the Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the taxpayers,</v>

3303
02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 3>the taxpayers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some but a minority,</v>

3304
02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.960
<v Speaker 3>a minority of people have no choice over</v>
<v Speaker 3>their sexuality.</v>

3305
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the total number of gay people in</v>

3306
02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:27.680
<v Speaker 3>minority have no have no choice</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>

3307
02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a varying amount of choice.</v>

3308
02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:33.950
<v Speaker 3>I am aware that there was a degree of</v>
<v Speaker 3>deliberation and my sexual orientation,</v>

3309
02:12:33.951 --> 02:12:37.880
<v Speaker 3>yet I am forced through my taxes to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>for gay pride banners that say born this</v>

3310
02:12:37.881 --> 02:12:38.270
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3311
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:40.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just something that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3312
02:12:40.530 --> 02:12:42.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean like the way that gay pride stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3313
02:12:42.501 --> 02:12:45.040
<v Speaker 3>is financed by the taxpayer in England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3314
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:46.280
<v Speaker 3>It's given,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given money by the government.</v>

3315
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:50.030
<v Speaker 3>My taxes go to gay pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who tell lies in the street stuff</v>

3316
02:12:50.031 --> 02:12:53.540
<v Speaker 3>that I know isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Medu it basically to get people and they</v>

3317
02:12:53.541 --> 02:12:56.870
<v Speaker 3>do it in the same bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty way that paid for a sign that just</v>

3318
02:12:56.871 --> 02:12:58.540
<v Speaker 3>said it's okay to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you be cool though?</v>

3319
02:12:58.550 --> 02:13:00.260
<v Speaker 3>They do that too and I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3320
02:13:00.261 --> 02:13:01.280
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want my taxes,</v>

3321
02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:04.100
<v Speaker 3>my taxes to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that will be your dreary pick a side,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you'd have like a paragraph of text.</v>

3325
02:13:17.690 --> 02:13:19.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't actually be able to see it</v>

3326
02:13:19.011 --> 02:13:20.400
<v Speaker 3>from very far away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this born this way sign.</v>

3328
02:13:23.001 --> 02:13:25.190
<v Speaker 3>We'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me start with this online in some</v>

3329
02:13:25.191 --> 02:13:26.710
<v Speaker 3>circumstances be bought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see this?</v>

3330
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:28.900
<v Speaker 3>You see the problem now you to see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem now,</v>

3331
02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but I'm objecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just</v>

3332
02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:37.500
<v Speaker 3>is simply telling people lies born this</v>
<v Speaker 3>way is a lie and true story with some of</v>

3333
02:13:39.301 --> 02:13:41.880
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody that's holding the signs because</v>

3334
02:13:41.881 --> 02:13:44.700
<v Speaker 3>most of the ones holding the signs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the militant homosexuals are the ones</v>

3335
02:13:44.701 --> 02:13:47.270
<v Speaker 3>that chose to be gay to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People gays.</v>

3336
02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Does she uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

3337
02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:52.020
<v Speaker 3>do you have like debates with gay people</v>
<v Speaker 3>about their sources?</v>

3338
02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:54.060
<v Speaker 3>My skates wanting to debate me because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know they'll lose.</v>

3339
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Well they've got woman brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry.</v>

3340
02:13:56.441 --> 02:14:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Get logic brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>

3341
02:14:01.050 --> 02:14:02.060
<v Speaker 3>You accuse me trolling out here.</v>

3342
02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:04.410
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I better do it to live up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the reputation.</v>

3343
02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're also very aware that uh,</v>

3344
02:14:07.330 --> 02:14:09.610
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are right wing views and the,</v>

3345
02:14:09.611 --> 02:14:10.444
<v Speaker 3>there was right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3346
02:14:11.130 --> 02:14:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Kind of a little bit of a right wing Ben</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

3347
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:17.400
<v Speaker 3>You talk about conservatives and dressy</v>
<v Speaker 3>events to wear a suit and tie this,</v>

3348
02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:22.230
<v Speaker 3>this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a good way to align yourself in the</v>

3349
02:14:22.231 --> 02:14:27.231
<v Speaker 3>club is you have to espouse Christian</v>
<v Speaker 3>values or talking about being Christian.</v>

3350
02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Give us stuff about what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative establishment thinks of me.</v>

3351
02:14:31.171 --> 02:14:33.120
<v Speaker 3>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my career would have turned out very</v>

3352
02:14:33.150 --> 02:14:34.140
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3353
02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:34.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3354
02:14:34.930 --> 02:14:38.700
<v Speaker 3>I would have chosen a very different</v>
<v Speaker 3>path through my professional life.</v>

3355
02:14:38.701 --> 02:14:39.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at the Telegraph and it,</v>

3356
02:14:39.861 --> 02:14:40.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3357
02:14:40.090 --> 02:14:44.160
<v Speaker 3>the most respectable establishment</v>
<v Speaker 3>newspaper in England,</v>

3358
02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:46.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight years ago if I'd want it to be,</v>

3359
02:14:46.741 --> 02:14:47.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sign on of the,</v>

3360
02:14:47.851 --> 02:14:50.160
<v Speaker 3>of the conservative Republican</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment.</v>

3361
02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I could've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the exact opposite.</v>

3362
02:14:52.051 --> 02:14:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I've stuck my nose up and my middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>finger up at conservatives every</v>

3363
02:14:56.191 --> 02:14:57.780
<v Speaker 3>available opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bright,</v>

3364
02:14:57.781 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 3>poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor Breitbart who put up with so much</v>

3365
02:15:00.571 --> 02:15:01.470
<v Speaker 3>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3366
02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:04.920
<v Speaker 3>they published Black Dick Jokes every</v>
<v Speaker 3>week from me and that is a direct</v>

3367
02:15:04.921 --> 02:15:08.040
<v Speaker 3>assault on the kind of stomach churn</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the conservative writers or West</v>

3368
02:15:08.041 --> 02:15:09.390
<v Speaker 3>set to have about gay things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3369
02:15:09.391 --> 02:15:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't just tell them I'm gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell them I'm sucking Black Dick,</v>

3370
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:15.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good columns to be funny and</v>

3371
02:15:15.871 --> 02:15:17.160
<v Speaker 3>entertaining and I'm right to</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

3372
02:15:17.161 --> 02:15:21.570
<v Speaker 3>And it also puts them in a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting place where they can say,</v>

3373
02:15:21.571 --> 02:15:23.070
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a gay guy working for us.</v>

3374
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 3>I tend to think probably about gives us</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff about whether people think that</v>

3375
02:15:26.191 --> 02:15:27.620
<v Speaker 3>homophobic on all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They certainly wouldn't hire me.</v>

3376
02:15:27.650 --> 02:15:31.650
<v Speaker 3>The second is everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does trust me,</v>

3377
02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:32.513
<v Speaker 3>trust me.</v>

3378
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:33.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But doesn't care about,</v>

3379
02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:36.900
<v Speaker 3>doesn't care if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't care if you do.</v>

3380
02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they care about is the facts of</v>

3381
02:15:39.511 --> 02:15:40.920
<v Speaker 3>what they published and the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they probably should,</v>

3382
02:15:41.230 --> 02:15:46.230
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time I see so strange is</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who believes but doesn't</v>

3383
02:15:47.641 --> 02:15:50.010
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You believe in religion,</v>

3384
02:15:50.011 --> 02:15:52.800
<v Speaker 3>but you don't practice any of the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that religious spouses,</v>

3385
02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:56.940
<v Speaker 3>especially the sexual of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what do you practice that religion?</v>

3386
02:15:57.090 --> 02:15:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I do most of the 10 Commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's steel.</v>

3387
02:15:59.430 --> 02:16:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't cover the wives.</v>

3388
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:03.360
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I probably covered your wife's</v>

3389
02:16:03.370 --> 02:16:04.203
<v Speaker 3>toxin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3390
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:09.110
<v Speaker 3>you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of</v>

3391
02:16:11.630 --> 02:16:14.280
<v Speaker 3>the 10 Commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that on most of the 10</v>

3392
02:16:14.281 --> 02:16:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I except for the gay stuff</v>

3393
02:16:18.690 --> 02:16:20.580
<v Speaker 3>that's in the book though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is gonna go.</v>

3394
02:16:20.590 --> 02:16:21.630
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna look after me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3395
02:16:21.631 --> 02:16:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a first class ticket to heaven.</v>

3396
02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:25.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the Moses Come Commandments,</v>

3397
02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:27.540
<v Speaker 3>the angels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerusalem scholars now believe that</v>

3398
02:16:27.541 --> 02:16:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Moses was high on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that,</v>

3399
02:16:29.291 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've read</v>

3400
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.570
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess another thing we have in common</v>

3401
02:16:32.590 --> 02:16:33.900
<v Speaker 1>that Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have any,</v>

3402
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on different drugs,</v>

3403
02:16:37.490 --> 02:16:39.770
<v Speaker 1>pills or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then it was acacia.</v>

3404
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I just be strictly accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not admitted to anything but the</v>

3405
02:16:43.021 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 1>bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is the idea that the burning</v>

3406
02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Bush was a Bush that was a high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated dod like a k.</v>

3407
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3408
02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:51.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3409
02:16:51.470 --> 02:16:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's nice on some kind of awesome</v>

3410
02:16:53.690 --> 02:16:55.960
<v Speaker 1>pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very powerful psychedelic.</v>

3411
02:16:55.961 --> 02:16:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Steve Job says he has these</v>

3412
02:16:57.431 --> 02:17:01.600
<v Speaker 1>visions of divine inspiration on Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has enabled him to these very</v>

3413
02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:03.200
<v Speaker 1>different than dimethyltryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3414
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:07.990
<v Speaker 1>dimethyltryptamine is a visionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogen extremely powerful one.</v>

3415
02:17:08.170 --> 02:17:11.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>IOWASCA that's the active ingredient and</v>

3416
02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idea is that,</v>

3417
02:17:13.451 --> 02:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>that's what Moses was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

3418
02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:18.700
<v Speaker 1>that's why the burning Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literal translation of what that</v>

3419
02:17:18.710 --> 02:17:20.830
<v Speaker 1>episode it was your smoking DMT.</v>

3420
02:17:21.670 --> 02:17:26.670
<v Speaker 1>He's getting a DMT trip and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is giving him these ideas about how</v>

3421
02:17:27.011 --> 02:17:29.110
<v Speaker 1>people should behave and be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3422
02:17:29.250 --> 02:17:30.430
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is divine,</v>

3423
02:17:30.431 --> 02:17:33.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be kind to each other to have a view</v>

3424
02:17:33.431 --> 02:17:34.510
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3425
02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it does sound like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

3426
02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:38.910
<v Speaker 1>If somebody on a nice trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well these are mainstream scholars.</v>

3427
02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:40.550
<v Speaker 1>They really nice to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moon.</v>

3428
02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck you.</v>

3429
02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck someone else's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa dude steel.</v>

3430
02:17:44.470 --> 02:17:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I carved it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3431
02:17:45.761 --> 02:17:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be quite high on drugs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build,</v>

3432
02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>but back then they carved down any idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had.</v>

3433
02:17:51.490 --> 02:17:52.960
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really have any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

3434
02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't make billboards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state have to pay for it.</v>

3435
02:17:57.610 --> 02:18:02.610
<v Speaker 1>The Christianity result of a drug trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had something today that is a,</v>

3436
02:18:02.951 --> 02:18:05.850
<v Speaker 1>what some mainstream scholars believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>this day.</v>

3437
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

3438
02:18:07.481 --> 02:18:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm right in saying that.</v>

3439
02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I sort of semi read that somewhere and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't follow it up,</v>

3440
02:18:12.581 --> 02:18:13.500
<v Speaker 1>but I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will look into that.</v>

3441
02:18:13.501 --> 02:18:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3442
02:18:14.561 --> 02:18:17.080
<v Speaker 1>you know John Marco Allegro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was one of the,</v>

3443
02:18:17.081 --> 02:18:19.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>head scholars that was deciphered the</v>

3444
02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Dead Sea Scrolls after 14 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>

3445
02:18:21.521 --> 02:18:24.610
<v Speaker 1>He was a ordained minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also agnostic because he</v>

3446
02:18:24.611 --> 02:18:26.860
<v Speaker 1>starts studying religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized it was all bullshit,</v>

3447
02:18:27.130 --> 02:18:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but he wrote a book called the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacred mushroom and the cross that</v>

3448
02:18:32.441 --> 02:18:36.880
<v Speaker 1>he believes that the entire origins of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity was based around fertility</v>

3449
02:18:36.881 --> 02:18:40.140
<v Speaker 1>rituals and the consumption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms fast.</v>

3450
02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:42.040
<v Speaker 1>That does sound fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Book,</v>

3451
02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:44.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously Bolex but it does sound fun at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

3452
02:18:44.411 --> 02:18:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3453
02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:47.830
<v Speaker 1>he was a well renowned religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholar.</v>

3454
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:48.783
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

3455
02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:53.050
<v Speaker 1>A guy who understood language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually trace back the word Christ</v>

3456
02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:57.400
<v Speaker 1>to an ancient Sumerian word that meant a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom covered in God's seaman.</v>

3457
02:18:57.810 --> 02:19:01.030
<v Speaker 1>She mean the psychedelic mushrooms that</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew out of nowhere.</v>

3458
02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They thought that when it rained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was God coming on the earth and that</v>

3459
02:19:04.991 --> 02:19:07.630
<v Speaker 1>these mushrooms that would come up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they would eat them and have these</v>

3460
02:19:07.631 --> 02:19:10.210
<v Speaker 1>great trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought they were experiencing God.</v>

3461
02:19:10.211 --> 02:19:11.590
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3462
02:19:11.591 --> 02:19:13.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can generate quite a few</v>

3463
02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:15.290
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3464
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:19.090
<v Speaker 1>theories with etymology because 70 words</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound like so many other words.</v>

3465
02:19:19.091 --> 02:19:22.330
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like an interesting thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment and Nice Social Studies</v>

3466
02:19:22.331 --> 02:19:24.400
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure I quite buy it as a</v>

3467
02:19:24.430 --> 02:19:25.600
<v Speaker 1>explaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never looked into it.</v>

3468
02:19:25.810 --> 02:19:28.790
<v Speaker 1>But if you do look into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta assume that we'll</v>

3469
02:19:28.791 --> 02:19:29.624
<v Speaker 1>look into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll write about it.</v>

3470
02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spectacular psychedelic experiences</v>

3471
02:19:32.811 --> 02:19:35.240
<v Speaker 1>would be interpreted by the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>had no science,</v>

3472
02:19:35.241 --> 02:19:36.074
<v Speaker 1>no books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3473
02:19:36.290 --> 02:19:40.610
<v Speaker 1>no knowledge of what's going on with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human neuro chemistry as being something</v>

3474
02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 1>that was divine you.</v>

3475
02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:45.720
<v Speaker 1>If you had no other reference point</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending right about that.</v>

3476
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3477
02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say there's lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always things about life in</v>

3478
02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:51.230
<v Speaker 1>general that would be considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculous.</v>

3479
02:19:51.231 --> 02:19:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Sun rising childbirth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's lots of things that we</v>

3480
02:19:53.931 --> 02:19:55.850
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things attributed to the gods.</v>

3481
02:19:56.090 --> 02:20:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And when these people were on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly powerful psychedelic drugs,</v>

3482
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.290
<v Speaker 1>they would try to hide this knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Romans.</v>

3483
02:20:03.470 --> 02:20:06.140
<v Speaker 1>And so they hid these stories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>parables.</v>

3484
02:20:06.350 --> 02:20:08.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

3485
02:20:08.631 --> 02:20:11.740
<v Speaker 1>very controversial thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious scholars you,</v>

3486
02:20:11.741 --> 02:20:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

3487
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:16.520
<v Speaker 1>this is why one of the reasons why is he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the only one who was an agnostic who</v>

3488
02:20:16.521 --> 02:20:18.440
<v Speaker 1>was on the Dead Sea Scrolls to ciphering</v>
<v Speaker 1>committee,</v>

3489
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:21.620
<v Speaker 1>all the other ones where it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an ordained minister,</v>

3490
02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:25.580
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the rest of them were very</v>

3491
02:20:25.581 --> 02:20:26.330
<v Speaker 1>religious.</v>

3492
02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And so the interpretations that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were willing to accept where not what he</v>

3493
02:20:29.961 --> 02:20:33.650
<v Speaker 1>was willing to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would have to get someone of that</v>

3494
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:36.260
<v Speaker 1>level of understanding of the language</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3495
02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 1>to debate him on this and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's dead,</v>

3496
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:41.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out the book you can buy it now,</v>

3497
02:20:41.001 --> 02:20:44.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now it got republished a few years</v>

3498
02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:47.870
<v Speaker 1>ago by this guy named John Irvin and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can get ahold of it now,</v>

3499
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:50.270
<v Speaker 1>but for the longest time we still have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy it as a used book.</v>

3500
02:20:50.980 --> 02:20:51.813
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will look it up.</v>

3501
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one also the Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>

3502
02:20:53.841 --> 02:20:56.450
<v Speaker 1>the Christian myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a second one after the Catholic</v>

3503
02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Church bought out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one stopped production of it</v>

3504
02:20:58.601 --> 02:21:00.830
<v Speaker 1>and bought out all the books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3505
02:21:00.831 --> 02:21:02.480
<v Speaker 1>your people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholics.</v>

3506
02:21:02.530 --> 02:21:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I tried to hide that information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're great at pl.</v>

3507
02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.380
<v Speaker 1>They last thing they want.</v>

3508
02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I went to Catholic school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man for a whole year.</v>

3509
02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Cured me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wakes me up.</v>

3510
02:21:10.881 --> 02:21:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where you get you a fine sense of</v>

3511
02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:14.570
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong from no wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not do that.</v>

3512
02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Well what's right and wrong as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>what anyone's right,</v>

3513
02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:21.830
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong now I got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They beat me a little smack me a little</v>

3514
02:21:21.831 --> 02:21:23.790
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky you didn't get that taste of no,</v>

3515
02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I said just like I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it went from Father Michael,</v>

3516
02:21:25.701 --> 02:21:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I would have given far less good head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3517
02:21:28.220 --> 02:21:31.280
<v Speaker 1>there was a real father Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much less than he's going to get</v>

3518
02:21:31.281 --> 02:21:32.750
<v Speaker 1>killed now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who was father Michael?</v>

3519
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:35.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a real dude I should've made me</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck his dick for real.</v>

3520
02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make me,</v>

3521
02:21:37.071 --> 02:21:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought my English teacher too,</v>

3522
02:21:38.781 --> 02:21:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but how old was he at the time?</v>

3523
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3524
02:21:41.290 --> 02:21:42.123
<v Speaker 1>She's quite young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite cohort.</v>

3525
02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:43.363
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3526
02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where it all started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Father Michael?</v>

3527
02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:47.001
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3528
02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:49.130
<v Speaker 1>it was that post the tranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3529
02:21:49.131 --> 02:21:51.350
<v Speaker 1>it was posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like I wasn't drag queens a</v>

3530
02:21:51.351 --> 02:21:53.240
<v Speaker 1>child or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3531
02:21:53.241 --> 02:21:54.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was quite a,</v>

3532
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:56.750
<v Speaker 1>you already had the five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when like this is all wrong,</v>

3533
02:21:56.751 --> 02:21:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I need to talk to father Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3534
02:21:58.191 --> 02:22:00.830
<v Speaker 1>suck my Dick and shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3535
02:22:00.831 --> 02:22:02.660
<v Speaker 1>religion is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

3536
02:22:02.661 --> 02:22:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I really had no hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I?</v>

3537
02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3538
02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I was never going to end well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it seems like you kept stumbling in</v>

3539
02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:12.890
<v Speaker 1>a Dick's pulling on them through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what would have happened if</v>

3540
02:22:12.981 --> 02:22:16.440
<v Speaker 1>a heterosexual man that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been falling on decks.</v>

3541
02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Was in the same circumstances as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>early on.</v>

3542
02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously things would have went</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different,</v>

3543
02:22:20.931 --> 02:22:24.410
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not sure if I buy the not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go down great.</v>

3544
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 1>And the gay club go down.</v>

3545
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:27.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3546
02:22:27.031 --> 02:22:31.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have an expression you go down well,</v>

3547
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:36.480
<v Speaker 3>so go down what it means you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be popular.</v>

3548
02:22:36.490 --> 02:22:38.460
<v Speaker 3>You got your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would be like the way you would describe</v>

3549

3665
02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:33.430
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia is the next progressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehabilitation drive.</v>

3666
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:36.670
<v Speaker 3>But I also think that straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

3667
02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:41.410
<v Speaker 3>that homosexual white guys are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be put back into the establishment</v>

3668
02:27:41.411 --> 02:27:44.790
<v Speaker 3>bucket very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at some of the whining</v>

3669
02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:46.600
<v Speaker 3>editorials coming out was like the daily</v>
<v Speaker 3>beast,</v>

<v Speaker 3>who will publish things about seeing it</v>

3672
02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:55.990
<v Speaker 3>on your Grindr profile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this app that you use to pick up guys</v>

3673
02:27:55.991 --> 02:27:58.000
<v Speaker 3>nearby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is best just to see if torsos and</v>

<v Speaker 3>you just pick or you want to get fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>by</v>

3675
02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:01.693
<v Speaker 3>its correct.</v>

3676
02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Jesus would've planned that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the iPhone and I don't use</v>

3677
02:28:05.171 --> 02:28:06.580
<v Speaker 3>it for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for that reason.</v>

3678
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't use these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to.</v>

3679
02:28:07.970 --> 02:28:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3680
02:28:09.220 --> 02:28:10.110
<v Speaker 3>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3681
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:12.940
<v Speaker 3>on the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people say whites only.</v>

3682
02:28:12.970 --> 02:28:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Some people say only Hispanics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just express their sexual</v>

3683
02:28:15.701 --> 02:28:16.990
<v Speaker 3>preference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has a sexual preference.</v>

3684
02:28:16.991 --> 02:28:18.730
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course,</v>

3685
02:28:18.731 --> 02:28:20.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some progressive column is just</v>

3686
02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:24.170
<v Speaker 3>finally like five years later as</v>
<v Speaker 3>cottoned onto this and decided to make a</v>

3687
02:28:24.171 --> 02:28:26.360
<v Speaker 3>thing about it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic that gay people express</v>

3688
02:28:26.361 --> 02:28:28.010
<v Speaker 3>racial preferences in dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it isn't.</v>

3689
02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:32.210
<v Speaker 3>We will have the Okcupid data actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows us which racism,</v>

3690
02:28:32.211 --> 02:28:33.130
<v Speaker 3>which genders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3691
02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:34.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out on top and come out of the</v>

3692
02:28:34.461 --> 02:28:37.040
<v Speaker 3>bottoms like Asian women do very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black women really badly.</v>

3693
02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3694
02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:42.660
<v Speaker 3>and the sort of league tables of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of of hotness a minimum.</v>

3695
02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3696
02:28:44.390 --> 02:28:46.640
<v Speaker 3>so the sign to police the language now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's police,</v>

3697
02:28:46.641 --> 02:28:50.900
<v Speaker 3>the sexuality of homosexuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was me thinking we were</v>

3698
02:28:50.901 --> 02:28:54.740
<v Speaker 3>sliding dangerously close to tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 3>and understanding and now progressive's</v>

3699
02:28:54.741 --> 02:28:56.540
<v Speaker 3>are starting to police the sexuality of</v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexuals again.</v>

3700
02:28:56.800 --> 02:28:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting.</v>

3701
02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:01.560
<v Speaker 3>There's a game of Gotcha though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a chemo scarred shirts so they</v>

3702
02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:04.170
<v Speaker 3>don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not really upset that they're</v>

3703
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:06.170
<v Speaker 3>not upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking for something to</v>

3704
02:29:06.171 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 3>complain about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with the prom with</v>

3705
02:29:08.811 --> 02:29:09.770
<v Speaker 3>outrage culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3706
02:29:09.771 --> 02:29:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I've always said the only part where</v>
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>

3707
02:29:11.061 --> 02:29:12.230
<v Speaker 3>culture is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3708
02:29:12.290 --> 02:29:15.440
<v Speaker 3>And the problem without any way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>approach outrage culture,</v>

3709
02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:16.820
<v Speaker 3>which is what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be outrageous,</v>

3710
02:29:16.821 --> 02:29:19.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say Ridiculous and outrageous things</v>

3711
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:24.170
<v Speaker 3>simply to draw attention to the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get upset about it.</v>

3712
02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a very important project</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's what I do in a lot of my</v>

3713
02:29:26.871 --> 02:29:27.210
<v Speaker 3>columns.</v>

3714
02:29:27.210 --> 02:29:28.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do on Twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it a little bit today.</v>

3715
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's very important to wait</v>

3716
02:29:31.401 --> 02:29:33.830
<v Speaker 3>a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've done a little bit of it today.</v>

3717
02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.930
<v Speaker 3>I've been outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haven't said anything I believe,</v>

3718
02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:38.300
<v Speaker 3>but I've been outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to read you something outrageous,</v>

3719
02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:40.130
<v Speaker 3>little bit outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3720
02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:42.230
<v Speaker 3>just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've turned myself down for you.</v>

3721
02:29:42.231 --> 02:29:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can heterosexual lump lumping Cretia</v>

3722
02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:48.670
<v Speaker 3>threatened me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3723
02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:50.150
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3724
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:52.640
<v Speaker 3>I've taken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've toned myself down with you today,</v>

3725
02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:53.700
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3726
02:29:53.700 --> 02:29:54.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3727
02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very firm believer that the only</v>

3728
02:29:57.171 --> 02:29:58.880
<v Speaker 3>appropriate response to outreach culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be outrageous.</v>

3729
02:29:58.881 --> 02:30:00.620
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with outreach culture is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3730
02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:02.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because these people are all basically</v>

3731
02:30:02.751 --> 02:30:03.930
<v Speaker 3>quite thick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3732
02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:07.430
<v Speaker 3>they tend to move in herds and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>outreach culture can have,</v>

3733
02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:08.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trends,</v>

3734
02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:10.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

3735
02:30:10.460 --> 02:30:12.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can sort of cottoned onto a</v>

3736
02:30:12.201 --> 02:30:14.900
<v Speaker 3>particular idea and suddenly everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>outraged about the same thing.</v>

3737
02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:18.130
<v Speaker 3>And I see ahead of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3738
02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.680
<v Speaker 3>sort of policing of the culture of</v>
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual gay men,</v>

3739
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:23.090
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3743
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:28.840
<v Speaker 3>on the basis that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3744
02:30:28.930 --> 02:30:30.680
<v Speaker 3>almost like the ultimate male privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3745
02:30:30.681 --> 02:30:33.650
<v Speaker 3>they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are smarter and richer and better</v>

3747
02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:38.060

<v Speaker 3>because feminists are none of those</v>

3748
02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:40.410
<v Speaker 3>things as feminists are</v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately poor and ugly and</v>

3749
02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:41.720
<v Speaker 3>unlovable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3752
02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:45.831
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3753
02:30:45.831 --> 02:30:49.730
<v Speaker 3>because the liberals</v>

<v Speaker 3>become liberal.</v>

3756
02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:54.980
<v Speaker 3>What's the percentage that don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural hair color?</v>

3779
02:31:33.871 --> 02:31:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I've never had it done before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I became a man today.</v>

3780
02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Real men don't do that because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust a man with a fucking razor blade.</v>

3781
02:31:39.650 --> 02:31:42.330
<v Speaker 3>You don't need because you've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

3782
02:31:42.390 --> 02:31:43.680
<v Speaker 3>there's no maneuver where you can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3783
02:31:43.690 --> 02:31:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want it like a martial art.</v>

3784
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:46.680
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's fucking crazy.</v>

3785
02:31:46.970 --> 02:31:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where there was a guy,</v>

3786
02:31:48.031 --> 02:31:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was in San Diego that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>slit someone's throat for no reason.</v>

3787
02:31:52.410 --> 02:31:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Just went crazy and just went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3788
02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:56.790
<v Speaker 3>And they arrested him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The person lived though,</v>

3789
02:31:56.791 --> 02:31:58.340
<v Speaker 3>but they're fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3790
02:31:58.410 --> 02:32:01.320
<v Speaker 3>they have surgery and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy just sliced open their</v>

3791
02:32:01.321 --> 02:32:05.160
<v Speaker 3>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was petrified that he would slip or</v>

3792
02:32:05.161 --> 02:32:07.820
<v Speaker 3>that someone would make him jump or</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody would just come in the store.</v>

3793
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:10.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like turning around and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes here.</v>

3794
02:32:10.350 --> 02:32:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Cut My throat open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3795
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:15.750
<v Speaker 3>they can just get a razor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched San Andreas earthquake,</v>

3796
02:32:15.751 --> 02:32:19.560
<v Speaker 3>so I watched San Dress on a plane over</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens to San Francisco is just</v>

3797
02:32:19.561 --> 02:32:20.320
<v Speaker 3>awful really?</v>

3798
02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:21.450
<v Speaker 3>And so dress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3799
02:32:21.451 --> 02:32:23.760
<v Speaker 3>it's just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful to see San Francisco brain</v>

3800
02:32:23.761 --> 02:32:26.820
<v Speaker 3>when you watch that movie is even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>

3801
02:32:26.821 --> 02:32:28.920
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's awesome.</v>

3803
02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:32.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen pretty much everything he's</v>

3804

<v Speaker 3>been in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you know what that movie,</v>

3805
02:32:34.021 --> 02:32:36.210
<v Speaker 3>he's actually kind of good actor in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3806
02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:38.640
<v Speaker 3>like he's quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like with this stuff with his</v>

3807
02:32:38.641 --> 02:32:41.640
<v Speaker 3>daughter at the beginning when the mom's</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving into the house with the new guy</v>

3808
02:32:41.641 --> 02:32:43.260
<v Speaker 3>who did the boss did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he runs away.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He does pussy.</v>

3811
02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:50.930
<v Speaker 3>What happens when probably British acts</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty it.</v>

3812
02:32:50.931 --> 02:32:52.590
<v Speaker 3>British actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always about going male feminist</v>

3813
02:32:52.591 --> 02:32:54.450
<v Speaker 3>palsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably male feminist.</v>

3814
02:32:54.451 --> 02:32:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3816
02:32:57.121 --> 02:33:00.130
<v Speaker 3>and I thought his acting was subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was really point.</v>

3817
02:33:00.220 --> 02:33:02.760
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a great performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was great.</v>

3818
02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:04.170
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do everything you want.</v>

3819
02:33:04.250 --> 02:33:05.580
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movie sucked.</v>

3820
02:33:07.010 --> 02:33:11.460
<v Speaker 3>I just liked seeing San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pummeled with waves,</v>

3821
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:13.470
<v Speaker 3>too many games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural disasters,</v>

3822
02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:17.400
<v Speaker 3>the solid self hate that you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could be,</v>

3823
02:33:17.430 --> 02:33:19.050
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd like to be there in an orgy when</v>

<v Speaker 3>the big one hits God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take me away.</v>

3825
02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe taking another way of earthquakes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So all evil in America that comes in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your butt tsunami takes you away.</v>

3828
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I've never been propelled forward by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not yet.</v>

3829
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First time for everything.</v>

3830
02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

3831
02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:41.220
<v Speaker 3>you're in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

3832
02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:44.780
<v Speaker 3>that's how we do it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some street fat you'd get propels and I</v>

3833
02:33:44.781 --> 02:33:49.350
<v Speaker 3>think get repelled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the viral load that's inside that</v>

3834
02:33:49.351 --> 02:33:51.480
<v Speaker 3>person's body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

3835
02:33:51.690 --> 02:33:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to just have days at t</v>
<v Speaker 3>on tap in the hipster bars in San</v>

3836
02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Francisco for the ECT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really worked.</v>

3837
02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:00.300
<v Speaker 3>That was like the big conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That AZT was a cancer medication,</v>

3838
02:34:00.301 --> 02:34:02.520
<v Speaker 3>that they were using an aids when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it was the gay cancer.</v>

3839
02:34:02.521 --> 02:34:04.080
<v Speaker 3>They stopped AZT a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

3840
02:34:04.081 --> 02:34:05.600
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

3841
02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:10.820
<v Speaker 3>so much so that there was a kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my gauge of sort of like 80s bigotry.</v>

3842
02:34:11.131 --> 02:34:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally out of date or my gay hate.</v>

3843
02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:17.730
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy named Peter though</v>

3844
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I had him on the podcast and Mandy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people I've ever had on the</v>

3845
02:34:20.831 --> 02:34:23.980
<v Speaker 1>podcast that brought so much hate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3846
02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:26.800
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is a biologist at the University of</v>

3847
02:34:26.801 --> 02:34:27.850
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley,</v>

3848
02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:31.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tenured fucking professor up there who,</v>

3849
02:34:31.151 --> 02:34:35.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that HIV did not cause aids and</v>

3850
02:34:35.621 --> 02:34:38.620
<v Speaker 1>that what HIV was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a weak virus that,</v>

3851
02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:41.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only existed in the bodies of people</v>

3852
02:34:41.171 --> 02:34:43.240
<v Speaker 1>that already had compromised immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

3853
02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And he said the correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>partying and a party drugs,</v>

3854
02:34:48.401 --> 02:34:50.640
<v Speaker 1>crystal meth dream and all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>different shit.</v>

3855
02:34:50.650 --> 02:34:54.490
<v Speaker 1>This is what drives you into the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just what could crushes your immune</v>

3856
02:34:54.491 --> 02:34:56.200
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>

3857
02:34:56.380 --> 02:34:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Academics believe we have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary reverence for science and</v>

3858
02:34:59.861 --> 02:35:00.571
<v Speaker 1>of course we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3859
02:35:00.571 --> 02:35:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3860
02:35:01.050 --> 02:35:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Because it's what tells us mostly about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the world works.</v>

3861
02:35:03.451 --> 02:35:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Python I've see from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3862
02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:06.310
<v Speaker 2>the transcendental bits that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually met her.</v>

3863
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it tells us,</v>

3864
02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:10.410
<v Speaker 2>it tells us so much about how the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>functions,</v>

3865
02:35:10.411 --> 02:35:11.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's going to happen if I do</v>

3866
02:35:11.791 --> 02:35:12.451
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3867
02:35:12.451 --> 02:35:13.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science tells us all these things,</v>

3868
02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:14.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3869
02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:16.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have this,</v>

3870
02:35:16.830 --> 02:35:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate reverence for scientists,</v>

3871
02:35:18.341 --> 02:35:23.341
<v Speaker 2>but what we always forget is just how</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentor and fallible and in many cases</v>

3872
02:35:23.791 --> 02:35:25.380
<v Speaker 2>unintelligence then many of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3873
02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there people,</v>

3874
02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:28.840
<v Speaker 1>they vary so widely to change stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3875
02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:32.680
<v Speaker 1>dark secret that I never tell anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to reveal to you.</v>

3876
02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:34.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe in climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

3877
02:35:34.541 --> 02:35:35.321
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly happy,</v>

3878
02:35:35.321 --> 02:35:38.200
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't even met McClemmits first</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

3879
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:39.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in manmade climate</v>

3880
02:35:39.851 --> 02:35:41.770
<v Speaker 1>change at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know.</v>

3881
02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:43.270
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3882
02:35:43.271 --> 02:35:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

3883
02:35:44.321 --> 02:35:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we are affecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate significantly.</v>

3884
02:35:46.610 --> 02:35:47.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3885
02:35:47.891 --> 02:35:48.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all those scientists,</v>

3886
02:35:48.971 --> 02:35:50.110
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what the fuck they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

3887
02:35:50.111 --> 02:35:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my dark secret.</v>

3888
02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:54.960
<v Speaker 2>So for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows this.</v>

3889
02:35:54.961 --> 02:35:55.771
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

3890
02:35:55.771 --> 02:35:58.230
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my last shred of conservative</v>

3891
02:35:58.231 --> 02:36:00.120
<v Speaker 2>credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gone off to this show.</v>

3892
02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:03.030
<v Speaker 2>I worked for a climate change NGO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3893
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:07.320
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw at the u I went to the UN,</v>

3894
02:36:07.350 --> 02:36:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I was in the front row for Al Gore</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech host in Barley,</v>

3895
02:36:11.740 --> 02:36:12.840
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the UN stuff.</v>

3896
02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I went to all their events and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>firsthand just what a load of what a</v>

3897
02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:19.320
<v Speaker 2>crock of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much of it is really,</v>

3898
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3899
02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.080
<v Speaker 2>we now know the IPC reports in the UN</v>
<v Speaker 2>are total horse shit.</v>

3900
02:36:25.081 --> 02:36:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Lead authors are asking for the names to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be removed from them now because they've</v>

3901
02:36:27.721 --> 02:36:30.390
<v Speaker 2>turned into just into ideological</v>
<v Speaker 2>political documents.</v>

3902
02:36:30.391 --> 02:36:32.580
<v Speaker 2>They have no basis in climate science</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever anymore.</v>

3903
02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:34.090
<v Speaker 2>But even in the early days when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3904
02:36:34.170 --> 02:36:37.830
<v Speaker 2>when they were supposedly better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

3905
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:41.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>papering over of data.</v>

3906
02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I was asked to do it and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

3907
02:36:44.010 --> 02:36:45.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people emitting,</v>

3908
02:36:46.010 --> 02:36:47.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3909
02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:49.590
<v Speaker 2>data sets that didn't fit with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

3910
02:36:49.591 --> 02:36:51.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3911
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:54.590
<v Speaker 2>hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw people getting reports,</v>

3912
02:36:54.690 --> 02:36:56.970
<v Speaker 2>some scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rewording them to make them more</v>

3913
02:36:56.971 --> 02:36:59.010
<v Speaker 2>extreme and more alarmist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw all of this happened,</v>

3914
02:36:59.430 --> 02:37:01.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw all this happen in multiple</v>

3915
02:37:01.470 --> 02:37:03.810
<v Speaker 2>organizations whose sole purpose was to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was to,</v>

3916
02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:06.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extremist about climate change.</v>

3917
02:37:06.510 --> 02:37:09.660
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came to believe that the whole thing</v>

3918
02:37:09.661 --> 02:37:10.494
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3919
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:11.850
<v Speaker 2>was a crock of shit and I left</v>

3920
02:37:13.330 --> 02:37:15.180
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that what happened?</v>

3921
02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

3922
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:17.570
<v Speaker 2>know very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

3923
02:37:17.571 --> 02:37:20.090
<v Speaker 2>very little on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna just take this at face</v>

3924
02:37:20.091 --> 02:37:21.890
<v Speaker 2>value and just debate you and not in</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

3925
02:37:21.891 --> 02:37:23.310
<v Speaker 2>You just ask you questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3926
02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that what is happening is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that an industry has been created?</v>

3927
02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that certainly is true that there is</v>

3928
02:37:31.521 --> 02:37:33.440
<v Speaker 2>an industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to suggest that the whole</v>

3929
02:37:33.470 --> 02:37:37.160
<v Speaker 2>climate change establishment as a result</v>
<v Speaker 2>of some people rent seeking where there</v>

3930
02:37:37.161 --> 02:37:39.110
<v Speaker 2>is some of that going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is definitely a climate change</v>

3931
02:37:39.111 --> 02:37:40.070
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>

3932
02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also is one,</v>

3933
02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:45.980
<v Speaker 2>it's something that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like saying that you don't believe</v>

3934
02:37:45.981 --> 02:37:47.600
<v Speaker 2>in vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3935
02:37:47.601 --> 02:37:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look,</v>

3936
02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3937
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:51.290
<v Speaker 2>but it is to public opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3938
02:37:51.291 --> 02:37:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3939
02:37:52.221 --> 02:37:53.054
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Opinion.</v>

3940
02:37:53.180 --> 02:37:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never hear about it because the</v>

3941
02:37:54.161 --> 02:37:59.090
<v Speaker 2>media will never dare tell you a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more skeptical about many of the same</v>

3942
02:37:59.091 --> 02:38:01.450
<v Speaker 2>people who don't believe in climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>change also.</v>

3943
02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Anti-Vaxxers right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think these two things have</v>

3944
02:38:03.531 --> 02:38:04.710
<v Speaker 2>anything in common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is right.</v>

3945
02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:06.110
<v Speaker 2>One them is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3946
02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:08.540
<v Speaker 2>you know which one's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anti-Vaxxers right.</v>

3947
02:38:09.650 --> 02:38:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Or rule should vaccinate their children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3948
02:38:11.930 --> 02:38:14.230
<v Speaker 2>And climate changes bunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3949
02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:17.390
<v Speaker 2>but if you need to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to believe in climate</v>

3950
02:38:17.391 --> 02:38:20.160
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times the same sort of</v>

3951
02:38:20.161 --> 02:38:22.170
<v Speaker 2>believing Wacko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they bought,</v>

3952
02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:24.350
<v Speaker 2>lump me in with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about facts not being,</v>

3953
02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not whether somebody lumps me in with</v>

3954
02:38:26.691 --> 02:38:28.580
<v Speaker 2>the wrong group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never cared about that.</v>

3955
02:38:28.581 --> 02:38:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what people think about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care whether,</v>

3956
02:38:30.621 --> 02:38:33.620
<v Speaker 2>whether my argument is sounded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether I'm right or whether I'm funny</v>

3957
02:38:33.621 --> 02:38:34.760
<v Speaker 2>and entertaining people like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3958
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:36.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if somebody,</v>

3959
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are people,</v>

3960
02:38:37.701 --> 02:38:39.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys like us off all the time.</v>

3961
02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

3962
02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:41.320
<v Speaker 2>write me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Miss [inaudible] self-loathing,</v>

3963
02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:43.670
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did today on wrongly,</v>

3964
02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:47.360
<v Speaker 2>you know people do this all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just another way that the left has</v>

3965
02:38:47.390 --> 02:38:49.610
<v Speaker 2>of dealers utilizing the speaker because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like the arguments.</v>

3966
02:38:49.611 --> 02:38:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Rather than take the argument you called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speaker self-loathing rather than</v>

3967
02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:54.970
<v Speaker 2>take the argument you call the speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know a bigger to have some other</v>

3968
02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:56.100
<v Speaker 2>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3969
02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:00.200
<v Speaker 2>what all you pathologize you say that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a gay person with these opinions</v>

3970
02:39:00.201 --> 02:39:03.380
<v Speaker 2>you must either have like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological problem and you get for</v>

3971
02:39:03.390 --> 02:39:06.410
<v Speaker 2>you need therapy or you hate yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your self loathing because of your</v>

3972
02:39:06.411 --> 02:39:09.620
<v Speaker 2>religious upbringing or the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't allow that person the dignity</v>

3973
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:12.680
<v Speaker 2>of having opinions that don't correspond</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their sexuality.</v>

3974
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:16.730
<v Speaker 2>That I think is cheap and it ignores the</v>
<v Speaker 2>messy and complicated reality of human</v>

3975
02:39:16.731 --> 02:39:17.870
<v Speaker 2>sexuality and who people are.</v>

3976
02:39:18.470 --> 02:39:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if somebody thinks that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>a self loathing homosexual.</v>

3977
02:39:21.441 --> 02:39:23.630
<v Speaker 2>What I care about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is telling the truth that other people</v>

3978
02:39:23.631 --> 02:39:26.940
<v Speaker 2>seem to be reluctant to do gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gay establishment and uh,</v>

3979
02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:28.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly doesn't tell the truth about a</v>

3980
02:39:28.971 --> 02:39:30.410
<v Speaker 2>lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't tell the truth about born</v>

3981
02:39:30.411 --> 02:39:31.940
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't tell the truth about HIV.</v>

3982
02:39:31.941 --> 02:39:33.830
<v Speaker 2>They get very upset when you dare to</v>
<v Speaker 2>told,</v>

3983
02:39:34.010 --> 02:39:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this column like you know,</v>

3984
02:39:35.601 --> 02:39:37.390
<v Speaker 2>gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to start donating blood,</v>

3985
02:39:37.391 --> 02:39:39.440
<v Speaker 2>cause most gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people are banned from donating</v>

3986
02:39:39.441 --> 02:39:40.170
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3987
02:39:40.170 --> 02:39:44.990
<v Speaker 2>or at least it's very difficult in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UK and I think the u s too,</v>

3988
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:47.000
<v Speaker 2>and I wrote this column,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you want it to gay people are</v>

3989
02:39:47.001 --> 02:39:49.010
<v Speaker 2>complaining that they're not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>donate blood and they said that it's,</v>

3990
02:39:49.011 --> 02:39:50.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of homophobia,</v>

3991
02:39:50.601 --> 02:39:50.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3992
02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:51.531
<v Speaker 2>I said if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

3993
02:39:51.531 --> 02:39:54.530
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be able to donate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood stopped being sluts.</v>

3994
02:39:54.740 --> 02:39:56.780
<v Speaker 2>The reason that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason the NHS doesn't let you</v>

3995
02:39:56.781 --> 02:39:58.250
<v Speaker 2>donate blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because gay blood is so</v>

3996
02:39:58.251 --> 02:40:00.530
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately more likely to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases in it.</v>

3997
02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:03.290
<v Speaker 2>If you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be allowed to donate</v>

3998
02:40:03.291 --> 02:40:06.560
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop sleeping around and this kind of</v>

3999
02:40:06.561 --> 02:40:09.080
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop sleeping around just so they can</v>

4000
02:40:09.081 --> 02:40:09.950
<v Speaker 2>give other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

4001
02:40:09.951 --> 02:40:11.330
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point was to,</v>

4002
02:40:11.331 --> 02:40:12.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get it,</v>

4003
02:40:12.171 --> 02:40:13.010
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whiners,</v>

4004
02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 2>the winches and the social justice</v>

4005
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:16.710
<v Speaker 3>warriors and handling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point is I don't care if somebody</v>

4006
02:40:16.711 --> 02:40:17.110
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4007
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:18.550
<v Speaker 3>you're still floating homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

4008
02:40:18.551 --> 02:40:20.670
<v Speaker 3>which isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cheap debate tactic.</v>

4009
02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it hasn't really has no meaning</v>

4010
02:40:22.621 --> 02:40:24.600
<v Speaker 3>outside of the fact that the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4011
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:26.110
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't care about being lumped in</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

4012
02:40:26.111 --> 02:40:28.500
<v Speaker 3>with crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If my arguments are sound about a</v>

4013
02:40:28.501 --> 02:40:30.270
<v Speaker 3>particular issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather it wasn't.</v>

4014
02:40:30.271 --> 02:40:31.510
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Auntie Auntie,</v>

4015
02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:33.990
<v Speaker 3>if you say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you come and you say,</v>

4016
02:40:34.170 --> 02:40:36.840
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe in climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in my head I think,</v>

4017
02:40:36.841 --> 02:40:37.621
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

4018
02:40:37.621 --> 02:40:39.750
<v Speaker 3>it can get crazy info wars conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>theorist.</v>

4019
02:40:39.751 --> 02:40:40.890
<v Speaker 3>You're an Alex Jones type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4020
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Who probably thinks vaccines are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy by the government.</v>

4021
02:40:43.890 --> 02:40:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that absurd.</v>

4022
02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:49.350
<v Speaker 3>And in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really mind too much because I</v>

4023
02:40:49.351 --> 02:40:52.020
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think ordinary people,</v>

4024
02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I think many of your fans and certainly</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine are a bit tired of having labels</v>

4025
02:40:57.211 --> 02:40:58.470
<v Speaker 3>applied to them by other people.</v>

4026
02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I think people are a bit tired of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>told what they are that told their</v>

4027
02:41:02.101 --> 02:41:03.450
<v Speaker 3>bigoted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told them a sergeant stick,</v>

4028
02:41:03.451 --> 02:41:04.980
<v Speaker 3>told the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4029
02:41:04.981 --> 02:41:07.590
<v Speaker 3>that there is something else wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them or that they have the wrong</v>

4030
02:41:07.591 --> 02:41:09.480
<v Speaker 3>opinions about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people are a bit sick of that</v>

4031
02:41:09.481 --> 02:41:10.470
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4032
02:41:10.570 --> 02:41:12.800
<v Speaker 3>and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4033
02:41:12.930 --> 02:41:13.860
<v Speaker 3>indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4034
02:41:13.890 --> 02:41:15.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people are a bit bored of that.</v>

4035
02:41:15.061 --> 02:41:17.910
<v Speaker 3>So I'm very relaxed about people calling</v>
<v Speaker 3>me names because I've had it my whole</v>

4036
02:41:17.911 --> 02:41:19.680
<v Speaker 3>career and normally it's a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 3>of telling the truth.</v>

4037
02:41:20.140 --> 02:41:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4038
02:41:21.511 --> 02:41:22.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of articles.</v>

4039
02:41:22.591 --> 02:41:26.010
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>googled it while you were talking about</v>

4040
02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:26.941
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4041
02:41:26.941 --> 02:41:29.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a quote that gets bandied around</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot,</v>

4042
02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:34.320
<v Speaker 3>a 97% of climate scientists agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4043
02:41:34.321 --> 02:41:36.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of fucking articles it</v>

4044
02:41:36.211 --> 02:41:38.970
<v Speaker 3>says that's horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's true.</v>

4045
02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:40.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's ever been true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the 97,</v>

4046
02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that 97% of climate scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>agreeing on climate change is in the</v>

4047
02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:47.670
<v Speaker 3>same category of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4048
02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:50.820
<v Speaker 3>of immortal myth that the campus rape</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

4049
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:52.620
<v Speaker 3>statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those sort of unquestioned,</v>

4050
02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:54.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become a,</v>

4051
02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:56.730
<v Speaker 3>it's become a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fact meme,</v>

4052
02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:57.610
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4053
02:41:57.610 --> 02:42:00.630
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things as uncritically</v>
<v Speaker 3>reported and it's been repeated so many</v>

4054
02:42:00.631 --> 02:42:03.270
<v Speaker 3>times that people don't even feel the</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to us for a citation anymore.</v>

4055
02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:05.430
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hear this stuff about the rape</v>

4056
02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:08.820
<v Speaker 3>rape statistics or the pay gap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people take it,</v>

4057
02:42:08.850 --> 02:42:12.390
<v Speaker 3>it's such an established part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>accepted a statistic.</v>

4058
02:42:12.391 --> 02:42:16.500
<v Speaker 3>Now people's have stopped bothering to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask for evidence to justify it.</v>

4059
02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was ever true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>

4060
02:42:17.831 --> 02:42:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I just 7% well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would know probably better than a</v>

4061
02:42:22.201 --> 02:42:25.710
<v Speaker 3>lot because you were actually there on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front lines and you watched people</v>

4062
02:42:25.711 --> 02:42:30.711
<v Speaker 3>actually fuck with evidence and omit</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and add things and,</v>

4063
02:42:32.250 --> 02:42:32.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4064
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:34.770
<v Speaker 3>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

4065
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:36.360
<v Speaker 3>when you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was all going on,</v>

4066
02:42:36.361 --> 02:42:38.430
<v Speaker 3>like what was the philosophy behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics?</v>

4067
02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:40.260
<v Speaker 3>It's all politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Climate change has never been about</v>

4068
02:42:40.261 --> 02:42:41.520
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always a bit about politics.</v>

4069
02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4070
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:43.441
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

4071
02:42:43.441 --> 02:42:45.540
<v Speaker 3>this is when right wing or sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>sound a bit conspiratorial,</v>

4072
02:42:45.541 --> 02:42:46.101
<v Speaker 3>a bit crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4073
02:42:46.101 --> 02:42:46.511
<v Speaker 3>Won't miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4074
02:42:46.511 --> 02:42:47.500
<v Speaker 3>it's all construction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The liberal.</v>

4075
02:42:47.501 --> 02:42:49.830
<v Speaker 3>So 97% of scientist is a construction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals.</v>

4076
02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Just guests get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4077
02:42:51.150 --> 02:42:55.590
<v Speaker 3>I understand how that conversational</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment comes to happen,</v>

4078
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:59.490
<v Speaker 3>but my more I can tell you is that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was climate change for me as an</v>

4079
02:42:59.491 --> 02:43:02.950
<v Speaker 3>observer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lu for the scientists concern,</v>

4080
02:43:02.951 --> 02:43:06.860
<v Speaker 3>it was primarily a political project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot to do with the,</v>

4081
02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:10.380
<v Speaker 3>the sort of UN global guilt about</v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty and the third world climate</v>

4082
02:43:10.381 --> 02:43:11.950
<v Speaker 3>change was this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to fix everything,</v>

4083
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:13.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going to fix poverty in third</v>

4084
02:43:13.691 --> 02:43:14.620
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4085
02:43:14.621 --> 02:43:16.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's finally addressed the sort of white</v>

4086
02:43:16.751 --> 02:43:18.310
<v Speaker 2>guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all feel and gave them all a real</v>

4087
02:43:18.311 --> 02:43:20.020
<v Speaker 2>reason to feel bad about being who they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

4088
02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4089
02:43:20.890 --> 02:43:22.000
<v Speaker 2>it gave them that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4090
02:43:22.001 --> 02:43:24.220
<v Speaker 2>that sort of terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4091
02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:27.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get it gave them the justification</v>

4092
02:43:27.371 --> 02:43:29.260
<v Speaker 2>to beat up on capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they all hate,</v>

4093
02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:31.130
<v Speaker 2>gave them a justification to beat up on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4094
02:43:31.131 --> 02:43:33.020
<v Speaker 2>a western way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my James Delingpole,</v>

4095
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:36.220
<v Speaker 2>my Breitbach colleague wrote a book</v>
<v Speaker 2>about watermelons green on the outside,</v>

4096
02:43:36.221 --> 02:43:39.100
<v Speaker 2>red on the red on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his point was that his thesis is</v>

4097
02:43:39.101 --> 02:43:39.640
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4098
02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:42.370
<v Speaker 2>dressed up in the language of</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalism and climate change</v>

4099
02:43:42.371 --> 02:43:45.480
<v Speaker 2>concern is actually just socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4100
02:43:45.550 --> 02:43:47.580
<v Speaker 2>anti-capitalism uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of this,</v>

4101
02:43:47.581 --> 02:43:49.060
<v Speaker 2>this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an archaic,</v>

4102
02:43:49.290 --> 02:43:50.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desire to see cds.</v>

4103
02:43:50.830 --> 02:43:55.270
<v Speaker 2>The</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed world burn on the part of very</v>

4104
02:43:55.271 --> 02:43:57.010
<v Speaker 2>politicized scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have to say,</v>

4105
02:43:57.220 --> 02:43:58.690
<v Speaker 2>based on what I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's right.</v>

4106
02:43:59.490 --> 02:44:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still seems like it's a very high</v>

4107
02:44:01.741 --> 02:44:03.660
<v Speaker 1>number when they're breaking down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4108
02:44:03.690 --> 02:44:07.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a skeptical science article</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and they break down the actual</v>

4109
02:44:07.681 --> 02:44:12.681
<v Speaker 1>number of scientists that do believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have something to do with global</v>

4110
02:44:12.721 --> 02:44:14.490
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4111
02:44:14.491 --> 02:44:17.250
<v Speaker 1>ultimately this is a large number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the debate pointless</v>

4112
02:44:17.251 --> 02:44:17.800
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4113
02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:18.310
<v Speaker 1>most of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4114
02:44:18.310 --> 02:44:19.320
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a million,</v>

4115
02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:21.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top point is,</v>

4116
02:44:21.031 --> 02:44:22.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are millions of us</v>

4117
02:44:23.020 --> 02:44:24.850
<v Speaker 2>was about climate change and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with one Google search,</v>

4118
02:44:24.851 --> 02:44:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you can't hope to get anywhere even</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to the truth.</v>

4119
02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:29.650
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any case,</v>

4120
02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:32.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a good idea to get off fossil fuels</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply because going to run out,</v>

4121
02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:34.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a question of energy security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not conservation.</v>

4122
02:44:34.601 --> 02:44:36.940
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for many conservatives who agree</v>

4123
02:44:36.941 --> 02:44:40.480
<v Speaker 2>that we have to find other solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's wind or nuclear or</v>

4124
02:44:40.481 --> 02:44:41.380
<v Speaker 2>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4125
02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just drilling and using up all the oil</v>

4126
02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:46.420
<v Speaker 2>is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4127
02:44:46.421 --> 02:44:47.500
<v Speaker 2>it's going to run out eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4128
02:44:47.501 --> 02:44:48.880
<v Speaker 2>It's going to run out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to better select,</v>

4129
02:44:48.910 --> 02:44:51.400
<v Speaker 2>we need something else in the wings that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can take over.</v>

4130
02:44:51.610 --> 02:44:53.680
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a question of ecology.</v>

4131
02:44:53.681 --> 02:44:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a political question</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

4132
02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:57.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just basic energy security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that we all have what we</v>

4133
02:44:57.551 --> 02:45:00.610
<v Speaker 2>need to survive and that we can all keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lights on.</v>

4134
02:45:00.730 --> 02:45:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4135
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:03.340
<v Speaker 2>so for me it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4136
02:45:03.410 --> 02:45:07.210
<v Speaker 2>there is a heavily politicized and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think primarily political and not</v>

4137
02:45:07.211 --> 02:45:09.470
<v Speaker 2>scientific issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

4138
02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.970
<v Speaker 2>we should in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be pursuing renewable energy because one</v>

4139
02:45:12.971 --> 02:45:15.190
<v Speaker 2>day we're going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with shale gas,</v>

4140
02:45:15.191 --> 02:45:18.070
<v Speaker 2>which is going to fix us for another 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 years or something,</v>

4141
02:45:18.071 --> 02:45:19.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to run out eventually and we</v>

4142
02:45:19.901 --> 02:45:21.070
<v Speaker 2>are going to be around when it does.</v>

4143
02:45:21.350 --> 02:45:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always find it very disturbing when</v>

4144
02:45:23.421 --> 02:45:26.480
<v Speaker 1>people bring up this whole fracking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and they're very dismissive of it.</v>

4145
02:45:26.481 --> 02:45:30.260
<v Speaker 1>That that one freaks me out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolute evidence that they've</v>

4146
02:45:30.350 --> 02:45:33.950
<v Speaker 1>poisoned a lot of wells and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas that people can't live in anymore,</v>

4147
02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:37.700
<v Speaker 1>that it's leaked into river supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's absolute evidence of that.</v>

4148
02:45:37.701 --> 02:45:38.870
<v Speaker 1>And then people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4149
02:45:38.871 --> 02:45:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how cheap the gas is now.</v>

4150
02:45:40.731 --> 02:45:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if you fuck something</v>

4151
02:45:42.921 --> 02:45:45.530
<v Speaker 1>up to the point where it's useless a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand years from now,</v>

4152
02:45:45.531 --> 02:45:48.170
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poisoned to river,</v>

4153
02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you made it,</v>

4154
02:45:49.430 --> 02:45:50.330
<v Speaker 1>supports it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The EPA,</v>

4155
02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:53.000
<v Speaker 1>EPA would say that doesn't mean there</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be any EPA just because they</v>

4156
02:45:53.001 --> 02:45:54.320
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and poisoned the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4157
02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Just because one fracking well fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even three,</v>

4158
02:45:57.860 --> 02:46:02.860
<v Speaker 1>four time fracking or 10 out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand a thousand maybe there needs to</v>

4159
02:46:03.621 --> 02:46:06.080
<v Speaker 1>be better at betting regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they need to do they think maybe</v>

4160
02:46:06.081 --> 02:46:08.780
<v Speaker 1>they need to do it differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the fracking,</v>

4161
02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I have idea actually more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

4162
02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I've been totally out of that climate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Energy stuff years.</v>

4163
02:46:13.820 --> 02:46:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now I'm going to say friendly in</v>

4164
02:46:15.901 --> 02:46:18.030
<v Speaker 3>wells and 100,000 how many million?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4165
02:46:18.031 --> 02:46:19.220
<v Speaker 3>fracking worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're kidding,</v>

4166
02:46:19.221 --> 02:46:20.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In America?</v>

4167
02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:21.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million fracking host in America.</v>

4168
02:46:22.580 --> 02:46:24.320
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4169
02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:27.830
<v Speaker 3>In America they call it possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more than that actually.</v>

4170
02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:31.590
<v Speaker 3>1.1 million active tus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4171
02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm stunned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't understand how my country</v>

4172
02:46:34.461 --> 02:46:36.290
<v Speaker 3>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that case,</v>

4173
02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:36.981
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4174
02:46:36.981 --> 02:46:39.620
<v Speaker 3>you could present hundreds of examples</v>
<v Speaker 3>of poisoned rivers.</v>

4175
02:46:39.621 --> 02:46:42.020
<v Speaker 3>It will still be set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it still will be significantly</v>

4176
02:46:42.021 --> 02:46:45.230
<v Speaker 3>insignificant because [inaudible] still</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs that need to get in.</v>

4177
02:46:45.231 --> 02:46:47.590
<v Speaker 3>If there's 1.1 million of these wells</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're only,</v>

4178
02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:49.160
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there were a hundred scare stories</v>

4179
02:46:49.161 --> 02:46:50.930
<v Speaker 3>in the media every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That hundred is a relatively small</v>

4180
02:46:50.931 --> 02:46:55.040
<v Speaker 3>number if you're looking at statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're the actual human beings</v>

4181
02:46:55.041 --> 02:46:57.200
<v Speaker 3>that live anywhere near the nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

4182
02:46:57.201 --> 02:46:58.640
<v Speaker 3>you could say people die in nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents.</v>

4183
02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:03.140
<v Speaker 3>So let's don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of people do.</v>

4184
02:47:03.141 --> 02:47:05.440
<v Speaker 3>But they were even that many nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually didn't even a,</v>

4185
02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:06.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're are traction.</v>

4186
02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:09.050
<v Speaker 3>There are nuclear accidents in Japan are</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unisex since,</v>

4187
02:47:09.051 --> 02:47:09.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

4188
02:47:09.601 --> 02:47:10.434
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Russia.</v>

4189
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's two and three mile island.</v>

4190
02:47:13.550 --> 02:47:14.383
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

4191
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:15.320
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

4192
02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:16.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably comparable,</v>

4193
02:47:16.410 --> 02:47:18.410
<v Speaker 3>comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparable in numbers of people affected</v>

4194
02:47:18.411 --> 02:47:19.850
<v Speaker 3>to your fracking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4195
02:47:19.851 --> 02:47:22.640
<v Speaker 3>we don't live in a perfect world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to make a risk assessment and a</v>

4196
02:47:22.641 --> 02:47:25.580
<v Speaker 3>judgment and also price comes into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the cost and the amount of the</v>

4197
02:47:25.581 --> 02:47:28.880
<v Speaker 3>benefit to society of getting all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this natural gas right?</v>

4198
02:47:28.881 --> 02:47:31.910
<v Speaker 3>If a couple of rivers of poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we may say that that is the best of a</v>

4199
02:47:31.911 --> 02:47:36.230
<v Speaker 3>bad set of solutions right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of this stuff is perfect because we</v>

4200
02:47:36.231 --> 02:47:38.060
<v Speaker 3>don't live in mud huts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want Nice Shit.</v>

4201
02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:39.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want your cameras,</v>

4202
02:47:39.351 --> 02:47:40.760
<v Speaker 3>you want the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't computers.</v>

4203
02:47:40.761 --> 02:47:44.780
<v Speaker 3>You want to read a producer with seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>buzzing devices next to him that comes</v>

4204
02:47:44.781 --> 02:47:45.770
<v Speaker 3>at a price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4205
02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:48.110
<v Speaker 3>There's an energy cost to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you want that,</v>

4206
02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:50.420
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to get it from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to get the power</v>

4207
02:47:50.421 --> 02:47:52.370
<v Speaker 3>from somewhere and none of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions are going to be,</v>

4208
02:47:52.371 --> 02:47:57.260
<v Speaker 3>things are going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's either drilling for it's Middle</v>

4209
02:47:57.260 --> 02:47:58.250
<v Speaker 3>East oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4210
02:47:58.251 --> 02:47:59.270
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should invade.</v>

4211
02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:01.820
<v Speaker 3>As Ann Coulter said in the country's</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed their leaders,</v>

4212
02:48:01.821 --> 02:48:03.860
<v Speaker 3>convert them to Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which she also said,</v>

4213
02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:05.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she also said,</v>

4214
02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:07.650
<v Speaker 3>who is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And coulters.</v>

4215
02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:09.500
<v Speaker 3>So did you say he also said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4216
02:48:09.501 --> 02:48:10.334
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4217
02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she also said we should invade their</v>

4218
02:48:12.411 --> 02:48:13.940
<v Speaker 3>country's killed the leads and convert</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to Christianity.</v>

4219
02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:18.530
<v Speaker 3>He became a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if she became a trainee and see the</v>

4220
02:48:18.531 --> 02:48:19.660
<v Speaker 3>ankle to whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>become a man.</v>

4221
02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:23.090
<v Speaker 3>She's a beautiful woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you lie to the Ma America,</v>

4222
02:48:23.091 --> 02:48:26.270
<v Speaker 3>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine you are a right wing</v>

4223
02:48:26.271 --> 02:48:27.390
<v Speaker 3>shill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Saddleback church.</v>

4224
02:48:28.090 --> 02:48:32.870
<v Speaker 3>We really are supportive of fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You love circumcision.</v>

4225
02:48:32.871 --> 02:48:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I love ankles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4226
02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:37.940
<v Speaker 3>I think she's tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I do.</v>

4227
02:48:37.941 --> 02:48:40.340
<v Speaker 3>And do you know what I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She falls into the same bucket you do.</v>

4228
02:48:40.341 --> 02:48:41.270
<v Speaker 3>And I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Trump does.</v>

4229
02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:43.070
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4230
02:48:43.071 --> 02:48:45.220
<v Speaker 3>she's not troll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could characterize,</v>

4231
02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:48.920
<v Speaker 3>you could characterize much of what both</v>
<v Speaker 3>of us do is just trolling.</v>

4232
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:52.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't tell me what I do with trolling.</v>

4233
02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Viewers will make up their own judgments</v>

4234
02:48:54.831 --> 02:48:56.570
<v Speaker 3>on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a tome fine.</v>

4235
02:48:56.571 --> 02:48:57.231
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not a trial,</v>

4236
02:48:57.231 --> 02:48:59.270
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I may say inflammatory things,</v>

4237
02:48:59.271 --> 02:49:01.750
<v Speaker 3>but I believe them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to meet you.</v>

4238
02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:04.490
<v Speaker 3>So where do I go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] shit about Mexicans.</v>

4239
02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:09.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she believes that I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to persuade you,</v>

4240
02:49:09.831 --> 02:49:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Kipp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is closest thing we have to</v>

4241
02:49:11.761 --> 02:49:12.600
<v Speaker 3>equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tea party.</v>

4242
02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to persuade Ukip in the UK who</v>
<v Speaker 3>were banned from the pride march because</v>

4243
02:49:15.811 --> 02:49:17.520
<v Speaker 3>of course the leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Houma,</v>

4244
02:49:17.610 --> 02:49:21.390
<v Speaker 3>homosexual establishment are nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not a ruthlessly intolerance of</v>

4245
02:49:21.391 --> 02:49:22.830
<v Speaker 3>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was much more difficult for me to</v>

4246
02:49:22.831 --> 02:49:24.480
<v Speaker 3>come out as a Tory that it wasn't a gay</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

4247
02:49:24.970 --> 02:49:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4248
02:49:26.011 --> 02:49:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Tory being a conservative and much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>just got to come out of the</v>

4249
02:49:28.731 --> 02:49:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that then it must have been gay.</v>

4250
02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing,</v>

4251
02:49:31.471 --> 02:49:32.590
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write me.</v>

4252
02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:35.080
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4253
02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I wanted Ukip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

4254
02:49:36.121 --> 02:49:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I could look at the tea party to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4255
02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:40.200
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4256
02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:43.430
<v Speaker 3>go all dressed in drag as Margaret</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thatcher and have signed,</v>

4257
02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:44.820
<v Speaker 3>we'll have signs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like,</v>

4258
02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:46.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've lost my thread.</v>

4259
02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost my to say we've been talking for</v>

4260
02:49:49.541 --> 02:49:50.340
<v Speaker 3>a very long time.</v>

4261
02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were you talking about?</v>

4262
02:49:52.060 --> 02:49:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay people.</v>

4263
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:57.030
<v Speaker 3>I've lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to the UK and I've lost it.</v>

4264
02:49:57.031 --> 02:49:58.260
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

4265
02:49:58.410 --> 02:49:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I've got,</v>

4266
02:49:59.371 --> 02:50:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a troll.</v>

4267
02:50:00.211 --> 02:50:01.140
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's done.</v>

4268
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:06.190
<v Speaker 3>You were accusing me of trolling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be trollish as quarter.</v>

4269
02:50:06.330 --> 02:50:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Donald Trump is,</v>

4270
02:50:07.770 --> 02:50:09.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I think we can all be trollish and</v>

4271
02:50:09.721 --> 02:50:13.770
<v Speaker 3>it's it being provocative and outrageous</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying things you believe in.</v>

4272
02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4273
02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:16.710
<v Speaker 3>the definition of trolling is expanded</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cover that.</v>

4274
02:50:16.711 --> 02:50:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Now it's become essentially meaningless</v>
<v Speaker 3>word like racist.</v>

4275
02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also dismissal word.</v>

4276
02:50:21.991 --> 02:50:22.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4277
02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:25.560
<v Speaker 3>when someone calls you a sexist or</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone calls you a bigot,</v>

4278
02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:28.020
<v Speaker 3>they'll call you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what we all do,</v>

4279
02:50:28.050 --> 02:50:30.990
<v Speaker 3>all four of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is we say thing,</v>

4280
02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:36.020
<v Speaker 3>we gin up our jokes and our rhetoric and</v>
<v Speaker 3>our provocation to get attention and to</v>

4281
02:50:37.261 --> 02:50:40.820
<v Speaker 3>draw attention perhaps to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessarily offended by things that</v>

4282
02:50:40.821 --> 02:50:42.540
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't be offended by two</v>
<v Speaker 3>idiots.</v>

4283
02:50:42.810 --> 02:50:45.210
<v Speaker 3>But in the course of doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do tell the truth what we really</v>

4284
02:50:45.211 --> 02:50:46.200
<v Speaker 3>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

4285
02:50:46.230 --> 02:50:50.820
<v Speaker 3>you may be the sort of least on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum that probably starts with you</v>

4286
02:50:50.821 --> 02:50:53.310
<v Speaker 3>and ends with Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your probably,</v>

4287
02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:55.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the least trollish but you still do it.</v>

4288
02:50:55.950 --> 02:50:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

4289
02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's part of the countercultural</v>

4290
02:50:59.730 --> 02:51:00.331
<v Speaker 3>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4291
02:51:00.331 --> 02:51:01.170
<v Speaker 3>if people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people,</v>

4292
02:51:01.171 --> 02:51:02.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not part of a right wing</v>

4293
02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:04.590
<v Speaker 3>establishment media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're your own thing.</v>

4294
02:51:04.591 --> 02:51:05.221
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4295
02:51:05.221 --> 02:51:06.130
<v Speaker 3>you fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4296
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I think very squarely into that category</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about earlier.</v>

4297
02:51:07.951 --> 02:51:08.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of,</v>

4298
02:51:09.150 --> 02:51:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I think many of the people who like each</v>
<v Speaker 3>of us,</v>

4299
02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:12.661
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the same,</v>

4300
02:51:12.661 --> 02:51:13.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have,</v>

4301
02:51:13.061 --> 02:51:14.280
<v Speaker 3>we have a big overlap I think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

4302
02:51:14.281 --> 02:51:16.040
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our listeners and fence.</v>

4303
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think we do too.</v>

4304
02:51:17.170 --> 02:51:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trollish in some,</v>

4305
02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:23.580
<v Speaker 3>here's one like what I said earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>about tweeting about male feminists</v>

4306
02:51:23.610 --> 02:51:25.170
<v Speaker 3>choking to death on Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter.</v>

4307
02:51:25.350 --> 02:51:28.710
<v Speaker 3>That's clearly true but offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just strikes me,</v>

4308
02:51:29.090 --> 02:51:30.480
<v Speaker 3>it strikes me as good government policy.</v>

4309
02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just did three hours,</v>

4310
02:51:34.771 --> 02:51:35.551
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

4311
02:51:35.551 --> 02:51:36.384
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

4312
02:51:37.570 --> 02:51:41.880
<v Speaker 3>And we could have done another three</v>
<v Speaker 3>easily when going to come to blows once</v>

4313
02:51:41.881 --> 02:51:46.470
<v Speaker 3>on the gay stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's fun.</v>

4314
02:51:46.471 --> 02:51:49.770
<v Speaker 3>It's fun when people die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got more heated about Christianity</v>

4315
02:51:49.771 --> 02:51:50.820
<v Speaker 3>than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes we did.</v>

4316
02:51:50.821 --> 02:51:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Because you're a militant atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Refused to extend that even an easy,</v>

4317
02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:58.110
<v Speaker 3>except the obvious truth that your your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

4318
02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:01.140
<v Speaker 3>this is where people can't get wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get me wrong.</v>

4319
02:52:01.141 --> 02:52:02.780
<v Speaker 3>I am not an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

4320
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:04.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>

4321
02:52:04.021 --> 02:52:05.030
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>

4322
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:09.550
<v Speaker 1>as anti I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe people,</v>

4323
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I think people are full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I read a story that's full of</v>

4324
02:52:13.001 --> 02:52:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like look at,</v>

4325
02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:16.270
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know too much about the construction</v>

4326
02:52:16.271 --> 02:52:18.190
<v Speaker 1>of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know too much about the new testament.</v>

4327
02:52:18.191 --> 02:52:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I know Constantine and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bishops constructed it and decided what</v>

4328
02:52:22.331 --> 02:52:24.130
<v Speaker 1>to leave out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Constantine didn't even become a</v>

4329
02:52:24.131 --> 02:52:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Christian until right before he fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

4330
02:52:26.321 --> 02:52:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the original Bible was</v>

4331
02:52:28.661 --> 02:52:33.160
<v Speaker 1>written in ancient Hebrew and to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>day there's a fucking shit ton of words</v>

4332
02:52:33.161 --> 02:52:35.590
<v Speaker 1>in ancient Hebrew that they have no idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell they mean.</v>

4333
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they an ancient Hebrew letters double as</v>

4334
02:52:39.071 --> 02:52:40.270
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were no numbers.</v>

4335
02:52:40.271 --> 02:52:44.350
<v Speaker 1>So the letter a was also the number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a numerical value to words and</v>

4336
02:52:44.351 --> 02:52:48.850
<v Speaker 1>sentences that was completely lost in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the translation to Latin and Greek and</v>

4337
02:52:48.851 --> 02:52:49.750
<v Speaker 1>eventually English.</v>

4338
02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I know that you're a well read and</v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate on the subject,</v>

4339
02:52:51.671 --> 02:52:54.280
<v Speaker 1>so let's move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't move on.</v>

4340
02:52:55.610 --> 02:52:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even,</v>

4341
02:52:57.250 --> 02:52:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had so much flat a great,</v>

4342

4344

<v Speaker 1>you can be sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll be back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4346
02:53:08.401 --> 02:53:10.290

<v Speaker 1>could do what?</v>

4347
02:53:10.291 --> 02:53:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I really like it guest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do 180.</v>
