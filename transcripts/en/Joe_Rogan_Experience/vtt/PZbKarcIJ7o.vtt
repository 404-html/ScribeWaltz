00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>What about the idea is that the universe is in a constant state of contraction</v>

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.783
<v Speaker 1>and expansion?</v>

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.721
<v Speaker 1>it's up.</v>

6
00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:11.221
<v Speaker 1>Been abandoned.</v>

7
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Some physicists to argue that it's,</v>

8
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a cycle because it looks nice and they are.</v>

9
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I think most of most people,</v>

10
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some people who were arguing for that,</v>

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.633
<v Speaker 1>trying to take pictures.</v>

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to type their ignorance and something that isn't any more</v>

14
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>plausible in the picture that it expands forever and as far as we can tell,</v>

15
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>the most likely possibilities that are universal expand forever fought to make</v>

16
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>you a little bit happier.</v>

17
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's quite possible.</v>

18
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>The best pictures that we have of our,</v>

19
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.951
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

20
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

21
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>of the early universe is that we actually,</v>

22
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>our universe isn't unique,</v>

23
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.271
<v Speaker 1>isn't alone.</v>

24
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>That there are many universes,</v>

25
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>we call it a multiverse and that at any instant in time and kind of a cosmic</v>

26
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.883
<v Speaker 1>super time,</v>

27
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>there's always university being born so that that multi-verse might be,</v>

28
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>might be infinite and eternal.</v>

29
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Where are they outside of our universe?</v>

30
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>How's that even possible?</v>

31
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.031
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

32
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

33
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.523
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

34
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.393
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:05.424
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

37
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>the simplest possibility is that they're outside the region.</v>

38
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>We can see right for,</v>

39
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

40
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.671
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

41
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>the edge is our visible universe.</v>

42
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Space is expanding faster away from us than light because you know,</v>

43
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>we taught you in school,</v>

44
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>nothing can travel faster than light.</v>

45
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And you may remember that from scratch.</v>

46
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.133
<v Speaker 1>We lied.</v>

47
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.263
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

48
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

49
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to parse it more carefully.</v>

50
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.034
<v Speaker 1>Like a lawyer.</v>

51
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can travel through space faster than light,</v>

52
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>but space can do whatever the hell it wants.</v>

53
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So locally,</v>

54
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:33.181
<v Speaker 1>as I told you though,</v>

55
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:34.014
<v Speaker 1>radio host is,</v>

56
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>is at rest they're not moving.</v>

57
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>And and the other end of the galaxy at the other end of the visible universe and</v>

58
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>we're rest,</v>

59
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>but the space between us is expanding.</v>

60
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>So that galaxy,</v>

61
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>like a surfer is being carried away from us faster than light relative to the</v>

62
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

63
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>The surfer is moving,</v>

64
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>But relative to the shore,</v>

66
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>the surfer is right,</v>

67
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

68
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

70
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>this galaxy is not moving relative to its local surroundings,</v>

71
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's moving away from us faster than light.</v>

72
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>And like a surfer in an undertow,</v>

73
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>they can swim really fast in the water,</v>

74
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but if the water's moving away from the shore,</v>

75
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>they'll never make it back to the shore.</v>

76
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

77
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And so that galaxy,</v>

78
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>the light from that galaxy is traveling through space at the speed of light.</v>

79
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's the space in between us and the galaxies moving faster than light.</v>

80
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Then the poor light can ever make it to us.</v>

81
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>We call that a horizon.</v>

82
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

83
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>So the space is traveling too far for the light to reach us so fast.</v>

84
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>The triple spaces too fast.</v>

85
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So this light can't catch up with the expansion of space and it never gets to</v>

86
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:35.574
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

87
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>And that that galaxy disappears from our causal horizon.</v>

88
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>We call it will never be able to see it.</v>

89
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>We'll never be able to interact with it will never be okay.</v>

90
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And it could be that,</v>

91
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that there are different regions so far away from us.</v>

92
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>We're space is expanding faster than light,</v>

93
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

94
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>which have a very different history than our own.</v>

95
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>So there could be space,</v>

96
00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>could be infinite,</v>

97
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>just our simple unit space that we know of and love could be infinite in extent</v>

98
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>and different regions of that space had different histories and some of those</v>

99
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:09.424
<v Speaker 1>regions,</v>

100
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>everything we can see,</v>

101
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>we know emerged from a single point.</v>

102
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.571
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>We can tell that.</v>

104
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>We can tell that by measuring the big bang expansion of everything we see and</v>

105
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.500
<v Speaker 1>working backwards and the university,</v>

106
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>our visible universe was once smaller and smaller and smaller.</v>

107
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.524
<v Speaker 1>If you go back in time,</v>

108
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>we can actually follow the laws of physics back to the earliest moments of the</v>

109
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>big bang until those laws break down and we can make predictions about the</v>

110
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.634
<v Speaker 1>university would look like.</v>

111
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>All those predictions agree exactly what the observations we make,</v>

112
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>which tells us that that picture works.</v>

113
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>But another region,</v>

114
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.061
<v Speaker 1>if you wish,</v>

115
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>could have come from a different big bang,</v>

116
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>but is that another universe or is it a part of the university?</v>

117
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Here's how we've changed and this is semantics,</v>

118
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>but nontrivial semantics,</v>

119
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>namely when I was a kid,</v>

120
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>universe meant every everything,</v>

121
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

122
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>But we say that's it's pretty stupid definition.</v>

123
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>A better definition is an operational one.</v>

124
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Universe means that region of space with which at one time we could have</v>

125
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>communicated or one time in the future,</v>

126
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>even if the future is infinite,</v>

127
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>we might communicate with,</v>

128
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>because that describes the region of space where cause and effect works some</v>

129
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>measurable distance.</v>

130
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

131
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that are we think of a universe is that region which could throughout</v>

132
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>which everything could affect everything else ultimately in an infinitely long</v>

133
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.644
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

134
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And in that picture,</v>

135
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>universes can be restricted in size.</v>

136
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And then other regions which could never have affected us and which will never</v>

137
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>affect us in the future.</v>

138
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>We call other universes.</v>

139
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

140
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.651
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

141
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

142
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>and now there are many different versions of a multiverse,</v>

143
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but that's the simplest version.</v>

144
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>And this picture we call inflation,</v>

145
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

146
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.004
<v Speaker 1>I talk,</v>

149
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I just did two little clips associated with the new book,</v>

150
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>one force for a publisher and one was for big.</v>

151
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Think one is,</v>

152
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

153
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>the universe and under two minutes.</v>

154
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>So you can look up online,</v>

155
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:57.971
<v Speaker 1>look for Lawrence Krauss,</v>

156
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 1>explains the universe in under two minutes where I talk about this cosmic</v>

157
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>expansion and how it might mean there's a multiverse.</v>

158
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.241
<v Speaker 1>But the other is,</v>

159
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I explained the universe in terms of this beer bottle that I talked about to you</v>

161
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:08.651
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

162
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>

163
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.061
<v Speaker 1>that's a video,</v>

164
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:10.894
<v Speaker 1>you can watch that.</v>

165
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

166
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>this theory of inflation,</v>

167
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>which actually says are universal.</v>

168
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

169
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>the qualities that we see of our universe can best be explained if some early</v>

170
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>time in the history of the universe when it was a billionth of a billionth of a</v>

171
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>billionth of a billionth of a second old.</v>

172
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It had a huge expansion suddenly and increased in size by 30 orders of magnitude</v>

173
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:32.244
<v Speaker 1>in size,</v>

174
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>in a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second.</v>

175
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Which is by the way,</v>

176
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>particle physics suggests is highly plausible even though,</v>

177
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

178
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

179
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.251
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

180
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 1>and then it would produce a university.</v>

181
00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>It looks more or less like we look like you look like and and uh,</v>

182
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.171
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

183
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>and it's right now the only explanation of what of how that would cause the</v>

184
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.654
<v Speaker 1>universe to look like,</v>

185
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like.</v>

186
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But the neat thing about inflation is it's eternal.</v>

187
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>So inflation that puffing up and in our universe and then boom,</v>

188
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:00.891
<v Speaker 1>a hot,</v>

189
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>big bang followed it.</v>

190
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>So the region,</v>

192
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

193
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.140
<v Speaker 1>universe puffed up by huge amount than all of that energy which was stored in</v>

194
00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:07.974
<v Speaker 1>empty space,</v>

195
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>got released like in the beer bottle and we got a hot,</v>

196
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Big Bang and the rest is history,</v>

197
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's locally but somewhere else at between us and their space is still</v>

198
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>expanding exponentially and faster and faster and faster and only maybe</v>

199
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else today.</v>

200
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.891
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

201
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Like an ice crystal forming boom,</v>

202
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>that that region of space is suddenly left inflation and maybe a guilt a</v>

203
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.561
<v Speaker 1>gazillion years in the future,</v>

204
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>they'll be another region of space that's expanding away from a summit much</v>

205
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:36.361
<v Speaker 1>faster than light.</v>

206
00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:37.194
<v Speaker 1>So we'll never know about it.</v>

207
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>We're suddenly that region,</v>

208
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>these inflation and boom,</v>

209
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 1>another hot big bang happens.</v>

210
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out in each of those hot,</v>

211
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.174
<v Speaker 1>big bangs,</v>

212
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>after the inflation ends,</v>

213
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>depending upon how it ends,</v>

214
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>the laws of physics could be different in that universe and that,</v>

215
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>so we tend to think it's quite likely that there are many,</v>

216
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>many separate regions of space.</v>

217
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.351
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

218
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.184
<v Speaker 1>it's eternal.</v>

219
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 1>So such regions or are forming eternally for all time and,</v>

220
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

221
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.111
<v Speaker 1>and there are hot,</v>

222
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>big bangs happening in many regions and the properties of each of those regions,</v>

223
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>whether they're conducive to forming galaxies and stars and planets and people</v>

224
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:13.101
<v Speaker 1>may be different.</v>

225
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>So we could say logically in that picture,</v>

226
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 1>that the reason the universe looks like the way it does is because we're here to</v>

227
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:21.134
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>

228
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.921
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

229
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>we should leave it at that.</v>

230
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>We should close with that.</v>

232
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:29.260
<v Speaker 1>That is the mind blower of glassblowers.</v>

233
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
