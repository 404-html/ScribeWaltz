1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.150
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does Larry David handle it?</v>

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>He's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of,</v>

4
00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:08.014
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

5
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them go through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was,</v>

7
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I saw him become famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>he was on Fridays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He created Seinfeld,</v>

9
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but that still wasn't the fame that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has now.</v>

10
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>So I saw him through curb your</v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm become truly iconic.</v>

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So he's had trouble figuring out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to take a picture of people,</v>

12
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>how do I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always changing.</v>

14
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>He's never an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's truly one of the greatest comedy</v>

15
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 1>shows of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:40.661
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

17
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>100% and I have to say the new season</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about to film in October,</v>

18
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>the storyline may be my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really subtle and fun.</v>

19
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

20
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

21
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I think people watching it will feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're living a fantasy and after</v>

22
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>the first one airs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to come back and talk about</v>

23
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

24
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that premise of where we're</v>

25
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>going is delightful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how hbo gives him sort of carte</v>

26
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:09.004
<v Speaker 1>blanche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

27
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a couple of years off,</v>

28
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

29
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take some pretty great,</v>

30
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>well for Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about the money.</v>

31
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about can I do another good show?</v>

32
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And that makes us different than most</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows in history.</v>

33
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

34
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>he only wants to do good work and enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

36
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise there's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

37
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>an HBO is smart that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're genius.</v>

38
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

39
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>you think about the show soprano's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking game of thrones and now they</v>

40
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.510
<v Speaker 1>know how to let a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a show.</v>

41
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand,</v>

42
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>they give a lot of notes on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>pilots,</v>

43
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>but once you become a series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of leave you alone.</v>

44
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.700
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

45
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:59.701
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you're doing a network show</v>
<v Speaker 1>or from other pay sources,</v>

46
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that the notes never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>when I was on the radio is the easiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to ruin with notes.</v>

48
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Drama can survive notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy cannot because it's like the,</v>

49
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:11.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.850
<v Speaker 1>doing comedies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

51
00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:13.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

52
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominoes and if you take one of</v>

53
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>those and just move it a little to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left to the right,</v>

54
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>you're screwing up the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

55
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise is fucking legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Travolta has done some silly</v>

56
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also,</v>

57
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 2>he's also done pulp fucking fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did carry when he was like really</v>

58
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 2>good after the Saturday night live face</v>
<v Speaker 2>off dude.</v>

59
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 2>He's a very fit and active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a terrible movie face off.</v>

60
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great one.</v>

61
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 2>When they cut the face off and put it</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

62
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>the other person dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Naked impose structure magically</v>

63
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Nick Cage looks like John Travolta,</v>

64
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Tom [inaudible] technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're not terrorist.</v>

65
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>It was no way Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

66
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>What did it happen if Brian put on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think</v>

67
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a monster here.</v>

68
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you head's way bigger.</v>

69
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So your skin a bit like some 60 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady from Bel Air,</v>

70
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>60 year old ladies where their mouth</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like it's so big a key your head,</v>

71
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>cause they've been pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling the skin back to their</v>

72
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>mouth was like the joker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose that in their face as you get</v>

73
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember you used to make fun of me</v>

74
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>for taking an acting class and I stayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

75
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>That didn't last for eight years longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I needed to because I love a train</v>

76
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these two guys did a seed.</v>

77
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey tambor was teaching and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>two guys did a scene from faceoff and</v>

78
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>the curtain comes up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one guy is hanging from a chain and</v>

79
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>the other guy's torturing him and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

80
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

81
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all,</v>

82
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and he's hitting him and it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the scenes like scene,</v>

83
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.150
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jeffrey Tambor,</v>

84
00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>it just takes a sip of his coffee and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

85
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>what was that scene?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy goes,</v>

86
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.620
<v Speaker 1>face off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>face off.</v>

87
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a movie.</v>

88
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.350
<v Speaker 1>It's an action movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Travolta in an occasion.</v>

89
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scene as band forever.</v>

90
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Cook a man</v>

92
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 2>is desperate for acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approval,</v>

93
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 2>and affection from women.</v>

94
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

95
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 2>This desperation has led to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise of his beliefs and values.</v>

96
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 2>The desecration of his dignity and self</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth and its inability to stand up for</v>

97
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's four Chan,</v>

98
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:38.014
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

99
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>and what he deserves it.</v>

100
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Human being example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loyalty,</v>

101
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.130
<v Speaker 2>fidelity and honesty in a romantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

102
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

103
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the example.</v>

104
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>The game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>

105
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I know John's always wanted a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>

106
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 2>but since him and Mary started dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's become a cock.</v>

107
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.860
<v Speaker 2>She spends all of his money and flirts</v>
<v Speaker 2>openly without openly with other men.</v>

108
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 2>I can tell it bothers him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so afraid of losing her that he</v>

109
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>doesn't say</v>

110
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 3>anything that's a cook.</v>

111
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a male feminist also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't believe you went there?</v>

112
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

113
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The male feminist thing,</v>

114
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known a few that were real creeps</v>

115
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 2>that were fake creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

116
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 2>they're like on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

117
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

118
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing was there,</v>

119
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.353
<v Speaker 3>there</v>

120
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.620
<v Speaker 2>posturing as an alternative to these men</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't want monogamous relationships</v>

121
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 2>or would break the woman's heart or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to compromise and bend to the</v>

122
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 2>will of the woman and that they put</v>
<v Speaker 2>these women on a platform and worship</v>

123
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 2>these women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I am the alternative and I'm the</v>

124
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 2>powerful alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these men are assholes,</v>

125
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.950
<v Speaker 2>and then they try to shit on those men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take those.</v>

126
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 2>But all it does is make those appear</v>
<v Speaker 2>even more attractive to these women.</v>

127
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Secretly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men,</v>

128
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>these feminists men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these women have these weird</v>

129
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 2>relationships where it doesn't work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're never sexual,</v>

130
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>or if they are a sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women aren't really sexually</v>

131
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 2>attracted to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they withhold sex and it just,</v>

132
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 2>it gets super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

133
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I just generalize a lot about giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people's relationships,</v>

134
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>but what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

135
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't run fast.</v>

136
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 2>They can't pick things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not attractive.</v>

137
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 2>So they tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little weasels to trying to find</v>

138
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.140
<v Speaker 2>another way in.</v>

139
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:35.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think men who,</v>

141
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.010
<v Speaker 4>not all men who call themselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>feminists are male feminists.</v>

142
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.000
<v Speaker 4>So in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think men who ascribed to women being</v>

143
00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 4>equal at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good thing.</v>

144
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of guys will say,</v>

145
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:47.770
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm feminist because they think that's</v>

146
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:50.430
<v Speaker 4>the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the socially acceptable thing and</v>

147
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.120
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way we should be.</v>

148
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 4>But then the ones who run around and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

149
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

150
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:59.650
<v Speaker 4>really push it and make that their</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity and really sell themselves as</v>

151
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 4>male feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the guys I have an issue with</v>

152
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:03.790
<v Speaker 4>because like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sneaky.</v>

153
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They and they know what they're doing.</v>

154
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.360
<v Speaker 4>They're not being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

155
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>well you could almost always tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see them.</v>

156
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

157
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.850
<v Speaker 2>they're a type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:17.740
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're an unattractive type.</v>

159
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.790
<v Speaker 2>They're not attractive to women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'd try to figure out a way like,</v>

160
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:24.480
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it going to be the way you've got</v>

161
00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 2>to figure out a way to stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way I'm going to just what,</v>

162
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.530
<v Speaker 2>what are these women want to hear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to hear that.</v>

163
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Egalitarians great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

165
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.990
<v Speaker 2>someone who believes in equality is</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

166
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.270
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you istat like your</v>
<v Speaker 2>proclaiming yourself to be more</v>

167
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:45.271
<v Speaker 2>interested in the opposite gender and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more supportive of them,</v>

168
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 2>then males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even though you are a male,</v>

169
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be a red flag.</v>

170
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant red flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be into humans.</v>

171
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I like people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people I like,</v>

172
00:07:57.821 --> 00:07:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm straight.</v>

173
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I like people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like when they're nice.</v>

174
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 2>You're nice to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm nice to you.</v>

175
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to get discriminated</v>

176
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:07.180
<v Speaker 2>against in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

177
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't want to pretend that one</v>

178
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.030
<v Speaker 2>group is better than other groups</v>

179
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.863
<v Speaker 5>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

180
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 5>if he'd had no makeup on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no money in King Lewin who Sacha Baron</v>

181
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 5>Cohen is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean?</v>

182
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 5>The crazy thing is these people must</v>
<v Speaker 5>have had to sign releases.</v>

183
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I did hidden camera shit,</v>

184
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 5>so I know how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

185
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 5>I've done that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did they get those two ways?</v>

186
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 5>There's money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is always the best way.</v>

187
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.810
<v Speaker 5>And you make them sign before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

188
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.431
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

189
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 5>there's two ways to get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way.</v>

190
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd make them sign,</v>

191
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be featuring you on the,</v>

192
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 5>say we did this bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ian Edwards and I did this bit for</v>

193
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 5>comedy central for the show that never</v>
<v Speaker 5>went.</v>

194
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I've ever told you this,</v>

195
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 5>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this bit was so fun to do.</v>

196
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 5>We made a thing called Melanin Mayo</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mayonnaise,</v>

<v Speaker 5>mayonnaise that she,</v>

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 5>And we put food coloring in mail.</v>

201
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 5>And so we got people in this test group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know that real people in a real test</v>

202
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:04.920

<v Speaker 5>time and they emanate sample shit.</v>

203
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 5>We put them in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we made them eat the sandwiches,</v>

<v Speaker 5>sandwiches.</v>

206

<v Speaker 5>I'm black.</v>

236
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 5>It's like the funny to watch him go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not as bad as you're making it out</v>

237
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:20.851
<v Speaker 5>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

238
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was born black and I'm liking it a</v>

239
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one woman goes,</v>

240
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's disturbing because it's shocking</v>

241
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 5>just to spring this on me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>

242
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not scared I could take on being</v>

243
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.431
<v Speaker 5>black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just,</v>

244
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

245
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 5>we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

246
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 5>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn credits.</v>

247
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.461
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll just,</v>

248
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 5>I'll just live with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll just figure this out,</v>

249
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:41.124
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

250
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 5>it was insane that they bought into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also that that's how we did it.</v>

251
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.880
<v Speaker 5>We fucking made him sign beforehand and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you pay them out and when it's</v>

252
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 5>over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we broke them off more money.</v>

253
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 5>So they wouldn't say no because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>still have the legal right to be like,</v>

254
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm pulling that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pull it or I'm suing you.</v>

255
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 5>So once it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they understand that it was for</v>

256
00:10:57.361 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 5>comedy central after,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after everything was said and done,</v>

257
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 5>and then do they laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few did not laugh.</v>

258
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 5>You laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few people were not good.</v>

259
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 5>But that was one of my favorite bits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Melon and Mayo and man,</v>

260
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 5>did it work like a charm?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were like,</v>

261
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 5>this man needs is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking Hellman's or whatever</v>

262
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.610
<v Speaker 5>with a little brown dye in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's unconventional,</v>

263
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 5>but I really like</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's so stupid.</v>

264
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:32.890
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible].</v>
