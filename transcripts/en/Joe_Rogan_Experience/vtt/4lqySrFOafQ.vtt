2
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:10.180
<v Speaker 1>entire day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I saw eight operations when I was a</v>

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.023
<v Speaker 1>freshman in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the illusion that I would be a </v>

<v Speaker 1>be a doctor,</v>

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.390

6
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:21.224
<v Speaker 1>a Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville and so I </v>

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.053
<v Speaker 1>without Jamie on the computer and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking questions and no one ever </v>

73
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>answered the questions we just said it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 100 percent misinformation.</v>

74
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it was like this.</v>

75
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Jamie.</v>

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.530
<v Speaker 1>She really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are fucking unbelievable.</v>

79
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Push them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like trash.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Five minutes left on this video.</v>

81
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a damn thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just had a baby.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The stuff coming out.</v>

85
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.963
<v Speaker 1>That's the gnarly parts or why she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it that obviously I'm not a </v>

86
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not criticizing her technique,</v>

87
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.323
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder why you have to take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunk out of the skin and less instead </v>

88
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>of like making like a little hatch.</v>

95
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>that they don't actually know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes cysts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they had her in some way where they </v>

119
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:08.174
<v Speaker 1>could push back and you could see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of the side coming like on </v>

120
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>the wall in a speculum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they opened her up.</v>

121
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gnarly.</v>

122
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Wonder if it really had fluid though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that.</v>

123
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really was like a stream coming out.</v>

124
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to be disrespectful,</v>

125
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but do you think it made her pussy </v>
<v Speaker 1>tighter?</v>

126
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a wood.</v>

127
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.753
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you had it in your mouth and be </v>

129
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>sure tough to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if you got it in your box.</v>

130
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how they said snug it up.</v>

131
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>David discovered it because her husband </v>
<v Speaker 1>was tight.</v>

132
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

133
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

134
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

135
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.590
<v Speaker 1>that 85 percent.</v>
