00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.450
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live sort of sorta.</v>

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're rolling.</v>

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>We're rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're rolling.</v>

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>We're rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dog.</v>

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>so we were talking about the game we </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped because we figured it's probably</v>

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>be good for the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ari finally paid off the bat.</v>

9
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I paid it off in a big way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

10
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>in a big way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>so if you remember when we were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight loss challenge,</v>

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>it was like whoever wins decides the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sporting event,</v>

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>we're all sports fans basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said at the time I was like,</v>

15
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>let's go see Barcelona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I wanted to say Barcelona,</v>

16
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>play Paris in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>some tournament cups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some channel,</v>

18
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>a tournament that they were playing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

19
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of the premier teams and it'd be fun</v>

20
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>to go to Europe and make already pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

21
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

22
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>So I told him that and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to like fucking Malaysia.</v>

23
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And he just left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I never heard from him again.</v>

24
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Then four months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it all,</v>

25
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>it all played out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he got back,</v>

26
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:06.114
<v Speaker 1>he was getting fucking slammed by people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was supposed to pay up this </v>

27
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.394
<v Speaker 1>bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and people were destroying him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

30
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.311
<v Speaker 1>they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well true,</v>

31
00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>you're a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably worse than that.</v>

32
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.103
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we got,</v>

34
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>we got to like hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we did the sober October thing,</v>

35
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just like,</v>

36
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>right before that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like,</v>

37
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.453
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

38
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.040

<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>

39
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.091
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

40
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about I go,</v>

41
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.110

42
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pick the event.</v>

43
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big college football fan.</v>

44
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the national championship </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

45
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.203
<v Speaker 1>in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of 2013 season 2014 Fsu and </v>

47
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Auburn played in the rosebowl out here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Burton Fsu alum.</v>

48
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big FSU fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

49
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember that we met,</v>

50
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like we kind of somebody who had </v>

51
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>student because they both always win the</v>
<v Speaker 1>national championship.</v>

52
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>They allow students to go to the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>for pretty expensive,</v>

53
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 1>much less than the general public can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

54
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.143
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want students have the </v>

55
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:17.151
<v Speaker 1>ability to go to see their school play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got like student tickets for,</v>

56
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:18.624
<v Speaker 1>I think they were three slash 50 each </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty expensive especially </v>

57
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>for a student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember burt treated me.</v>

58
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:25.044
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bought the ticket for me and we went </v>

59
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:27.504
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that game and he left that fucking </v>

60
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>halftime of the national championship </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

61
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Why'd he leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

62
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to see the kids had been drinking.</v>

63
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.173
<v Speaker 1>He left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one of the best players left </v>

64
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you there yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were sitting in separate sections,</v>

65
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking.</v>

66
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.140

67
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>so you were by yourself and he was by </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself?</v>

68
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

69
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.553
<v Speaker 1>When he knew more people at the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of his friends that he </v>

70
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>went to school with were at the game </v>

<v Speaker 1>the lead just like swung.</v>

73
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at home.</v>

74
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I gave him shit for it.</v>

77
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.953
<v Speaker 1>I still give them shit for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ended up being just this amazing </v>

78
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

79
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.880
<v Speaker 1>when I tell red I want to go to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kinda thinking that's the ballpark.</v>

80
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Like because that's the only experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

81
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So the games in Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he buys tickets and I'm like,</v>

82
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not flying me coach,</v>

83
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

84
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go first bird rookies,</v>

85
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.630
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't work as coach.</v>

86
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give them a seat bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>extension.</v>

87
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But burden ended up going from somewhere</v>

88
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:31.841
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

89
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>he bought the ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got an Airbnb,</v>

90
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.790
<v Speaker 1>a really nice house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>for a few days in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a,</v>

92
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big thing is game day.</v>

93
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's cool that you got these </v>

94
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>tickets and you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.440
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we get to the stadium.</v>

96
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>It was a total fucking disaster to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in because trump went to the game.</v>

97
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.363
<v Speaker 1>So it was raining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was wet secret service everywhere to </v>

98
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>our lines to get into the venue and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid a guy,</v>

99
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>a security guy 100 bucks to walk us </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the line,</v>

100
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.154
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was almost impossible because it </v>

101
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>was so packed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno,</v>

102
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>he just started walking us through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

103
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>like in front of people.</v>

104
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>People were yelling at the security guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like so uncomfortable.</v>

105
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>He's like a young black kid and like old</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people,</v>

106
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

107
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

111
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.550

<v Speaker 1>What we were doing was highly unethical.</v>

112
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.384
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like we just weren't going to wait </v>

113
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>in that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then burt,</v>

114
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bird in a crowd like that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

192
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.080

<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

193
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just buys.</v>

201
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:07.684
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

202
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel he was either a museum or a hotel</v>

<v Speaker 1>do you want to read this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay or not?</v>

243
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

246
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.113
<v Speaker 1>I support paying for journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I should give us a </v>

247
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:02.090
<v Speaker 1>taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

248
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.003
<v Speaker 1>we could get a little taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to trust journalism these </v>

249
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.743
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to trust like how fucking </v>

250
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>weird or your article's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

251
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journalism was tough.</v>

252
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Watching news has become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

253
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I remember when it started to skew to </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and taste.</v>

254
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is off the rails.</v>

255
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.450
<v Speaker 1>That's where the money is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

256
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you were totally just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going with who?</v>

257
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.493
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can select what do I feel like </v>

258
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>leaning towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you watch that.</v>

259
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Tucker Carlson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

260
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.410

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rachel maddow theory is.</v>

262
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 1>That's that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

263
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

264
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 1>He looks nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's what 105 billion will do.</v>

265
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.820
<v Speaker 1>He's just sitting there with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.com banner.</v>

266
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's still hanging somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his house.</v>

267
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably shoots loads on that.</v>

268
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

269
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy that he started out.</v>

270
00:11:03.021 --> 00:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I remember Amazon being a book thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.473
<v Speaker 1>I remember being a place to buy books </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember thinking how weird like </v>

272
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.104
<v Speaker 1>an online bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you just go to the </v>

273
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>bookstore store where you could see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

274
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.393
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

275
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.340
<v Speaker 1>and all those bookstores shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She like,</v>

276
00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>they closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's only a few left.</v>

277
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who got a deal with </v>

278
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:24.234
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.com to publish a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when Amazon started publishing </v>

279
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 1>books and they blackballed him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

280
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 1>because he had had a traditional outlet </v>
<v Speaker 1>deals before and you know,</v>

281
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>his books would be front and center in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Barnes,</v>

282
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:40.840
<v Speaker 1>noble and all those other different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

283
00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:44.080
<v Speaker 1>He's a pretty popular author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you went to Amazon.com,</v>

284
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>they're like fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just shut them out.</v>

285
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.470
<v Speaker 1>They shut him out of all those stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.510
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

287
00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like a weird book war going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that I didn't know about.</v>

288
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.850
<v Speaker 1>They're both probably try mean</v>

289
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.903
<v Speaker 2>those book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were trying to keep their </v>

290
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 2>business model going and thriving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

291
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>And he wasn't doing it by threats is </v>
<v Speaker 2>never the way to go.</v>

292
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

293
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean the best way to go is when Amazon</v>
<v Speaker 2>publishes a book that people actually </v>

294
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 2>want to buy in your store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dumb fuck shirt and your store.</v>

295
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 2>You know what I hate about these?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A super rich guys.</v>

296
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 2>They'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never in their interviews have like</v>

297
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.100
<v Speaker 2>the only one who will talk like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like to ball at that level and make</v>

298
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:18.934
<v Speaker 2>it sound fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the things you want to ask is </v>

299
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Mark Cuban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him in interviews be like,</v>

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.033

<v Speaker 2>Like that's a genuine curiosity for </v>

305

<v Speaker 2>but I saw this interview with gates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was asking all those questions.</v>

306
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.513
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to worry about like when </v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of that is even </v>
<v Speaker 2>true because this guy seemed like he was</v>

351
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:43.321
<v Speaker 2>missing a little piece of his brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>start really adding stuff to it.</v>

352
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of this is urban myth?</v>

353
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I know that they were reporting even </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

354
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when that house was built </v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

355
00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>15 or whatever years ago</v>

356
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 1>that even back then there was shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his house because it was super high tech</v>

357
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 1>of like if you walk in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music would play as you left the room.</v>

358
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Music would die down and pick up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next room so that you know,</v>

359
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>it had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think you could probably regular</v>

360
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>person could probably do something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that now,</v>

361
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.813
<v Speaker 1>but that was unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you wore a pin him pin on and </v>

362
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 1>that pen as you walked into different </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms,</v>

363
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:22.691
<v Speaker 1>recognize that you were the person so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had specific colors that you liked,</v>

364
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 1>so they'd be like backlighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his kids.</v>

365
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.483
<v Speaker 1>He's big on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the one that started that giving </v>

366
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:32.144
<v Speaker 1>pledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is for billionaires to give the </v>

367
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.593
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming majority of their wealth to</v>
<v Speaker 1>charity so that you don't pass on </v>

368
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>billions to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

369
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.110
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his thing is like,</v>

370
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave my kids money but not</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy that money.</v>

371
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.281
<v Speaker 1>Which you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

372
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:49.821
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:54.821
<v Speaker 1>I totally get the idea behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also like if you grew up with his,</v>

374
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're his kid and you're like,</v>

375
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 1>oh there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got lions this year.</v>

376
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

377
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:06.350
<v Speaker 1>you grow up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a photographer now.</v>

378
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.323
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad left me $5,000,000 but like </v>

379
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000 is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

380
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:12.584
<v Speaker 1>But my thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a step down from what they're </v>

381
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:16.394
<v Speaker 1>used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel even remotely bad for some </v>

382
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.513
<v Speaker 1>fucking kid who gets $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars from ms dot don't feel </v>

383
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:22.544
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that that adjustment </v>

384
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 1>has to kick you in the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

385
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the exposure that they've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lifestyle is like,</v>

386
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfathomable to us.</v>

387
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Like we can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond.</v>

388
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 1>They're just like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like being the prince,</v>

389
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your dad's assaulting a Brunei</v>

390
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.610
<v Speaker 1>and then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well go fuck him.</v>

391
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably,</v>

392
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>well just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I assumed that,</v>

393
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but I think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

394
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.583
<v Speaker 1>he and his wife seem like such </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people that I bet they've </v>

395
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.930
<v Speaker 1>prepared them for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

396
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.230
<v Speaker 1>for what's coming while they've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to make it on their own</v>

397
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>and how do you get a kid to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tough,</v>

398
00:16:56.751 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

399
00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 1>how do you get a kid to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>

400
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.570
<v Speaker 1>who's grown up like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.643
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about that with your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as you're starting to ball out of </v>

402
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:05.960
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

403
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I think about it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

404
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:08.444
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

405
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 1>and then like had to not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you want to prepare your kid for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then how does,</v>

407
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 1>how will a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

408
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe especially a boy's aligned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their dads usually in a certain way,</v>

409
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kid compares himself to you and </v>

410
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>your success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want them to feel like,</v>

411
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.280
<v Speaker 1>he's less than in your shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

413
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Especially like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if he goes into comedy.</v>

414
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you thought about if your daughters</v>

415
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 1>were to go with my seven year old's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

416
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.220
<v Speaker 1>She's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does she ever like,</v>

417
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:44.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she like,</v>

418
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 1>does she know what the fuck comedy is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

419
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>she just knows how to be silly and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen me on TV doing it.</v>

420
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Not</v>

421
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.220
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

422
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 3>She flipped through Netflix and makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun of me.</v>

423
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

424
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

425
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Nice jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad starts mocking me.</v>

426
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

427
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 3>She's just ruthlessly funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes after a seven year old.</v>

428
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Is the younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

429
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 3>she goes after it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going after jokes.</v>

430
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.240
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

431
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 3>She's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's really funny.</v>

432
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 3>But I see her becoming like a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>character or something.</v>

433
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

434
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.520
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>them not feeling,</v>

435
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by your success or status?</v>

436
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think about that?</v>

437
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it's less likely because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

438
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

439
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.700
<v Speaker 3>I was actually having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Neil Brennan about this last night.</v>

440
00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:33.380
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about another famous </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

441
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him that well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I won't use his name,</v>

442
00:18:36.021 --> 00:18:41.021
<v Speaker 3>but he has a Tucson's and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least one daughter.</v>

443
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.000
<v Speaker 3>The daughter is highly motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not worried about it at all.</v>

444
00:18:44.001 --> 00:18:45.680
<v Speaker 3>She kicks ass in school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's awesome.</v>

445
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.843
<v Speaker 3>The sons are fucking insanely lazy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just sit around and they know that </v>

446
00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:50.594
<v Speaker 3>when they turn 26,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get a giant check and they're 25 </v>

447
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:59.060
<v Speaker 3>now and boy they don't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's civil super worried about it.</v>

448
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be able to do,</v>

449
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

450
00:19:01.871 --> 00:19:04.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a nightmare man.</v>

451
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

452
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to actually do something if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to.</v>

453
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.590
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make something happen in your life,</v>

454
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To start a business,</v>

455
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.320
<v Speaker 3>to enter into a career and become </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful at it,</v>

456
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.163
<v Speaker 3>to really focus and try to get good to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where you're successful at </v>

457
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.100
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a fire inside of you.</v>

458
00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:26.934
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a need to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you already have a Ferrari and </v>

459
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:31.074
<v Speaker 3>you're already living in a mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already have $10,000,000 in the </v>

460
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 3>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You already have all your bills paid.</v>

461
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:37.734
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to get up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't want to get the idea of </v>

462
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.963
<v Speaker 3>just becoming this discipline machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there to try to kick ass in this </v>

463
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 3>life and be self actualized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So hard,</v>

464
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 3>so hard to pull off.</v>

465
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>You got to like dial back to on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoiling.</v>

466
00:19:53.811 --> 00:19:58.811
<v Speaker 1>I think I went to high school with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand son of a billionaire and they were</v>

467
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:02.960
<v Speaker 1>very present in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

469
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.680
<v Speaker 1>they drove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used cars,</v>

470
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.993
<v Speaker 1>the grandkids I'm saying and had </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously they could have gotten way </v>

471
00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:13.910
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like instilling this.</v>

472
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:19.270
<v Speaker 1>You're not just going to coast through </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and they got jobs and uh,</v>

473
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.260
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know about now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing now is like,</v>

474
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.340
<v Speaker 1>he's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really working,</v>

475
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.400
<v Speaker 1>even though he's gonna inherit like just</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy amounts of money,</v>

476
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

477
00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:32.900
<v Speaker 1>part of it too is just the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>

478
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I think you can try to not go crazy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

479
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of them gifts and all that </v>

480
00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:40.094
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of that drive has to come from </v>

481
00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:45.170
<v Speaker 1>within no matter what your socioeconomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>level is.</v>

482
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine some of it.</v>

483
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I think there's people that are grow up </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich that it doesn't matter.</v>

484
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

485
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 2>they're going to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

486
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.310
<v Speaker 2>They like succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like working hard.</v>

487
00:20:57.311 --> 00:20:58.144
<v Speaker 2>They like getting things done within.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like what causes a kid to be a </v>

488
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 2>lazy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

489
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:04.324
<v Speaker 2>like you come home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids on the couch just with their </v>

490
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:08.590
<v Speaker 2>feet up and they don't do what I asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to do.</v>

491
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But something happened.</v>

492
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.783
<v Speaker 2>Mike called and fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people like cars and gas and I </v>

493
00:21:15.991 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Speaker 2>think there's something wrong with just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

494
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I know people like that who you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shake the fuck is wrong with you,</v>

495
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of times they just,</v>

496
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they fear doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

497
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:26.790
<v Speaker 2>They're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're scared.</v>

498
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 2>What if I do something and I suck at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely that.</v>

500
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.940
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you see that in a lot of,</v>

501
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

502
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.050
<v Speaker 3>amateur comics that are sort of starting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it into comedy?</v>

503
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see like a lot of like sabotage.</v>

504
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.203
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that stress of you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing open mic nights and then all of a </v>

505
00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:49.194
<v Speaker 3>sudden you starting to get paid and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people start moving forward and </v>

506
00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:54.080
<v Speaker 3>other people get left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

507
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.610
<v Speaker 3>remember those days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I remember thinking like,</v>

508
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.061
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

509
00:21:57.061 --> 00:21:59.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people here that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sabotaging themselves.</v>

510
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.473
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the stress of [inaudible] stand up </v>

511
00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:04.584
<v Speaker 3>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so open ended like you could make of it </v>

512
00:22:06.931 --> 00:22:09.060
<v Speaker 3>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put in as much as you want.</v>

513
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.830
<v Speaker 3>You either can be successful or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>depending upon how much you focus on it,</v>

514
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.693
<v Speaker 3>how much talent you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much drive and discipline you have </v>

515
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.160
<v Speaker 3>in a couple of breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple breaks.</v>

516
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.003
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of factors and sometimes those </v>

517
00:22:21.961 --> 00:22:22.794
<v Speaker 3>factors are just too overwhelming to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people and see them just start </v>

518
00:22:25.741 --> 00:22:26.574
<v Speaker 3>tanking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're drinking at the store every </v>

519
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.081
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

520
00:22:28.081 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

521
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's scary.</v>

522
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.780
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

523
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I remember when people handle it </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

524
00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember the people who'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

525
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.980
<v Speaker 2>they would just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

526
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't going to work out.</v>

527
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know why we're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

528
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Those people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

531
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:49.603

<v Speaker 2>But they do in that just to sort of </v>

532
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:55.530
<v Speaker 2>eliminate that pain of failing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>money doing this.</v>

543
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.430
<v Speaker 2>I remember that a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't make any money doing</v>

544
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:16.630
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

545
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make any money right now.</v>

546
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you're not going to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>money later.</v>

547
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.450
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to get to later?</v>

548
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no money now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

549
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost this weird.</v>

550
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the development deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

551
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Were you around during the development </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal in detail?</v>

552
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 2>And I was at the where they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

553
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.603
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago you would make $600,000 </v>

554
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:35.914
<v Speaker 2>for that same Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there for the development deal </v>

555
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of was working during.</v>

556
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:44.464
<v Speaker 2>Most of it was during most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing news radio when it got </v>

557
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.013
<v Speaker 2>really hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing news news radio and I </v>

558
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 2>remember that there were comics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go to Montreal.</v>

559
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.313
<v Speaker 2>They would do the comedy festival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have these sets and they </v>

560
00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 2>would come back and they had half a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar deals and they were,</v>

561
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:01.964
<v Speaker 2>there was sitcoms and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that it was all fucking </v>

562
00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:05.504
<v Speaker 2>happening for them and I remember I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite more than one conversation with </v>

563
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:10.424
<v Speaker 2>one of these people that we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put me on their show comics that have </v>

564
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.770
<v Speaker 2>never worked since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do not hear from them bro.</v>

565
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 2>My shows guaranteed is what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

566
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.020
<v Speaker 2>It's guaranteed go to air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't go there.</v>

567
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.923
<v Speaker 2>There's a million dollar backup deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they had all this stuff that they </v>

568
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:26.654
<v Speaker 2>were telling you about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they went the opposite way instead </v>

569
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:32.920
<v Speaker 2>of like being like terrified of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future to the point where they were just</v>

570
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.973
<v Speaker 2>letting themselves off the hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were super confident in this weird </v>

571
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 2>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely happened for me thing.</v>

572
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Odd Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.280

<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

574
00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 2>That would always scare me because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

575
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.423
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my just more life perspective is like </v>

576
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't react until the check clears.</v>

577
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

578
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.610
<v Speaker 2>And every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

579
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't go like that's definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

580
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always like wait and see.</v>

581
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Well those people that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting because they.</v>

582
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.260
<v Speaker 2>None of them made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

583
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 2>None of them and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced,</v>

584
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.950
<v Speaker 2>but it was a weird convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like if you what?</v>

585
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.540
<v Speaker 2>You're not even that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I wanted to tell him.</v>

586
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Like you got lucky man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a pretty.</v>

587
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:17.024
<v Speaker 2>You're Kinda cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a pretty decent set in front of </v>

588
00:25:19.821 --> 00:25:20.654
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very willing crowd and someone took a </v>

589
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:26.930
<v Speaker 2>chance on you because people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a nutty time.</v>

590
00:25:26.931 --> 00:25:27.764
<v Speaker 2>I guess we should describe it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a nutty time where they were </v>

591
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:31.364
<v Speaker 2>just chucking around development deals </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a regular person who probably had </v>

592
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 2>no business being on stage.</v>

593
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.090
<v Speaker 2>You get $100,000 development deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I literally just missed that.</v>

595
00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they said that the last big one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they talked about was like,</v>

596
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 2>oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

597
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the last big six figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>development deals,</v>

598
00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 2>which is basically you go to Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the just for laughs.</v>

599
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.620

601
00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.080

<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

602
00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were signing people up with those </v>

603
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:02.864
<v Speaker 2>checks and we literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went in the o seven new faces class </v>

607
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.440
<v Speaker 2>failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a record.</v>

608
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.950
<v Speaker 2>There was like a tallying of like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

<v Speaker 2>came of it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went from being fucking broke,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

630
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>were you like,</v>

633
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.803
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got 100 the first time and then there </v>

634
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:19.500
<v Speaker 3>was a second part of it where I got 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>

635
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating lobster every night.</v>

636
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Then you say that your accountant </v>
<v Speaker 3>manager,</v>

637
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 3>he thought I had a gambling problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So funny.</v>

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

641
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 3>How are you spending so much money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

642
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm just spending money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

643
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 3>this is how I'm going to live from now </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

644
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

645
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 3>that is the stupidest fucking thing I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever heard in my life.</v>

646
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Why I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

647
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 3>because I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

648
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just took a chance.</v>

649
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so cool.</v>

650
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.530
<v Speaker 3>It could have turned out terribly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

651
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.513
<v Speaker 3>the thing that was weird about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the most incredible thing was </v>

652
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 3>that once I started working and wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>the money,</v>

653
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.703
<v Speaker 3>the check came in and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to think about my bills </v>

654
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a physical feeling of relief,</v>

655
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.530
<v Speaker 3>like a physical feeling of relief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

656
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.313
<v Speaker 3>To go from being broke and have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you're going to pay your bills and </v>

657
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:14.754
<v Speaker 3>just trying to hustle up $100 sad or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>$75 set somewhere to go from that to </v>

658
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Speaker 3>just not having to worry about money.</v>

659
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instantaneously instantaneously,</v>

660
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after taxes,</v>

661
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:27.534
<v Speaker 3>having x amount of dollars in the bank </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just go on and what that's in the </v>

662
00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:31.120
<v Speaker 3>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

663
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.610
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

664
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 3>But then the feeling like a lightness of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being like,</v>

665
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.660
<v Speaker 3>like I felt physically lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's so much of your life,</v>

666
00:28:41.691 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 3>it consumes you for so much of your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like.</v>

667
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.170
<v Speaker 3>And there's this bill and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bill.</v>

668
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's on your mind all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

669
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

670
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.970
<v Speaker 3>like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got no,</v>

671
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:51.804
<v Speaker 3>I got these weeks of work lined up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that other thing is going to </v>

672
00:28:54.351 --> 00:28:55.184
<v Speaker 3>come up so I better not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to call it because it's all you </v>

673
00:28:57.091 --> 00:28:59.310
<v Speaker 3>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it goes the other way too.</v>

674
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I think that when you get to like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Bezos level,</v>

675
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.923
<v Speaker 3>I think then all of a sudden it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>burden because I feel like there isn't </v>

676
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:07.740
<v Speaker 3>the lightness.</v>

677
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 3>The lightness is like Brian Cowen had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying once and I've repeated it a bunch</v>

678
00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:12.714
<v Speaker 3>of time because I think he nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said you want to get rich enough so </v>

679
00:29:15.331 --> 00:29:16.164
<v Speaker 3>that you don't have to worry about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>bills and you don't have to worry about </v>

680
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 3>how much things cost when you go to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a restaurant.</v>

681
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

682
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.190
<v Speaker 3>It was everything else after that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

683
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.870
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

684
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

685
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 3>All that other stuff like acquiring </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and jewelry and shit like that,</v>

686
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.390
<v Speaker 3>like dealing with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

687
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

688
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:35.363
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that thing too when like when </v>

689
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.830
<v Speaker 3>you have enough money to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants and sometimes you'll go to a</v>

690
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>and they'll like and the</v>

691
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.813
<v Speaker 1>special is a this cut of meat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lobster on the side and it's </v>

692
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.370
<v Speaker 1>69,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95 and you're like,</v>

693
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:51.483
<v Speaker 1>not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like it's weird when I </v>

694
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 1>tell you the price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're like,</v>

695
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:57.310
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going to embarrass me </v>
<v Speaker 1>here at the table?</v>

696
00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead it's an odd thing.</v>

697
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes they tell you the price </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they don't.</v>

698
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they just tell you the special</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a rack of lamb.</v>

699
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.310
<v Speaker 1>That sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice restaurants.</v>

700
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.840
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times there's multiple items.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just says market price.</v>

701
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird one.</v>

702
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And you can just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that.</v>

703
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said.</v>

704
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:19.210
<v Speaker 1>So they just bring it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's $400.</v>

705
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

706
00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Speaker 1>what kind of market is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy,</v>

707
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.200
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that if you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where you're worth $105,</v>

708
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars just to focus on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

709
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>

710
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be overwhelming.</v>

711
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.653
<v Speaker 1>It must be overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also to the Bill Gates thing is </v>

712
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:36.184
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the thing that everybody probably </v>

713
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:42.970
<v Speaker 1>wants to ask you talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

714
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone knows you have a 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>inch Dick and then let me see,</v>

715
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.733
<v Speaker 1>just let me see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I touch it tastes like a regular </v>

716
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his limp and shifting and just.</v>

717
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like knowing that about someone.</v>

718
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.030
<v Speaker 1>It's all everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

719
00:30:58.031 --> 00:30:58.864
<v Speaker 1>I think that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel that everyone's like you're </v>

720
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 1>super rich because we're all fascinated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in this country with,</v>

721
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulating wealth.</v>

722
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's.</v>

723
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's heightened here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

724
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

725
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about how much of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is about balling.</v>

726
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

727
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.123
<v Speaker 1>It's all about young entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture is all about diamonds and </v>

728
00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:20.660
<v Speaker 1>stepping out of role.</v>

729
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I saw this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his name.</v>

730
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.320
<v Speaker 1>They showed him getting a jewelry that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he bought and you saw that and it has an</v>

731
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:29.403
<v Speaker 1>emblem with the 69 and it spins and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got like diamond teeth and then he had </v>

732
00:31:33.941 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had like 200 grand in his waistband.</v>

733
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.300
<v Speaker 1>He just took it out and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

734
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 1>stacking the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

735
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascination with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how much shit I have,</v>

736
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.753
<v Speaker 1>all this shit I can buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's part of the culture now and </v>

737
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 1>going on for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been coming up from poverty.</v>

738
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:51.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

739
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that these guys were all </v>
<v Speaker 1>like super poor and then they made it in</v>

740
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens when you make it.</v>

741
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's kind of also,</v>

742
00:31:59.131 --> 00:32:01.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that in like hip hop a lot here,</v>

743
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's also what you saw with a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug traffickers.</v>

744
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.230
<v Speaker 1>They all come from extreme poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

745
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>El Chapo,</v>

746
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

747
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super poor.</v>

748
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.610
<v Speaker 1>And they accumulate in crazy amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

749
00:32:15.611 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all my shit.</v>

750
00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you see this,</v>

751
00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 1>like the parallel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

752
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when Pablo Escobar,</v>

753
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.200
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he had the hippos and shit.</v>

754
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Fucking zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

755
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.380
<v Speaker 1>he had when he built his prison time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm building it and there was soccer</v>

756
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:38.680
<v Speaker 1>fields and then he would fly in national</v>
<v Speaker 1>players like play soccer with me today.</v>

757
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:39.891
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

758
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.300
<v Speaker 1>And even after all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

759
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speak anymore.</v>

760
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll even.</v>

761
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else built his own prison.</v>

762
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had parties.</v>

763
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz got me on this show because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched narcos,</v>

764
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:54.380
<v Speaker 1>which is a great netflix series.</v>

765
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another series called </v>
<v Speaker 1>surviving Escobar.</v>

766
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.963
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

767
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 1>it follows a escobar had a right hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

768
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his right hand.</v>

769
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Hitman killed like 300 people for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>named John Heidel of Alaska is baskets.</v>

770
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.013
<v Speaker 1>And if follows him from like the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got Escobar and this guy turned </v>

771
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:18.434
<v Speaker 1>himself in and it shows him in prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how he just ended up starting </v>

772
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 1>another cartel from basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from within prison.</v>

773
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's a fascinating series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

774
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a new netflix pressure.</v>

775
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened was that I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was a.</v>

776
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.000
<v Speaker 1>seems like it was a Colombian series </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they acquired,</v>

777
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 1>is what it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>

778
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

779
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:42.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all in Spanish,</v>

780
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with subtitles.</v>

781
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:45.360
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the real guy on,</v>

782
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.690
<v Speaker 1>in that picture right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that guy still alive?</v>

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

785
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

786
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.663
<v Speaker 1>he fucking murdered so many people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had such a dedication to their </v>

787
00:33:57.531 --> 00:33:58.364
<v Speaker 1>bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things they followed </v>

788
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:00.950
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like religious leaders,</v>

789
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.630

<v Speaker 1>this guy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Pablo Escobar had told me to kill my </v>

791
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have done it.</v>

792
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.393
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't have hesitated either </v>

<v Speaker 1>that they have such devotion to the boss</v>
<v Speaker 1>really was a dick.</v>

00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:07.580
<v Speaker 1>pockets and then a jersey over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just looks so much everybody.</v>

813
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.533
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ Bergs you put on 400 that </v>

814
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.380
<v Speaker 1>picture because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has like six layers on photo.</v>

815
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It was all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all pretty slim there though.</v>

816
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Are we got fat for awhile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

817
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:21.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

818
00:35:21.881 --> 00:35:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I already got into a serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A candy.</v>

819
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 1>A addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh quite a bit.</v>

820
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking terrible for you.</v>

821
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.200
<v Speaker 1>That sugar fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just getting fat from nothing but sugar.</v>

822
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 1>But he just decided to cut it out as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

823
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look good.</v>

824
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 1>We look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a long time ago though,</v>

825
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 1>but the way he did it was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

826
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.033
<v Speaker 1>Just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

827
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be fat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to do it.</v>

828
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Didn't join weight watchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do anything.</v>

829
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's a body that responds to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well too though.</v>

830
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like there's different.</v>

831
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:51.643
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely different body types </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's the kind that could probably </v>

832
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 1>make a slight adjustment and see things </v>
<v Speaker 1>sway.</v>

833
00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee with burdens,</v>

834
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.160
<v Speaker 1>booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if burt just cut off the booze,</v>

835
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean he would lose a massive amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

836
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 1>He goes so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes so hard.</v>

837
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bizarre.</v>

838
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he goes hard,</v>

839
00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:11.844
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the point where I was really stunned </v>

840
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:16.980
<v Speaker 1>that he made it through sober October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was stunned.</v>

841
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I think he really responds to challenges</v>
<v Speaker 1>he likes.</v>

842
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.610
<v Speaker 1>He likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he likes to challenge because he,</v>

843
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

844
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 1>we always joke how he speaks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperbole and he's always just like,</v>

845
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.753
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you go like I bet you can do </v>

846
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 1>like definitely could to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always immediate.</v>

847
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without consideration of it.</v>

848
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.660
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can definitely do that.</v>

849
00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now already said when we were hanging </v>

850
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:36.504
<v Speaker 1>this weekend because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely doing definitely doing </v>

851
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:43.000
<v Speaker 1>the La Marathon and I think it's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>April and he's like,</v>

852
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 1>if you do that I will show up in roller </v>
<v Speaker 1>skates.</v>

853
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I will fucking kill you.</v>

854
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And like there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way.</v>

855
00:36:51.631 --> 00:36:53.280
<v Speaker 1>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

856
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you can casually rollerskate a five</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute mile casually.</v>

857
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No sweating.</v>

858
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like after,</v>

859
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>after when your feet hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just push through it.</v>

860
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.493
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think you can push through </v>

861
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:12.600
<v Speaker 1>something and somebody else can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just fucking push through.</v>

862
00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It will beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

863
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll go take a nap and get back and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>still be cute.</v>

864
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

865
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 1>definitely definitely be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he ran a half marathon.</v>

866
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 1>He did and he did surprisingly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think he would do that.</v>

867
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:25.960
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take them to run a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon?</v>

868
00:37:25.961 --> 00:37:29.550
<v Speaker 1>One to say it was like the 2:40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

869
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.413
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

870
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe to 35 to 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that.</v>

871
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Is that a clean split like can you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

872
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 1>that means that you would do a five hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon?</v>

873
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be slower.</v>

874
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:41.650
<v Speaker 1>You get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

875
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:42.663
<v Speaker 1>That second half and everyone that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to said especially that last </v>

876
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 1>stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the last five miles are supposed to</v>

877
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:51.360
<v Speaker 1>be the most taxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

878
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

879
00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:52.884
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend campaigns is running a </v>

880
00:37:53.501 --> 00:37:54.740
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

881
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.800
<v Speaker 1>really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really crazy psychopath.</v>

882
00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you watch him,</v>

883
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pull up his instagram and I'm like,</v>

884
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.410
<v Speaker 1>just fucking positive man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just do it.</v>

885
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.840
<v Speaker 1>He's getting up every morning before </v>
<v Speaker 1>work has a regular job.</v>

886
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Is running fucking miles and miles at </v>
<v Speaker 1>six in the morning.</v>

887
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.213
<v Speaker 1>And I heard her say the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made him seem human was him talking </v>

888
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:17.970
<v Speaker 1>about there was a time when he said it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was hard to run a mile or something.</v>

889
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:18.841
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

890
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember when it was hard to run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile.</v>

891
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously?</v>

892
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>You had trouble running a mile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

893
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:27.030
<v Speaker 1>When he first started running like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>

894
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.500
<v Speaker 1>running is a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

895
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.520
<v Speaker 1>They been doing it a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

896
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.150
<v Speaker 1>but when I do it now too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

897
00:38:32.151 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think back at like where it used to be</v>

898
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 1>difficult</v>

899
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 3>and it's not difficult there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

900
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:39.274
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come it's not?</v>

901
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like your brain's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what happened?</v>

902
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what changed?</v>

903
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:43.803
<v Speaker 3>How come I can just run up this section </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and hustled through here and push </v>

904
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.123
<v Speaker 3>through around this corner and get up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Ridge and go over the top and then </v>

905
00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 3>to the top and that's where I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

906
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Why did I get so much further?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

907
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 3>you brought your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body does.</v>

908
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:57.933
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like your brain doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe that your body can get in </v>

909
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 3>better shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

910
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:03.424
<v Speaker 3>like when I work out and have worked out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time and I'm fit and I'll do </v>

912
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 3>like rounds in the bag or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

913
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I'll know I'm not getting as tired as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to be,</v>

914
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:12.110
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to believe it.</v>

915
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.740
<v Speaker 1>That is weird why your body is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is.</v>

916
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like trying to keep you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing in a way.</v>

917
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your brain has memories of the</v>

918
00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.813
<v Speaker 1>Times where you were getting tired doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you're not getting tired </v>

919
00:39:24.681 --> 00:39:26.020
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confused.</v>

920
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing,</v>

921
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I hired a trainer and a part of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>workouts has been bike sprints,</v>

922
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:36.020
<v Speaker 1>like stationary bike sprints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck men.</v>

923
00:39:36.021 --> 00:39:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you get an airdyne sprint or do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do just like a regular bike sprint?</v>

924
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a stationary bike,</v>

925
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what type of bike it is,</v>

926
00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.493
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be like a max out 32nd sprint and </v>

927

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.940
<v Speaker 1>He dances like the widest phish fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

997
00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:57.803

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:31.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's so rough on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1011

<v Speaker 1>he pushes through man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1012
00:43:33.451 --> 00:43:36.030
<v Speaker 1>He gets up the next day and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll be like,</v>

1013
00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm really feeling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're like,</v>

1017
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1018
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.110
<v Speaker 1>we went to breakfast the day of the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1019
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.890
<v Speaker 1>my friend Justin lives in Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes over,</v>

1020
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.010
<v Speaker 1>picks us up and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1021
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:58.740
<v Speaker 1>first feeling more than we sit down at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this breakfast place,</v>

1022
00:43:59.130 --> 00:43:59.963
<v Speaker 1>coffees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we ordered breakfast and he orders </v>

1023
00:44:01.861 --> 00:44:05.070
<v Speaker 1>eggs and toast and bacon or something.</v>

1024
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:06.630
<v Speaker 1>And then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1025
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.700
<v Speaker 1>And then as the waitress walks go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1026
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.050
<v Speaker 1>could you send them a waffle also?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1027
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:12.300
<v Speaker 1>like in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1028
00:44:12.301 --> 00:44:13.350
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1029
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.080
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like waffles?</v>

1030
00:44:15.081 --> 00:44:15.781
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1031
00:44:15.781 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's like this massive,</v>

1032
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.090
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1033
00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:25.860
<v Speaker 1>this was a really good decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally tearing it up.</v>

1034
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Scarfing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:31.140
<v Speaker 1>I know he wants to do another challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about doing something.</v>

1036
00:44:31.141 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 1>He keeps bringing things up and makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>these videos already threw one at us.</v>

1037
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1038
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Which I think actually would probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1039
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it's something that would benefit him </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

1040
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:44.130
<v Speaker 1>but other people will get benefits from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

1041
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Was the go phone free social media free </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a month?</v>

1042
00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Ari.</v>

1043
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Ari does that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

1044
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 1>That's like me asking you guys to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

1045
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1046
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.153
<v Speaker 1>but I think like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respected the challenge in terms of </v>

1047
00:44:59.341 --> 00:44:59.671
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1048
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I do look at that shit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it,</v>

1049
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes,</v>

1050
00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it takes too much of your focus away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which like already talked about.</v>

1051
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And then of course where it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>

1052
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.900
<v Speaker 1>like it's not easy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on it.</v>

1053
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 1>He brings his charger with him when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1054
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 1>When we went out I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1055
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:14.484
<v Speaker 1>He's like curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My battery runs out like you have 70 </v>

1056
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:17.740
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to run out?</v>

1057
00:45:17.741 --> 00:45:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And you've used it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always on it.</v>

1058
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a good challenge for you</v>

1059
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.710
<v Speaker 1>because you are consumed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was like,</v>

1060
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty hesitant to accept that.</v>

1061
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tool for work.</v>

1062
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his thing was like,</v>

1063
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:34.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have your assistant,</v>

1064
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 1>the guy that helps produce your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could send him things and be like,</v>

1065
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to post these things.</v>

1066
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.690
<v Speaker 1>You could post these promotions for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and Blah,</v>

1067
00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:44.340
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't be on.</v>

1068
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:48.270
<v Speaker 1>They're consumed by likes and consumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by comments and and that whole thing.</v>

1069
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

1070
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.350
<v Speaker 1>it was just definitely an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad idea.</v>

1071
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with it.</v>

1072
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1074
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the physical stuff is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting and fun.</v>

1075
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.090
<v Speaker 1>The physical stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting.</v>

1076
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Even like even for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who does yoga on a regular basis,</v>

1077
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:08.760
<v Speaker 1>doing 15 of them in a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1078
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:09.930
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot to make up.</v>

1079
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 1>What would it be?</v>

1080
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Another good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1081
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:12.894
<v Speaker 1>But let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the last nine days I did nine days </v>

1082
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:19.830
<v Speaker 1>of Yoga and it wasn't the last nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1084
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I had plenty of time to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just decided to burn it all out in</v>

1085
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 1>one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1086
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.593
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning a lot about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never done anything that's </v>

1087
00:46:27.391 --> 00:46:30.310
<v Speaker 1>that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety minute hot yoga classes,</v>

1088
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.980
<v Speaker 1>nine days in a row with no days off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1089
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.430
<v Speaker 1>if you just don't give yourself a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1090
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 1>your body starts to adapt to not having </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day off.</v>

1091
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.410
<v Speaker 1>You can accomplish way more than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you can.</v>

1092
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what that shit taught me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever had like those.</v>

1093
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember being on the road once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a deadline for a writing packet.</v>

1094
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.270
<v Speaker 1>It was some type of submission or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

1095
00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:51.123
<v Speaker 1>I was getting paid like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you got to send it in by this by </v>

1096
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.043
<v Speaker 1>like tomorrow.</v>

1097
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was doing so much writing in the </v>

1098
00:46:57.961 --> 00:47:01.230
<v Speaker 1>hotel room and that when I submitted it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything was fine,</v>

1099
00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1100
00:47:02.371 --> 00:47:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I could get a lot of work that in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel rooms.</v>

1101
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:05.743
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I needed that experience to tell me </v>

1102
00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:07.580
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Because all the time I'm like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting around and he's fucking hotel,</v>

1104
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.100
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just watching TV,</v>

1105
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 1>flipping through the channels and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing shit.</v>

1106
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Watching those fucking pawn shop shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

1107
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.990

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1109
00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>If you just make yourself do it or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Like for me I have to have have two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing does help is when I have a</v>

1111
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:29.830
<v Speaker 1>schedule of shit that I wrote down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hour a day for five days.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know if everyone works this way.</v>

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I definitely work better when it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's 100 percent out,</v>

1132

<v Speaker 2>actually out.</v>

1135
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.850
<v Speaker 2>I feel the fear and the drive more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I create more when I,</v>

1136
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.200
<v Speaker 2>when I know it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone now I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it really fuels me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

1138
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.593
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the scariest fucking thing in </v>

1139
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to say that thing one last time.</v>

1159
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:42.100
<v Speaker 2>And I was looking over like the bits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1160
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:43.750
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm done,</v>

1161
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.633
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to focus on just all new </v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're being forced into this </v>

1163
00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1164
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:51.783
<v Speaker 2>for a good thing because you have fans </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fans want to hear new stuff </v>

1165
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:56.163
<v Speaker 2>and it just makes me think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always used to pity those old guys </v>

1166
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.693
<v Speaker 2>back in Boston that never wrote that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had that same hour that they would </v>

1167
00:50:04.181 --> 00:50:06.670
<v Speaker 2>do for a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so nuts to me.</v>

1168
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:07.743
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to think about now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then there was no social media and </v>

1169
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>none of these guys got on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you didn't go to see them alive,</v>

1170
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.800
<v Speaker 2>you did not know their material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really wild.</v>

1172
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.033
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to think that that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>norm and that guys would polish an act </v>

1173
00:50:24.311 --> 00:50:25.144
<v Speaker 2>together and put it together and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just work and they would </v>

1174
00:50:26.681 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 2>never write and I fucking</v>

1175
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:28.880
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1176
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the norm now without </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

1177
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:31.934
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was kind of debated for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit is definitely want a special </v>

1178
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Speaker 1>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that shit is gone.</v>

1179
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's accepted now that </v>

1180
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you're done with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1181
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a conversation with someone at the</v>

1182
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:43.724
<v Speaker 3>store a year ago because she did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>special and then after the special she </v>

1183
00:50:47.331 --> 00:50:48.670
<v Speaker 3>was still doing the same material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1184
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.660
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1185
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:51.131
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1186
00:50:51.131 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think most of the people seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1187
00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.001
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

1189
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:54.494
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1190
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.480

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1194
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.340

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1196
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.420
<v Speaker 3>like you can be touring with the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>exact act.</v>

1197
00:51:07.421 --> 00:51:10.070
<v Speaker 3>It was on comedy central just six months</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1198
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1199
00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.210

1202
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I ran into it a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely the minority,</v>

1203
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.990
<v Speaker 1>which is the person who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you do that one bit?</v>

1204
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.380

<v Speaker 1>but I did one,</v>

1207
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:35.820
<v Speaker 1>people were asking me to do some bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1208
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.630
<v Speaker 1>when I was touring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was not 20,</v>

1209
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.770
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:43.680
<v Speaker 1>are you going to do this bit and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1212
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So I just do one show at a club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1213
00:51:46.321 --> 00:51:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try this,</v>

1214
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.720
<v Speaker 1>this thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This encore thing,</v>

1215
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:52.320
<v Speaker 1>so I did my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did my new show and then I said,</v>

1216
00:51:52.321 --> 00:51:56.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people ask me to do some bits that,</v>

1217
00:51:56.131 --> 00:51:57.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1218
00:51:57.061 --> 00:51:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how I got into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1219
00:51:58.801 --> 00:52:02.010
<v Speaker 1>and that got this huge round of applause</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I would be,</v>

1220
00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I would start it and there'd be like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1221
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.093
<v Speaker 1>big applause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go through the bit to complete </v>

1222
00:52:08.071 --> 00:52:11.730
<v Speaker 1>silence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they would just watch me do the bit</v>

1223
00:52:11.731 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 1>they know and then when I would end it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another round of applause.</v>

1224
00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:15.603
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's horrible.</v>

1225
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 3>That was the worst feeling ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason,</v>

1226
00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:21.710
<v Speaker 3>because there was no lab because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was no surprise.</v>

1227
00:52:21.711 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1228
00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:26.420
<v Speaker 3>of course they knew the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did like the next bit and I was like,</v>

1229
00:52:26.421 --> 00:52:27.051
<v Speaker 3>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1231
00:52:27.591 --> 00:52:29.570
<v Speaker 3>this one as the same thing.</v>

1232
00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:30.950
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do know this one,</v>

1233

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.823
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1235
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 3>that was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was my one attempt at doing,</v>

1236

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then people were like,</v>

1240
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the next line.</v>

1241
00:52:45.401 --> 00:52:46.234
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1244
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.023
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bit about people breaking into the </v>

1245
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:57.990
<v Speaker 3>White House about a woman who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>guarding the front door,</v>

1246
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.160
<v Speaker 3>the White House by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's on your last one.</v>

1247
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:03.130
<v Speaker 3>And I had to go back and watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1248
00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.780

<v Speaker 3>I forgot all the different beats</v>

1253
00:53:18.131 --> 00:53:20.920
<v Speaker 1>rich guys and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1254
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:21.903
<v Speaker 1>I flew in and I was talking to them like</v>
<v Speaker 1>five hours before the show and I was </v>

1255
00:53:24.911 --> 00:53:25.681
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

1256
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

1257
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my current show.</v>

1258
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1259
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:31.140
<v Speaker 2>we were hoping you would do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1260
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:32.940
<v Speaker 2>this and this though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1261
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went up to my hotel room,</v>

1262
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:40.140
<v Speaker 2>pulled up Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started watching and making notes.</v>

1263
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.453
<v Speaker 2>And then I downloaded the album so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could listen to it and I would walk </v>

1264
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:46.000
<v Speaker 2>around and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1265
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:47.223
<v Speaker 2>like forgetting the thing that you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a throwaway is actually like a </v>

1266
00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 2>connector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing you're like fuck.</v>

1267
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And I was doing like halfassed versions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it at the show.</v>

1268
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.633
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were still like on board with </v>

1269
00:53:58.021 --> 00:53:59.520

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing about like a bruce </v>

1280
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:34.224
<v Speaker 2>springsteen or any of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that on any given night you could </v>

1281
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:37.524
<v Speaker 2>bring back that one and really get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharp again for like five nights and </v>

1282

<v Speaker 2>it just goes further and further away </v>

1286
00:54:48.241 --> 00:54:50.240
<v Speaker 2>from your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to like,</v>

1287
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:53.490
<v Speaker 2>if you go to see Bruce springsteen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't play born to run.</v>

<v Speaker 2>doing like for our shows,</v>

1292

<v Speaker 2>the country and she's awesome and she </v>

1340
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:14.953

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1342
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember saying that to her one</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1343
00:57:20.231 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 2>like four or five years ago at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>

1344
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:26.890
<v Speaker 2>She'd fucking crushed in the or and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came up to upstairs go,</v>

1345
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 2>no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're one of the best comics alive.</v>

1346
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.850
<v Speaker 2>That set that you just did right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the,</v>

1347
00:57:31.851 --> 00:57:35.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just funny but it's insightful.</v>

1348
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:36.183
<v Speaker 2>She's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She points out shit that other people </v>

1349
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:41.530
<v Speaker 2>aren't pointing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real writer to writer writes a lot.</v>

1350
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.813
<v Speaker 2>How does she bright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does she sit in front of the computer </v>

1351
00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 2>and paper and then a computer and then a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pen and paper.</v>

1352
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:48.123
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of notes to writing a lot of </v>

1353
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:50.434
<v Speaker 2>actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're talking about spending that </v>

1354
00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:52.234
<v Speaker 2>time working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of time you gotta do you know </v>

1355
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.353
<v Speaker 2>that's the difference between someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who produces a lot of material and </v>

1356
00:57:58.781 --> 00:58:02.150
<v Speaker 2>someone who doesn't like I've had these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations with people before.</v>

1357
00:58:02.151 --> 00:58:02.711
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1358
00:58:02.711 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I only write onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1359
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:05.350
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's the only way it works.</v>

1361
00:58:08.921 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Or is it because you're lazy and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you justify it?</v>

1362
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:13.500
<v Speaker 2>It's probably more of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of that.</v>

1363
00:58:13.501 --> 00:58:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1364
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Now that I write on stage stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1365
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:17.870
<v Speaker 2>well I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1366
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I write onstage stuff but don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give it out as.</v>

1367
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:22.683
<v Speaker 2>The thing that drives me crazy is I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them giving it out as advice to other </v>

1368
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:27.780
<v Speaker 2>young guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like don't write on paper dude.</v>

1369
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1370
00:58:28.901 --> 00:58:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I write on stage man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I do like,</v>

1371
00:58:30.461 --> 00:58:32.020
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1372
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.190
<v Speaker 2>but is that the only way and is it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best way and isn't,</v>

1373
00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:36.024
<v Speaker 2>isn't it possible that you're missing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say what happened was two was like </v>

1374
00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:43.480
<v Speaker 2>when Louie got like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really popular and he was just like,</v>

1375
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I never write anything down that became </v>
<v Speaker 2>like folklore and attend like attractive</v>

1376
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.770
<v Speaker 2>to see comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1377
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do that.</v>

1378
00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.710
<v Speaker 2>So he said he never writes anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

1379
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.593
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't even write down bullet points </v>

1380
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.900
<v Speaker 2>really just all in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then people are like,</v>

1381
00:58:59.050 --> 00:58:59.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I heard,</v>

1383
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.983
<v Speaker 2>I started to hear that more when his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fame really exploded and that was a big </v>

1384
00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:07.684
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1385
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1386
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.910
<v Speaker 2>you don't even write shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1387
00:59:09.911 --> 00:59:11.380
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1388
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Well I guess if you're doing stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>every night,</v>

1389
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 2>three or four nights a week or three or </v>
<v Speaker 2>four times a night,</v>

1390
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 2>like you're doing those New York sets </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're constantly working</v>

1391
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 1>constantly in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with that.</v>

1392
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could,</v>

1393
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:27.584
<v Speaker 1>but like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always liked having at least a bullet </v>

1394
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:35.270
<v Speaker 1>point list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even when I wasn't writing anything</v>

1395
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.520
<v Speaker 1>long form down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still like to have that.</v>

1396
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I just to see it all,</v>

1397
00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.470
<v Speaker 1>like how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1398
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.483
<v Speaker 1>how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the movie plays out and they'd be </v>

1399
00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:44.651
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1400
00:59:44.651 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I should move this over here and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be right here.</v>

1401
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine not having any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that written down,</v>

1402
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.400
<v Speaker 1>but I just think that the more time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend focusing on it,</v>

1403
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:53.323
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the more time you spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>just writing stuff down or looking at </v>

1404
00:59:55.761 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 1>bullet points or the just the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intention you put on things.</v>

1405
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:02.570
<v Speaker 1>More attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more focused.</v>

1406
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:03.643
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna you're gonna have it's gonna </v>

1407
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to know it better.</v>

1408
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like getting good at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1409
01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put a lot of time into it.</v>

1410
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It happened for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing those.</v>

1412
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>One of the weirdest ones because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody does it a different way.</v>

1413
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1414
01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:17.853
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got their own weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>style and no one can tell you exactly </v>

1415
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:22.844
<v Speaker 1>how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could never tell Theo Vaughn </v>

1416
01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>how to write a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1417
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initially him,</v>

1418
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>his ax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So odd.</v>

1419
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know.</v>

1420
01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Then you're like mispronounce things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like that's like.</v>

1421
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.200
<v Speaker 1>But it's like a disguised so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shit like that where you just like,</v>

1423
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>how'd you come up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1424
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>was it an accident the first time like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1425
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like I remember a Carlin,</v>

1426
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:48.543
<v Speaker 1>he would write on a note cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>note cards and clubs and then kind of </v>

1427
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>shuffle through them and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's shit and throw it on the ground.</v>

1428
01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1429
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him,</v>

1430
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.493
<v Speaker 1>one of his last tours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that universal amphitheater and he for </v>

1431
01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:07.943
<v Speaker 1>his last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he called them like individual </v>

1432
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.573
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his bits where it was really </v>

1433
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>heavily about the writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the specific word play the flow,</v>

1434
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythm patterns.</v>

1435
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Like his comedy was very melodic like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1436
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>And when it got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1437
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>when it was like one of his closing </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>

1438
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>it was like five pages and he brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the pages and he's like,</v>

1439
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read this because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how I memorize it,</v>

1440
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.170
<v Speaker 1>memorize it by doing these shows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading this.</v>

1441
01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.213
<v Speaker 1>So just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this thing I'm going to look at it </v>

1442
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.033
<v Speaker 1>like he told the 6,000 people that wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he would know it and then flip </v>

1443
01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>the page and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was it?</v>

1444
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:50.563
<v Speaker 1>It was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1445
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:51.403
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was what it was like the second to </v>

1446
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>last special and I remember the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was a,</v>

1447
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>it was a really well constructed piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of writing is a little throw,</v>

1448
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>threw you off a little bit to have him </v>
<v Speaker 1>be reading it,</v>

1449
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

1450
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I would say when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw the show,</v>

1451
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.363
<v Speaker 1>that piece was probably at least half </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to memory and he was still </v>

1452
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1453
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:13.251
<v Speaker 1>repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat,</v>

1454
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>repeat to so that it would be in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

1455
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It was still really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still really funny.</v>

1456
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Well he was also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

1457
01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>how</v>

1458
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.873
<v Speaker 2>old was he?</v>

1459
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Sixty nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70.</v>

1460
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I think he died at 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1461
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>he looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked older because of,</v>

1462
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1463
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>he went hard in the paint too.</v>

1464
01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Drug use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:34.850
<v Speaker 2>But he was upset when he apparently had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pain pill.</v>

1466
01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:35.684
<v Speaker 2>Problem for awhile because I remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a time when he committed </v>

1467
01:02:40.071 --> 01:02:45.071
<v Speaker 2>himself to Rehab and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was wine and pills.</v>

1468
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:48.380
<v Speaker 2>He was taking pain pills plus kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn opiates,</v>

1469
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:52.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People they do get you get,</v>

1470
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:53.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to think that your memory </v>

1471
01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.473
<v Speaker 2>must eventually at some point in time </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to give out when you're doing </v>

1472
01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:01.970
<v Speaker 2>these long monologues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1473
01:03:01.971 --> 01:03:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you do long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long monologues?</v>

1474
01:03:04.371 --> 01:03:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he would write out his whole act,</v>

1475
01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:10.940
<v Speaker 2>like the whole hour and then just start </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1476
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is a new one every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like reading like a book almost.</v>

1477
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I think you said 16 months was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>turnaround</v>

1478
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:18.993
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1479

01:04:21.551 --> 01:04:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was really interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see him do this big Polish special and a</v>

1503
01:04:26.201 --> 01:04:30.160
<v Speaker 2>big place and then do the little special</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the belly room.</v>

1504
01:04:30.161 --> 01:04:30.791
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1505
01:04:30.791 --> 01:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The room felt weird,</v>

1506
01:04:33.071 --> 01:04:33.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1507
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my take on it is like the second one,</v>

1508
01:04:36.981 --> 01:04:41.981
<v Speaker 1>the belly ruin w we're and we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice of calling that a special,</v>

1509
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not a special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1510
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.730
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing is what here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in definitely in Los Angeles.</v>

1511
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And if you live in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denver,</v>

1512
01:04:52.161 --> 01:04:52.994
<v Speaker 1>New York places he likes to frequent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight is what you see Dave chappelle </v>

1513
01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.630
<v Speaker 1>known for in these cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1514
01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>he would drop into clubs and like spill </v>
<v Speaker 1>out everything that's on his mind.</v>

1515
01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.793
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's more like </v>

1516
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:09.440
<v Speaker 1>semantics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

1517
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.843
<v Speaker 1>it's not a special to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're seeing one of the best </v>

1518
01:05:13.941 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>guys ever do a workout set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1519
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:18.543
<v Speaker 1>a loose riff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been six slash seven weeks </v>

1520
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.860
<v Speaker 1>since the special was shot that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays before it broke,</v>

1521
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:26.723
<v Speaker 1>when which he toured for like a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that you can see how like polished </v>

1522
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1523
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's really cool if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big standup nerd to see the other one,</v>

1524
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>like that's what happens a lot in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities that he,</v>

1525
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>he'll just fly into and be like here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's on my mind.</v>

1526
01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:42.981
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1527
01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're seeing like,</v>

1528
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1529
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>it's masterful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's like,</v>

1530
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1531
01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as separate then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>special,</v>

1532
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a [inaudible],</v>

1533
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>a special to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tour,</v>

1534
01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you prepare and then like you present </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1535
01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1536
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you'd be like,</v>

1537
01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a separate thing as a special.</v>

1538
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:09.721
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying that within that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something really specific going on which</v>

1539
01:06:10.601 --> 01:06:12.940
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like in the moment,</v>

1540
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all topical commentary and that's</v>

1541
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:20.590
<v Speaker 1>how that dude works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1542
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.840
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will walk into a club and be like,</v>

1543
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I want to get on stage and like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>

1544
01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:27.203
<v Speaker 1>He said he also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves topical stuff so it fits </v>

1545
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.580
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

1546
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>it's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1547
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the total differ,</v>

1548
01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:35.863
<v Speaker 1>that contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you watch one after the </v>

1549
01:06:37.601 --> 01:06:38.680
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1550
01:06:38.681 --> 01:06:39.514
<v Speaker 1>you're watching toward proven like </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out stuff and like here's some </v>

1551
01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:47.380
<v Speaker 1>shit I thought of basically in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

1552
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:48.161
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1553
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:49.840
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a whole hour of it,</v>

1554
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:51.270
<v Speaker 2>which is really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1555
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 2>So prolific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1556
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.900
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1557
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact,</v>

1558
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:57.423
<v Speaker 2>the way it worked was doing the two of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them together that way you got to see </v>

1559
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:03.310
<v Speaker 2>the big Polish special when you get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the fuck around workouts set.</v>

1560
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's like if you watched the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>Polish specialty,</v>

1561
01:07:05.301 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 2>like I need more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1562
01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1563
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I think just to hear people go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth on which they liked more.</v>

1564
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.110
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a bunch of people,</v>

1565
01:07:16.111 --> 01:07:19.320
<v Speaker 1>at least online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say they liked the belly room,</v>

1566
01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1567
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Well the belly room was so intimate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in that room.</v>

1568
01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:23.834
<v Speaker 2>I was there for one of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting to be there when </v>

1569
01:07:27.801 --> 01:07:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you're watching someone film in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 people.</v>

1570
01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:33.410
<v Speaker 2>It's so tight and small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1571
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.450
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of naked a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1572
01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:40.430
<v Speaker 2>and the people in the audience where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were fucking on the show.</v>

1573
01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:41.443
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that got those front row </v>

1574
01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.160
<v Speaker 2>seats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1575
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:45.700
<v Speaker 2>they were featured prominently in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>

1576
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:46.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of makes you entertain the idea of </v>

1577
01:07:48.921 --> 01:07:51.200
<v Speaker 2>like a really small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>special what that would be like.</v>

1578
01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1579
01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.960
<v Speaker 2>there's different kinds of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1580
01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:58.010
<v Speaker 2>This is like the comedy that you do for </v>
<v Speaker 2>70 people.</v>

1581
01:07:58.011 --> 01:07:58.844
<v Speaker 2>It's just not exactly the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy that has done it for $700 or </v>

1582
01:08:01.851 --> 01:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>$7,000 and the way you present it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>

1583
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.040
<v Speaker 2>he basically sat for most of that.</v>

1584
01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1585
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:09.590
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1586
01:08:09.591 --> 01:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Usually if you were in a big 2,500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seater,</v>

1587
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.690
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna like chill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit on a bench.</v>

1588
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Mark Marin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark parents cosby,</v>

1589
01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 2>oldschool cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1590
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always sitting even as you got </v>

1591
01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.370
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1592
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Cosby did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just old school cosby,</v>

1593
01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:26.330
<v Speaker 2>but old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

1594
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:27.441
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old cost.</v>

1595
01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:29.440
<v Speaker 2>But you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Qosmio tour again?</v>

1596
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:30.540
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1597
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>

1598
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:34.380
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1600
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.750
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he was touring promoters</v>
<v Speaker 2>obligations,</v>

1601
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 2>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think it's not worth the trouble</v>

1602
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.650
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

1603
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Louisville to Oregon.</v>

1604
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.130
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1605
01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he'll take a year off.</v>

1607
01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:53.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he'll do some shows and people </v>

1608
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:55.424
<v Speaker 2>get mad</v>

1609
01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and then it'd be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like if,</v>

1610
01:08:57.690 --> 01:08:58.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real thing is like the corporate </v>

1611
01:08:59.111 --> 01:09:00.760
<v Speaker 1>side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in other words,</v>

1612
01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>a channel or network that would went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say host show the special,</v>

1613
01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:08.853
<v Speaker 1>but he has such a dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's website following is like what </v>

1614
01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:17.791
<v Speaker 1>he ended up developing and he's sold </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and made millions,</v>

1615
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people were doing the like download</v>

1616
01:09:20.711 --> 01:09:24.460
<v Speaker 1>my special thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he could book a venue,</v>

1617
01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.500
<v Speaker 1>shoot something and go back to his $5 </v>
<v Speaker 1>model and do really well.</v>

1618
01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:30.723
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he could and people would be </v>

1619
01:09:31.451 --> 01:09:34.480
<v Speaker 2>really interested to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course netflix would have them on.</v>

1620
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.290
<v Speaker 2>They still have his old stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old stuff.</v>

1621
01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1622
01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:40.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a flight after,</v>

1623
01:09:40.571 --> 01:09:43.600
<v Speaker 2>right after all of it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched his,</v>

1624
01:09:43.601 --> 01:09:45.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the special from DC,</v>

1625
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:49.300
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch it knowing the DC one was,</v>

1626
01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:51.820
<v Speaker 2>is that the latest lotus one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>

1627
01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:53.043
<v Speaker 2>But just to know that it was like right </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the corner that he was going to </v>

1628
01:09:56.201 --> 01:09:57.650
<v Speaker 2>get busted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Beating off in front of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing to get caught,</v>

1630
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:02.443
<v Speaker 2>dylan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to all the things that people </v>

1631
01:10:04.211 --> 01:10:05.044
<v Speaker 2>have done that they got caught doing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rape accusations and all the </v>

1632
01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:08.494
<v Speaker 2>horrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his is the most pathetic and also </v>

1633
01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>kind of the most innocuous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1634
01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:17.590
<v Speaker 2>just humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just petering off in front of people.</v>

1635
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like his kink,</v>

1636
01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.000
<v Speaker 2>it's what he likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could be way worse,</v>

1637
01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:22.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

1638
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:26.950
<v Speaker 2>what he actually did not saying it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good thing to do to people now it's hey,</v>

1639
01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:30.070
<v Speaker 2>watch me beat off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a bunch of people.</v>

1640
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:32.630
<v Speaker 2>He did it to apparently laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Quite a few comics that I've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that know people that</v>

1642
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:38.400
<v Speaker 1>he did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1643
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I knew somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

1644
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And which she think not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1646
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.240
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1647
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1648
01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It was like weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it for a long time.</v>

1649
01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.340
<v Speaker 1>That story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:56.930
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I said it before.</v>

1651
01:10:56.931 --> 01:10:57.764
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1652
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:59.443
<v Speaker 1>I knew it and then like every other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person I talked to in comedy to it and </v>

1653
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>we were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked up,</v>

1654
01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:06.464
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this doesn't excuse it at all </v>

1655
01:11:07.791 --> 01:11:08.624
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something about something </v>

1656
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 1>at least that as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that something somebody did a while ago.</v>

1657
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I supposed to bring this shit up</v>

1658
01:11:18.571 --> 01:11:19.404
<v Speaker 1>to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1659
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you know?</v>

1660
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:22.303
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing is how do you even </v>

1661
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:27.810
<v Speaker 1>know that they did it because one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that happened during the whole,</v>

1662
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:28.703
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he do it or do not do it thing </v>

1663
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>before it came out was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone had told me that it was bullshit</v>

1664
01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:34.883
<v Speaker 1>and that what he had done is take some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures of female comedians with his </v>

1665
01:11:38.821 --> 01:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>dick out just being silly and stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1666
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.253
<v Speaker 1>and then tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please delete those pictures were just </v>

1667
01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:45.350
<v Speaker 1>having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1668
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:46.260
<v Speaker 1>how do I get in trouble?</v>

1669
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story I heard was very specific.</v>

1670
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1671
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically one of the stories reported</v>

1672
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:54.083
<v Speaker 1>in the times and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing that story and the </v>

1673
01:11:56.461 --> 01:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>person was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1674
01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.093
<v Speaker 1>was pretty upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a lot of people heard the </v>

1675
01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:01.541
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:03.330
<v Speaker 1>And then I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:12:03.331 --> 01:12:06.120
<v Speaker 1>another year would go by and two years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and three years and you're like,</v>

1678
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:08.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's bad.</v>

1679
01:12:08.281 --> 01:12:10.700
<v Speaker 1>But like as far as my role in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1680
01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:11.693
<v Speaker 1>as somebody who knows the story now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just one of those things where </v>

1681
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:14.311
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1682
01:12:14.311 --> 01:12:17.550
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked up story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not someone that like,</v>

1683
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1684
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:23.070
<v Speaker 1>that guy he fucking punched someone 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago was a real asshole.</v>

1685
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sucks,</v>

1686
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But 15 years ago is a long time.</v>

1687
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:27.181
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1688
01:12:27.181 --> 01:12:29.040
<v Speaker 1>kind of it's like is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

1689
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not to like minimize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrongdoing,</v>

1690
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.860
<v Speaker 1>but like I sit there some part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about how people mature and</v>

1691
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 1>become different people as they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

1692
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure a lot of people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their fifties and sixties,</v>

1693
01:12:43.321 --> 01:12:44.590
<v Speaker 1>you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.290
<v Speaker 1>who are not celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

1695
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.153
<v Speaker 1>do you know that when this guy was 26 he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did this fucking horrible stupid thing </v>

1696
01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:52.710
<v Speaker 1>or something like Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're like,</v>

1697
01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1698
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.410
<v Speaker 1>there's long time ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was kind of,</v>

1699
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:59.760
<v Speaker 1>at least that part of the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in this.</v>

1700
01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:00.611
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>

1701
01:13:00.611 --> 01:13:02.370
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something really bad and he's being</v>

1702
01:13:02.371 --> 01:13:03.360
<v Speaker 1>punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1703
01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.790
<v Speaker 1>we're not saying that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely,</v>

1704
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it has not been excused because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being punished.</v>

1705
01:13:07.741 --> 01:13:11.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's also old behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the Dustin Hoffman thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets really strange.</v>

1708
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:22.070
<v Speaker 1>A lot of his stuff was 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1985 and shit.</v>

1709
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.153
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the difference too </v>

1710
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.283
<v Speaker 1>between the Hoffman stuff and Louis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe everybody else is louise </v>

1711
01:13:29.341 --> 01:13:30.720
<v Speaker 1>admission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1712
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.600
<v Speaker 1>That's very different because even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff I heard with Hoffman,</v>

1713
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.733
<v Speaker 1>he is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely trying to justify a </v>

1714
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.910
<v Speaker 1>versions and the behavior and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people did you know,</v>

1715
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:43.260
<v Speaker 1>is that what he said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1716
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:43.861
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1717
01:13:43.861 --> 01:13:47.310
<v Speaker 1>on the set like you try to like get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1718
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to break the tension or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1719
01:13:49.031 --> 01:13:49.864
<v Speaker 1>there's a monotony to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people would have these </v>

1720
01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:55.890
<v Speaker 1>conversations and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like he's trying to appears that</v>

1721
01:13:55.891 --> 01:13:58.650
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to be less accountable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he said.</v>

1722
01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Louis was like,</v>

1723
01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:01.980
<v Speaker 1>these stories are true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

1724
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:02.993
<v Speaker 1>I think all those things end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting how your redemption goes </v>

1725
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:09.570
<v Speaker 1>because they're like somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this shit.</v>

1726
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1727
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think in this country people love </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

1728
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Like are you punished for the thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>

1729
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:21.370
<v Speaker 1>We hate like somebody getting away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1730
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:22.983
<v Speaker 1>So part of him I think coming back will </v>
<v Speaker 1>also be the people realize that he paid </v>

1731
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 1>a price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he lost deals.</v>

1732
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>He lost shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last money.</v>

1733
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Definitely lost a lot of fucking touring</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1734
01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that day is probably at least a $50</v>

1735
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>million a day for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1736
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.730
<v Speaker 1>with everything together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

1737
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1738
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.760
<v Speaker 1>what a weird kink jerk off in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1739
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how you develop it.</v>

1740
01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:48.543
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I can imagine how you develop </v>

1741
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:50.223
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that you could even do </v>

1742
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was trying to think,</v>

1743
01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 1>could I even ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1744
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.843
<v Speaker 1>do you mind if I jerk off in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and then just get hard and actually </v>

1745
01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the thing.</v>

1746
01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I imagine he had to be leaking ripe like</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>

1747
01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:02.524
<v Speaker 1>like to come that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to be something he's thinking </v>

1748
01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:09.190
<v Speaker 1>about all day and like hanging out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then like,</v>

1749
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to hang out?</v>

1750
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Like do you want to come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or whatever might come up.</v>

1751
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:15.130
<v Speaker 1>And so as he's getting closer to doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1752
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1753
01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.120
<v Speaker 1>it's the only fuel that's on his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1754
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's like to just ask me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

1755
01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 1>well that's not my kink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>

1756
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.553
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you go from fully flacid to come </v>

1757
01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:26.340
<v Speaker 1>out of these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1758
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:30.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could do that.</v>

1759
01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinks are fucking weird.</v>

1760
01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Kinks are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1761
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:36.603
<v Speaker 1>like I had a friend and him and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and used to tie each other </v>

1762
01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:40.960
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tie each other both up.</v>

1763
01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Ball gags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.380
<v Speaker 1>The whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He loved it.</v>

1765
01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:48.480
<v Speaker 1>He would talk about it with great glee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1767
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like tiny each other up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1768
01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:53.200
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking great.</v>

1770
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:56.263
<v Speaker 1>It's just something about like trusting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person to put that rope in their </v>

1771
01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:04.471
<v Speaker 1>mouth and like I wonder how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of those kinks develop later?</v>

1772
01:16:04.901 --> 01:16:05.734
<v Speaker 1>Like you realize it later as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the more common theory that </v>

1773
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:12.120
<v Speaker 1>everything's tied to childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that must have been,</v>

1774
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.233
<v Speaker 1>you must have been tied up or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kid once and then you somehow </v>

1775
01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:18.510
<v Speaker 1>relate that to sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder if the,</v>

1776
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.080
<v Speaker 1>if you can be 28 and be like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tying thing is fucking awesome.</v>

1777
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you can just date one crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1778
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.273
<v Speaker 1>like if you have one girl who's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild animal in the sack and she just </v>

1779
01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:31.360
<v Speaker 1>wants to tie you up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1780
01:16:31.361 --> 01:16:31.990
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

1781
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't your love it.</v>

1782
01:16:33.821 --> 01:16:37.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as we need to answer.</v>

1783
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Where's Jim Norton when you need it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1784
01:16:39.411 --> 01:16:40.244
<v Speaker 1>He would go deep with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets all sweaty and shit and it's </v>

1785
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.600
<v Speaker 1>bugging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blinking.</v>

1786
01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Nobody embraces their kinks more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>him though.</v>

1788
01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking admire that.</v>

1789
01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1790
01:16:51.491 --> 01:16:55.600
<v Speaker 1>whether it's trannies or any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that he's experienced friends,</v>

1791
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:56.590
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says it.</v>

1792
01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:57.850
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh he does.</v>

1793
01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:58.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's definitely supports the </v>

1794
01:17:00.311 --> 01:17:03.250
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the industry is that.</v>

1795
01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that you can't say tranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tranny is somehow or another negative.</v>

1796
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1797
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>these are noises that we make by now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle was like the,</v>

1798
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:13.410
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1799
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:14.243
<v Speaker 1>he brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got a lot of shit on the old one or </v>

1800
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the one from a year ago and so he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he brought up the topic again,</v>

1801
01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but he's said Trans people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It was real specific on that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the last one he was like fucking</v>

1803
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.073
<v Speaker 1>Chinese man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's certainly a lot of thought </v>

1804
01:17:30.861 --> 01:17:31.870
<v Speaker 1>policing going on</v>

1805
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.940
<v Speaker 3>and there's language policing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to wonder,</v>

1806
01:17:35.941 --> 01:17:36.774
<v Speaker 3>like how much of that affects the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>people actually feel and how much and </v>

1807
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:48.510
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is just people trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>control the way people communicate and,</v>

1808
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.363
<v Speaker 3>and dictating the languages because like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go to the far end of the </v>

1809
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:54.830
<v Speaker 3>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these new,</v>

1810
01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:57.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender pronouns that there's,</v>

1811
01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.920
<v Speaker 3>there's literally ems or 78 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think are utterly preposterous,</v>

1812
01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:04.610
<v Speaker 3>absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd,</v>

1813
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.920
<v Speaker 3>absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're make believing you have,</v>

1814
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:12.050
<v Speaker 3>you've make-believe language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're inventing all these new words and</v>

1815
01:18:12.051 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not like there's some universal </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreement going on and everybody.</v>

1816
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:19.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not like remember when ms dot was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing.</v>

1817
01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was mrs and Mr. but then there was</v>

1818
01:18:24.861 --> 01:18:29.861
<v Speaker 3>miss [inaudible] and Mr was married or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr [inaudible] was not married and women</v>

1819
01:18:30.051 --> 01:18:30.501
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1820
01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:32.480
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come we don't have one of those?</v>

1821
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they came up with ms.ms dot,</v>

1822
01:18:34.731 --> 01:18:36.310
<v Speaker 3>but it never really stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1823
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.840
<v Speaker 3>like nobody uses Ms.</v>

1824
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:39.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be like a real formal,</v>

1825
01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raven.</v>

1826
01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Would you say ms dot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they would ever in writing,</v>

1827
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:47.210
<v Speaker 1>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1828
01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:50.580
<v Speaker 1>might write ms if it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1829
01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:55.190
<v Speaker 1>a piece of journalism or something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>add to indicate the person that's single</v>

1830
01:18:55.191 --> 01:18:56.570
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never hear that.</v>

1831
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't hear it spoken a lot.</v>

1832
01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:58.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1833
01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:00.800
<v Speaker 3>but they were trying to push for it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

1834
01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was something that was like on </v>

1835
01:19:03.721 --> 01:19:06.690
<v Speaker 3>the borderline of being accepted by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Common Vanessa.</v>

1836
01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.553
<v Speaker 1>Killer shit is xer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also wonder like how many people are </v>

1837
01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:16.560
<v Speaker 1>just professionally upset at shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>said wrong.</v>

1838
01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

1839
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:20.130
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reaction to everything is like,</v>

1840
01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:25.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like their job is to police and </v>
<v Speaker 1>react in a fucking.</v>

1841
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:25.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1842
01:19:25.441 --> 01:19:26.071
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>

1843
01:19:26.071 --> 01:19:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

1844
01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like almost how academia exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1845
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.550
<v Speaker 1>You see like the way that people are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses,</v>

1846
01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:33.384
<v Speaker 1>it's like fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not a reflection of the real </v>

1847
01:19:35.431 --> 01:19:36.264
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1848
01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:38.880
<v Speaker 1>To consider everyone's feelings at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1849
01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how shit works.</v>

1850
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1851
01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.880
<v Speaker 1>People get upset and get offended at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1852
01:19:44.881 --> 01:19:46.110
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like that,</v>

1853
01:19:46.111 --> 01:19:46.944
<v Speaker 1>everyone should like dial back </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything they say to make sure </v>

1854
01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:51.100
<v Speaker 1>everyone feels protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it should.</v>

1855
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:54.020
<v Speaker 3>What's been really interesting in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last five days,</v>

1856
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:54.913
<v Speaker 3>there's been a battle going on in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter mentions that I haven't dived </v>

1857
01:19:58.071 --> 01:19:59.900
<v Speaker 3>into at all really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1858
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:01.003
<v Speaker 3>but lesbians had been going at it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender people in my twitter </v>

1859
01:20:04.911 --> 01:20:05.744
<v Speaker 3>mentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is like long ongoing </v>

1860
01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 3>conversation with going back</v>

1861
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.023
<v Speaker 2>and forth and remarkably civil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting is all these </v>

1862
01:20:13.621 --> 01:20:14.454
<v Speaker 2>lesbians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they've been saying </v>

1863
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.380
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dive in every now and then I read some</v>

1864
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.370
<v Speaker 2>of it and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1865
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:21.690
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

1866
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:25.390
<v Speaker 2>But that lesbians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1867
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.393
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to say that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence that happens in supposedly </v>

1868
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:31.854
<v Speaker 2>lesbian relationships is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender men to women where they </v>

1869
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:36.534
<v Speaker 2>switched over and then they're beating </v>
<v Speaker 2>up their girlfriends and they're </v>

1870
01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:45.260
<v Speaker 2>bringing their masculine toxic violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the world of lesbianism.</v>

1871
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 2>And they're not willing to be honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1872
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:51.270
<v Speaker 2>And there was all this crazy debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on back and forth.</v>

1873
01:20:51.271 --> 01:20:54.000
<v Speaker 2>This lady was citing statistics of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many.</v>

1874
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering how accurate that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many women in which she</v>

1875
01:20:57.781 --> 01:20:59.130
<v Speaker 2>was a lesbian and she was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1876
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:01.920
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that you're a fucking expert,</v>

1877
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 2>100 percent on facts if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian,</v>

1878
01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 2>but she was pretty adamant she was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian who was like,</v>

1879
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing she was saying,</v>

1880
01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.273
<v Speaker 2>lesbians like women and that she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know any lesbians that want to date a </v>

1881
01:21:15.901 --> 01:21:17.460
<v Speaker 2>transgender woman like that.</v>

1882
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Used to have someone who used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man and is now a woman.</v>

1883
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:22.820
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what we're attracted to it.</v>

1884
01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And actually women wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of negate the argument because</v>

1885
01:21:26.911 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

1886
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.153
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if formerly male transgender women are </v>

1887
01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:35.280
<v Speaker 2>beating up their lesbian girlfriends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there are lesbians out there.</v>

1888
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:39.840
<v Speaker 2>There are some that are dating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to these transgender women.</v>

1889
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does get it muddy there,</v>

1890
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:43.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's saying like,</v>

1892
01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:45.150
<v Speaker 2>we're not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1893
01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:45.984
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stats then don't back up your </v>

1894
01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:49.110
<v Speaker 2>argument because that's clearly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're indicating.</v>

1895
01:21:49.111 --> 01:21:49.944
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that these transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>women that were formerly men are dating </v>

1896
01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:55.500
<v Speaker 2>women and beating him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was saying,</v>

1897
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:56.383
<v Speaker 2>and people she knows her friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like Elizabeth and Sarah aren't into </v>

1898
01:22:01.231 --> 01:22:02.100
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's supposed to.</v>

1899
01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:03.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how else could,</v>

1900
01:22:03.061 --> 01:22:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1901
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have like a pole you gals </v>

1902
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 2>out there and eating pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like eating fake pussy.</v>

1903
01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1904
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.530
<v Speaker 2>That's a wild stat to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never thought of that.</v>

1905
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:14.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was this going back and forth </v>

1906
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:21.591
<v Speaker 2>with lesbians versus a transgender women</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they started getting.</v>

1907
01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Some people started getting hostile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's just cut the shit.</v>

1908
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:28.980
<v Speaker 2>You have a y chromosome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking man.</v>

1909
01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:30.840
<v Speaker 2>And then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1910
01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:36.410
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of you want us to assume</v>

1911
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.953
<v Speaker 2>and not just assume we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want us to just go along with the </v>

1912
01:22:43.711 --> 01:22:48.711
<v Speaker 2>idea that you absolutely are the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender and there's no way that you could</v>

1913
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:50.604
<v Speaker 2>just be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you could actually have </v>

1914
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:54.840
<v Speaker 2>gender dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you could actually have a</v>

1915
01:22:54.841 --> 01:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible and that's.</v>

1916
01:22:57.450 --> 01:23:01.290
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the weird things about any</v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

1917
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a certain amount of</v>

1918
01:23:03.571 --> 01:23:06.600
<v Speaker 2>people that are mentally insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're mentally there.</v>

1919
01:23:06.601 --> 01:23:07.900
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1920
01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any group,</v>

1921
01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:11.710
<v Speaker 2>any group or there's a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a thousand people,</v>

1922
01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain percentage of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are just going to be insane.</v>

1923
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to gender,</v>

1924
01:23:17.351 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to ignore that were never</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to think like out of your mind.</v>

1925
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1926
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.320
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

1927
01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1928
01:23:24.821 --> 01:23:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely a woman born in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man's body and did I tell you,</v>

1929
01:23:28.151 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I support all the trans rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone doing all this stuff.</v>

1930
01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that I ever go like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem right is with athletics.</v>

1931
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing where I feel like </v>

1932
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.033
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I don't feel like someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be able to play any sport </v>

1933
01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 2>compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like when a dude,</v>

1934
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.440
<v Speaker 2>it transitions to becoming a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1935
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:48.490
<v Speaker 2>I play basketball now.</v>

1936
01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

1937
01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get it.</v>

1938
01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:52.410
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1939
01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you have the right to live your life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

1940
01:23:54.251 --> 01:23:55.084
<v Speaker 2>but like you have all those skills that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you developed as a man and now you're </v>

1941
01:24:00.971 --> 01:24:04.330
<v Speaker 2>playing against frailer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller,</v>

1942
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1943
01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:08.770
<v Speaker 2>To say that like you can't bring that </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1944
01:24:08.771 --> 01:24:11.290
<v Speaker 2>that that's offensive is ridiculous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1945
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to fighting.</v>

1946
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.863
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the big one and that was where </v>

1947
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I really understood like how bizarre and</v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive for that.</v>

1948
01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How cult like this,</v>

1949
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:28.630
<v Speaker 2>this ideology is that like to see you </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition to a woman and fight women.</v>

1950
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.710
<v Speaker 2>It'd be fun to have what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 murder charges.</v>

1951
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 2>That would be the fun part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1952
01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:36.034
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

1953
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.460
<v Speaker 2>The bone structure is so different and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that deny that are fucking crazy.</v>

1954
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1955
01:24:40.050 --> 01:24:41.320
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is silly,</v>

1956
01:24:41.321 --> 01:24:43.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I like transition,</v>

1957
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:47.510
<v Speaker 2>whatever anyone man and does a power </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting well,</v>

1958
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:48.403
<v Speaker 2>people have done that and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning and breaking all these records </v>

1959
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.120
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why are we like,</v>

1960
01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:54.910
<v Speaker 2>why are we not stopping being like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know.</v>

1961
01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.230
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't want to save people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

1962
01:24:57.231 --> 01:24:58.064
<v Speaker 2>Exactly and silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really fascinating is in the </v>

1963
01:25:00.761 --> 01:25:05.761
<v Speaker 2>process of being super progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1964
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.903
<v Speaker 2>you go towards the most maligned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part section of society which is like </v>

1965
01:25:11.981 --> 01:25:12.814
<v Speaker 2>transgender people and so everybody else</v>
<v Speaker 2>who also has been marginalized by </v>

1966
01:25:17.621 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 2>society like women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women get put on there.</v>

1967
01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.910
<v Speaker 2>They get put in a less protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>

1968
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:26.223
<v Speaker 2>Transgender women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a man becomes a more protected class </v>

1969
01:25:31.391 --> 01:25:34.990
<v Speaker 2>of woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a natural born woman herself.</v>

1970
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:36.920
<v Speaker 2>That's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1971
01:25:36.921 --> 01:25:38.200
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very true.</v>

1972
01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1973
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:40.024
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because all these women that </v>
<v Speaker 2>got beaten up by that man who became a </v>

1974
01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:45.490
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started fighting in mma,</v>

1975
01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.533
<v Speaker 2>fought to women before ever disclosing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that she used to be a man </v>

1976
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:54.790
<v Speaker 2>because she said it was a medical issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had nothing to do with them,</v>

1977
01:25:54.791 --> 01:25:59.790
<v Speaker 2>which is just shows you how completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane the logic behind all this.</v>

1978
01:25:59.790 --> 01:26:02.350
<v Speaker 2>She's still fight this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She hasn't been awhile,</v>

1979
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

1980
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.410
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows she lost to a woman who </v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

1981
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was an actual one who wound up.</v>

1982
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:09.531
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1983
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:11.400
<v Speaker 3>I said actual fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.360
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1985
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you say?</v>

1986
01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:19.130
<v Speaker 3>That's wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1987
01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:22.130
<v Speaker 3>That a woman beat good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1988
01:26:22.131 --> 01:26:23.770
<v Speaker 3>she's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not going to fight her.</v>

1989
01:26:23.771 --> 01:26:24.950
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just strong.</v>

1990
01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't look at her and think like,</v>

1991
01:26:27.981 --> 01:26:28.814
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she fights like Chris Cyborg or she </v>

1992
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.120
<v Speaker 3>boxes like Claressa shields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1993
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.080
<v Speaker 3>she's not that unbelievably talented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is physically way different.</v>

1994
01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a fucking man.</v>

1995
01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Some man for 30 years had children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was when I knew it was crazy.</v>

1996
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I got into conversation with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>online with this woman was like,</v>

1997
01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.250
<v Speaker 3>she's always been a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1998
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:54.550
<v Speaker 3>even when she got another woman pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had children with her and she goes,</v>

1999
01:26:54.891 --> 01:26:56.450
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even then she was a woman.</v>

2000
01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.313
<v Speaker 3>She was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a woman that fucked another </v>

2001
01:26:58.461 --> 01:27:00.690
<v Speaker 3>woman who got her pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2002
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:02.180
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just hang up.</v>

2003
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.010
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing?</v>

2004
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.873
<v Speaker 3>I know like this is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to tap out of those kinds of </v>

2005
01:27:07.001 --> 01:27:08.300
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even Bruce Jenner,</v>

2006
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:12.050
<v Speaker 3>when he transitioned to Caitlyn Jenner </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then eventually got his.</v>

2007
01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>His surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2008
01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Got Her surgery become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said even before the surgery though,</v>

2009
01:27:17.901 --> 01:27:20.840
<v Speaker 3>it didn't change anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always 100 percent a woman.</v>

2010
01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then why get surgery?</v>

2011
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.793
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're thinking that gender is </v>

2012
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 3>just with Genitalia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liam mistake you personally.</v>

2013
01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.580
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's genders,</v>

2014
01:27:34.581 --> 01:27:36.200
<v Speaker 3>not just genitals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in your mind.</v>

2015
01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2016
01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:43.080
<v Speaker 3>so it's also a facial reconstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just said something fucking stupid and I</v>

2017
01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.640
<v Speaker 3>just let you know how dumb that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the difference?</v>

2018
01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:47.593
<v Speaker 3>Someone said that there's gender and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's there's biological sex and </v>

2019
01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:57.660
<v Speaker 3>gender is the operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and biological sex is the hardware.</v>

2020
01:27:58.130 --> 01:27:58.963
<v Speaker 3>I hundred percent agree.</v>

2021
01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:01.983
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outrage over transgender female weight </v>

<v Speaker 3>lifter who destroy her rivals by </v>

2034
01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden you have to </v>

<v Speaker 3>Sandbagging.</v>

2039
01:28:56.970 --> 01:28:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what a lot of it is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What a lot of it is,</v>

2042
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:03.510
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to admit that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2043
01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:04.533
<v Speaker 3>sandbagging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know what it means is like </v>

2044
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:08.690
<v Speaker 3>you would get that in martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>tournaments,</v>

2045
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.980
<v Speaker 3>like say you would have a tournament and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tournament would be um,</v>

2046
01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 3>like for blue belts on lane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like one rank above white belt</v>

2047
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:16.913
<v Speaker 3>and then guys would be like a black belt</v>
<v Speaker 3>in judo and they would enter into the </v>

2048
01:29:19.801 --> 01:29:24.430
<v Speaker 3>blue belt division and dump everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like a belt in that,</v>

2049
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:25.883
<v Speaker 3>but he's sandbagging and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what they're doing and </v>

2050
01:29:28.021 --> 01:29:30.530
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that shit and you,</v>

2051
01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:31.364
<v Speaker 3>you see there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of that where people just </v>

2052
01:29:33.781 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 3>want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way they can win is by competing</v>

2053
01:29:36.421 --> 01:29:37.800
<v Speaker 3>against people that are not on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>same level.</v>

2054
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:38.663
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't think that people do that </v>

2055
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:40.883
<v Speaker 3>when they switch over from being a man </v>
<v Speaker 3>for 30 years and then competing as a </v>

2056
01:29:44.191 --> 01:29:47.190
<v Speaker 3>woman and not tell them and just start </v>
<v Speaker 3>smashing these women.</v>

2057
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 3>So there's something in that that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand.</v>

2058
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:52.770
<v Speaker 3>Athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand competition.</v>

2059
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:56.370
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand sandbaggers and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand the kind of people that</v>

2060
01:29:56.371 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't tell people about that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

2061
01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2062
01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:01.560
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to look at it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2063
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:02.453
<v Speaker 3>They want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything has to go through the filter </v>

2064
01:30:04.321 --> 01:30:05.154
<v Speaker 3>of being progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to err on the side of being </v>

2065
01:30:09.691 --> 01:30:10.524
<v Speaker 3>the most open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most liberal in the most </v>

2066
01:30:13.081 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 3>progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm 100 percent for.</v>

2067
01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 3>If women want to fight a transgender </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

2068
01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.113
<v Speaker 3>if a woman wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be able to ride </v>

2069
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:26.550
<v Speaker 3>bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be able to sky dive.</v>

2070
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:29.460
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be able to do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bungee jumping.</v>

2072
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:34.170
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy dangerous shit.</v>

2073
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.450
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to do flips with BMX </v>
<v Speaker 3>bikes.</v>

2074
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Why shouldn't you be able to fight a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

2076
01:30:39.991 --> 01:30:42.270
<v Speaker 3>transgender woman?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A woman that used to be a man.</v>

2077
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:44.280
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a man,</v>

2078
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:45.360
<v Speaker 3>you're up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2079
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.190

<v Speaker 3>I don't advise it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>

2089
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just show me.</v>

2090
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.620
<v Speaker 3>The article says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person can't decide to compete as a</v>

2091
01:31:10.621 --> 01:31:12.630
<v Speaker 3>man or a woman and this is what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like.</v>

2092
01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:15.420
<v Speaker 3>They can't decide whether to compete as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a man or a woman.</v>

2093
01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.220
<v Speaker 3>That's what he used to look like on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

2094
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Fucking a man and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2095
01:31:19.321 --> 01:31:23.010
<v Speaker 3>he was super jacked and now he is on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2096
01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.340
<v Speaker 3>an easy trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he looks like he's still.</v>

2097
01:31:26.341 --> 01:31:27.174
<v Speaker 3>A man says he hasn't a Trans Trans </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition yet still lives his life as </v>

2098
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:37.070
<v Speaker 3>both he lives his life as both seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where you're seeing that there's</v>

2099
01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:39.930
<v Speaker 3>some of these fucking people have mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>illness,</v>

2100
01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:45.020
<v Speaker 3>but there was an episode of radio lab </v>
<v Speaker 3>where this one guy who's also a girl,</v>

2101
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.673
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>switches back and forth and under </v>

2102
01:31:48.481 --> 01:31:49.314
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changes like he's Paul or ascending </v>

2103
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.560
<v Speaker 3>and this is what on what radio lab so </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2104
01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 3>but radio lab is so fucking left wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I love them.</v>

2105
01:31:58.110 --> 01:31:58.943
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're so left wing and so </v>

2106
01:32:00.821 --> 01:32:03.510
<v Speaker 3>progressive that they are unwilling to </v>
<v Speaker 3>note and,</v>

2107
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:04.423
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even even address that pro postural </v>

2108
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.800
<v Speaker 3>nature of this fucking person who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2109
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I just switched now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cindy right now.</v>

2110
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm back to Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went back to Paul in the conversation in</v>

2111
01:32:14.171 --> 01:32:16.510
<v Speaker 3>the conversation like I just turned over</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2112
01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:17.344
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did?</v>

2113
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.273
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're this special creature that can </v>

2114
01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:23.800
<v Speaker 3>just go back and forth and switch </v>
<v Speaker 3>genders or are you fucking crazy?</v>

2115
01:32:23.801 --> 01:32:24.634
<v Speaker 3>Paul Slash Cindy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would never have violated pages </v>

2116
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:30.250
<v Speaker 3>wishes in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an unfortunate understanding what,</v>

2117
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:31.450
<v Speaker 3>what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled up</v>

2118
01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:33.063
<v Speaker 4>when they had to change the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember they had to go back because </v>

2119
01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:39.330
<v Speaker 4>they got mad that they as gendered them </v>
<v Speaker 4>in their original.</v>

2120
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:42.960
<v Speaker 3>How did they miss gender?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she goes back and forth,</v>

2121
01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:48.740
<v Speaker 3>they have to keep up at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they mis-gendered.</v>

2122
01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.970
<v Speaker 3>How were they called her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A him or him or her?</v>

2123
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Which ones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mis-gendering</v>

2124
01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:56.293
<v Speaker 4>miscommunication was between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reporter and the actual person they're </v>

2125
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:00.330
<v Speaker 4>talking to.</v>

2126
01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person's fucking crazy.</v>

2127
01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:06.210
<v Speaker 3>You can't just go back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth like cut the shit.</v>

2128
01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:09.300
<v Speaker 3>You know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole thing is just preposterous.</v>

2129
01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Coming will remove references to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>

2130
01:33:11.791 --> 01:33:14.590
<v Speaker 3>She no longer recognizes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that afterwards,</v>

2131
01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:17.010
<v Speaker 3>afterwards she decided to go full </v>
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>

2132
01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.370
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened when you saw me </v>
<v Speaker 3>Craig,</v>

2133
01:33:19.371 --> 01:33:24.090
<v Speaker 3>for a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at one point in time during the show,</v>

2134
01:33:24.091 --> 01:33:25.440
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She switches like,</v>

01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:29.410
<v Speaker 3>now back to Cindy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cindy.</v>

2139
01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.980
<v Speaker 3>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At one point in time we see.</v>

2140
01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:37.973
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to say that when it </v>

2141
01:33:39.931 --> 01:33:42.540
<v Speaker 3>comes to gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to anything else,</v>

2142
01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:43.560
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2143
01:33:43.561 --> 01:33:45.810
<v Speaker 3>I recognize it as a wood Elf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Wood Elf,</v>

2144
01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.100
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I,</v>

2145
01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:51.000
<v Speaker 3>that's how I identify a sprite should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the forest,</v>

2146
01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:52.650
<v Speaker 3>flying around with the butterflies.</v>

2147
01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Like people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2148
01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:56.400
<v Speaker 3>you probably has a housing issue because</v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia.</v>

2149
01:33:56.490 --> 01:33:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's a guy who's built like brock</v>

2150
01:33:58.651 --> 01:34:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Lesnar who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2151
01:34:00.451 --> 01:34:05.190
<v Speaker 3>I've always identified as Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small thin woman and people are like,</v>

2152
01:34:05.191 --> 01:34:06.024
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who dance?</v>

2153
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should respect that.</v>

2154
01:34:08.130 --> 01:34:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should respect that.</v>

2155
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.720
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gender is true.</v>

2156
01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Weird thing that we allow all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>very illogical behavior.</v>

2157
01:34:16.071 --> 01:34:16.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2158
01:34:16.891 --> 01:34:20.730
<v Speaker 3>like these 78 plus gender step by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2159
01:34:20.731 --> 01:34:23.040
<v Speaker 3>They're adding more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more like,</v>

2160
01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.123
<v Speaker 3>there weren't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more gender pronouns now than </v>

2161
01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:28.830
<v Speaker 3>ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if it's a guy at a bus stop,</v>

2162
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:30.510
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the president.</v>

2163
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.590
<v Speaker 3>You don't go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2164
01:34:31.591 --> 01:34:33.420
<v Speaker 3>we should respect the fuck out of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2165
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:34.321
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just like,</v>

2166
01:34:34.321 --> 01:34:35.154
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identifies as the leader of the free </v>

2167
01:34:35.821 --> 01:34:37.620
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should address that.</v>

2168
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be like,</v>

2169
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.260
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand over here.</v>

2170
01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to gender,</v>

2171
01:34:42.181 --> 01:34:45.960
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We give like a lot of leeway.</v>

2172
01:34:46.210 --> 01:34:49.020
<v Speaker 3>A let a lot of things slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get us through.</v>

2173
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's for good reason.</v>

2174
01:34:52.801 --> 01:34:53.634
<v Speaker 3>I think the good part of it is that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize that there are people that </v>

2175
01:34:56.761 --> 01:34:57.594
<v Speaker 3>really wish that they were a woman would</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you to call them a woman and why </v>

2176
01:35:01.881 --> 01:35:02.714
<v Speaker 3>not let let the guy become a Gao and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there'll be happy that way and it </v>

2177
01:35:06.621 --> 01:35:09.680
<v Speaker 3>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess shows acceptance and kindness on</v>

2178
01:35:09.681 --> 01:35:12.140
<v Speaker 3>our part to just allow that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

2179
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:17.590
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn slippery slope and a lot of this</v>

2180
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:19.183
<v Speaker 3>weirdness that's going on is people </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to control other people's </v>

2181
01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:22.124
<v Speaker 3>behavior and one of the ways they try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that is try to get you to use words </v>

2182
01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:27.880
<v Speaker 3>that they've made up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2183
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:31.100
<v Speaker 3>This is where you're seeing how </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous it is.</v>

2184
01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:34.040
<v Speaker 1>The level,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2267
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:22.123
<v Speaker 1>I think we all go to like an era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that to be that fucking </v>

2268
01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Ireland smoke show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2269
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:28.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like 80 now.</v>

2270
01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because there was a time when</v>

2271
01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I was really stroking to her.</v>

2272
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Were you proud?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2273
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure when that sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrated was coming out I was </v>

2274
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:39.330
<v Speaker 1>probably like 13 or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

2275
01:39:39.331 --> 01:39:42.060
<v Speaker 1>that would have been prime time for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that era.</v>

2276
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:44.100
<v Speaker 1>It's was like when you discover what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot woman is,</v>

2277
01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.510
<v Speaker 1>when did you discover what a woman is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like someone's mom now.</v>

2278
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:50.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely Pearson.</v>

2279
01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what she used to look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.613
<v Speaker 1>So that right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be so hard for those women </v>

2281
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:57.240
<v Speaker 1>to let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And to be that hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2283
01:39:58.930 --> 01:39:59.763
<v Speaker 1>Celebrated for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now to be just like a regular old </v>

2284
01:40:02.851 --> 01:40:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Nice lady with price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice Gal.</v>

2285
01:40:07.230 --> 01:40:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Someone's mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2286
01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing about the ski stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the sports,</v>

2287
01:40:12.201 --> 01:40:13.034
<v Speaker 1>with when the swimsuit issue would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out is that they were kind of household </v>

2288
01:40:16.591 --> 01:40:17.424
<v Speaker 1>names and kind of not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you felt like you knew something by </v>

2289
01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:20.154
<v Speaker 1>learning their name.</v>

2290
01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like because it wasn't a movie star,</v>

2291
01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:26.970
<v Speaker 1>a swimsuit model was like learning that </v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

2292
01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:27.804
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about like as a teenager in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bizarre way you thought like he knew </v>

2293
01:40:31.801 --> 01:40:33.840
<v Speaker 1>them better because you knew their name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2294
01:40:33.841 --> 01:40:36.150
<v Speaker 1>so like I would be like Oh Kathy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland,</v>

2295
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Elle Macpherson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people would catch on.</v>

2296
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.820
<v Speaker 1>But you'd learn their names and feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you knew something.</v>

2297
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

2298
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:43.771
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2299
01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:44.604
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you were better than people that </v>

2300
01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:48.420

2301
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Was it like a sports thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like knowing stats like six,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2305
01:40:58.061 --> 01:40:58.894
<v Speaker 1>That was always a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right when you were young to be able to </v>

2306
01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:05.320
<v Speaker 1>pull out sports stats and players' names</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know the entire lineup.</v>

2307
01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:09.360
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I saw this thing a already lange.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like like the two teams that played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about you can be like </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some really,</v>

2314
01:41:31.811 --> 01:41:36.700
<v Speaker 1>really ridiculous stats to know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking banana baseball fan.</v>

2315
01:41:36.730 --> 01:41:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this level of it is really.</v>

2316
01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2317
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't he do like sports radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

2318
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:45.670
<v Speaker 1>He did for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't he?</v>

2319
01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.620
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did with Nick Depaulo.</v>

2320
01:41:47.621 --> 01:41:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that like a sports radio show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

2321
01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2322
01:41:51.881 --> 01:41:52.930
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2323
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:54.880
<v Speaker 1>he checked himself into Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2324
01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:56.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so because he was doing that </v>

2325
01:41:57.281 --> 01:42:02.281
<v Speaker 1>show with Anthony and then I think he </v>
<v Speaker 1>checked himself into Rehab.</v>

2326
01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2327
01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2328
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:07.740

2332
01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:15.030
<v Speaker 1>He's one of.</v>

2333
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I think so because he was on it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first season and yeah,</v>

2334
01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.280

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hard ones.</v>

2336
01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 1>He's a true addict.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

2340
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:32.120
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that sports analogy has,</v>

2341
01:42:32.121 --> 01:42:33.550
<v Speaker 1>is fucking crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of sports knowledge now </v>

2343
01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.180

<v Speaker 1>I like college football and so like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2347
01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I can hold a conversation with different</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of college football fans.</v>

2348
01:42:51.461 --> 01:42:52.294

<v Speaker 1>United States like that?</v>

2359
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:27.303
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got this weird ability to draw </v>

2360
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:33.880
<v Speaker 1>every state that he went all 50 states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He draws the shape of them,</v>

2361
01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:36.030
<v Speaker 1>puts it together in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the.</v>

2363
01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his ability to do that.</v>

2364
01:43:42.941 --> 01:43:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

2365
01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is before everybody knew he grabbed</v>

2366
01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.830
<v Speaker 1>butts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's already impressive.</v>

2368
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.873

01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:58.910
<v Speaker 2>completely freehand and it's an accurate</v>
<v Speaker 2>map of the country.</v>

2370
01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.710
<v Speaker 2>How is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2371
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:04.490
<v Speaker 2>because he's a real patriot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that's kind of</v>

2372
01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 2>disturbing and sad about the whole Al </v>
<v Speaker 2>Franken thing.</v>

2373
01:44:08.690 --> 01:44:09.523
<v Speaker 2>The worst they got out of him was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he may or may not have grabbed </v>

2374
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:16.990
<v Speaker 2>someone's,</v>

01:44:17.530 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he did or he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is basically it.</v>

2376
01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's resigning.</v>

2377
01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.840
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to be a senator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he's done and.</v>

2378
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:30.080
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't get them on anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like completely horrible.</v>

2379
01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.333
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he may or may not have squirrels in </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But that guy is interesting.</v>

2423
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:39.560
<v Speaker 2>He was a national champion swimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2424
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a kid,</v>

2425
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:42.420
<v Speaker 2>like a thin guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2426
01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Lean and thin and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's competing against guys.</v>

2427
01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Most of the guys he competes against are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a that guys,</v>

2428
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 1>the next smallest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically everyone,</v>

2429
01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.300
<v Speaker 1>all the other guys were like six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

2430
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

2431
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:56.770
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

2432
01:46:56.770 --> 01:46:58.170
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24:30.</v>

2433
01:46:59.040 --> 01:46:59.720
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2434
01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:04.720
<v Speaker 1>the swimmer guy has to eat like all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they explained the physiology.</v>

2435
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Look at that size of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

2436
01:47:06.781 --> 01:47:07.381
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2437
01:47:07.381 --> 01:47:11.700
<v Speaker 1>27.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're just Jesus Christ.</v>

2438
01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:15.420
<v Speaker 1>So they're so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this level of competition is.</v>

2439
01:47:15.450 --> 01:47:17.430
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy from game of thrones </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

2440
01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:18.773
<v Speaker 1>He's a competitor too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the physiology of I'm </v>

2441
01:47:24.210 --> 01:47:29.210
<v Speaker 1>eating that much to sustain the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you have to put on the weight</v>

2442
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:35.550
<v Speaker 1>like the you need the fat and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained how,</v>

2443
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:38.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like his physique is like that.</v>

2444
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:40.133
<v Speaker 1>He's just kind of put together that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the guys have these big </v>

2445
01:47:42.901 --> 01:47:43.734
<v Speaker 1>barrel bellies and a doctor explains how</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain level of consumption the </v>

2446
01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:53.670
<v Speaker 1>these guys all basically get Belize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2447
01:47:53.730 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 1>like because people are like why do they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get fat?</v>

2448
01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:56.573
<v Speaker 1>And just as you think that they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining it so when you're that big </v>

2449
01:48:00.031 --> 01:48:02.310
<v Speaker 1>and you lifting that much weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be fast.</v>

2450
01:48:02.311 --> 01:48:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically what the guy says.</v>

2451
01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:07.030
<v Speaker 1>But the game of thrones guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really that far,</v>

2452
01:48:07.050 --> 01:48:07.883
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's one of the unique cases where </v>

2453
01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:16.620
<v Speaker 1>he is actually built to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>viking.</v>

2454
01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:17.483
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guys are eating so much to </v>

2455
01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.313
<v Speaker 1>sustain themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to pick up and recover from all </v>

2456
01:48:25.651 --> 01:48:26.484
<v Speaker 1>this crazy weight lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who is essentially born </v>

2457
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:31.320
<v Speaker 1>walking around six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

2458
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.580
<v Speaker 1>three 95 or whatever the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a unique freak,</v>

2459
01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:39.180
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guys have to eat crazy amounts</v>

2460
01:48:39.181 --> 01:48:39.961
<v Speaker 1>of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2461
01:48:39.961 --> 01:48:42.510
<v Speaker 1>they show what one of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would blow your mind.</v>

2462
01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.860
<v Speaker 1>He forced feeds himself like nine times </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day and he has to.</v>

2463
01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:47.930
<v Speaker 1>He said he has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2464
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.690
<v Speaker 1>And has he ever tried to not do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he's less strong?</v>

2465
01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2466
01:48:53.250 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the force feeding yourself,</v>

2467
01:48:55.021 --> 01:48:56.490
<v Speaker 1>make yourself stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2468
01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is interesting.</v>

2469
01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you get stronger if you're fatter</v>

2470
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:03.403
<v Speaker 1>or do you need that much food to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the muscles up and if you just eat that </v>

2471
01:49:06.451 --> 01:49:07.284
<v Speaker 1>much food to keep the muscles up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a certain amount of </v>

2472
01:49:08.641 --> 01:49:09.710
<v Speaker 1>fat that's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2473
01:49:09.711 --> 01:49:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that's more of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it goes.</v>

2474
01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:14.520
<v Speaker 1>They talk about steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2475
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:15.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

2476
01:49:15.511 --> 01:49:18.860
<v Speaker 1>No bullshit documentary then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like they did fucking guys.</v>

2477
01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:19.710
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>

2478
01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:22.800
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing about that world.</v>

2479
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:24.650
<v Speaker 1>That's this swimmer guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

2480
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:26.640

<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying if you were going to,</v>

2483
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:34.303
<v Speaker 1>there was a film about a guy working out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the backyard and a bunch of guys </v>

2484
01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:40.630
<v Speaker 1>showed up to suck his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the guy didn't even believe it</v>

2485
01:49:40.730 --> 01:49:41.563
<v Speaker 1>was real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that one of those guys could </v>

2486
01:49:44.341 --> 01:49:48.490
<v Speaker 1>just become a woman and just enter into </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's weightlifting competitions,</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some women that are just </v>

2529
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:44.350
<v Speaker 3>physical freaks and there's some women </v>
<v Speaker 3>that also take steroids.</v>

2530
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:45.383
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another very controversial issue </v>

2531
01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:51.520
<v Speaker 3>because you have women that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingesting large amounts of male hormones</v>

2532
01:51:51.521 --> 01:51:54.880
<v Speaker 3>and changing their physiology and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they also compete against women,</v>

2533
01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.730
<v Speaker 3>but then there's women or just women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2534
01:51:58.810 --> 01:52:00.970
<v Speaker 3>What about them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about looking out for them?</v>

2535
01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:01.983
<v Speaker 3>How about not letting them get their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head smashed in fairview and this comes </v>

2536
01:52:05.441 --> 01:52:06.550
<v Speaker 3>down to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair,</v>

2537
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>

2538
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:09.873
<v Speaker 3>It just shows you how silly people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten and about how weird we are about </v>

2539
01:52:15.371 --> 01:52:19.480
<v Speaker 3>looking at things and that everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so and it because they don't have.</v>

2540
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:21.430
<v Speaker 3>They don't really have a personal stake </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the game.</v>

2541
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:23.223
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is so concerned about being </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewed as being incredibly progressive </v>

2542
01:52:26.561 --> 01:52:27.750
<v Speaker 3>and open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:31.030
<v Speaker 3>That they don't want to criticize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting point because if</v>

2544
01:52:31.031 --> 01:52:35.140
<v Speaker 3>you really put yourself in a competition</v>
<v Speaker 3>you care about say like,</v>

2545
01:52:35.141 --> 01:52:35.974
<v Speaker 3>it's important to you to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself competing in something where </v>

2546
01:52:38.411 --> 01:52:43.411
<v Speaker 3>it's important to you to when they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they we're going to have this person</v>

2547
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:45.740
<v Speaker 3>in and those are the circumstances you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

2548
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.240
<v Speaker 3>You'd be the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>

2549
01:52:47.241 --> 01:52:48.600
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2550
01:52:48.650 --> 01:52:51.740
<v Speaker 3>that is not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those women get called bigots.</v>

2551
01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets.</v>

2552
01:52:52.611 --> 01:52:54.040
<v Speaker 3>It's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2553
01:52:54.041 --> 01:52:54.874
<v Speaker 3>that is very straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those women get attacked online like a </v>

2554
01:52:57.231 --> 01:52:58.064
<v Speaker 3>bunch of women that didn't want to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>that transgender man who became a woman </v>

2555
01:53:01.570 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 3>in mma and they got called bigots and </v>
<v Speaker 3>transphobia and that and the transgender</v>

2556
01:53:05.481 --> 01:53:06.314
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That community is like super aggressive </v>

2557
01:53:09.021 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 3>about defending that intellectual turf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defending that idea.</v>

2558
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:13.363
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting place is work </v>

2559
01:53:14.850 --> 01:53:15.683
<v Speaker 3>where you go because you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>empathy for let's say this transgender </v>

2560
01:53:19.251 --> 01:53:20.810
<v Speaker 3>person who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to compete,</v>

2561
01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:21.620
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2562
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:24.590
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how is.</v>

2563
01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:28.040
<v Speaker 3>How is this circumstance fair to both </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides?</v>

2564
01:53:28.190 --> 01:53:29.023
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to those women that that are really </v>

2565
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:32.323
<v Speaker 3>wanting attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of part of the wanting to compete </v>

2566
01:53:34.431 --> 01:53:35.264
<v Speaker 3>is also wanting attention and wanting </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone to know that you're a man or </v>

2567
01:53:38.661 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 3>transition to a woman and that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2568
01:53:41.391 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of energy in that.</v>

2569
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:44.623
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to that and and anybody who </v>

2570
01:53:47.061 --> 01:53:48.590
<v Speaker 3>says no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's preposterous.</v>

2571
01:53:48.591 --> 01:53:50.930
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want their privacy when it comes to</v>

2572
01:53:50.931 --> 01:53:51.764
<v Speaker 3>these matters and they they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be open to the </v>

2573
01:53:53.901 --> 01:53:57.130
<v Speaker 3>ridicule bullshit bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2574
01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:59.300
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want attention 100 percent.</v>

2575
01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.310
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're competing with what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>

2576
01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:05.180
<v Speaker 3>It's why they're letting everybody know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the first openly transgender woman.</v>

2577
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:06.223
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of this is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some of it is about transgender </v>

2578
01:54:09.051 --> 01:54:09.884
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about transparency and showing </v>

2579
01:54:11.121 --> 01:54:13.120
<v Speaker 3>people how many of those folks are out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2580
01:54:13.121 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot of it's about horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2581
01:54:16.101 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it.</v>

2582
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:18.643
<v Speaker 3>I mean for you to sign up for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition when you know what's what </v>

2583
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:26.570
<v Speaker 3>wildly attention getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially things like power lifting and</v>

2584
01:54:26.571 --> 01:54:30.890
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to deny that there's some sort of a</v>

2585
01:54:30.891 --> 01:54:32.120
<v Speaker 3>difference in the male frame.</v>

2586
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:33.103
<v Speaker 3>There's also a lot of horseshit when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to like what actually happens to </v>

2587
01:54:35.721 --> 01:54:40.430
<v Speaker 3>the body during transition and how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength you lose and how much bone mass</v>

2588
01:54:40.431 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 3>you lose and there's a woman named Dr </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ramona crushed sick.</v>

2589
01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:46.003
<v Speaker 3>I think that's her name and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewed her and she's one of the </v>

2590
01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:48.374
<v Speaker 3>very few people that's been interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this as an actual endocrinologist </v>

2591
01:54:51.321 --> 01:54:56.321
<v Speaker 3>that's not a gender transition doctor </v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

2592
01:54:57.110 --> 01:54:57.943
<v Speaker 3>That's what a lot of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the people that talk about </v>

2593
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:00.374
<v Speaker 3>these things and have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these discussions about these things </v>

2594
01:55:02.811 --> 01:55:06.920
<v Speaker 3>that are hashtag experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually transitioned doctors so</v>

2595
01:55:06.921 --> 01:55:07.754
<v Speaker 3>they have a vested interest in sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing the ideology that there's no </v>

2596
01:55:13.761 --> 01:55:17.080
<v Speaker 3>physical advantage and that these women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2597
01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:18.493
<v Speaker 3>they once they have been under these </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormonal treatments for x amount of </v>

2598
01:55:21.561 --> 01:55:22.394
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they become physiologically a woman and </v>

2599
01:55:24.261 --> 01:55:27.350
<v Speaker 3>there's no distinction between them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a biological woman.</v>

2600
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 3>But this one woman doctor Ramona </v>
<v Speaker 3>critique,</v>

2601
01:55:29.770 --> 01:55:33.560
<v Speaker 3>she wrote an article for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was.</v>

2602
01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.430
<v Speaker 3>It was either SB nation or bloody elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was,</v>

2603
01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:39.350
<v Speaker 3>but they interviewed her and she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2604
01:55:39.351 --> 01:55:40.184
<v Speaker 3>not only do you not lose bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you maintain it because you're </v>

2605
01:55:43.111 --> 01:55:44.970
<v Speaker 3>taking estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

2606
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:45.833
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the is that a man has more bone </v>

2607
01:55:47.281 --> 01:55:48.240
<v Speaker 3>density.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're thicker,</v>

2608
01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:51.750
<v Speaker 3>they're built different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you would lose a lot of that in</v>

2609
01:55:51.751 --> 01:55:52.584
<v Speaker 3>your transition to being a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't lose the bone density </v>

2610
01:55:54.661 --> 01:55:55.494
<v Speaker 3>because estrogen is actually what causes</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to maintain their bone density </v>

2611
01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:01.710
<v Speaker 3>when they're older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're women,</v>

2612
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:02.903
<v Speaker 3>like that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to women when they get older to </v>

2613
01:56:04.301 --> 01:56:05.134
<v Speaker 3>get osteoporosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What part of the problem is that your </v>

2614
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:08.663
<v Speaker 3>body doesn't produce as much estrogen as</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to and so you have a lack of </v>

2615
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:11.910
<v Speaker 3>bone density.</v>

2616
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:12.743
<v Speaker 3>One way to heighten that it's to </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplement with estrogen interested </v>

2617
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 3>actually maintains bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a good argument,</v>

2618
01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:23.820
<v Speaker 3>but they're not the same as men because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have testosterone anymore.</v>

2619
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:26.190
<v Speaker 3>And if they're not taking exogenous </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

2620
01:56:26.191 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 3>they're definitely a have a disadvantage</v>
<v Speaker 3>against men,</v>

2621
01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:30.440
<v Speaker 3>but they still would have an advantage </v>
<v Speaker 3>against men about,</v>

2622
01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:32.610
<v Speaker 3>against women rather than mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage,</v>

2623
01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's also a mental advantage.</v>

2624
01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:40.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a reaction advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reaction time is quicker with,</v>

2625
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:41.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with men than with women.</v>

2626
01:56:41.881 --> 01:56:42.714
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a bunch of weird three d </v>
<v Speaker 3>space recognition advantages that men </v>

2627
01:56:47.071 --> 01:56:47.904
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the thing that people </v>

2628
01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 3>want to pretend that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between men and women.</v>

2629
01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.630
<v Speaker 3>There's that group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that group.</v>

2630
01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:55.493
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that seems like so stupid to even </v>

2631
01:56:57.331 --> 01:56:59.080
<v Speaker 3>entertain the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2632
01:56:59.140 --> 01:56:59.973
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a common thing among the most </v>

2633
01:57:01.501 --> 01:57:02.334
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous of the progressives is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no biological difference in the </v>

2634
01:57:05.131 --> 01:57:05.964
<v Speaker 3>sexes.</v>

2635
01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:07.313
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wha,</v>

2636
01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:12.930
<v Speaker 3>how could anything dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is dumb,</v>

2637
01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:18.170
<v Speaker 3>but it shows you how insane a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this thinking is,</v>

2638
01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:19.853
<v Speaker 3>is that this group think this mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive thought process that they </v>

2639
01:57:24.061 --> 01:57:24.894
<v Speaker 3>just accept things that they're totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrational and then repeat them as ad </v>

2640
01:57:28.171 --> 01:57:29.004
<v Speaker 3>nauseum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we played this one clip where </v>

2641
01:57:30.361 --> 01:57:31.194
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like as a transgender man to a </v>

2642
01:57:33.961 --> 01:57:34.794
<v Speaker 3>woman to man who's saying she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking was Jordan Peterson debate and </v>

2643
01:57:39.901 --> 01:57:42.390
<v Speaker 3>she was saying there's no biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between the Saxon.</v>

2644
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd be happy to unpack that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2645
01:57:45.090 --> 01:57:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be happy to unpack biology.</v>

2646
01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:49.013
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just no difference at all in our </v>

2647
01:57:51.301 --> 01:57:54.040
<v Speaker 3>biology is now it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2648
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:57.830
<v Speaker 3>There's no biological basis and sex in </v>
<v Speaker 3>general.</v>

2649
01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:01.380
<v Speaker 3>What did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an expert.</v>

2650
01:58:01.381 --> 01:58:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Dig It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2651
01:58:02.490 --> 01:58:03.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he transphobic.</v>

2652
01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Are you a bigot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this an this is an expert?</v>

2653
01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:07.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's teaching at a college.</v>

2654
01:58:08.050 --> 01:58:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2655
01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would follow,</v>

2656
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:10.950
<v Speaker 3>but that's what a lot of good lots going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2657
01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:13.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that going on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleges where people are teaching.</v>

2658
01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievably ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go right buddy.</v>

2659
01:58:16.710 --> 01:58:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2660
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah.</v>

2661
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:20.663
<v Speaker 3>Tommy buns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As done the three hour podcasts and </v>

2662
01:58:22.031 --> 01:58:25.220
<v Speaker 3>while it doesn't have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bladder for it too,</v>

2663
01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:27.210
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can go live with that.</v>

2664
01:58:27.211 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well it's too late.</v>

2665
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:31.860
<v Speaker 3>We'll go live with tyron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he comes in earlier later,</v>

2666
01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:34.320
<v Speaker 3>people were parking in front of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>garage again.</v>

2667
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Fuck heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So young.</v>

2668
01:58:37.711 --> 01:58:38.544
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This game that Tommy Buns and Ari </v>

2669
01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:43.353
<v Speaker 3>Shaffir and Bert Kreischer went to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was the game that you were </v>

2670
01:58:45.161 --> 01:58:46.090
<v Speaker 3>interested in as well.</v>

2671
01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:47.870
<v Speaker 4>I was watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was actually a really,</v>

2672
01:58:47.871 --> 01:58:49.010
<v Speaker 4>really good game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were.</v>

2673
01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:52.610
<v Speaker 4>They took the side of Georgia who turned</v>
<v Speaker 4>out to not be the victors,</v>

2674
01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:53.473
<v Speaker 4>but the final five minutes of the game </v>
<v Speaker 4>was insane and you as non football fan </v>

2675
01:58:57.531 --> 01:58:59.000
<v Speaker 4>could probably watch it and enjoy it </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2676
01:58:59.150 --> 01:58:59.983
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2677
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Now let me ask you this because this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was going to ask.</v>

2678
01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:03.473
<v Speaker 3>Is there any other sport like football </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has the kind of attention on the </v>

2679
01:59:06.931 --> 01:59:07.764
<v Speaker 3>college level because it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does basketball have that kind of </v>

2680
01:59:11.551 --> 01:59:14.580
<v Speaker 3>attention to people care as much about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>championship game in March,</v>

2681
01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:16.080
<v Speaker 3>in March,</v>
<v Speaker 3>March madness.</v>

2682
01:59:16.130 --> 01:59:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what my marketed thing,</v>

2683
01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:19.050
<v Speaker 3>but not baseball.</v>

2684
01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:20.250
<v Speaker 4>Baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2685
01:59:20.250 --> 01:59:21.820
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do have a college world series,</v>

2686
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:24.250
<v Speaker 4>but nobody gives a fuck about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>summer when no one's paying attention.</v>

2687
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:25.303
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2688
01:59:25.610 --> 01:59:28.340
<v Speaker 3>But that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as in terms of other sports,</v>

2689
01:59:28.341 --> 01:59:29.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no other ones.</v>

2690
01:59:30.490 --> 01:59:31.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just trying to think.</v>

2691
01:59:31.391 --> 01:59:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a little attention,</v>

2692
01:59:34.121 --> 01:59:34.954
<v Speaker 4>but it's very small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in their world they sell out arenas </v>

2693
01:59:37.961 --> 01:59:39.430
<v Speaker 4>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not televised.</v>

2694
01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in wrestling it's really only other.</v>

2695
01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:43.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like wrestling fans that are into </v>

2696
01:59:45.731 --> 01:59:47.110
<v Speaker 3>it and you're not a national thing</v>

2697
01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:47.973
<v Speaker 4>given that knife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure not every college has a </v>

2698
01:59:49.841 --> 01:59:50.674
<v Speaker 4>wrestling team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like they almost all have a </v>

2699
01:59:52.391 --> 01:59:54.430
<v Speaker 4>football team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost all have a basketball team.</v>

2700
01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:56.500
<v Speaker 4>They don't all have wrestling team.</v>

2701
01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:57.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2702
01:59:57.931 --> 01:59:59.490
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>highlighting,</v>

2703
01:59:59.491 --> 02:00:00.900
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this article about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2704
02:00:01.050 --> 02:00:01.883
<v Speaker 3>the coaches and about how the coaches </v>
<v Speaker 3>were getting these large bonuses for </v>

2705
02:00:05.251 --> 02:00:07.190
<v Speaker 3>victory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2706
02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:07.831
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2707
02:00:07.831 --> 02:00:11.850
<v Speaker 3>they were saying how crazy it is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids that are playing aren't getting</v>

2708
02:00:11.851 --> 02:00:12.684
<v Speaker 3>any money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that these fucking coaches are </v>

2709
02:00:14.641 --> 02:00:19.641
<v Speaker 3>making shit tons of money and that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university prophets massively from these</v>

2710
02:00:20.571 --> 02:00:21.404
<v Speaker 3>successful football programs and yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>these athletes who are damaging their </v>

2711
02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:26.184
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damaging their body and then a large </v>

2712
02:00:28.111 --> 02:00:28.944
<v Speaker 3>percentage of them are never even going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go onto a career in professional </v>

2713
02:00:31.981 --> 02:00:32.814
<v Speaker 3>sports.</v>

2714
02:00:33.090 --> 02:00:36.480
<v Speaker 4>So I'm pulling this up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this now here's another pop up.</v>

2715
02:00:36.481 --> 02:00:37.400
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2716
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:38.663
<v Speaker 4>this summer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was right before the </v>

2717
02:00:40.441 --> 02:00:43.440
<v Speaker 4>basketball season started this a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scandal.</v>

2718
02:00:43.441 --> 02:00:45.870
<v Speaker 4>It had hit the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rick Pitino is,</v>

2719
02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:49.680
<v Speaker 4>I think he might've been running the </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic program in some capacity,</v>

2720
02:00:49.681 --> 02:00:51.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he was the age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was definitely.</v>

2721
02:00:51.871 --> 02:00:52.704
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the top basketball </v>
<v Speaker 4>coaches in the country and he was </v>

2722
02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.620
<v Speaker 4>getting 98 percent of the cash of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal they had with Adidas.</v>

2723
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:03.383
<v Speaker 4>And what</v>

2724
02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:05.690
<v Speaker 3>did she know about this deal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2725
02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.050
<v Speaker 3>That's so he raked in 98 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cash from the University of Louisville.</v>

2726
02:01:10.051 --> 02:01:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Is Current Adidas deal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that possible?</v>

2727
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:14.720
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

2728
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:17.600
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to explain how it can even </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

2729
02:01:17.630 --> 02:01:19.880
<v Speaker 4>If you watch the movie blue chips from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the nineties,</v>

2730
02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:20.714
<v Speaker 4>they sort of almost tap into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this was 15 years even before this </v>

2731
02:01:24.771 --> 02:01:26.970
<v Speaker 4>has happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a whole extra world going on.</v>

2732
02:01:26.971 --> 02:01:27.290
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2733
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:28.690
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what's funny.</v>

2734
02:01:28.810 --> 02:01:29.643
<v Speaker 3>The reporter asked him of some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proceeds will be shared with the </v>

2735
02:01:31.271 --> 02:01:33.220
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says in quotes,</v>

2736
02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:36.040
<v Speaker 3>it's for the athletic department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>junk reply.</v>

2737
02:01:36.041 --> 02:01:38.590
<v Speaker 3>How do you say his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Derek Jurich replied.</v>

2738
02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:44.600
<v Speaker 3>It's for these student athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been earmarked for them high.</v>

2739
02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:48.380
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the current deal with Adidas,</v>

2740
02:01:48.381 --> 02:01:49.214
<v Speaker 3>which explained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which expires July first 98 percent of </v>

2741
02:01:52.731 --> 02:01:55.250
<v Speaker 3>the cash provided by adidas goes to one </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

2742
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.910
<v Speaker 3>Rick Pitino the now suspended head </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach.</v>

2743
02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:03.830
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the next sentence.</v>

2744
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two Thousand Fifteen,</v>

2745
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:07.700
<v Speaker 3>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2746
02:02:07.701 --> 02:02:08.534
<v Speaker 3>one point $5 million went to Pitino </v>
<v Speaker 3>under his personal services agreement </v>

2747
02:02:11.781 --> 02:02:12.614
<v Speaker 3>with the Apparel Company is $25,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went to the program according to the </v>

2748
02:02:16.821 --> 02:02:20.540
<v Speaker 3>contract obtained by the courier journal</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the State's public records act</v>

2749
02:02:21.810 --> 02:02:25.570
<v Speaker 1>the year before the department got 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand and we got one point 5 million.</v>

2750
02:02:25.930 --> 02:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they pay him so much?</v>

2751
02:02:28.210 --> 02:02:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Because he didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can recruit a,</v>

2752
02:02:30.610 --> 02:02:31.443
<v Speaker 1>it's so he can recruit the kids to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>school because he's got the name and </v>

2753
02:02:34.751 --> 02:02:37.900
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he's got some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to sell them also,</v>

2754
02:02:37.901 --> 02:02:38.830

2761
02:02:56.171 --> 02:02:57.004

<v Speaker 1>Those NBA deals are the best fucking </v>

2762

<v Speaker 1>deals in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guaranteed contracts to play and the</v>

<v Speaker 1>The NBA guys for the top tier guys,</v>

2765
02:03:11.261 --> 02:03:12.094
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a very select few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nine figures before they ever </v>

2766
02:03:15.461 --> 02:03:16.294
<v Speaker 1>played ball like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're signing like hundred million </v>

<v Speaker 1>dollar deals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus for they play professional </v>

2768
02:03:22.121 --> 02:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2769
02:03:23.591 --> 02:03:24.424
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking amazing and outrageous </v>

2770
02:03:26.711 --> 02:03:27.544
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money.</v>

2771
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:31.670
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about under armour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how one,</v>

2772
02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:32.513
<v Speaker 1>what was the player that said nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to play in under armour's having </v>

2773
02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>there and said that he needs sank the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock.</v>

2774
02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:38.313
<v Speaker 3>By saying that because universities have</v>
<v Speaker 3>deals with sneaker competence and that </v>

2775
02:03:41.921 --> 02:03:42.754
<v Speaker 3>no one wanted to play for Maryland </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't want to play with </v>

2776
02:03:44.981 --> 02:03:45.814
<v Speaker 3>under armour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to wear under armor and </v>

2777
02:03:47.441 --> 02:03:52.000
<v Speaker 3>everything just went and they had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggling ever since.</v>

2778
02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2779
02:03:52.990 --> 02:03:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2780
02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:57.650
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to me the way under armour </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been able to compete,</v>

2781
02:03:57.710 --> 02:04:01.130
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is so outrageous that that's a</v>

2782
02:04:01.131 --> 02:04:04.400
<v Speaker 1>former university of Maryland student </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

2783
02:04:04.401 --> 02:04:05.234
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a student athlete and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was able to start an apparel </v>

2784
02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.440
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Athletic Company,</v>

2785
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:16.250
<v Speaker 1>and really actually compete with Adidas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nike.</v>

2786
02:04:16.251 --> 02:04:17.084
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is so nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like you starting a fucking </v>

2787
02:04:21.471 --> 02:04:24.200
<v Speaker 1>car tomorrow and then you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2790
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:31.430
<v Speaker 1>That's how nuts that is to break into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that field.</v>

2791
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:32.241
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2792
02:04:32.241 --> 02:04:33.074

<v Speaker 1>Yet his men that they have that shit so </v>

2793
02:04:35.091 --> 02:04:37.530
<v Speaker 1>locked down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have such deep pockets.</v>

2794
02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:41.370
<v Speaker 1>They're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the levels of endorsements and like what</v>

2795
02:04:41.371 --> 02:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>he started doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the under armour guy wouldn't even pay.</v>

2796
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Like now they have paid endorsed </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

2797
02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but at first people were just liking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gear.</v>

2798
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:53.610
<v Speaker 1>He was like one of the first ones to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop that,</v>

2799
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you know that like tight fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe.</v>

2800
02:04:57.031 --> 02:04:57.864
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like compression gear and like he </v>

2801
02:05:00.421 --> 02:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>developed some of it and we'd give it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a former p,</v>

2802
02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:05.730
<v Speaker 1>like people he knew at University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland,</v>

2803
02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:06.680
<v Speaker 1>we're now like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it was like that.</v>

2806
02:05:11.010 --> 02:05:11.731
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2807
02:05:11.731 --> 02:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>just kind of a very organic way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing,</v>

2808
02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:19.170
<v Speaker 1>of like somebody would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you bake something and you're like,</v>

2809
02:05:19.171 --> 02:05:19.891
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tastes good,</v>

2810
02:05:19.891 --> 02:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>like you make me another one from me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends.</v>

2811
02:05:22.110 --> 02:05:22.943
<v Speaker 1>It was that I was reading something </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting where they were </v>

2812
02:05:24.811 --> 02:05:25.644
<v Speaker 1>saying that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking up the brand because </v>

2813
02:05:27.571 --> 02:05:28.404
<v Speaker 1>they've put them into discount stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to raise the sails </v>

2814
02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:35.250
<v Speaker 1>and by raising the sales they put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a discount stores and by putting them</v>

2815
02:05:35.251 --> 02:05:36.084
<v Speaker 1>in the discount stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to change the way people </v>

2816
02:05:37.741 --> 02:05:38.490
<v Speaker 1>look at the brand.</v>

2817
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:41.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be worth as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a very realistic man.</v>

2818
02:05:41.970 --> 02:05:45.950
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird people think so weird and no.</v>

2819
02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:48.180
<v Speaker 1>If you saw a pair of Nike's at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discount store,</v>

<v Speaker 1>more press and like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of just feeds itself and people </v>

2852
02:07:00.031 --> 02:07:00.864
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same school of thought and now </v>

2853
02:07:02.071 --> 02:07:03.300
<v Speaker 1>though that guy.</v>

2854
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:07.470
<v Speaker 1>So he has a son in Lonzo plays for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lakers,</v>

2855
02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:09.510
<v Speaker 1>who's a fourth round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first round draft pick,</v>

2856
02:07:09.511 --> 02:07:14.511
<v Speaker 1>like a top tier player from Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then his other son was two more sons.</v>

2857
02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:20.130
<v Speaker 1>One of them was on Ucla team this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got arrested for shoplifting in China.</v>

2858
02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:22.380
<v Speaker 1>If he hadn't been released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't high,</v>

2859
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:23.223
<v Speaker 1>blissfully highly publicized thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely could have gone to jail </v>

2860
02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:28.140
<v Speaker 1>for a while in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't fuck around,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

2863
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>when he got out and came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lavar pulled him from like from school,</v>

2864
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:41.190

<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2869
02:07:56.410 --> 02:07:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely some,</v>

2870
02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:59.230
<v Speaker 1>some good players that come out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2871
02:07:59.590 --> 02:08:00.423
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a circus over there if you </v>

2872
02:08:02.861 --> 02:08:04.660
<v Speaker 1>see like how it was when they arrived.</v>

2873
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like some crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reception,</v>

2874
02:08:08.441 --> 02:08:10.150
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is he trying to do now is trying</v>

2875
02:08:10.151 --> 02:08:12.550
<v Speaker 1>to start some new league.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to do a couple things.</v>

2876
02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:13.413
<v Speaker 1>He started a brand big baller brand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that's like their ball and </v>

2877
02:08:18.670 --> 02:08:19.503
<v Speaker 1>they came out with these shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're basically $500 retail sneakers </v>

2878
02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:24.273
<v Speaker 1>and if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's expensive because you're not a </v>

2879
02:08:25.061 --> 02:08:26.220
<v Speaker 1>big baller bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

2880
02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:27.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what are they like made by a </v>

2881
02:08:29.191 --> 02:08:31.680
<v Speaker 1>real organization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didas no,</v>

2882
02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2883
02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:32.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2884
02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:35.140
<v Speaker 1>They're not made by definitely not any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2885
02:08:35.141 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>the sun that's in the NBA turned down </v>
<v Speaker 1>real money,</v>

2886
02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:40.293
<v Speaker 1>like real fucking money because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the father demanded that you basically </v>

2887
02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>pay to develop this brand from the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2888
02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.753
<v Speaker 1>apparel and the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us like a billion dollar contract </v>

2889
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:55.730
<v Speaker 1>and like develop this brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2890
02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2891
02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2892
02:08:58.781 --> 02:09:01.810
<v Speaker 1>well then we're not even going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you about endorsing my science.</v>

2893
02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

2894
02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then now he's had like,</v>

2895
02:09:06.070 --> 02:09:06.903
<v Speaker 1>there's so much a conversation about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand that he's definitely elevated the </v>

2896
02:09:13.931 --> 02:09:15.910
<v Speaker 1>awareness of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we don't know,</v>

2897
02:09:15.911 --> 02:09:16.744
<v Speaker 1>what nobody knows is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what level are they actually selling </v>

2898
02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:21.600
<v Speaker 1>this apparel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2899
02:09:21.610 --> 02:09:23.350
<v Speaker 1>like are they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they have everything.</v>

2900
02:09:23.351 --> 02:09:24.184
<v Speaker 1>They have shirts and shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just got it rated an f by the </v>

2901
02:09:26.650 --> 02:09:30.610
<v Speaker 1>better business bureau because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes are not the ones they sold.</v>

2902
02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:33.940
<v Speaker 1>They sold a bunch of shoes and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that people are getting are not</v>

2903
02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:35.590
<v Speaker 1>what they bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are pissed.</v>

2904
02:09:35.650 --> 02:09:37.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to return refund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:09:38.010 --> 02:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Great Fund or exchange them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2906
02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:41.530
<v Speaker 1>and they're just telling people they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally.</v>

2907
02:09:41.531 --> 02:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I think I read that the customer service</v>
<v Speaker 1>people told you,</v>

2908
02:09:43.650 --> 02:09:44.483
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be a brook baller then if </v>

2909
02:09:45.730 --> 02:09:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you're not satisfied.</v>

2910
02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's literally what my God.</v>

2911
02:09:50.290 --> 02:09:51.490
<v Speaker 1>But he's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's.</v>

2912
02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:52.570
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2913
02:09:52.730 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>

2914
02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.920
<v Speaker 1>he took these kids to Lithuania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to play basketball.</v>

2915
02:09:56.921 --> 02:09:58.780
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically says they're going to be on</v>

2916
02:09:58.781 --> 02:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>the Lakers when my three sons are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be Lakers.</v>

2917
02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have no idea really realistically</v>

2918
02:10:04.961 --> 02:10:09.961
<v Speaker 1>whether the two younger sons even have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know to be fair whether they're</v>

2919
02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:12.670
<v Speaker 1>going to be mba quality players yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2920
02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:15.850
<v Speaker 1>like the clearly one is the one is on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lakers,</v>

2921
02:10:15.851 --> 02:10:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but so we don't know if that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pan out in any way,</v>

2922
02:10:18.431 --> 02:10:22.120
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also talked about developing a league</v>

2923
02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:23.673
<v Speaker 1>for like kids that are coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school that don't want to go to </v>

2924
02:10:27.071 --> 02:10:32.071
<v Speaker 1>college and play in a league where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get paid like a salary,</v>

2925
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable salary,</v>

2926
02:10:35.150 --> 02:10:38.870
<v Speaker 2>which is an idea that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is fascinating.</v>

2927
02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know logistically whether he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could pull that off,</v>

2928
02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a know for sure.</v>

2929
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:45.711
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2930
02:10:45.711 --> 02:10:46.544
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is one that people have </v>

2931
02:10:47.511 --> 02:10:48.344
<v Speaker 2>talked about for years because college </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes generate a lot of revenue </v>

2932
02:10:52.210 --> 02:10:53.350
<v Speaker 2>getting fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2933
02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Pay Athletes Getting pimped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2934
02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:57.860
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in football and basketball.</v>

2935
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:58.723
<v Speaker 2>But will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were telling me what I was talking </v>

2936
02:10:59.541 --> 02:11:01.600
<v Speaker 2>to Jamie when you went to Pete about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2937
02:11:01.670 --> 02:11:04.460
<v Speaker 2>how big the game was that you went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking God.</v>

2938
02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:07.610
<v Speaker 2>And I was saying is what about baseball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baseball like down,</v>

2939
02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:07.941
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2940
02:11:07.941 --> 02:11:09.440
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a fuck about college </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball.</v>

2941
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Basketball is a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said March madness.</v>

2942
02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Definitely those are the big college </v>
<v Speaker 2>football.</v>

2943
02:11:14.650 --> 02:11:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Get that big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the end.</v>

2944
02:11:17.181 --> 02:11:19.340
<v Speaker 2>It's worth billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many billions.</v>

2945
02:11:19.341 --> 02:11:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2946
02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kids aren't getting paid.</v>

2947
02:11:22.221 --> 02:11:24.230
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any fucking sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2948
02:11:24.250 --> 02:11:25.540
<v Speaker 2>we've got a free scholarship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2949
02:11:25.610 --> 02:11:27.770
<v Speaker 2>He could go to school for free and oh </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Get $25,000 a years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the free education.</v>

2951
02:11:31.730 --> 02:11:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2952
02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I tend to agree.</v>

2953
02:11:35.070 --> 02:11:35.903
<v Speaker 4>I'd say there's a couple of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a interesting story that came out </v>

2954
02:11:37.591 --> 02:11:39.990
<v Speaker 4>earlier this year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's on one of the teams that did really</v>

2955
02:11:39.991 --> 02:11:41.880
<v Speaker 4>good UFC or ucf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2956
02:11:42.170 --> 02:11:43.003
<v Speaker 4>GCFS kicker was a youtuber right as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>season started and he got in trouble </v>

2957
02:11:47.371 --> 02:11:51.570
<v Speaker 4>because he was making profit off of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>likeness on Youtube.</v>

2958
02:11:51.571 --> 02:11:53.310
<v Speaker 4>So they took away his ability to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2959
02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:54.233
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got kicked off the team and I think </v>

2960
02:11:54.991 --> 02:11:55.790
<v Speaker 4>he left the team.</v>

2961
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking monsters.</v>

2964
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:03.583
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't own people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're providing a service that makes </v>

2972
02:12:29.171 --> 02:12:32.990
<v Speaker 2>value is because they ain't worth a </v>

<v Speaker 2>so he takes like two hour lunches and </v>

3045
02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:42.630

<v Speaker 3>One couldn't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't see where her feet were while </v>

3071
02:16:48.701 --> 02:16:49.810
<v Speaker 3>she was running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her brain.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's just tough.</v>

3073
02:16:53.250 --> 02:16:54.083
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's mental toughness that some </v>

3074
02:16:55.691 --> 02:17:00.691
<v Speaker 3>people have that is almost an </v>
<v Speaker 3>explainable like you don't like.</v>

3075
02:17:00.941 --> 02:17:04.360
<v Speaker 3>What makes them that tough?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it.</v>

3076
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 3>The ability to block out all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative voices.</v>

3077
02:17:07.871 --> 02:17:09.310
<v Speaker 3>The stock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3078
02:17:09.550 --> 02:17:10.690
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about personalities,</v>

3079
02:17:10.691 --> 02:17:12.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a personality like burt.</v>

3080
02:17:12.430 --> 02:17:14.710
<v Speaker 3>It can be the life of the party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not me.</v>

3081
02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never been that guy.</v>

3082
02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

3083
02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:22.420
<v Speaker 3>If we're all hanging around together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all drinking.</v>

3084
02:17:22.421 --> 02:17:23.254
<v Speaker 3>I can make everybody laugh and be silly </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we could all have a good time </v>

3085
02:17:25.121 --> 02:17:25.954
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't gravitate towards that </v>

3086
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:29.470
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of behavior.</v>

3087
02:17:29.590 --> 02:17:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Whereas burt can walk into a liquor </v>
<v Speaker 3>store and having everybody sing along to</v>

3088
02:17:33.101 --> 02:17:33.934
<v Speaker 3>I would die for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got his phone out and people are </v>

3089
02:17:36.011 --> 02:17:39.700
<v Speaker 3>dancing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's genuine personality type too.</v>

3090
02:17:39.730 --> 02:17:41.680
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his personality type.</v>

3091
02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:42.543
<v Speaker 3>Some people have that personality type </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they'll get up at 4:30 in the </v>

3092
02:17:45.941 --> 02:17:50.941
<v Speaker 3>morning and you know it's dark outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they relish the fact that they don't</v>

3093
02:17:51.101 --> 02:17:54.640
<v Speaker 3>want to put the running shoes on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to hit that mountain and</v>

3094
02:17:54.641 --> 02:17:55.474
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They relish the fact that there there's </v>

3095
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:58.870
<v Speaker 3>going to struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like it.</v>

3096
02:17:58.930 --> 02:18:00.790
<v Speaker 3>They like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like the pain,</v>

3097
02:18:00.791 --> 02:18:04.570
<v Speaker 3>they liked the stinging of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lungs is there.</v>

3098
02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:07.540
<v Speaker 3>Your lungs struggle to fill with air </v>
<v Speaker 3>would like it.</v>

3099
02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

3100
02:18:09.010 --> 02:18:09.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like also the fact that other </v>

3101
02:18:10.931 --> 02:18:11.764
<v Speaker 3>people can't do what they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That like the fact that there's people </v>

3102
02:18:13.811 --> 02:18:14.644
<v Speaker 3>that are in bed that are comfortably </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep while they're out there doing it </v>

3103
02:18:17.921 --> 02:18:18.970
<v Speaker 3>and it gives them an edge.</v>

3104
02:18:19.210 --> 02:18:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3105
02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3106
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:22.173
<v Speaker 3>what makes a person's personality to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>this outgoing extrovert like Bert </v>

3107
02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:27.633
<v Speaker 3>Kreischer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes that stoic individual that </v>

3108
02:18:29.171 --> 02:18:31.360
<v Speaker 3>can sit and go over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3109
02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:35.890
<v Speaker 3>like an accountant who can just sit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>go over things for hours and hours.</v>

3110
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:36.743
<v Speaker 3>A coder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody could sit in front of a </v>

3111
02:18:37.811 --> 02:18:38.644
<v Speaker 3>computer and go over a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 hours a day is worth a certain </v>

3112
02:18:40.810 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 3>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of human,</v>

3113
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:43.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3114
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:48.781
<v Speaker 3>Because both of those personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never entertain just so far from</v>

3115
02:18:50.561 --> 02:18:52.720
<v Speaker 3>what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by personalities.</v>

3116
02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just find it.</v>

3117
02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:56.253
<v Speaker 3>There's so many variables like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as to what makes a person who they are </v>

3118
02:19:00.101 --> 02:19:02.880
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how it changes over time and who,</v>

3119
02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.140
<v Speaker 3>who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more you consider yourself.</v>

3120
02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I did a podcast yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3121
02:19:07.531 --> 02:19:08.364
<v Speaker 3>about meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all about meditation with Dan </v>

3122
02:19:10.450 --> 02:19:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Harris from Good Morning America who's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big proponent of meditation and um,</v>

3123
02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.280
<v Speaker 3>This Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Warren who wrote this book,</v>

3124
02:19:18.310 --> 02:19:19.330
<v Speaker 3>a head trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

3125
02:19:19.331 --> 02:19:21.940
<v Speaker 3>very interesting guy who was his </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation teacher.</v>

3126
02:19:22.430 --> 02:19:23.263
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking about thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>processes and the mind and managing on </v>

3127
02:19:27.501 --> 02:19:28.334
<v Speaker 3>and managing the way you do things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do things and how much of these </v>

3128
02:19:30.861 --> 02:19:31.694
<v Speaker 3>little weird kinks and pitfalls can just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip you up and fuck you up in your </v>

3129
02:19:34.911 --> 02:19:35.744
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like imagine Louis ck without this </v>

3130
02:19:38.481 --> 02:19:39.314
<v Speaker 3>desire to beat off in front of women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's say he did that 10 times in </v>

3131
02:19:42.021 --> 02:19:42.854
<v Speaker 3>his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you could get to them before </v>

3132
02:19:45.111 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 3>those 10 times and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3133
02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:48.950
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a real nice guy.</v>

3134
02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:52.790
<v Speaker 3>You've always been friendly to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give good advice as a comedian.</v>

3135
02:19:52.791 --> 02:19:53.624
<v Speaker 3>Just can't beat off in front of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's going to cost you like </v>

3136
02:19:57.351 --> 02:20:01.220
<v Speaker 3>$50,000,000 one day what you think so </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3137
02:20:01.390 --> 02:20:02.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day is going to cost you </v>

3138
02:20:02.541 --> 02:20:04.730
<v Speaker 3>$50,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just beat off in front of people.</v>

3139
02:20:04.731 --> 02:20:07.820
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to work with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just don't do that.</v>

3140
02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or here's what you could do.</v>

3141
02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Pay a hooker and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to beat off in front of you.</v>

3142
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:15.103
<v Speaker 3>And she'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3143
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:19.100
<v Speaker 3>and then you give her a thousand bucks </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it costs and you beat off in</v>

3144
02:20:19.101 --> 02:20:20.930
<v Speaker 3>front of her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could do that.</v>

3145
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:22.190
<v Speaker 3>And he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

3146
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.023
<v Speaker 3>That's not to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like what would make a person what </v>

3147
02:20:29.001 --> 02:20:31.430
<v Speaker 3>makes a person tick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3148
02:20:31.450 --> 02:20:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3149
02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:34.340
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it inside your head?</v>

3150
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Like it's all your experiences really </v>
<v Speaker 3>that become your personality.</v>

3151
02:20:38.241 --> 02:20:41.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it that there's your </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

3152
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 3>there's managing your particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology,</v>

3153
02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:46.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many,</v>

3154
02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:47.650
<v Speaker 3>so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3155
02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:48.493
<v Speaker 3>Because like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at the age now to where you can </v>

3156
02:20:50.091 --> 02:20:50.924
<v Speaker 3>see like with your children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see how they're a certain </v>

3157
02:20:55.071 --> 02:20:56.410
<v Speaker 3>age now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you go like,</v>

3158
02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I saw that trait in you when you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

3159
02:20:59.210 --> 02:21:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3160
02:21:00.570 --> 02:21:02.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see like the stuff that's natural in</v>

3161
02:21:02.841 --> 02:21:03.674
<v Speaker 3>someone there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural personality trait and then </v>

3162
02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:10.160
<v Speaker 3>you sprinkle life on top of that starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>to develop who the person becomes.</v>

3163
02:21:10.310 --> 02:21:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Well your son son's probably just now </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to talk you.</v>

3164
02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:14.533
<v Speaker 3>You will start to have a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with them and then you'll </v>

3165
02:21:16.071 --> 02:21:19.490
<v Speaker 3>start to see you in them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it gets really weird.</v>

3166
02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:22.430
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've inherited all my craziness.</v>

3167
02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:24.860
<v Speaker 3>You see that in your nine year old in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>

3168
02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got a lot of my crazy enter.</v>

3169
02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3170
02:21:28.171 --> 02:21:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you totally see yourself.</v>

3171
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>She gets obsessed with things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got assessed where she just,</v>

3172
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.903
<v Speaker 3>she'll just do them like all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we went on a vacation and we were </v>

3173
02:21:38.331 --> 02:21:43.220
<v Speaker 3>walking back from the resort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did cartwheels all the way back from</v>

3174
02:21:43.221 --> 02:21:45.290
<v Speaker 3>the resort to the room.</v>

3175
02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:50.450
<v Speaker 3>It was a half mile to find cartwheels </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over again.</v>

3176
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:53.540
<v Speaker 3>She just gets nuts about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it the kind of thing we were like,</v>

3177
02:21:53.541 --> 02:21:54.860
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should probably stop doing that,</v>

3178
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:56.480
<v Speaker 3>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let her do it.</v>

3179
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3180
02:21:58.130 --> 02:21:58.963
<v Speaker 3>I think as long as your kids aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurting themselves and hurting other </v>

3181
02:22:01.551 --> 02:22:03.740
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you say,</v>

3182
02:22:03.741 --> 02:22:04.910
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do that,</v>

3183
02:22:04.911 --> 02:22:06.140
<v Speaker 3>the more they're going to want to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3184
02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:07.293
<v Speaker 3>It's just natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I try to do is encourage healthy </v>

3185
02:22:10.881 --> 02:22:12.290
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3186
02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I try to like when it comes to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>candy and sugar and stuff like that,</v>

3187
02:22:15.861 --> 02:22:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I try to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taste great,</v>

3188
02:22:17.770 --> 02:22:18.603
<v Speaker 3>taste amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're really only supposed to have </v>

3189
02:22:21.651 --> 02:22:24.890
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of it for your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just it's bad for your body,</v>

3190
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:25.861
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3191
02:22:25.861 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

3192
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.540
<v Speaker 2>don't just give them the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3193
02:22:27.541 --> 02:22:28.890
<v Speaker 2>you can eat candy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3194
02:22:28.891 --> 02:22:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3195
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:31.210
<v Speaker 2>little bit's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit.</v>

3196
02:22:31.211 --> 02:22:32.640
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a little bit.</v>

3197
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's understand what it is like,</v>

3198
02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:39.450
<v Speaker 2>let's be aware of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't be afraid of it.</v>

3199
02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Don't run from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know?</v>

3200
02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:42.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody died because they had an ice </v>

3201
02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:45.160
<v Speaker 2>cream once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3202
02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:46.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to hurt.</v>

3203
02:22:46.201 --> 02:22:47.430
<v Speaker 2>You just don't have it every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

3204
02:22:47.431 --> 02:22:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get crazy.</v>

3205
02:22:48.481 --> 02:22:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Don't let it become a part of everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are.</v>

3206
02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:54.720
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I do the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>though is encouraged them.</v>

3207
02:22:54.721 --> 02:22:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Like what are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they enjoy doing?</v>

3208
02:22:57.271 --> 02:22:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you enjoy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3209
02:22:59.371 --> 02:23:02.670
<v Speaker 2>like my youngest one loves art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves to draw,</v>

3210
02:23:02.730 --> 02:23:04.920
<v Speaker 2>loves it because it's constantly drawing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this awesome.</v>

3211
02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Like let's draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

3212
02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:07.790
<v Speaker 2>let's look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do smart.</v>

3213
02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:08.953
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's something like find </v>

3214
02:23:10.771 --> 02:23:15.530
<v Speaker 2>out whatever it is where you can find </v>
<v Speaker 2>this avenue for expression and,</v>

3215
02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:16.373
<v Speaker 2>and I want to encourage that as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can because I feel like if there's </v>

3216
02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:24.600
<v Speaker 2>anything in this life that'll guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 2>you some satisfaction or some feeling of</v>

3217
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:26.730
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment or some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

3218
02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:30.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some way to fuel your passions,</v>

3219
02:23:30.481 --> 02:23:33.600
<v Speaker 2>it's find something that really hits </v>
<v Speaker 2>your switches.</v>

3220
02:23:34.350 --> 02:23:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Find that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you found it,</v>

3221
02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:37.581
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You found it,</v>

3222
02:23:37.581 --> 02:23:38.460
<v Speaker 2>but stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3223
02:23:38.461 --> 02:23:39.294
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3224
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:42.000
<v Speaker 2>but you imagine doing something else </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than stand up?</v>

3225
02:23:42.001 --> 02:23:42.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

3226
02:23:42.991 --> 02:23:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>

3227
02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:45.053
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell people that all the time </v>

3228
02:23:45.991 --> 02:23:46.824
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's the thing you become </v>

3229
02:23:48.421 --> 02:23:50.280
<v Speaker 2>aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you get older you're like,</v>

3230
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:55.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm so lucky that I do the thing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really liked doing the most.</v>

3231
02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:57.343
<v Speaker 2>That's really the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you meet people like at the </v>

3232
02:24:00.390 --> 02:24:02.490
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I talked to people who,</v>

3233
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:03.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just happy with what they're just </v>

3234
02:24:04.721 --> 02:24:05.554
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy with my life and this and </v>

3235
02:24:06.241 --> 02:24:06.690
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3236
02:24:06.690 --> 02:24:08.690
<v Speaker 2>what is it you really want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they got,</v>

3237
02:24:08.691 --> 02:24:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real question,</v>

3238
02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:14.430
<v Speaker 2>real question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody wanted a trade lives,</v>

3239
02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Bezos wanted to trade lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to be Jeff Bezos,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you get 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$5,000,000,000,</v>

3241
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:21.420
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do standup anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3242
02:24:21.421 --> 02:24:22.650
<v Speaker 2>because I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

3243
02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so hard for people to imagine.</v>

3244
02:24:25.141 --> 02:24:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>

3245
02:24:26.431 --> 02:24:27.264

<v Speaker 2>fuck would turn that down?</v>

3247
02:24:32.671 --> 02:24:33.504
<v Speaker 2>But it's like I don't really feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm turning something down because I </v>

3248
02:24:36.270 --> 02:24:37.103

<v Speaker 2>And then there's the other part that's </v>

<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

3342
02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll.</v>

3345
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:24.500
<v Speaker 3>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen that video game where</v>

3346
02:28:24.501 --> 02:28:28.910
<v Speaker 3>you hit a golf ball in the virtual golf </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball screen?</v>

3347
02:28:28.970 --> 02:28:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make that with archery.</v>

3348
02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:33.020

<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3349
02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:37.790
<v Speaker 3>So there's the animals walk across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen and you shoot it,</v>

3350
02:28:37.791 --> 02:28:38.624
<v Speaker 3>the animals with a regular compound bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And instead of having sharp pointed </v>

<v Speaker 3>tips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3353
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:48.103
<v Speaker 3>like the head of a nail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these animals walk across the </v>

3354
02:28:50.691 --> 02:28:55.370
<v Speaker 3>screen and you literally shoot at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>target and like,</v>

3355
02:28:55.371 --> 02:28:58.200
<v Speaker 3>watch it'll show you like it's going to </v>

3368
02:29:24.921 --> 02:29:26.900
<v Speaker 1>right on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3369
02:29:26.901 --> 02:29:28.550
<v Speaker 1>They have one in Vegas and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3370
02:29:28.590 --> 02:29:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 25 locations.</v>

3371
02:29:30.130 --> 02:29:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all over the place.</v>

3372
02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>We stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We stayed there for like hours hours.</v>

3373
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:35.803
<v Speaker 1>Like we thought we were going to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>around but it just became addictive and </v>

3374
02:29:38.661 --> 02:29:40.280
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just kept kept doing it.</v>

3375
02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:43.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not just driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like a bay?</v>

3376
02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like your own the tea and,</v>

3377
02:29:46.460 --> 02:29:48.080
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3378
02:29:48.081 --> 02:29:48.914
<v Speaker 1>the three of you put your names in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and you get a real golf ball and </v>

3379
02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:53.331
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3380
02:29:53.331 --> 02:29:53.840
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3381
02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:56.360
<v Speaker 1>track the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when you hit it,</v>

3382
02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:58.760
<v Speaker 1>there's targets that you can go for </v>
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>

3383
02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh you hit that flat nose like already </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the flag and it like,</v>

3384
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:07.190
<v Speaker 1>so you get like eight points and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be like your next balls were double</v>

3385
02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:10.340
<v Speaker 1>and if he hit the blue flag it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like 16 points.</v>

3386
02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:11.353
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's different games within </v>

3387
02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.950
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go just for like chip shots.</v>

3388
02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:18.650
<v Speaker 1>You can go for distance anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>

3389
02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:19.410
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were,</v>

3390
02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:20.960
<v Speaker 1>we thought we were going to play like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

3391
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I think we say four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3392
02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were all like,</v>

3393
02:30:25.211 --> 02:30:28.040
<v Speaker 1>we got to find another top golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were really,</v>

3394
02:30:28.041 --> 02:30:28.940
<v Speaker 1>really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3395
02:30:28.941 --> 02:30:32.720
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't even play golf now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know those two used to play,</v>

3396
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:36.050
<v Speaker 1>like already said he played regularly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

3397
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Same with Bert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both had much better shots than me,</v>

3398
02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:39.913
<v Speaker 1>but I was equally obsessed with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't care that I was even </v>

3399
02:30:41.961 --> 02:30:44.930
<v Speaker 1>shitting the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having so much fun doing it.</v>

3400
02:30:46.970 --> 02:30:47.803
<v Speaker 3>So many different things you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why when people tell me that </v>

3401
02:30:49.371 --> 02:30:50.590
<v Speaker 3>they're bored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3402
02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:52.040
<v Speaker 3>unless you're broke and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do,</v>

3403
02:30:52.041 --> 02:30:54.890
<v Speaker 3>but even then there's so many physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>activities that you do that are free.</v>

3404
02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:55.833
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3405

<v Speaker 1>I'm not bored.</v>

3406
02:30:57.491 --> 02:31:00.280

<v Speaker 3>he might've been like super frustrated </v>

3449
02:32:38.821 --> 02:32:39.654
<v Speaker 3>if that was the case.</v>

3483
02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:00.473
<v Speaker 3>That's rerecorded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went back and watched it after I </v>

3486
02:34:07.291 --> 02:34:09.480
<v Speaker 3>pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He walks in with his wife,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Then I watch it and in the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it there's a fucking guy in the front of</v>

3489
02:34:16.471 --> 02:34:17.950

3490
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.823
<v Speaker 2>like Richard Pryor is on stage and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there taking pictures of </v>

3491
02:34:21.341 --> 02:34:26.110

<v Speaker 2>it was an issue.</v>

3495
02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a picture and it's just a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the audience.</v>

3496

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for my shows upcoming in Austin,</v>

<v Speaker 2>North Carolina.</v>

3503
02:34:47.410 --> 02:34:49.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called Yonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3504
02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:50.763
<v Speaker 2>They take your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put it into a bag and you keep </v>

<v Speaker 2>Keep your phone,</v>

3506
02:34:55.690 --> 02:34:57.670
<v Speaker 2>but they have to open your bag when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

3507
02:34:57.671 --> 02:35:00.520
<v Speaker 2>So you're not making any phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing any tax.</v>

3508
02:35:00.521 --> 02:35:02.290
<v Speaker 2>You're not filming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing anything.</v>

3509
02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I watched Chappelle special when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle did that and I was like,</v>

3510
02:35:06.821 --> 02:35:07.654

3511
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was fucking amazing how much more</v>

3512
02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:14.650
<v Speaker 2>tuned in people are like when they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their phone.</v>

3513
02:35:14.770 --> 02:35:15.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially it just checking your texts </v>

3514
02:35:17.081 --> 02:35:18.550
<v Speaker 2>and every time you're on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3515
02:35:18.551 --> 02:35:21.450
<v Speaker 2>how many times are people just standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>there filming things?</v>

3516
02:35:21.451 --> 02:35:26.451
<v Speaker 2>So I just did a show where it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth row dark house and you just see,</v>

3517
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:32.460
<v Speaker 2>see the light fucking beacon of light </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like doing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking,</v>

3519
02:35:33.250 --> 02:35:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking and then just like trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>finish a bit and then I did it.</v>

3520
02:35:37.061 --> 02:35:37.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

3523
02:35:42.190 --> 02:35:43.023
<v Speaker 2>He's not even listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I asked him what he's doing and </v>

3524
02:35:45.011 --> 02:35:46.870
<v Speaker 2>then his friends were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3525
02:35:46.871 --> 02:35:47.501
<v Speaker 2>he looks up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3526
02:35:47.501 --> 02:35:51.160
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing for work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3527
02:35:51.170 --> 02:35:54.940
<v Speaker 2>you bought these tickets to do work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

3528
02:35:55.250 --> 02:35:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do it.</v>

3529
02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3530
02:35:57.700 --> 02:35:59.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had lighting up the whole room,</v>

3531
02:35:59.621 --> 02:36:00.800
<v Speaker 2>like always believed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't realize that.</v>

3532
02:36:00.810 --> 02:36:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like 15 minutes left.</v>

3533
02:36:03.010 --> 02:36:04.410
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>

3534
02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And he flipped it over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the phone down,</v>

3535
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:12.280
<v Speaker 2>not not two minutes later he's back on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his phone,</v>

3536
02:36:13.210 --> 02:36:14.043
<v Speaker 2>back on it back doing things that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like and I actually knew to not say </v>

3537
02:36:16.781 --> 02:36:20.170
<v Speaker 2>anything at the second time because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to.</v>

3538
02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want the show to be about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>

3539
02:36:23.070 --> 02:36:25.420
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3540
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:28.230
<v Speaker 2>But thankfully the staff noticed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they went over there and,</v>

3541
02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:29.080
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

3542
02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this from now on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this phone thing,</v>

3543
02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:34.690
<v Speaker 2>some people don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay,</v>

3544
02:36:34.691 --> 02:36:35.524
<v Speaker 2>but it's gonna make a better show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing so that people know </v>

3545
02:36:37.001 --> 02:36:39.010
<v Speaker 2>because I know a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>honor thing too,</v>

3546
02:36:39.011 --> 02:36:40.060
<v Speaker 2>is like if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3547
02:36:40.061 --> 02:36:40.960
<v Speaker 2>what if I need to.</v>

3548
02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.780
<v Speaker 2>You can actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can leave the showroom.</v>

3549
02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll unlock it for you.</v>

3550
02:36:45.551 --> 02:36:47.020
<v Speaker 2>You can make your call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3551
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.943
<v Speaker 2>In the lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just keeping people tuned in </v>

3552
02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:56.120
<v Speaker 2>and not distracting people.</v>
