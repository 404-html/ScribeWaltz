1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two we need like a digital counter.</v>

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.870
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whew.</v>

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to drink that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew,</v>

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 2>be very careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 270 milligrams of caffeine.</v>

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 2>That Ooh,</v>

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be donated.</v>

8
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 3>That allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have that.</v>

9
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Brendan drank one of those yesterday and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pot of coffee and have a cup of coffee</v>

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and then on top of that he drank a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd he have?</v>

11
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A venti with a shot of espresso in it</v>

12
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 2>from starbucks with all cha all doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he was fasting.</v>

13
00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So a halfway into the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he starts hurling,</v>

14
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 2>runs into the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throws up,</v>

15
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 2>then it comes back and then throws up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bucket at the end of the podcast.</v>

16
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Literally didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't make it out of the room</v>

17
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 3>so they could have had a heated seat if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to take a shit.</v>

18
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a heat instead of 200 7,270</v>

19
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 3>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 3>Caveman coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nitrogenated it's basically like</v>

21
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 3>espresso with nitrogen in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good stuff.</v>

22
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 3>You get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

23
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I'll take it before bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 3>that's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll have some weird dreams.</v>

25
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take Express will before I go to bed.</v>

26
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not used to this clean shaven,</v>

27
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Andrew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 3>like a different human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could sneak up on people.</v>

29
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 3>That's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

30
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 3>My daughter's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

31
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 3>about a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said they had enough of the beard so it</v>

32
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 3>had to go.</v>

33
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a,</v>

34
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 2>well when my daughter was one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine died and we on the</v>

35
00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd all had this guy,</v>

36
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Evan Tanner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is a former UFC champion.</v>

37
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 2>And we had decided that we were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna grow beards for him cause he had</v>

38
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 2>this crazy giant beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a bunch of us on the Internet did</v>

39
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just grew this fucking werewolf</v>

40
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:43.600
<v Speaker 2>beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it got to a point where I was</v>

41
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 2>it was time was up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to shave it off.</v>

43
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.350
<v Speaker 2>And my daughter had no idea what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>really looked like.</v>

44
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So I shaved my face and she started</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming.</v>

45
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>She thought it was somebody else and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>started crying and I'm like,</v>

46
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 2>touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

47
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 2>this is my normal face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she's confused.</v>

48
00:01:58.521 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that voice.</v>

49
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Like who are you there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>

50
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a sand a half with my boys.</v>

51
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were young too,</v>

52
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 3>like so they had never seen me without</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

53
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:12.731
<v Speaker 3>So like they thought you were a stranger</v>
<v Speaker 3>to then you see that that's because</v>

54
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 3>we're on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I trimmed the cheek areas cause it creep</v>

55
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:17.924
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gq.</v>

56
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Gq Did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to look fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I have to admit the fact that after</v>

58
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 3>30 years of not having a beard meeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>you right,</v>

59
00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I ended up with that beard and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>started speaking Arabic.</v>

60
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.180
<v Speaker 3>Right out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out of nowhere.</v>

61
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 3>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was more academic to go when you're</v>

62
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 3>lecturing on the lecture circuit</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes for,</v>

63
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 3>but for</v>

64
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 2>guy with your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of beard is a,</v>

65
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 2>it's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean guys who have lived your line of</v>

67
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:49.344
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

68
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like counter culture,</v>

69
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 3>so anti establishment establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's part of it.</v>

70
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like anything else you get into,</v>

71
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt normal.</v>

72
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like a,</v>

73
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 3>probably a crutch a little bit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that felt right for a long</v>

74
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a crutch,</v>

75
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.440
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's definitely like a mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

76
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.700
<v Speaker 2>the occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember a red tick mark Kinko's book.</v>

77
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Shanko Marchenko I read one of his books</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

78
00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:20.750
<v Speaker 2>way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogue Warrior.</v>

79
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were talking about guys who had</v>

80
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:27.000
<v Speaker 2>dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just how they didn't fit in with</v>

81
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:27.834
<v Speaker 2>like regular military.</v>

82
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

83
00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:30.410
<v Speaker 3>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally like,</v>

84
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unconventional.</v>

85
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Probably a better way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

86
00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:37.550
<v Speaker 3>So not in with authority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in with,</v>

87
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

88
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.050
<v Speaker 3>everybody being the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not down with uniforms,</v>

89
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:42.950
<v Speaker 3>not down with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

90
00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 3>using name and rank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

91
00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:47.060
<v Speaker 3>we called everybody by their first name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grew our hair long,</v>

92
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 3>grew beards wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just kind of,</v>

93
00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:49.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

94
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.140
<v Speaker 3>you had to earn that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

95
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:53.090
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's part of it.</v>

96
00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:53.631
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

97
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:56.630
<v Speaker 3>I earned the right to be able to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous,</v>

98
00:03:56.631 --> 00:03:57.680
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

99
00:03:57.681 --> 00:03:59.060
<v Speaker 3>And so that's kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

100
00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.923
<v Speaker 3>some of it.</v>

101
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.470
<v Speaker 2>It is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's the,</v>

102
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:04.304
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

103
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make distinctions,</v>

104
00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:10.100
<v Speaker 2>but the baddest motherfuckers in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>military are the ones who dress like,</v>

105
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.020
<v Speaker 2>like just regular savages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something,</v>

106
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>there's something odd about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

107
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just a,</v>

108
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 3>like that idea though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to earn it.</v>

109
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

110
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 3>You got to earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

111
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 3>it's like you get so tired of doing what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're told and you want to do what you</v>

112
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 3>think you need to do for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

113
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 3>So like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

114
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I see that I need to accomplish</v>

115
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 3>this task,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

116
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 3>And I don't need to be dictated from</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's not going to be there</v>

117
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 3>telling me how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that goes all the way down to</v>

118
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 3>even like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

119
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 3>well what kind of boots am I going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wear?</v>

120

<v Speaker 3>what Kinda uniform do I need to</v>

121
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.120

<v Speaker 3>things?</v>

122
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 3>And I just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way those guys are.</v>

123
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 3>They're always thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

124
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

125
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 3>not how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not how to fall in line man,</v>

126
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 3>but like how can we think differently to</v>
<v Speaker 3>solve problems and,</v>

127
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

128
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 3>the uniform is just one of those things.</v>

129
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>This is very interesting now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

130
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.120
<v Speaker 2>for just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a standalone podcast so</v>

131
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 2>people don't have to go back and listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the first one that we did.</v>

132
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.180
<v Speaker 2>We have Dr. Mark Gordon here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good friend of mine and,</v>

133
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Marr who is the founder of the</v>

134
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 2>warrior angel.</v>

135
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and my cofounder.</v>

136
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.880
<v Speaker 3>Me and my brother Adam Mar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was also in the army</v>

137
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.640
<v Speaker 2>and we did a podcast a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the people that didn't hear,</v>

138
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 2>explain what the Warrior Angels</v>
<v Speaker 2>Foundation is and what you guys do.</v>

139
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I get some context first,</v>

140
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we talked about I was special forces</v>

141
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 3>green baret for a better part of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>decade,</v>

142
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would say somebody defined by my</v>

143
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 3>vision of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

144
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 3>and so that always led me to doing what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do in life.</v>

145
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

146
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 3>special forces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spec ops type dudes,</v>

147
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 3>they're in life and death situations</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty regularly and,</v>

148
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perform,</v>

149
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise they don't live.</v>

150
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was kind of life for the</v>

151
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:05.111
<v Speaker 3>better part of 10 years being in life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and death situations on a regular basis.</v>

152
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 3>And so going from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

153
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say a high performer,</v>

154
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

155
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by every metric to one day after my last</v>

156
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 3>deployment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

157
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I woke up and I was on 13 different</v>
<v Speaker 3>medications.</v>

158
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't remember how to drive home</v>

159
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:24.820
<v Speaker 3>from the same route that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving home every day.</v>

160
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just in chronic pain all the time.</v>

161
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 3>I had these balance issues where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't walk in a straight line,</v>

162
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blurry vision would go into double</v>

163
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:36.640
<v Speaker 3>vision and I had these horrible migraine</v>
<v Speaker 3>headaches.</v>

164
00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 3>So just the ability to bring that way</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

165
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started to have become depressed.</v>

166
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 3>And this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

167
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 3>this was just mind boggling to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was living,</v>

168
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I thought my life's purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

169
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Doing the job I wanted to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people I wanted to be with Mary,</v>

170
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 3>to the woman of my dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the family that we always wanted.</v>

171
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 3>But yet here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have all these physical problems.</v>

172
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm starting to be depressed and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a reason to be depressed.</v>

173
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 3>And then I started having panic attacks</v>
<v Speaker 3>in public,</v>

174
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 3>in our weight room at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of my kids,</v>

175
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just breaking down crying and not</v>

176
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 3>knowing why and not being able to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about it.</v>

177
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

178
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 3>and then I started to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 3>and that was again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my,</v>

180
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 3>the structure of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fracturing around me.</v>

181
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

182
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

183
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know why or what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

184
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 3>and the first thing he can think to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>and something like that was to drink.</v>

185
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta I gotta stop this and I don't,</v>

186
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

187
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I think I have some screws loose or</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>

188
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 3>but all I know is this is so disastrous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if I just drank,</v>

189
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can put the,</v>

190
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 3>put the brakes on this a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

191
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things just continued to get worse</v>

192
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 3>and then my behavior just continue to</v>
<v Speaker 3>skyrocket out of control.</v>

193
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't like I was making</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious decisions to be fucked up.</v>

194
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm driving,</v>

195
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm drinking and driving on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>basis and I never even crossed my mind.</v>

196
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a wrong thing to do.</v>

197
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

198
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 3>I can't function unless I drink and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to drive.</v>

199
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's what we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

200
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.860
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

201
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 3>start producing just horrible effects on</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family with that line of behavior.</v>

202
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 3>And it got to the point and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as a special forces operator,</v>

203
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you want to do is operate.</v>

204
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 3>All you want to do is be on the team and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and do the things that we signed up</v>

205
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have any problem with that or</v>

206
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

207
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these combat scenarios are weighing</v>

208
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 3>on me and it's been too much and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just can't handle it.</v>

209
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only thing I felt comfortable</v>

210
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 3>doing and wanted to get back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

211
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

212
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 3>like I'd never had any of these symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

213
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 3>So life is just spiraling out of control</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not sleeping and everything else.</v>

214
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 3>And so finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

215
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 3>you sit on it until you can't sit on any</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

216
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 3>And it got to the point where I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

217
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not only am I a detriment to myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and probably society,</v>

218
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 3>like I can't go out and operate right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

219
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 3>like these guys can depend on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so at that point I was like,</v>

220
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I gotta raise my hand and I got to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>some help.</v>

221
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

222
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that well intended people,</v>

223
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.740
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to offer as much help and find</v>

224
00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 3>the answers as they possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

225
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 3>all that got me was 13 different</v>
<v Speaker 3>medications and,</v>

226
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:21.391
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was told,</v>

227
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had so many head injuries,</v>

228
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 3>you can't afford to take another blow to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head.</v>

229
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 3>And this is probably going to be the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

230
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be on these medications,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a pen and a pad everywhere you go.</v>

231
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

232
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 3>and learn how to live within these new</v>
<v Speaker 3>parameters and schedule out your meds</v>

233
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be that.</v>

234
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 3>And so it was a medical retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It got so bad,</v>

235
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my wife was nine months pregnant</v>

236
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 3>with our fifth child and she had to ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

237
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 3>Hey Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you keep your drinking down today in</v>

238
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 3>case I go into labor so I don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive myself to the hospital,</v>

239
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's all bad it was getting.</v>

240
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 3>And that wasn't enough to stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she actually,</v>

241
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 3>our son had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

242
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic,</v>

243
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lymphatic malformation,</v>

244
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 3>his neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he got sick.</v>

245
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:09.590
<v Speaker 3>He's like 13 months old and it got</v>
<v Speaker 3>infected and it blew up to like the size</v>

246
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 3>of a softball.</v>

247
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 3>And this is when she's nine months</v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant.</v>

248
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 3>So we have to take him to the emergency</v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

249
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 3>And my calf had been killing me for</v>
<v Speaker 3>about three days at this point.</v>

250
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think anything of it.</v>

251
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I just wrote it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're in there in the emergency</v>

252
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:23.710
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's having trouble breathing.</v>

253
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.970
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad like a softball.</v>

254
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 3>And his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

255
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 3>he turns out he has to go into emergency</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery and then becky goes into labor.</v>

256
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's up on like the fifth floor</v>

257
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:37.470
<v Speaker 3>getting emergency surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Becky's given labor to our youngest son</v>

258
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 3>on the second floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going back and forth between the</v>

259
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 3>fifth floor on the second floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like dragging my leg at this</v>

260
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 3>point cause it just stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

261
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was all in and refuse any care till I</v>

262
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 3>get these two taken care of.</v>

263
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get Jason out of surgery.</v>

264
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.751
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

265
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 3>he's on the road to recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get down for the birth.</v>

266
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have our son Joe,</v>

267
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's good to go.</v>

268
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.260
<v Speaker 3>And then it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

269
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 3>they finally rushed me to imaging and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a blood clot in my leg and it's</v>

270
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 3>broken off into both long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I have a bilateral pulmonary</v>

271
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 3>embolisms and at this point they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

272
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.230
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we have a very small window here.</v>

273
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:15.660
<v Speaker 3>This is very high mortality rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And A,</v>

274
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm like laughing at them because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

275
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 3>I was drunk at the time.</v>

276
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 3>No bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

277
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 3>you guys think this is going to kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in line.</v>

278
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 3>This isn't the vis a long line of</v>
<v Speaker 3>offenders here that,</v>

279
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>that I want a shot at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

280
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sitting there in the hospital</v>

281
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 3>room and I'm just wondering and waiting</v>
<v Speaker 3>for somebody to come explain to me like</v>

282
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 3>how life has spiraled out of control</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

283
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 3>And like somebody's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

284
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 3>this is a reason that you have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood clots.</v>

285
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what's going on with your head</v>

286
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 3>and all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just,</v>

287
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 3>it never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember like,</v>

288
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:53.450
<v Speaker 3>I got to go down and visit my son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

289
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 3>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

290
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.250
<v Speaker 3>in emergency recovery and I was there at</v>
<v Speaker 3>his hospital bed and,</v>

291
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a bottle of whiskey or airplane</v>

292
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 3>bottle of whiskey and I popped the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain pill I ever took and I shot down</v>

293
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 3>the whiskey.</v>

294
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 3>That was just normal 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

295
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 3>How I operated at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to just to cope and a,</v>

296
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I had this epiphany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

297
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 3>that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I continue on this same track and I</v>

298
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 3>continue to just wholesale buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in the medical system is,</v>

299
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 3>is telling me it's going to kill me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to ruin everything that I</v>

300
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:31.381
<v Speaker 3>love so I can stay on that route or I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can decide to act and to change what I</v>

301
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 3>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at that point it was everything.</v>

302
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.780
<v Speaker 3>And so I made the promise to my son</v>
<v Speaker 3>right then and there that I was going to</v>

303
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 3>do some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

304
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.970
<v Speaker 3>I was going to get off all medication</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was going to return to the man of</v>

305
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:50.971
<v Speaker 3>my pre-injury status too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to find a way to heal</v>

306
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then three,</v>

307
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 3>I was going to turn around and do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing for somebody else.</v>

308
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 3>And so right then and there and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital's bed,</v>

309
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Speaker 3>and I mean this is the honest to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>true story.</v>

310
00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how,</v>

311
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've had enough.</v>

312
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I've had enough of people telling me</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my life is over.</v>

313
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.490
<v Speaker 3>And at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

314
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Speaker 3>my identity was in special forces and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was taken away because of the</v>

315
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 3>medical injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

316
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't care anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still a husband.</v>

317
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm still a father and I'm going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

318
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 3>And that was enough to pull me out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

319
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 3>out of that negative spiral that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

320
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 3>And to start being proactive again and</v>
<v Speaker 3>start being defined by a vision of the</v>

321
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.040
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my vision of the future was just</v>

322
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 3>what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't know it was going to lead</v>

323
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 3>to where we're at today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was the catalyst.</v>

324
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 3>And so I started going and looking for</v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative therapies and it turned out</v>

325
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 3>like the government didn't want to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>for anything that wasn't covered by</v>

326
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 3>their insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

327
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll charge it a max it on credit cards.</v>

328
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get more credit cards.</v>

329
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if it's $1 million,</v>

330
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.560
<v Speaker 3>I will get the money and I will get</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and I will solve this problem.</v>

331
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:00.920
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

332
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.070
<v Speaker 3>then I started getting objective about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and that was like,</v>

333
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:04.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to everybody out there who's</v>

334
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 3>having head problems like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

335
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 3>what's working for you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got real interested in why did</v>

336
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 3>some things work for some people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then not work for others,</v>

337
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

338
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 3>precursor and meeting mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm starting to get really</v>

339
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 3>scientific minded or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one objective data to be able to support</v>

340
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

341
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 3>And so there's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other treatment modalities out</v>

342
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:30.541
<v Speaker 3>there and I did every single one of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of them were little bit of a</v>

343
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 3>benefit in the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>

344
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reversed or made symptoms worse.</v>

345
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was leading to that that we got</v>

346
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some publicity out of it.</v>

347
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Mark read about it and just contacted me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't know anything else about</v>

348
00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 3>me at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>

349
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:49.480
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

350
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 3>we've been treating Tbi for a number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years now here's my credentials,</v>

351
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 3>here's the background story on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's some media that I had done and it</v>

352
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 3>was a podcast that you guys had done a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple back with.</v>

353
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:02.841
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

354
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had matt Gaza Neon and I'm listening</v>

355
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 3>to Matt tell a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for the first time ever through</v>

356
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 3>hearing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

357
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

358
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 3>this isn't specific to me.</v>

359
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Like I got so wrapped up in myself like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought like the whole world's on</v>

360
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 3>pause and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this my problem.</v>

361
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 3>And I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

362
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.150
<v Speaker 3>this is a much bigger problem that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>wide reaching a repercussion is that</v>

363
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 3>doesn't just deal with me specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so as I'm hearing matt talk about</v>

364
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 3>all the problems that he's having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he's like tall telling my</v>

365
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:39.680
<v Speaker 3>story to the teeth and then I hear mark</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

366
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

367
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 3>but we can identify,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

368
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.880
<v Speaker 3>an underlying condition for all of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that we were just talking about.</v>

369
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 3>And we can measure it objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

370
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 3>that just blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I was like,</v>

371
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 3>here I am on 13 medications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there wasn't one objective</v>

372
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 3>measurement where somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's put them on antidepressant</v>

373
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 3>depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's put him on another antidepressant.</v>

374
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's put him on anti anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

375
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing objective about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

376
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

377
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 2>So they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing you were saying there</v>

378
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:08.460
<v Speaker 2>was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were measuring subjective as</v>

379
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a level of this that we need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move up.</v>

380
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a level of that we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

381
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Based off the symptoms and the</v>

382
00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:17.530
<v Speaker 3>complaints I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just throwing darts.</v>

383
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 medications from a person who never</v>

384
00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:22.630
<v Speaker 3>had any issue before</v>

385
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.250
<v Speaker 2>and to all the guys that have served</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have gone through this kind of</v>

386
00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:27.690
<v Speaker 2>thing and not just guys that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>served,</v>

387
00:16:27.691 --> 00:16:31.200
<v Speaker 2>but also when you're dealing with Tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about athletes,</v>

388
00:16:31.201 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about former fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

389
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys that have been in contact</v>
<v Speaker 2>with on a regular basis have these</v>

390
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:42.261
<v Speaker 2>issues and what mark has done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been just phenomenal,</v>

391
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.260
<v Speaker 2>was open up a new door for treatment to</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

392
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.210
<v Speaker 2>And I have talked to so many people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in contact with so many people</v>

393
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.170
<v Speaker 2>that heard about you through the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've done together and heard about</v>

394
00:16:55.171 --> 00:16:59.710
<v Speaker 2>your work and have gone on to completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>remove these medications.</v>

395
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

396
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.700
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem in psychiatry is there</v>
<v Speaker 4>are no real biological markers.</v>

397
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to use a radiographic</v>
<v Speaker 4>studies like Spec Scans,</v>

398
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Mris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pet scans,</v>

399
00:17:12.501 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 4>and what have you as rationale for</v>
<v Speaker 4>starting people on medication.</v>

400
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 4>But there's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

401
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 4>in the biomarker or the biomarker panel</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have,</v>

402
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.810
<v Speaker 4>there's a direct correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone having had a head trauma re</v>

403
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 4>regardless of it was mild or a blast</v>
<v Speaker 4>trauma like Andrew had or a slip and</v>

404
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 4>fall or someone coming up and hitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>you behind the headboard,</v>

405
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.900
<v Speaker 4>mma or boxers or Muay tight and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely zero that they use to</v>

406
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.370
<v Speaker 4>regulate what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>

407
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today's Thursday,</v>

408
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 4>let's try this drug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or this is Friday or else this month</v>

409
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:49.110
<v Speaker 4>we're giving you this Satchel of meds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As many of the vets have come up and</v>

410
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:51.300
<v Speaker 4>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending upon the day of the week</v>

411
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:55.550
<v Speaker 4>dictated what groupings of medications</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were given what,</v>

412
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 4>but let's break it down for people.</v>

413
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 4>What do you feel is the underlying cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>of all this?</v>

414
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 4>It's related to Tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

415
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 4>great question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is number one from the</v>

416
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 4>head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it elicits chemical changes in the brain</v>

417
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 4>that we call inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this inflammation leads to</v>

418
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 4>disruption of chemical processes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

419
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old alkaline batteries or the car</v>

420
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 4>batteries where we used to put distilled</v>
<v Speaker 4>water into it.</v>

421
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you put coca cola in it,</v>

422
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:27.290
<v Speaker 4>it totally changes the ability of</v>
<v Speaker 4>electrons to be conducted just like in</v>

423
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 4>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the chemistry of the brain is altered</v>

424
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 4>by the inflammation and it starts</v>
<v Speaker 4>shutting down systems so that the nerves</v>

425
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.600
<v Speaker 4>in left side of the brain can't talk to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right side,</v>

426
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 4>or the frontal lobe of the brain can</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to the temporal lobe of the brain.</v>

427
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.500
<v Speaker 4>So you have disruption of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

428
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 4>executive function,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is your ability to make correct</v>

429
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 4>decisions about things right and wrong.</v>

430
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 4>Why do we have over a million veterans</v>
<v Speaker 4>incarcerated?</v>

431
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 4>That's because they can't make the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct decisions about how to respond</v>

432
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:58.310
<v Speaker 4>to an innocuous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

433
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>approach by an individual that they</v>

434
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.810
<v Speaker 4>don't know and they respond by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

435
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:08.811
<v Speaker 4>assault or with physical or anger or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>yelling at people and that leads him</v>

436
00:19:08.911 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 4>into jail or into incarceration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

437
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Speaker 4>the inflammation leads to hormonal</v>
<v Speaker 4>deficiencies in the brain.</v>

438
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.020
<v Speaker 4>And what we've found is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since 1986,</v>

439
00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 4>Dr Baylew out of Paris found that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have enzyme systems that take</v>

440
00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:28.311
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol and convert it into hormones</v>
<v Speaker 4>that actuate and regulate our brain</v>

441
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 4>function from schizophrenia to als,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Parkinson's disease,</v>

442
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 4>to bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to all the different disorders.</v>

443
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 4>There was a recent article that I sent</v>
<v Speaker 4>out to our journal Group and Andrew's in</v>

444
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:42.580
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was about management event,</v>

445
00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 4>thigh of neuroinflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain inflammation to treat psychiatric</v>

446
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:47.814
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>

447
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.490
<v Speaker 4>And in the past six months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been starting to see a lot of</v>

448
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 4>articles talking specifically about</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>

449
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:57.300
<v Speaker 4>creating all these things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to treat with medications that</v>

450
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 4>are ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

451
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 4>last month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

452
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 4>had a class in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

453
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.390
<v Speaker 4>Arizona and I presented a group of</v>
<v Speaker 4>articles and one of the key articles was</v>

454
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 4>the fact that they found people with</v>
<v Speaker 4>atypical depression.</v>

455
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:15.930
<v Speaker 4>That's depression that doesn't respond</v>
<v Speaker 4>to traditional medication.</v>

456
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 4>So you're on whole bunch 13 medications</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're still depressed.</v>

457
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.700
<v Speaker 4>So they found in 61% of these people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>were still depressed with atypical</v>

458
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they had growth hormone deficiency.</v>

459
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.040
<v Speaker 4>And then when they replaced the growth</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormone within one to two months,</v>

460
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 4>their depression disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they had some beneficial side</v>

461
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They slept better,</v>

462
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 4>they had more mental energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were socially more adaptable,</v>

463
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 4>and they're reactive scores that</v>
<v Speaker 4>creates,</v>

464
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an assault situation.</v>

465
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 4>They were calm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone said booted them and they said,</v>

466
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.963
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who do?</v>

467
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.240
<v Speaker 4>As opposed to getting into their face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a very clear,</v>

468
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 4>and it's becoming clearer and clearer in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the literature around the world.</v>

469
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Now we've been doing this since 2004 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the inflammation is really the problem.</v>

470
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 4>So unfortunately there is no specific</v>
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>

471
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.560
<v Speaker 4>They talk about use of aspirin and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ibuprofen in things like Alzheimer's</v>

472
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:15.730
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an inflammatory disease.</v>

473
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.120
<v Speaker 4>I know I shared it with you in the past</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if a football player has one major</v>

474
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 4>concussion on the field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's 19 times at greater risk of</v>

475
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 4>developing Alzheimer's between 30 and 49</v>
<v Speaker 4>years of age because it's an</v>

476
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory illness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

477
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genetics by itself.</v>

478
00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:37.060
<v Speaker 4>There are people with genetic</v>
<v Speaker 4>predisposition to it because they</v>

479
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 4>generate this thing called Beta amyloid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But trauma,</v>

480
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.740
<v Speaker 4>any kind of trauma to the head can</v>
<v Speaker 4>elicit increased production of Beta</v>

481
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 4>amyloid and lead to these problems.</v>

482
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the traumatic brain injury causes this</v>

483
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a,</v>

484
00:21:51.701 --> 00:21:55.360
<v Speaker 4>there's a process that goes on when the</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain is dealing with this inflammation.</v>

485
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's disrupting all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these normal functions.</v>

486
00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 4>Executive functions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

487
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have different,</v>

488
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relay centers in our brain that regulate</v>

489
00:22:07.391 --> 00:22:10.500
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you're going to be calm</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you going to be hyper,</v>

490
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 4>have anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the products that we use 100%</v>

491
00:22:14.111 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 4>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 80% of our treatment is all</v>

492
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 4>natural products with 10 to 20% being</v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical products,</v>

493
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:23.820
<v Speaker 4>but no psychotropic or brain altering</v>
<v Speaker 4>medications slugging.</v>

494
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.250
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of products do you use?</v>

495
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.800
<v Speaker 4>Training alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnenolone.</v>

496
00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:31.801
<v Speaker 4>There's 6,160 articles talking about its</v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial effect on anxiety.</v>

497
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.070
<v Speaker 4>So we have people who come in on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>multitude of anxiety medications within</v>

498
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.250
<v Speaker 4>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're off all their medication.</v>

499
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.410
<v Speaker 4>They're alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pregnenolone is called the mother of all</v>

500
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:41.950
<v Speaker 4>hormones.</v>

501
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.380
<v Speaker 4>It's the precursor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It comes right off of cholesterol.</v>

502
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:45.590
<v Speaker 4>The first comp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

503
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 4>changed cholesterol becomes</v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnenolone,</v>

504
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 4>which goes down one pathway to become</v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone and then down another</v>

505
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 4>pathway to become cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the anti inflammatory product.</v>

506
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 4>So we get benefits of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

507
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.600
<v Speaker 4>antiinflammatory effect by having</v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnenolone.</v>

508
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.590
<v Speaker 4>But if you're on any kind of stat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug that decreases the availability of</v>

509
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.410
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol in the brain or the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you lose.</v>

510
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.780
<v Speaker 4>I have heard nothing but bad things</v>
<v Speaker 4>about staten drugs.</v>

511
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.450
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get you going because there's</v>

512
00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 4>so many people that have this very</v>
<v Speaker 4>meager understanding of cholesterol and</v>

513
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:22.891
<v Speaker 4>a understanding of like what is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between having a,</v>

514
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high cholesterol,</v>

515
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 4>low cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

516
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

517
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 4>what's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's not healthy?</v>

518
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 4>What's your cholesterol mark?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My cholesterol is 350.</v>

519
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 4>My ldl is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it should be according to the</v>

520
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 4>present standards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less than 200.</v>

521
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.080
<v Speaker 4>My ldl cholesterol is two 73 my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the ldl is the lousy kind and</v>

522
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.300
<v Speaker 4>Hdl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the happy to have the healthy</v>

523
00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 4>one is like 23 to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did the numbers change over time?</v>

524
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 4>They're all saying no for the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the standard.</v>

525
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of where they used to measure from the</v>

526
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.370
<v Speaker 4>70s till now in my infancy in medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

527
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.460
<v Speaker 4>back in the late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was 349 and then went to 329 then two</v>

528
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:09.710
<v Speaker 4>79 then to 49 to 29 in less than 200</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

529
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 4>And we would expect our nutrition is</v>
<v Speaker 4>changing the quality of foods that we</v>

530
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 4>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that we have since 1986</v>

531
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 4>staten drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are $36 billion a year,</v>

532
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 4>we would anticipate that the rate of</v>
<v Speaker 4>cardiovascular disease should be diving,</v>

533
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 4>getting lower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

534
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.680
<v Speaker 4>it's going up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does it tell us?</v>

535
00:24:27.681 --> 00:24:31.190
<v Speaker 4>It tells us like a Smithkline Beecham us</v>
<v Speaker 4>study that was done.</v>

536
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 4>50% of all heart attacks happen in</v>
<v Speaker 4>people with normal or low levels of</v>

537
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the question is then what's causing</v>

538
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:38.001
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

539
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 4>it turns out inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start looking at inflammatory</v>

540
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:42.800
<v Speaker 4>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

541
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a group of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory markers that we have a</v>

542
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.830
<v Speaker 4>which sdl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dl,</v>

543
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 4>homocysteine LP,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little a.</v>

544
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 4>So a whole group of them that can</v>
<v Speaker 4>predict better than cholesterol,</v>

545
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.710
<v Speaker 4>your risk for heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what we do in the offices,</v>

546
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 4>we have a biomarker panel for cardiac</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>

547
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 4>Person comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got a history of elevated</v>

548
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:06.380
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my closest buddies,</v>

549
00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:07.540
<v Speaker 4>Keith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

550
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.690
<v Speaker 4>x fighter pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his clusteral one 41 50 my cholesterol</v>

551
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:16.810
<v Speaker 4>303 50 we went and had an ultra fast ct</v>
<v Speaker 4>scan that looks at the heart and his</v>

552
00:25:17.241 --> 00:25:22.241
<v Speaker 4>calcium score was greater than 2000</v>
<v Speaker 4>which if it's a hundred or less as good</v>

553
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:27.290
<v Speaker 4>grade than 400 horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mine was zero and I had cholesterol that</v>

554
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:28.370
<v Speaker 4>was three times his.</v>

555
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.820
<v Speaker 4>So after he had his open heart surgery</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his New v arteries put in,</v>

556
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 4>we went and had this panel called an lp</v>
<v Speaker 4>six my cholesterol sky high,</v>

557
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:42.050
<v Speaker 4>but all these inflammatory markers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low and keith situation,</v>

558
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:47.051
<v Speaker 4>his inflammatory markers were sky high</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though his cholesterol was very</v>

559
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 4>low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

560
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 4>there's a simplistic understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what what's causing these issues and</v>

561
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.720
<v Speaker 4>people peg it on cholesterol and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>hear it so often,</v>

562
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 4>so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

563
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do I even begin having this</v>

564
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 4>conversation with people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to,</v>

565
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 4>if anybody's listening and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>really get into this,</v>

566
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:08.240
<v Speaker 4>a doctor Rhonda Patrick went pretty deep</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it in the last podcast that we did</v>

567
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:13.241
<v Speaker 4>and the newly found connections between</v>
<v Speaker 4>refined sugars and refined carbohydrates</v>

568
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 4>and saturated fats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The combination of the two seems to be a</v>

569
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:21.710
<v Speaker 4>gigantic issue where a saturated fats on</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own are not an issue.</v>

570
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.340
<v Speaker 4>The small particle versus large particle</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ldl,</v>

571
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 4>small particles are the dangerous ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

572
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 4>Stld is dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's at greater risk when you have</v>

573
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:35.780
<v Speaker 4>an enzyme called a pla two in the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which causes the stld.</v>

574
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:40.781
<v Speaker 4>L does small density Ldl to fracture</v>
<v Speaker 4>into two parts that cause the immune</v>

575
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 4>system to be called in and once the</v>
<v Speaker 4>immune system</v>

576
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 5>gets there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it creates all this inflammation and</v>

577
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:51.120
<v Speaker 5>there's something that happens with ldl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you combine it with a refined</v>

578
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 5>sugars that's extremely bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes it worse.</v>

579
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely bad sugars,</v>

580
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.820
<v Speaker 5>corn syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that people are drinking sodas</v>

581
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 5>and cake and bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the refined bread and we products.</v>

582
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 5>All that stuff is fucking terrible for</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

583
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.150
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just adding more inflammation on</v>

584
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:13.080
<v Speaker 5>top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's being conflated with saturated</v>

585
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:14.780
<v Speaker 5>fats and with cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

586
00:27:14.781 --> 00:27:16.470
<v Speaker 5>it's not what the issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

587
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.530
<v Speaker 5>So think about if you have a brain</v>
<v Speaker 5>injury and you're eating like that,</v>

588
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like your [inaudible] on a fire and</v>

589
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:26.000
<v Speaker 5>having no idea about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's the issue that we face a lot</v>

590
00:27:26.001 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 5>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's,</v>

591
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 5>there's the inflammation response and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's also the,</v>

592
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 5>the issues with the pituitary gland and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hormonal deficiencies.</v>

593
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.110
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

594
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.920
<v Speaker 5>it's not only the two Terry Glen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which generates the,</v>

595
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>signals to the thyroid gland,</v>

596
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.710
<v Speaker 5>testicles at the ovaries to make their</v>
<v Speaker 5>hormones are the adrenal glands,</v>

597
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 5>but it's the fact that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

598
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 5>we call them glial cells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are astrocytes and neuro cells,</v>

599
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.330
<v Speaker 5>which generate their own hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it turns out that the hormones</v>

600
00:27:57.331 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 5>produced a below the neck have a genomic</v>
<v Speaker 5>effect on the body,</v>

601
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 5>which is slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means it turns on genetic switches to</v>

602
00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:08.250
<v Speaker 5>do things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the hormones produced in the brain</v>

603
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:11.700
<v Speaker 5>called the neuro steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have the immediate effect because</v>

604
00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:15.840
<v Speaker 5>they influence the membranes of neurons</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do things.</v>

605
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.820
<v Speaker 5>So our ability to be rational because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're taking different parts of the</v>

606
00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 5>brain and they're all working in unison</v>
<v Speaker 5>as opposed to having this section that</v>

607
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 5>deals with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know how you respond to someone</v>

608
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:31.280
<v Speaker 5>talking in a high voice to you or</v>
<v Speaker 5>pointing a gun at you or pointing at</v>

609
00:28:31.281 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 5>Pencil at you so you lose that</v>
<v Speaker 5>integration of the different parts of</v>

610
00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 5>the brain.</v>

611
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.200
<v Speaker 5>That's what each of the lobes is</v>
<v Speaker 5>responsible for is how we integrate</v>

612
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 5>signals coming in that the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>is so fascinating because it seems like</v>

613
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
<v Speaker 5>there's so much to understand and for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the average person that goes to your</v>

614
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:52.680
<v Speaker 5>general practitioner and the General</v>
<v Speaker 5>Practitioner says,</v>

615
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got high cholesterol.</v>

616
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:56.390
<v Speaker 5>You need to be on a stat and drug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you find out about all this.</v>

617
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 5>People get extremely angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to so many people that were</v>

618
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:03.990
<v Speaker 5>on staten drugs and suffered all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 5>of health consequences because of that</v>

619
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.280
<v Speaker 5>and then realize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

620
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 5>what about cutting all the fucking sugar</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of my diet?</v>

621
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.000
<v Speaker 5>What about doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing all this stuff that has been shown</v>

622
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:15.000
<v Speaker 5>in all these more recent studies to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>a significant effect?</v>

623
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's unfortunate that when science comes</v>

624
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:23.301
<v Speaker 5>out and it's really good science that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>takes another 20 to 30 years before it</v>

625
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 5>gets into the medical community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's no obligation for your</v>

626
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 5>general practitioner to be up on this</v>
<v Speaker 5>dot.</v>

627
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely not.</v>

628
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Because it's status quo and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>changing constantly.</v>

629
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's what has me and frustrated</v>

630
00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 5>state all the time is because of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>science that's been sitting on the</v>

631
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:39.780
<v Speaker 5>bench.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I do,</v>

632
00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 5>what I've been told I do is called</v>

633
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 4>translational medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I take the research that's on the</v>

634
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.450
<v Speaker 4>bench that's already been done and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it in large groups and then</v>

635
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.860
<v Speaker 4>applied into the clinical practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how we've had our success is</v>

636
00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 4>we've got us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've taken the stuff that's sitting</v>

637
00:29:55.901 --> 00:30:00.901
<v Speaker 4>there ready to be used that's not being</v>
<v Speaker 4>used because we're in the paradigm of</v>

638
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.830
<v Speaker 4>don't do anything for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean every generation a little bit,</v>

639
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 4>something better happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it takes 30 years.</v>

640
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.090
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Andrew,</v>

641
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.300
<v Speaker 2>please go back to how you found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>about mark and what changes you made and</v>

642
00:30:17.311 --> 00:30:18.000
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>

643
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

644
00:30:19.361 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I've only known you since you've</v>

645
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 3>been happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a good ride,</v>

646
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.610
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you lower cholesterol mark,</v>

647
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 3>it ruins all the hormonal production.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

648
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.381
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

649
00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's not understood.</v>

650
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.220
<v Speaker 3>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

651
00:30:38.221 --> 00:30:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I mark found me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked into everything.</v>

652
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I was just saying one over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to listen to that research,</v>

653
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.170
<v Speaker 3>did my own research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found out about the neuroendocrine</v>

654
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.610
<v Speaker 3>system and ran it by my own people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I went and saw an</v>

655
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 3>endocrinologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still in the army at this time.</v>

656
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:54.461
<v Speaker 3>And I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

657
00:30:54.461 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 3>do you think that any of these problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>were based off of the,</v>

658
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:00.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds or thousands of explosions that</v>

659
00:31:00.821 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 3>weave around on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a routine basis?</v>

660
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:03.221
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

661
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:04.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

662
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.240
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

663
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 3>he was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

664
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we test and replace any hormones</v>

665
00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 3>that I'm missing?</v>

666
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.830
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean at that time we had done some</v>

667
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 3>tests and I knew that I was deficient in</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and he's like,</v>

668
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.690
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to test you for anabolic</v>

669
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 3>steroids because I think the reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having these problems is you're</v>

670
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 3>abusing anabolic steroids and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>pass the test and you prove that you're</v>

671
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:27.580
<v Speaker 3>not on anabolic steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will take about four to six weeks,</v>

672
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 3>then we'll talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Replacement Treatment Program.</v>

673
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 3>And I was fucking irate man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I told him that he accused,</v>

674
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 3>you accuse me of being a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to him because his levels were so</v>

675
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:38.780
<v Speaker 3>low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

676
00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.410
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

677
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen levels this low unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody was abusing anabolic steroids.</v>

678
00:31:44.801 --> 00:31:48.000
<v Speaker 3>And so you must be abusing antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids and,</v>

679
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 3>and you're here essentially trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>score drugs.</v>

680
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people don't understand what you're</v>

681
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:55.760
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

682
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.080
<v Speaker 2>when you take antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>

683
00:31:58.081 --> 00:32:02.040
<v Speaker 2>your natural testosterone shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times when people get off</v>

684
00:32:02.041 --> 00:32:03.930
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll go to a doctor,</v>

685
00:32:03.931 --> 00:32:06.840
<v Speaker 2>they're natural testosterone to shut</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and they'll go to a doctor to try</v>

686
00:32:06.841 --> 00:32:10.100
<v Speaker 2>to get hormone replacement therapy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the only way a doctor is going</v>

687
00:32:10.101 --> 00:32:12.900
<v Speaker 2>to give you hormone replacement</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapies if your levels are low.</v>

688
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.560
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the reasons for having low</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels is that you've,</v>

689
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you've put all this exotic in his shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and it's,</v>

690
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

691
00:32:20.911 --> 00:32:22.410
<v Speaker 2>your whole body's all confused.</v>

692
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thanks for clarifying that mark.</v>

693
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Like I a what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was it like,</v>

694
00:32:27.691 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think I'm coming in here putting all</v>

695
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:31.740
<v Speaker 3>this personal stuff on you because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

696
00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:35.030
<v Speaker 3>I like to make things up just cause you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want steroids cause I want steroid</v>

697
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.500
<v Speaker 3>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life's a disaster and I think this is</v>

698
00:32:37.501 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 3>funny and I worry that he would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

699
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.630
<v Speaker 3>It happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happened twice.</v>

700
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice back to back.</v>

701
00:32:44.081 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 3>You understand that there's other issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cause your body to have low</v>

702
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:49.340
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy.</v>

703
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 3>So this is what puts to push us in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>

704
00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

705
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sat at that point,</v>

706
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I started reading some of the literature</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

707
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 3>it's not even black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

708
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not even in the gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is black and white.</v>

709
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 3>There's like blast trauma can through</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation affect the hypothalamus and</v>

710
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:07.790
<v Speaker 3>the pituitary gland and downregulate all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these hormones.</v>

711
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.150
<v Speaker 3>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I finally,</v>

712
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 3>I link up with mark in southern</v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

713
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we run the labs,</v>

714
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:17.660
<v Speaker 3>but we don't get the results back for</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two or three weeks.</v>

715
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:18.910
<v Speaker 3>But he gives me a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we call it,</v>

716
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 3>provocative testosterone injection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to see how I react.</v>

717
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.070
<v Speaker 3>And like up until this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

718
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:28.490
<v Speaker 3>like my life has just been a complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>

719
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've put a gun in my mouth several times</v>

720
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 3>and actually had thought about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is how life is going to continue</v>

721
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:39.440
<v Speaker 3>and I continue to have this type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative effect on my family,</v>

722
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll just end it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

723
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.590
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

724
00:33:42.591 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got to the point where I was just</v>

725
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:47.300
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it for my family alone.</v>

726
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 3>And just kept driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So found mark,</v>

727
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:52.290
<v Speaker 3>mark found me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got the information and actually is</v>

728
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 3>there to see him in his office in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Encino.</v>

729
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Get that injection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving south on the four oh five</v>

730
00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:01.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm in bumper to bumper traffic like two</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours later.</v>

731
00:34:01.311 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 3>And usually man like me and traffic just</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't mix.</v>

732
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to say that I had a hostile temper</v>

733
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:10.250
<v Speaker 3>was like the understatement of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I realized like,</v>

734
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:11.840
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all of a sudden I'm cool,</v>

735
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:15.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm calm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm collected and not having any issues.</v>

736
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

737
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I f I don't feel any anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for the last year and a half,</v>

738
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I like it had this fist like coming out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my stomach man,</v>

739
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 3>like at all times 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

740
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:27.020
<v Speaker 3>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was gone.</v>

741
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is any taste of what could be,</v>

742
00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 3>this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I call my wife and we have a</v>

743
00:34:34.011 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 3>conversation for like an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the first time that we had</v>

744
00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Speaker 3>talked more than two minutes in like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

745
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.970
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't just say yes or no because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wasn't capable of,</v>

746
00:34:41.971 --> 00:34:45.170
<v Speaker 3>of anything else at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

747
00:34:45.171 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 3>so fast forward for a few weeks from</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

748
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets the report back and he's like,</v>

749
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:51.380
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're deficient in everything.</v>

750
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can,</v>

751
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.880
<v Speaker 3>we can fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we get on anti-inflammatory</v>

752
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.850
<v Speaker 3>protocol and we replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we replaced the and replenish the</v>

753
00:35:01.851 --> 00:35:06.851
<v Speaker 3>hormones that are deficient or</v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficient and life slowly and surely</v>

754
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 3>started to turn back on little by little</v>
<v Speaker 3>by little,</v>

755
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 3>by little to where I'm at today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm off all medication.</v>

756
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.991
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

757
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sober,</v>

758
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>performing as good,</v>

759
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.560
<v Speaker 3>if not better than my pre-injury status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We startup organization called the</v>

760
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Warrior Angels Foundation to deliver</v>
<v Speaker 3>this same level of healing to other</v>

761
00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:30.410
<v Speaker 3>people who are in the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 3>predicament and situation.</v>

762
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm excited to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

763
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 3>three years later we've delivered to</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 200 people with incredible results.</v>

764
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.930
<v Speaker 3>So it meets with the scientific criteria</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can predict,</v>

765
00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 3>we can measure and we can replicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it's not just my story,</v>

766
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:47.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not just Mac os and he's Tori.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark's done this like 1400 times.</v>

767
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 3>We had done it 200 times through our</v>
<v Speaker 3>organization where somebody,</v>

768
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 3>like we did a three year Tbi study</v>
<v Speaker 3>cohort,</v>

769
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:58.200
<v Speaker 3>we took 58 of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those 200 people,</v>

770
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 3>just the ones that are committed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attempted suicide,</v>

771
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 3>58 individuals attempted suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had,</v>

772
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:07.190
<v Speaker 3>we showed that within three months they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

773
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.290
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>91% had a 50% improvement.</v>

774
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So almost everybody had at least a 50%.</v>

775
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.290
<v Speaker 3>This isn't their subjective analysis</v>
<v Speaker 3>improvement.</v>

776
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:19.600
<v Speaker 3>After one year 90,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

777
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.070
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>73% of that population was off all</v>

778
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:24.750
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is unheard of.</v>

779
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 3>This is unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is people that wanted,</v>

780
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.160
<v Speaker 3>that actually attempted to take their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own life,</v>

781
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 3>I think a minimum of two times in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>

782
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.920
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

783
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.090
<v Speaker 3>we're producing results that have never</v>
<v Speaker 3>been annotated before.</v>

784
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's through the scientific model</v>

785
00:36:38.191 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 3>that marks come up with this protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>

786
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.960
<v Speaker 3>That's on our website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

787
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:45.630
<v Speaker 3>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got all that research on our website</v>

788
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 3>to check Waf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tbi.org,</v>

789
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:52.470
<v Speaker 3>but I got marks Predator as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got mark's presentation.</v>

790
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 3>We got an incredible media page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a library of all this information that</v>

791
00:36:56.701 --> 00:37:00.050
<v Speaker 3>didn't exist three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's now all in one location and all the</v>

792
00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.420
<v Speaker 3>stuff that I'm saying here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please don't take my word for word.</v>

793
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.990
<v Speaker 3>You guys go out and fact check it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can't tell you how many guys have</v>

794
00:37:04.991 --> 00:37:09.630
<v Speaker 3>come up to me after shows that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>either been in contact with you or have</v>

795
00:37:09.631 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 3>been in contact with other doctors</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the information that you've</v>

796
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 3>given out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was so thankful and so,</v>

797
00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:17.640
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you changing peoples future,</v>

798
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.360
<v Speaker 3>you're literally giving them an option</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't know existed.</v>

799
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:25.110
<v Speaker 3>They thought they thought their world</v>
<v Speaker 3>was black and then you open the door and</v>

800
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:25.973
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

801
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:26.963
<v Speaker 3>you can be okay.</v>

802
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 4>When Andrew first came to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

803
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.620
<v Speaker 4>Andrew wasn't the first veteran that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>had seen.</v>

804
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:36.740
<v Speaker 4>The first guy that I took care of was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>2009 he was active greenbrae and in</v>

805
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:41.520
<v Speaker 4>North Carolina at Bragg and his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew she was emergency room doc and</v>

806
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 4>she called me up and told me about her</v>
<v Speaker 4>husband getting ready to get a less than</v>

807
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:49.410
<v Speaker 4>honorable discharge after four or five</v>
<v Speaker 4>tours of duty in Afghanistan.</v>

808
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she explained it to me.</v>

809
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:52.590
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me send you a kit.</v>

810
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.170
<v Speaker 4>So I sent a kid out and we got the</v>
<v Speaker 4>results back.</v>

811
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 4>I told her what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she put them on to treatment.</v>

812
00:37:57.661 --> 00:38:02.661
<v Speaker 4>He lasted another two sign up towards or</v>
<v Speaker 4>two towards the duty and was doing</v>

813
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 4>phenomenally well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the key that drives me on this is</v>

814
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:12.651
<v Speaker 4>guys getting back into life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to pepperdine business school.</v>

815
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:15.320
<v Speaker 4>Now a guy who was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

816
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:20.160
<v Speaker 4>attempted school five times and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fifth time he was on our protocol for</v>

817
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:23.580
<v Speaker 4>two or three months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he ends up getting honors and now he</v>

818
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:28.290
<v Speaker 4>wants to go back and give back to the va</v>
<v Speaker 4>for them not having treated him</v>

819
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.030
<v Speaker 4>optimally by going into sociology to try</v>
<v Speaker 4>and help them to understand what he had</v>

820
00:38:33.031 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 4>gone through with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have guys who are in Wall Street now</v>

821
00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:36.730
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

822
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 2>all over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a Harvard business school.</v>

823
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean just all kinds of very</v>
<v Speaker 2>prestigious thing.</v>

824
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:47.170
<v Speaker 2>They've got their family back there re</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling their parents going on for a</v>

825
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 2>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't give them a self help book.</v>

826
00:38:48.641 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 2>We didn't give him any snow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Churchill teachings,</v>

827
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 2>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fix what was deficient.</v>

828
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were able to come back and make</v>

829
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:58.490
<v Speaker 2>their own their own choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get their life back on track is</v>

830
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 2>such a giant factor in this whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>equation that people need to understand.</v>

831
00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:05.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not just about motivational</v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches.</v>

832
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:08.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not about memes that you put on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your instagram page to make you feel</v>

833
00:39:08.861 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 2>better about life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally about the chemical</v>

834
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:14.890
<v Speaker 2>balance in your physical vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's off,</v>

835
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's off because of diet,</v>

836
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 2>if it's off because of injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the factors are,</v>

837
00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 2>you've got to figure out what those</v>
<v Speaker 2>factors are and you've got to correct</v>

838
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:24.850
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to correct them before</v>

839
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 2>self-help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before all that bullshit,</v>

840
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 2>correct your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

841
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Whatever is deficient in your hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

842
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever is deficient in your nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>

843
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.840
<v Speaker 2>It's so God damn it.</v>

844
00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean to,</v>

845
00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>focus only on the neuro steroid and the</v>

846
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.130
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you just said,</v>

847
00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:46.190
<v Speaker 4>physical fitness and nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

848
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.180
<v Speaker 4>my daughter Alison is a natural pathic</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she works with us with the warrior</v>

849
00:39:50.181 --> 00:39:55.181
<v Speaker 4>Angel Foundation to help with getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gut brain in sync so that you don't</v>

850
00:39:56.181 --> 00:39:58.160
<v Speaker 4>have the glutens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have all the junk we talked</v>

851
00:39:58.161 --> 00:40:01.670
<v Speaker 4>about because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they generate the poor nutrition,</v>

852
00:40:01.671 --> 00:40:05.510
<v Speaker 4>generates more inflammation that passes</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the gut into the blood,</v>

853
00:40:05.511 --> 00:40:07.430
<v Speaker 4>into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they've actually,</v>

854
00:40:07.431 --> 00:40:12.120
<v Speaker 4>there was a study that came out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was on the bbcs last week where they</v>

855
00:40:12.121 --> 00:40:13.700
<v Speaker 4>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

856
00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:17.260
<v Speaker 4>we finally figured out that if you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>peripheral inflammation like diseases</v>

857
00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:20.660
<v Speaker 4>like Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the inflammation goes into the</v>

858
00:40:20.661 --> 00:40:22.520
<v Speaker 4>brain and can cause depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

859
00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:24.320
<v Speaker 4>it's been in the literature for 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

860
00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:28.190
<v Speaker 4>They finally are starting to understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>that things that happened on the</v>

861
00:40:28.191 --> 00:40:30.290
<v Speaker 4>periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can affect our brain's functioning.</v>

862
00:40:30.291 --> 00:40:31.910
<v Speaker 4>So nutrition very important</v>

863
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.400
<v Speaker 2>is part of what's going on to just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human bodies.</v>

864
00:40:35.401 --> 00:40:40.120
<v Speaker 2>So insanely complex and there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand and so much to be you have</v>

865
00:40:40.121 --> 00:40:43.150
<v Speaker 2>to kind of be like you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be obsessed with all this</v>

866
00:40:43.151 --> 00:40:45.040
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I was obsessed.</v>

867
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 2>You're obsessed by pull out my phone up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your face a little bit more,</v>

868
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.370
<v Speaker 2>but you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are doing though is just,</v>

869
00:40:51.371 --> 00:40:54.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important and so it,</v>

870
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 2>there's just so little of it out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>

871
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to really go looking</v>

872
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.310
<v Speaker 2>for these solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

873
00:41:03.311 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 2>you got to go through every door in</v>
<v Speaker 2>every channel and try to find out.</v>

874
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And so many times they want to offer you</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a pill,</v>

875
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.190
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a pharmaceutical drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some sort of an antidepressant</v>

876
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:18.400
<v Speaker 2>antianxiety medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that one doesn't take,</v>

877
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:22.060
<v Speaker 2>they give you an antianxiety medication</v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of the anti anxiety medication,</v>

878
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:23.643
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

879
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lunch or dinner with the admiral in,</v>

880
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Virginia Beach,</v>

881
00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:32.420
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the stories that he was</v>

882
00:41:32.421 --> 00:41:34.460
<v Speaker 4>sharing was fact that his wife,</v>

883
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was diagnosed at a va as having a</v>

884
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.520
<v Speaker 5>thyroid related issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they started treating it in the</v>

885
00:41:40.521 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 5>course of treating it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she felt worse because they weren't</v>

886
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 5>giving her the ample amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>replacement hormones.</v>

887
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:50.390
<v Speaker 5>So the next thing that the doctor offers</v>
<v Speaker 5>her as an antidepressant,</v>

888
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 5>saying the reason why you still not</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling well,</v>

889
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:55.610
<v Speaker 5>it's because the antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when we got to her and checked out</v>

890
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 5>or hormone levels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her hormone levels were off.</v>

891
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.420
<v Speaker 5>And did they even check her hormone</v>
<v Speaker 5>levels?</v>

892
00:41:59.421 --> 00:42:00.141
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course not.</v>

893
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hand those Goddamn antidepressants</v>

894
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:03.480
<v Speaker 5>out like fucking candy.</v>

895
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what was crazy with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

896
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be an underlying</v>
<v Speaker 3>condition.</v>

897
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Like in summary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me what that is.</v>

898
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 3>I know we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're managing symptoms,</v>

899
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.430
<v Speaker 3>but can we do that and can we do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>objectively or scientifically?</v>

900
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:15.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's the beauty of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of of the protocol.</v>

901
00:42:15.321 --> 00:42:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to break it down for everybody out</v>

902
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:18.951
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tbi,</v>

903
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:23.951
<v Speaker 3>it's a two phase injury phase one is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a physical trauma or assault?</v>

904
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be black,</v>

905
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

906
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 3>explosive blast way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blunt force,</v>

907
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:30.710
<v Speaker 3>trauma acceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deacceleration slip,</v>

908
00:42:30.711 --> 00:42:34.370
<v Speaker 3>fall rollercoaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that causes that anti</v>

909
00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:37.610
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory cascade to start</v>
<v Speaker 3>rollercoaster can cause it.</v>

910
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.290
<v Speaker 3>The coordinator Mario Cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the literature.</v>

911
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just think man,</v>

912
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so mark calls it the neuro permissive</v>

913
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't have a good internal</v>

914
00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're eating a bunch of processed</v>

915
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:48.440
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

916
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 3>you're leaving just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a low quality of life,</v>

917
00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:52.460
<v Speaker 3>making poor lifestyle decisions.</v>

918
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are like compounding interest over</v>

919
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

920
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:59.690
<v Speaker 3>are being like low level blast waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it could be something as simple as</v>

921
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:03.120
<v Speaker 3>one of those 300 mile per hour moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>roller coaster.</v>

922
00:43:03.121 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 3>It's going to rock your head back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

923
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.680
<v Speaker 3>That could be enough to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

924
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.580
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's enough.</v>

925
00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:11.030
<v Speaker 3>That could cause the inflammation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inflammatory cascade and then that</v>

926
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 3>causes the hormones to become deficient</v>
<v Speaker 3>or insufficient.</v>

927
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what we found through our</v>
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>

928
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:19.610
<v Speaker 3>at least our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what our research suggests is</v>

929
00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 3>that's the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't get rid of the</v>

930
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 3>inflammation or bring the body back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a balance,</v>

931
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 3>if you don't replenish or replace those</v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones that are lost,</v>

932
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have all the physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>and psychological manifestations that we</v>

933
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:35.240
<v Speaker 3>all know about and talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the deal.</v>

934
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Can we be objective?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

935
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:38.330
<v Speaker 3>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we measure it?</v>

936
00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:39.051
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can.</v>

937
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Can we predict and replicate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

938
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:44.120
<v Speaker 3>we've done it 1400 times so we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now it's like,</v>

939
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.280
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how do we continue to take this to</v>

940
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:49.310
<v Speaker 3>the next level to make sure this goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream?</v>

941
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 3>It's disseminating information on</v>
<v Speaker 3>platforms like this.</v>

942
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 3>We're working projects with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

943
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think we might be able to actually</v>

944
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 3>affect change on a real level here the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next few years.</v>

945
00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

946
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.090
<v Speaker 3>it's so incredible</v>

947
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.330
<v Speaker 5>that there is finally some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>resource that there's something that</v>

948
00:44:06.331 --> 00:44:08.090
<v Speaker 5>people could turn to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

949
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.380
<v Speaker 5>we need to lay it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>

950
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.150
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be every point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

951
00:44:12.151 --> 00:44:14.690
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be exercise.</v>

952
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.340
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be reducing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>inflammation.</v>

953
00:44:17.341 --> 00:44:20.400
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be replacing the hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those things together.</v>

954
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:21.970
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

955
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an individual is suffering with</v>

956
00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:26.890
<v Speaker 5>symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I call it symptomatic Tbi.</v>

957
00:44:26.891 --> 00:44:31.891
<v Speaker 5>I don't really agree with the term pts</v>
<v Speaker 5>or ptsd or ptss especially</v>

958
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 2>when there's a history of trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma,</v>

959
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 2>trauma to the body or trauma to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

960
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily,</v>

961
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I think people think of it as like</v>
<v Speaker 2>stressful situations that guys have been</v>

962
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I've found in</v>

963
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 2>talking to a lot of guys who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>operators is they don't have like a high</v>

964
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 2>stress level because of what they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

965
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Like there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

966
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 2>there were the actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were the ones who are doing the</v>

967
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There weren't,</v>

968
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.080
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stress level comes from a lot of the</v>

969
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 2>guys that we're not being proactive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're waiting around for something to</v>

970
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:04.980
<v Speaker 2>happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are the guys that are the most</v>

971
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.640
<v Speaker 2>effected by Stress Disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys who were wondering when they</v>

972
00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:11.820
<v Speaker 2>were going to be attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas guys who are operators who are</v>

973
00:45:11.821 --> 00:45:15.870
<v Speaker 2>out there aggressive out there being</v>
<v Speaker 2>proactive actually correct doing it.</v>

974
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 2>They had less of a situation with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less stress meditation for them going</v>

975
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:20.784
<v Speaker 2>out and killing people.</v>

976
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.280
<v Speaker 3>You're on the offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

977
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:25.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I can speak from experience</v>

978
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:26.630
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

979
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you're on the offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not waiting to get on there.</v>

980
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:33.030
<v Speaker 3>So when you're stuck in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is is a fight or flight</v>

981
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 3>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

982
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:37.210
<v Speaker 3>You're on security mode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

983
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.680
<v Speaker 3>in a non combat environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these guys get stuck in these</v>

984
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:42.840
<v Speaker 3>fight or flight modes and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out why,</v>

985
00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:47.520
<v Speaker 3>why am I in fight or flight like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This situation does not call for that</v>

986
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:50.730
<v Speaker 3>type of response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at it like if you're</v>

987
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:53.700
<v Speaker 3>deficient in these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the body going to do if these got</v>

988
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Speaker 3>these mics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrical signals or they're sharing of</v>

989
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.940
<v Speaker 3>neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to come out as a fight or</v>

990
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:03.150
<v Speaker 3>flight mechanism and that's why they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck in this and that's,</v>

991
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.530
<v Speaker 3>it's called post traumatic stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when we've treat these so called</v>

992
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 3>psychological issues as a physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury and replace and replenish,</v>

993
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 3>lower the inflammatory cascades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

994
00:46:15.871 --> 00:46:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Those symptoms resolve themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they were,</v>

995
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:20.850
<v Speaker 3>whether they were on the defensive or</v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive.</v>

996
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.713
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

997
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.530
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's definitely a psychological</v>

998
00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:28.370
<v Speaker 2>difference between someone who becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>seal or a ranger or a green baret there.</v>

999
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a documented yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1000
00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference in the mindset and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those,</v>

1001
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.830
<v Speaker 2>those people are some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important people we have in the planet.</v>

1002
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have them.</v>

1003
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.120
<v Speaker 2>You want to have a safe world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have the elite of the elite.</v>

1004
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:47.390
<v Speaker 2>You have to like and people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that you need to go to some</v>

1005
00:46:47.391 --> 00:46:50.090
<v Speaker 2>really terrible places in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what's out there.</v>

1006
00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking across the spectrum of special</v>

1007
00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:57.680
<v Speaker 2>ops and then the regular army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about this in the past.</v>

1008
00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:02.210
<v Speaker 2>The pattern that I've been seeing also</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in civilian population is those</v>

1009
00:47:02.211 --> 00:47:05.150
<v Speaker 2>people who are more eight type get</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

1010
00:47:05.151 --> 00:47:07.580
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to get better as opposed to</v>

1011
00:47:07.581 --> 00:47:09.450
<v Speaker 2>the people who really don't want to get,</v>

1012
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.470
<v Speaker 3>or you've seen it time and time again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you have a clear vision of</v>

1013
00:47:14.471 --> 00:47:15.940
<v Speaker 3>the future and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1014
00:47:15.941 --> 00:47:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't care what anybody else</v>

1015
00:47:17.951 --> 00:47:20.560
<v Speaker 3>says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they were like the 10th stop that</v>

1016
00:47:20.561 --> 00:47:22.150
<v Speaker 3>they've come to their like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've tried everything,</v>

1017
00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:24.430
<v Speaker 3>we just found a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys were going to do something,</v>

1018
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 3>let's get this going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those guys get better.</v>

1019
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:27.881
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1020
00:47:27.881 --> 00:47:28.900
<v Speaker 3>not to mention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1021
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 3>objectively we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can</v>

1022
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 5>push look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people come to us and you're like,</v>

1023
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1024
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:36.850
<v Speaker 5>Life doesn't work out and everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes my way.</v>

1025
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope this goes,</v>

1026
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:41.110
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not getting my hopes up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything else?</v>

1027
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 5>Those people will talk themselves out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting better and I wouldn't have</v>

1028
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 5>believed it unless I've seen it time and</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and time again,</v>

1029
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.150
<v Speaker 5>hills people mentally fucked themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of life.</v>

1030
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:51.670
<v Speaker 5>Every step of the show we've watched him</v>
<v Speaker 5>put a gun in their mouth and pull the</v>

1031
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:53.380
<v Speaker 5>trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1032
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:56.740
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunately we've lost people to do in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that and it wasn't like,</v>

1033
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:57.851
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got,</v>

1034
00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:00.340
<v Speaker 5>we got you the help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it was like,</v>

1035
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:05.341
<v Speaker 5>well it's such a hassle to take the</v>
<v Speaker 5>medication at the prescribed times.</v>

1036
00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1037
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I looked into that and like</v>

1038
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 5>that's a thing called noncompliance.</v>

1039
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1040
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:17.140
<v Speaker 5>the Glaucoma Research Institute put out</v>
<v Speaker 5>a study like 60% of glaucoma patients</v>

1041
00:48:17.141 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 5>don't take their medication on time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one that that will cause them to go</v>

1042
00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:22.360
<v Speaker 5>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I had needed to,</v>

1043
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 5>I needed to justify losing some people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I couldn't,</v>

1044
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't wrap my head around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why won't they be compliant?</v>

1045
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:35.010
<v Speaker 5>They people get in this Rut and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>memorize these emotions and they get in</v>

1046
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:37.630
<v Speaker 5>this negative fucking place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1047
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they talk themselves right out of life.</v>

1048
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:45.630
<v Speaker 5>And why people become super comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 5>with repeating these really negative</v>

1049
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.250
<v Speaker 5>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get comfortable because they know</v>

1050
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:50.860
<v Speaker 5>those patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very disturbing when you see</v>

1051
00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.060
<v Speaker 5>someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1052
00:48:52.061 --> 00:48:55.930
<v Speaker 5>I grew up with a lot of guys that had</v>
<v Speaker 5>drug problems and when you would see</v>

1053
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.470
<v Speaker 5>they would get hooked on coke or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that and get off of it</v>

1054
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 5>and know that they're on a better path,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's pulling them back in and not</v>

1055
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:06.560
<v Speaker 5>even physically like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1056
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 5>the process of doing something that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and ruining your life somehow</v>

1057
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:13.030
<v Speaker 5>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it becomes more comfortable than the</v>

1058
00:49:13.031 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 5>process of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is improving your life.</v>

1059
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.310
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's scary to people,</v>

1060
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 5>to people they know the of the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

1061
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think at a neuroscience level,</v>

1062
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could memorize an emotion cause</v>

1063
00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:26.790
<v Speaker 5>what I those thoughts and freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1064
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:30.580
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa re structure of the brain through</v>

1065
00:49:30.581 --> 00:49:33.580
<v Speaker 5>neuroplasticity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that can be their new status quo.</v>

1066
00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you get people that are in that</v>

1067
00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 5>mindset?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you get them free of that?</v>

1068
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you get someone who's this woe is</v>

1069
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:41.350
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It never works out,</v>

1070
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.700
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way,</v>

1071
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there a tried and true way,</v>

1072
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:45.790
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to direct my health,</v>

1073
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:47.740
<v Speaker 5>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrecked my health tourism,</v>

1074
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 5>but we've had a couple of guys who had</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped their protocol because they</v>

1075
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 5>didn't feel that anything was happening</v>
<v Speaker 5>from it and they send me an email after</v>

1076
00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:57.730
<v Speaker 5>they had been off for maybe a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I says,</v>

1077
00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.440
<v Speaker 5>Jeez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel as well,</v>

1078
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:03.720
<v Speaker 5>maybe it was working or they say that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're working with the devil and and go</v>

1079
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:06.590
<v Speaker 5>all kinds of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.880
<v Speaker 5>I stopped January accepting a Pi cases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1081
00:50:11.881 --> 00:50:14.860
<v Speaker 5>legal cases because what's the impetus</v>
<v Speaker 5>for them to get better?</v>

1082
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero.</v>

1083
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:19.030
<v Speaker 5>They get what they want to pitch a</v>
<v Speaker 5>personal injury,</v>

1084
00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 5>like the motor vehicle accident there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One disability check.</v>

1085
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1086
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:27.870
<v Speaker 5>so I stopped taking Pi cases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's unfortunate because there's gotta</v>

1087
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 5>be some</v>

1088
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 3>people that have real personal injuries</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would like to get better.</v>

1089
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.150
<v Speaker 3>I talked to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I filter them,</v>

1090
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 3>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've cut down,</v>

1091
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I just come to the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1092
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:40.161
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1093
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:42.410
<v Speaker 3>I can't make the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't make anybody get better.</v>

1094
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1095
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Like all we can do is give out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

1096
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 3>but I mean shoes on and make them go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally made myself sick,</v>

1097
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 3>like worried about people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1098
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to lose something and I</v>

1099
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:53.864
<v Speaker 3>can't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1100
00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I can do is I can control my</v>

1101
00:50:56.241 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 3>attitude and my effort and I can push</v>
<v Speaker 3>out this information to the best of my</v>

1102
00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:04.610
<v Speaker 3>ability and people got to meet us</v>
<v Speaker 3>halfway.</v>

1103
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.100
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing we can do to make</v>

1104
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 3>somebody want to get themselves better.</v>

1105
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Talking with the guy tomorrow is his</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother's at wit's end and just wrecking</v>

1106
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:16.700
<v Speaker 3>everything that he comes in and out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>every rehab program.</v>

1107
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as a,</v>

1108
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrible place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1109
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see an end in well,</v>

1110
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to talk to him tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he wants to know how can I make</v>

1111
00:51:23.421 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 3>my brother want to get better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1112
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 3>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you man,</v>

1113
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:32.081
<v Speaker 3>but we can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't force somebody to do that and</v>

1114
00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.770
<v Speaker 3>that disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1115
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 3>The tragic part of that I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1116
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person's not thinking right because</v>

1117
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their judgments clouded because of a</v>

1118
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:42.440
<v Speaker 3>head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1119
00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 3>serving the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1120
00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1121
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the battles that we have also is</v>

1122
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:50.180
<v Speaker 3>that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>

1123
00:51:50.181 --> 00:51:55.010
<v Speaker 3>I speak to wipes that are a strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>husbands that are strange when we take</v>

1124
00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.950
<v Speaker 3>on a new veteran or patient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1125
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.210
<v Speaker 3>to let them know that the person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been dealing with post traumatic</v>

1126
00:52:02.211 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Speaker 3>brain injury is not really the person</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to be.</v>

1127
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.180
<v Speaker 3>That's an effect of the hormonal</v>
<v Speaker 3>dysfunctioning.</v>

1128
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.190
<v Speaker 3>So they're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're angry,</v>

1129
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.120
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1130
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:15.290
<v Speaker 3>they're difficult to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tried to get them to help in the</v>

1131
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:18.590
<v Speaker 3>protocol to get them better in what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've seen are couples getting back</v>

1132
00:52:18.591 --> 00:52:20.570
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a 77 year old,</v>

1133
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:25.610
<v Speaker 3>a Vietnam veteran who lost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's back with his kids now he's out and</v>

1134
00:52:25.611 --> 00:52:28.040
<v Speaker 3>back chopping wood and Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1135
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reward that really is the</v>

1136
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:33.610
<v Speaker 3>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people have to understand that if</v>

1137
00:52:33.611 --> 00:52:37.400
<v Speaker 3>that you've had traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anticipate within one year's time,</v>

1138
00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.040
<v Speaker 3>total change in the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>total change.</v>

1139
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.930
<v Speaker 3>They're now no longer the person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you anticipate.</v>

1140
00:52:42.931 --> 00:52:45.620
<v Speaker 3>How long did it take you for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>transition?</v>

1141
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1142
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started first having symptoms like six</v>

1143
00:52:50.121 --> 00:52:52.220
<v Speaker 3>months after I got home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1144
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:53.420
<v Speaker 3>So that's the difficult part.</v>

1145
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not missing a limb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't think anything like,</v>

1146
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:58.940
<v Speaker 3>we are rocking and rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back,</v>

1147
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.920
<v Speaker 3>good to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy to be alive.</v>

1148
00:53:00.921 --> 00:53:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Let's get ready for the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>

1149
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:05.600
<v Speaker 3>stuff starts happening and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>

1150
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:07.460
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1151
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't see anything and you just</v>

1152
00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:15.431
<v Speaker 3>keep going and you keep seeing this low</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality of life and then you want help</v>

1153
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 3>and you can't get help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1154
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 3>you asked for help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting medication,</v>

1155
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 3>start drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep gets messed up,</v>

1156
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.110
<v Speaker 3>nutrition gets messed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start wrecking relationships,</v>

1157
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 3>then start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never be able to do what I thought</v>

1158
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:34.980
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody understands me.</v>

1159
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the future gonna be like,</v>

1160
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1161
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:40.890
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't get neat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how you get trapped into</v>

1162
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:43.380
<v Speaker 3>these memorizing these negative states.</v>

1163
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Cause you get stuck in that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard mark on the podcast,</v>

1164
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:52.880
<v Speaker 3>how long did it take you to act and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>long did it take after their tea for you</v>

1165
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:54.750
<v Speaker 3>to become who you are now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1166
00:53:54.751 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 3>so I made that decision at my son's</v>
<v Speaker 3>bedside and that was,</v>

1167
00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:01.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several months before I met mark.</v>

1168
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Well heres this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many years ago?</v>

1169
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.890
<v Speaker 3>This is 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1170
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:07.860
<v Speaker 3>14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>January 7th,</v>

1171
00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 3>September of 2014 and I didn't meet him</v>
<v Speaker 3>until December,</v>

1172
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.111
<v Speaker 3>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1173
00:54:13.111 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1174
00:54:14.371 --> 00:54:17.730
<v Speaker 3>it was all of 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a disaster,</v>

1175
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.920
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leading up to the hospital scene.</v>

1176
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 3>So I made the decision like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1177
00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:23.430
<v Speaker 3>at that point it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1178
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.910
<v Speaker 3>I've always been defined by my future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all of a sudden like,</v>

1179
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like being a special forces greenbrae</v>

1180
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 3>was my mask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all wear our masks and that's how I,</v>

1181
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that was my identity,</v>

1182
00:54:34.681 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 3>or at least I thought it was.</v>

1183
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:37.890
<v Speaker 3>And so when that got taken away from me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1184
00:54:37.891 --> 00:54:39.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do now?</v>

1185
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm sick and now my children are</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick and now they're telling me like I</v>

1186
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 3>have a brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what does that mean?</v>

1187
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Like that this is like just getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>rocked.</v>

1188
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:54.240
<v Speaker 3>So like being rocked by circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked me for a year and a half,</v>

1189
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.040
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it knocked me and like I wasn't</v>

1190
00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 3>prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't ready.</v>

1191
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know how to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't until I made that decision</v>

1192
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:02.640
<v Speaker 3>that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1193
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I've always been defined by going after</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future that I want to create.</v>

1194
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>

1195
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.280
<v Speaker 3>so there was like a will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1196
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:12.090
<v Speaker 3>that was to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1197
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where it came from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I could observe my thoughts and</v>

1198
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:17.010
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these thoughts that are being produced</v>

1199
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:19.200
<v Speaker 3>now or not me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where they're coming from,</v>

1200
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.360
<v Speaker 3>but there is a will inside me that says</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna fight this and we're going</v>

1201
00:55:22.361 --> 00:55:23.910
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to find a way to come out on</v>

1202
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:24.744
<v Speaker 3>the other side.</v>

1203
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:27.870
<v Speaker 3>So that happened in September,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1204
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:30.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast forward to finding mark.</v>

1205
00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 3>So it was like quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like after three months of the protocol,</v>

1206
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:38.520
<v Speaker 3>like physiologically I felt like myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1207
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I was off all medication every three</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>

1208
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 3>How long did it take you to get off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>medication?</v>

1209
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Did you Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] Turkey,</v>

1210
00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should never do that.</v>

1211
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just have that in place in my</v>

1212
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:51.210
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doctors,</v>

1213
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:52.533
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1214
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.510
<v Speaker 3>how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A place in my life that I was like,</v>

1215
00:55:54.511 --> 00:55:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

1216
00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:00.320
<v Speaker 3>I accept whatever fallout could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever I'm going to feel it's not</v>

1217
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:04.200
<v Speaker 3>going to be artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to feel whatever it is</v>

1218
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:06.660
<v Speaker 3>and I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to deal with it on,</v>

1219
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.720
<v Speaker 3>on my terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not going to be zombied out.</v>

1220
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.000
<v Speaker 3>It was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was rough.</v>

1221
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1222
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.290
<v Speaker 3>I was off all medication before I got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mark,</v>

1223
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1224
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.450
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1225
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have control of like my mind</v>

1226
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 3>the way I wanted to like the way I do</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1227
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:26.710
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to work very hard and not just to</v>

1228
00:56:26.711 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 3>lose it on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

1229
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 3>like we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1230
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.220
<v Speaker 3>my was with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in a fast food restaurant</v>

1231
00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:35.680
<v Speaker 3>picking up some food for my youngest</v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter.</v>

1232
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbing some food.</v>

1233
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I see this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>teenager in the parking lot and he,</v>

1234
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kid throws his cup down,</v>

1235
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 3>he's cussing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's causing the scene.</v>

1236
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I needed to intervene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

1237
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:47.170
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>

1238
00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 3>pick your cup up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw in the trash,</v>

1239
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 3>quit yelling customers everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>families are here.</v>

1240
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 3>And he tells me to go fuck myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1241
00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.140
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go pick up your stuff and put in the</v>

1242
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 3>trash.</v>

1243
00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 3>And he said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And before I knew it,</v>

1244
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I just backhanded this kid across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

1245
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 3>dropped them on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I picked him up and I threw him</v>

1246
00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:06.040
<v Speaker 3>into oncoming traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

1247
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the parking lot took offense to</v>

1248
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:10.121
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1249
00:57:10.121 --> 00:57:11.920
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rightly rightly so.</v>

1250
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I got people swarming me.</v>

1251
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 3>Next thing I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I dropped like three dudes in the</v>

1252
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:22.720
<v Speaker 3>parking lot and I look up after dropping</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last guy and like my wife's</v>

1253
00:57:22.721 --> 00:57:25.870
<v Speaker 3>breastfeeding and three of my children</v>
<v Speaker 3>are looking at me and like they're in,</v>

1254
00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:29.860
<v Speaker 3>they're an like horror is on their face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just horror struck.</v>

1255
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.630
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God man,</v>

1256
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 3>if I don't get control of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not only is this going to possibly</v>

1257
00:57:36.401 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 3>kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill somebody else.</v>

1258
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had,</v>

1259
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1260
00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.030
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happened.</v>

1261
00:57:43.031 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came to and it was like,</v>

1262
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Dear God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just dropped a parking lot and I'm</v>

1263
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:50.200
<v Speaker 3>doing evasive maneuvers in my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>minivan trying to get out of it.</v>

1264
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm funny.</v>

1265
00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:56.240
<v Speaker 3>But not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not funny.</v>

1266
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:57.850
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1267
00:57:57.851 --> 00:57:58.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1268
00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.610
<v Speaker 3>it was this process of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1269
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:02.950
<v Speaker 3>so it was rough man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was rough coming off medication.</v>

1270
00:58:02.951 --> 00:58:04.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't recommend it from anybody for</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else,</v>

1271
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:05.950
<v Speaker 3>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1272
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 3>like I want off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause that just made me a Zombie,</v>

1273
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:10.900
<v Speaker 3>just like drooling on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zone B.</v>

1274
00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:15.730
<v Speaker 3>What steps did you take as far as your</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet and exercise and then mark's</v>

1275
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:17.230
<v Speaker 3>protocol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat,</v>

1276
00:58:17.231 --> 00:58:17.891
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1277
00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:21.070
<v Speaker 3>basically try to anti inflammatory diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1278
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's just based off my individual</v>

1279
00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 3>needs at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1280
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I would just remaining active.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I mean by anti inflammatory</v>

1281
00:58:30.431 --> 00:58:31.540
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you do differently?</v>

1282
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1283
00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:35.560
<v Speaker 3>just learning what causes inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1284
00:58:35.561 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 3>So where are we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like refined sugars,</v>

1285
00:58:37.751 --> 00:58:40.420
<v Speaker 3>refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting away from things that were</v>

1286
00:58:40.421 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 3>packaged for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1287
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Going back to more wholesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole foods.</v>

1288
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And this is before mark's protocol or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1289
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.700
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1290
00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.920
<v Speaker 3>this is after I'm on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1291
00:58:50.921 --> 00:58:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't make any changes until I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>up anything until I got into mark's</v>

1292
00:58:55.181 --> 00:58:59.320
<v Speaker 3>protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started to like return to normalcy.</v>

1293
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:02.760
<v Speaker 3>And then when you get to that level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start feeling really good again.</v>

1294
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:03.191
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1295
00:59:03.191 --> 00:59:04.900
<v Speaker 3>what else can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1296
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like been the steps that we've</v>

1297
00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:09.940
<v Speaker 3>seen in so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we don't have to make any lifestyle</v>

1298
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 3>changes initially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like thrill make them on their own.</v>

1299
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:17.510
<v Speaker 3>So get them back to a homeostasis or</v>
<v Speaker 3>balance and neuro permissive environment</v>

1300
00:59:17.511 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 3>and mark as mark calls it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you start looking at like,</v>

1301
00:59:20.291 --> 00:59:22.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else do I need to do in my life to</v>

1302
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 3>optimize it?</v>

1303
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1304
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:27.020
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take a look at water,</v>

1305
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be taking a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1306
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sound,</v>

1307
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.560
<v Speaker 3>emf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like every external,</v>

1308
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulus.</v>

1309
00:59:34.611 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I want to optimize and make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's as optimized as possible.</v>

1310
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.351
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1311
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you do any changes to the way you</v>

1312
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 3>exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me think about that.</v>

1313
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.283
<v Speaker 3>Not Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1314
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of into Olympic lifting at</v>

1315
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 3>the time and stayed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1316
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:51.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

1317
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:54.200
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always remain physically active through</v>

1318
00:59:54.201 --> 00:59:55.470
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1319
00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.900
<v Speaker 3>so not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the only thing that probably</v>

1320
00:59:56.901 --> 00:59:58.160
<v Speaker 3>kept you sane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1321
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.170
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And another reason they said that I</v>

1322
01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:01.400
<v Speaker 3>lived through the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1323
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:04.880
<v Speaker 3>the blood clots was the level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cardiovascular fitness that I was in at</v>

1324
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1325
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:07.454
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1326
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.121
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1327
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1328
01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:11.270
<v Speaker 3>one Goto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I just always worked out.</v>

1329
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 3>I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's always been a part of my life.</v>

1330
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 3>And so that was always there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stuck with that.</v>

1331
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:19.580
<v Speaker 3>So three months in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you feel and what was the</v>

1332
01:00:19.581 --> 01:00:22.760

1349
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:06.680
<v Speaker 3>all these different things and then just</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whole host of physical injuries as</v>

1350
01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:08.510
<v Speaker 3>well that they've been documented over</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1351
01:01:08.511 --> 01:01:11.450
<v Speaker 3>but they're just like 33 disabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% disabled.</v>

1352
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not missing a beat man.</v>

1353
01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in any chronic pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any symptomology of any of</v>

1354
01:01:17.781 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 3>those things and we've that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific or special to me.</v>

1355
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like mark,</v>

1356
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:26.660
<v Speaker 3>how can we've been able to take so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>dudes come off of their pain medication</v>

1357
01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:30.480
<v Speaker 3>without going into withdrawals like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>

1358
01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:32.000
<v Speaker 3>You need to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1359
01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Matthew was here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matthew was on 16 medications.</v>

1360
01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:38.780
<v Speaker 3>One of the medications was oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on 80 milligrams a day.</v>

1361
01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:41.660
<v Speaker 3>He was a morphine sulfate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>240 milligrams a day.</v>

1362
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:45.060
<v Speaker 3>He was on fentanyl patches and in six</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

1363
01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.810
<v Speaker 3>no patches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fentanyl patches on top of it.</v>

1364
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Every anesthesiologists that I run by</v>
<v Speaker 3>with what he was on,</v>

1365
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:54.830
<v Speaker 3>said the guy shouldn't be walking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1366
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:58.870
<v Speaker 3>he flew down from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Washington to come his tolerance,</v>

1367
01:01:58.871 --> 01:02:01.080
<v Speaker 3>it must've just been off the charts</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance stuff,</v>

1368
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.790
<v Speaker 3>tolerance and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had six pins in his draw,</v>

1369
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.910
<v Speaker 3>shrapnel out of the left side of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>head and his right leg was shot.</v>

1370
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.270
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reason why they justify it</v>

1371
01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:14.180
<v Speaker 3>all his medications six weeks after</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting the protocol,</v>

1372
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.240
<v Speaker 3>unique for him based on the biomarkers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on two medications a year later,</v>

1373
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 4>he's off all his medications and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>moves to Hollywood to become an actor</v>

1374
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.670
<v Speaker 4>and a screenwriter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally function,</v>

1375
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 4>no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to fuck him up more than</v>

1376
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 4>anything else to go back on 17</v>
<v Speaker 4>medications,</v>

1377
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:33.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1378
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:37.380
<v Speaker 4>but the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started seeing this pattern as andrew</v>

1379
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 4>brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're guys,</v>

1380
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:42.360
<v Speaker 4>we're getting offered their medications</v>
<v Speaker 4>and no withdrawal.</v>

1381
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.240
<v Speaker 4>So I went back to the literature and</v>
<v Speaker 4>started seeing the things about Nibin</v>

1382
01:02:46.241 --> 01:02:49.950
<v Speaker 4>all a and b receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more the opioid receptor alpha and</v>

1383
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Beta the mu receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it turns out a lot of the things</v>

1384
01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:57.570
<v Speaker 4>that we do modify it and modulating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then more recently talking about</v>

1385
01:02:57.571 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 4>pregnenolone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that mother of all hormones</v>

1386
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 4>that comes off of cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're using it in people who are</v>

1387
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 4>addicted to Benzodiazepines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are,</v>

1388
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>valium and so forth,</v>

1389
01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:12.180
<v Speaker 4>where they have side effects from being</v>
<v Speaker 4>on such a high dose where they're</v>

1390
01:03:12.181 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 4>sleeping all the time.</v>

1391
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:18.030
<v Speaker 4>They give him pregnenolone and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>decreases their fatigued during the day.</v>

1392
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:22.680
<v Speaker 4>And it turns out that we're value more</v>
<v Speaker 4>benzodiazepines work on this thing</v>

1393
01:03:22.681 --> 01:03:25.740
<v Speaker 4>called the Gaba a receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one of those relay stations.</v>

1394
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnenolone is what is what should be</v>

1395
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:33.540
<v Speaker 4>given instead of giving someone a</v>
<v Speaker 4>benzodiazepine.</v>

1396
01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:38.541
<v Speaker 4>So that's how we've been able to get all</v>
<v Speaker 4>our people off of antianxiety medication</v>

1397
01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:42.570
<v Speaker 4>has with this pregnenolone because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it functions and it's all out there.</v>

1398
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:45.270
<v Speaker 4>I didn't invent anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just reading the literature.</v>

1399
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Brie.</v>

1400
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.070
<v Speaker 4>So it fits into the same cell receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same receptor called the</v>

1401
01:03:50.071 --> 01:03:53.400
<v Speaker 4>benzodiazepine receptor on the Gabba a</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy,</v>

1402
01:03:53.401 --> 01:03:54.220
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1403
01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.120
<v Speaker 4>You've seen dudes that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what we were going to do.</v>

1404
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:58.380
<v Speaker 4>And like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pain free,</v>

1405
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.750
<v Speaker 4>no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none.</v>

1406
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 4>And coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not coming off the meds with without</v>

1407
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:03.714
<v Speaker 4>withdrawals.</v>

1408
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Critics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were you,</v>

1409
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.780
<v Speaker 4>did they put you on tramadol or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1410
01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 4>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even remember,</v>

1411
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a long time ago because he had</v>

1412
01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:12.630
<v Speaker 4>been off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the things that disturbs me the</v>

1413
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:16.650
<v Speaker 4>most about this is what if someone like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wasn't around,</v>

1414
01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 4>like what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kind of an outlier in the medical</v>

1415
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 4>community that you've really gravitated</v>
<v Speaker 4>towards helping soldiers,</v>

1416
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 4>helping people with Tbi for athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>football players,</v>

1417
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 4>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you weren't around?</v>

1418
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1419
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:33.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm not hearing about this from a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1420
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Andrew and I,</v>

1421
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 2015 when my second third book came</v>

1422
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:42.330
<v Speaker 4>out on traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we started giving classes,</v>

1423
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:46.230
<v Speaker 4>very inexpensive classes for docs to</v>
<v Speaker 4>come in and get trained.</v>

1424
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:49.890
<v Speaker 4>So to date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've trained specifically on the</v>

1425
01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 4>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 400 docs and they're going through</v>

1426
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:57.720
<v Speaker 4>a process of training and exams and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>forth before they become part of our</v>

1427
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 4>network.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's wire Angel Foundation Network,</v>

1428
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that we can disseminate the</v>

1429
01:05:02.851 --> 01:05:05.520
<v Speaker 4>information and have more people</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

1430
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:09.930
<v Speaker 4>But this is such an important thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a common factor.</v>

1431
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 4>There's so many people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering from depression and anxiety</v>

1432
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:16.980
<v Speaker 4>and all these different issues that very</v>
<v Speaker 4>easily could be attached,</v>

1433
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.490
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injuries</v>

1434
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people that don't even think they've</v>

1435
01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>had traumatic brain juice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sub concussive trauma.</v>

1436
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that have just</v>

1437
01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:28.630
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just been had a knock,</v>

1438
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.870
<v Speaker 2>knock and tumble rough and tumble life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll realize it,</v>

1439
01:05:31.871 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>but they've caused damage to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

1440
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 4>We see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have patients who come in under our</v>

1441
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:40.270
<v Speaker 4>wellness program and when they're asked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever had any traumatic brain</v>

1442
01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:41.440
<v Speaker 4>injury?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say no,</v>

1443
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:46.900
<v Speaker 4>but you look at the bio markers and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>see the pattern that they've had head</v>

1444
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.460
<v Speaker 4>trauma and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1445
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.480
<v Speaker 4>when I was 18 there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1446
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:53.830
<v Speaker 4>53 years of age or 47 years of age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1447
01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 4>When I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in a car accident and I hit my</v>

1448
01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.720
<v Speaker 4>left side of my head against the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1449
01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:01.510
<v Speaker 4>driver's side window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not,</v>

1450
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 4>wasn't knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have nausea,</v>

1451
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 4>didn't have vomiting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you think because of that,</v>

1452
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.140
<v Speaker 4>that you're immune.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1453
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:12.970
<v Speaker 4>it turns out that 85% of all traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain injuries are called mild for a</v>

1454
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:15.040
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have any symptoms.</v>

1455
01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people might have a little bit of a</v>

1456
01:06:16.721 --> 01:06:17.590
<v Speaker 4>headache,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1457
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or feeling fatigued.</v>

1458
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.320
<v Speaker 4>But for the most part they feel nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's 15% that make up the</v>

1459
01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 4>moderate to severe where they're in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>coma for periods of time.</v>

1460
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.360
<v Speaker 4>And we've actually had people who were</v>
<v Speaker 4>in coma,</v>

1461
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.610
<v Speaker 4>some of our vets who have been in coma</v>
<v Speaker 4>told,</v>

1462
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>connors,</v>

1463
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.250
<v Speaker 4>who was told that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1464
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 4>he'll never walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll never be able to,</v>

1465
01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of himself.</v>

1466
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 4>He'll die young and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Guy,</v>

1467
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 4>he's married and he's walking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's bicycle riding on,</v>

1468
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.551
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

1469
01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He shows his pictures and so forth that,</v>

1470
01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:47.170
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy couldn't walk.</v>

1471
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.170
<v Speaker 4>They told him he wouldn't walk again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got three guys like that.</v>

1472
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 4>And what was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what were they saying?</v>

1473
01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:53.140
<v Speaker 4>They want the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1474
01:06:53.141 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 4>the imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right mark and still shows damage in the</v>

1475
01:06:56.531 --> 01:06:57.490
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gray matter.</v>

1476
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the white matter and the white</v>

1477
01:06:59.111 --> 01:06:59.410
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

1478
01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:04.000
<v Speaker 4>But he's made new connections and so now</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why he's able to do it because of</v>

1479
01:07:04.001 --> 01:07:07.960
<v Speaker 4>the protocols allowed him to go back</v>
<v Speaker 4>into this neuro permissive environment.</v>

1480
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:10.510
<v Speaker 4>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means that he can experience new</v>

1481
01:07:10.511 --> 01:07:12.460
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The brain is rewiring itself,</v>

1482
01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 4>even though there's physical damage to</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain lobes because he can rewire</v>

1483
01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can get better and he's walking.</v>

1484
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 4>We have got three guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1485
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.610
<v Speaker 4>All the hormones that we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the testosterone,</v>

1486
01:07:24.611 --> 01:07:25.444
<v Speaker 4>estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>progesterone,</v>

1487
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:28.570
<v Speaker 4>we relate to them as gender hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male or female.</v>

1488
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:31.240
<v Speaker 4>We reproductive hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex hormones.</v>

1489
01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:36.260
<v Speaker 4>It turns out that each one of them has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>secondary function to Stastrom,</v>

1490
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.760
<v Speaker 4>stimulates the immune system to increase</v>
<v Speaker 4>the white blood cells,</v>

1491
01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:43.690
<v Speaker 4>the CD four and cd eight which are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>protective kind of white blood cells.</v>

1492
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:48.790
<v Speaker 4>It also decreases the inflammation in</v>
<v Speaker 4>our body called the t h one section of</v>

1493
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:51.730
<v Speaker 4>the immune system and stimulates the</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti-inflammatory,</v>

1494
01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Estradiol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>progesterone,</v>

1495
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.810
<v Speaker 4>pregnenolone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now pregnenolone.</v>

1496
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.850
<v Speaker 4>They all function to improve Alzheimer's</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions.</v>

1497
01:07:57.851 --> 01:08:02.170
<v Speaker 4>So if you're an elderly male or female</v>
<v Speaker 4>with low levels of hormones and you're</v>

1498
01:08:02.171 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 4>starting to develop dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to have your hormones looked at</v>

1499
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 4>because they regulate all these things</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to document it up the Kazoo or was,</v>

1500
01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Speaker 4>what about the interpretation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1501
01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 4>that's also where your unconventional</v>
<v Speaker 4>kariah standard means.</v>

1502
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.490
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've looked at it from uh,</v>

1503
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 4>a shift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1504
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.140
<v Speaker 4>hormone x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

1505
01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 4>has a range of 10 to 90 so you go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>your doctor and you get the blood tests</v>

1506
01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 4>and it's 15 and you've got all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>symptoms as though you're at below 10</v>

1507
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:37.850
<v Speaker 4>and the doctor says you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 4>having any symptoms because you're</v>

1508
01:08:37.851 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 4>within that range that we called the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reference range.</v>

1509
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.250
<v Speaker 4>But it turns out that not all of us are</v>
<v Speaker 4>identical genetically and function very</v>

1510
01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:48.590
<v Speaker 4>well at that specific level of 15.</v>

1511
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 4>So what we do is we bring people up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's called the median 10 on the</v>

1512
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 4>bottom 90 on the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet it together you get a hundred you</v>

1513
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 4>divided by two and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>statistical median.</v>

1514
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:04.060
<v Speaker 4>So we move people from that 15 all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way up towards that 50 and some people</v>

1515
01:09:04.221 --> 01:09:05.540
<v Speaker 4>hit 20 and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>

1516
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.700
<v Speaker 4>I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 29.</v>

1517
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:11.620
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a population who have</v>
<v Speaker 4>had the greatest amount of head trauma,</v>

1518
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:16.630
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury where they need</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go up between 50 and 75% and we still</v>

1519
01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:22.210
<v Speaker 4>keep everybody within the normal</v>
<v Speaker 4>physiological range as predict them by a</v>

1520
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:25.100
<v Speaker 4>traditional medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>classical medicine.</v>

1521
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's where we get the benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the reason why,</v>

1522
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:32.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these guys have had a missed</v>

1523
01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:36.620
<v Speaker 4>opportunity by their primary care doc to</v>
<v Speaker 4>improve them is because they are still</v>

1524
01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:41.621
<v Speaker 4>functioning under the old paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which in 1975 to major biostatisticians</v>

1525
01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:45.200
<v Speaker 4>came out with these two books that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like eight pounds each.</v>

1526
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:48.470
<v Speaker 4>And all they talked about is how all</v>
<v Speaker 4>this science,</v>

1527
01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:53.270
<v Speaker 4>all this chemistry that we do for people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it doesn't apply to you.</v>

1528
01:09:53.271 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it applied to the people that were part</v>

1529
01:09:55.731 --> 01:10:00.731
<v Speaker 4>of that study to set the standard range</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the reference range because I wasn't</v>

1530
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.780
<v Speaker 4>part of that group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my,</v>

1531
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 4>what's normal for me wasn't part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1532
01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:10.980
<v Speaker 4>So what the guy said was the two guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>said was what's best is to develop your</v>

1533
01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:17.270
<v Speaker 4>own reference range based on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he should do the same as I've been</v>

1534
01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:21.650
<v Speaker 4>doing over the past 60 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a guy comes in and he's an 11 and</v>

1535
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:24.950
<v Speaker 4>they tell him what he's normal in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothetical situation,</v>

1536
01:10:24.951 --> 01:10:26.870
<v Speaker 4>he still has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has all these symptoms,</v>

1537
01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:29.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we do in a provocative to</v>

1538
01:10:29.061 --> 01:10:31.790
<v Speaker 4>stossel testing and the guy and I also</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it in females,</v>

1539
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 4>is we test the theory out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1540
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.800
<v Speaker 4>if it is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to give you a shot.</v>

1541
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 4>What did you say you felt like for 60</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours since Cinderella?</v>

1542
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 4>Cinderella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got three daughters,</v>

1543
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.440
<v Speaker 4>so I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that Disney well,</v>

1544
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:46.303
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

1545
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.350
<v Speaker 4>So he received his injection and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>drove on the full of five talk to Becky</v>

1546
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:55.180
<v Speaker 4>for an hour and she told me the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she was in amazement that it goes</v>

1547
01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:56.470
<v Speaker 4>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1548
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.520
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't think it was me.</v>

1549
01:10:58.521 --> 01:10:59.850
<v Speaker 4>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1550
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.020
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he sends back a,</v>

1551
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 4>what happens is after they get their</v>
<v Speaker 4>injection,</v>

1552
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:08.480
<v Speaker 4>they send back five days later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this questionnaire that says how well</v>

1553
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:10.550
<v Speaker 4>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in big letters in the area,</v>

1554
01:11:10.551 --> 01:11:11.990
<v Speaker 4>that's for comments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

1555
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 4>I felt Cinderella</v>

1556
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.620
<v Speaker 5>after the ball and for 60 hours he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>just cruising.</v>

1557
01:11:18.621 --> 01:11:22.440
<v Speaker 5>And we're using physiological dosing of</v>
<v Speaker 5>testosterone.</v>

1558
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1559
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:27.420
<v Speaker 5>everybody who comes to the office is not</v>
<v Speaker 5>abiding bodybuilder.</v>

1560
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:31.470
<v Speaker 5>So we give physiological dosing because</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you give it more consistently,</v>

1561
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.340
<v Speaker 5>they get a better response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he was given 60 milligrams of a</v>

1562
01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 5>blended testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had a phenomenal,</v>

1563
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.660
<v Speaker 5>you had a good response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could respond.</v>

1564
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 5>But the crazy thing is we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about from 2014 we're in 2017 almost</v>

1565
01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:46.130
<v Speaker 5>2018 now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

1566
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're less than four years and</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this change has happened.</v>

1567
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:51.540
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's amazing that you've</v>

1568
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:55.800
<v Speaker 5>started the warrior Angels Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have helped so many soldiers</v>

1569
01:11:55.801 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 5>since then that you've gotten the word</v>
<v Speaker 5>out through your foundation.</v>

1570
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 5>We're dealing with a very short amount</v>
<v Speaker 5>of time and so many people have been</v>

1571
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 5>helped to this amazing extent.</v>

1572
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.730
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know we asked people how'd they</v>

1573
01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:13.200
<v Speaker 5>hear about us and thank God that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>started back in two 14 on your show.</v>

1574
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:17.070
<v Speaker 5>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so many people have commented to me,</v>

1575
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 5>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you see Joe would just thank them for</v>

1576
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:21.690
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have lists and lists of people who</v>

1577
01:12:21.691 --> 01:12:26.070
<v Speaker 5>would like to thank you for the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you believed in what I was doing</v>

1578
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 5>enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have us on the show the first time</v>

1579
01:12:29.341 --> 01:12:32.280
<v Speaker 5>back in 2014 separate Korean man and</v>
<v Speaker 5>people seek,</v>

1580
01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.490
<v Speaker 5>keep hearing it for the first time like</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ceased to.</v>

1581
01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:40.491
<v Speaker 5>It never ceases to amaze me every week I</v>
<v Speaker 5>get just a ton of mail from people who</v>

1582
01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:42.300
<v Speaker 5>heard it for the first time that like I</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't,</v>

1583
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:44.580
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think there was any solution</v>
<v Speaker 5>out there,</v>

1584
01:12:44.581 --> 01:12:45.120
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1585
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.860
<v Speaker 5>I think this is a really good time to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1586
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the reasons why I was</v>

1587
01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:51.720
<v Speaker 5>excited about this because the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 5>has grown exponentially since then.</v>

1588
01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:52.531
<v Speaker 5>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's much,</v>

1589
01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:53.061
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1590
01:12:53.061 --> 01:12:55.560
<v Speaker 5>the audience is much larger now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think we're going to be able to</v>

1591
01:12:55.561 --> 01:12:58.320
<v Speaker 5>affect and help a lot more people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1592
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:02.250
<v Speaker 5>so for people that are interested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that want to find out more</v>

1593
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:04.860
<v Speaker 5>information and then they want to try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>help themselves,</v>

1594
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 5>what's the best steps?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1595
01:13:07.171 --> 01:13:11.790
<v Speaker 5>so we set up the organization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had such a outpouring because of all</v>

1596
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 5>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was an overwhelming,</v>

1597
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost to get to everybody.</v>

1598
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.000
<v Speaker 5>So basically what we do now is we grant</v>
<v Speaker 5>a millennium health centers so much</v>

1599
01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:24.180
<v Speaker 5>money and we were helped to subsidize</v>
<v Speaker 5>costs like that.</v>

1600
01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:29.181
<v Speaker 5>So they'll go with our grants to mark's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a facility.</v>

1601
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.500
<v Speaker 5>They'll go there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll fill out information,</v>

1602
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:32.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>through his website,</v>

1603
01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:33.860
<v Speaker 5>which is millennium.</v>

1604
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.000
<v Speaker 5>Let's see,</v>

<v Speaker 5>legal.com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll fill out a new patient</v>

1607
01:13:42.871 --> 01:13:45.300
<v Speaker 5>information packet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put in all their information there.</v>

1608
01:13:45.301 --> 01:13:48.270
<v Speaker 5>Then they can be seen that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And let me tell you this about mark.</v>

1609
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.750
<v Speaker 5>Every time I go to visit him for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>doctor's visit,</v>

1610
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:55.530
<v Speaker 5>he won't let me pay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He may make pay for other soldiers.</v>

1611
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:58.260
<v Speaker 5>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He picks patients out and he goes,</v>

1612
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:59.370
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's pick some guys out.</v>

1613
01:13:59.371 --> 01:14:01.500
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna pay for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how he does it.</v>

1614
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.630
<v Speaker 5>And You have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're appreciative.</v>

1615
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.320
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you do as beautiful are the</v>

1616
01:14:07.321 --> 01:14:08.670
<v Speaker 5>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our corporation,</v>

1617
01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:10.140
<v Speaker 5>Millennium Health Centers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inks,</v>

1618
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has a fund.</v>

1619
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:17.370
<v Speaker 3>And what it does is it underwrites a</v>
<v Speaker 3>portion of the veterans.</v>

1620
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 3>And then warrior Angel Foundation</v>
<v Speaker 3>underwrites another portion of it.</v>

1621
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:22.990
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1622
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.570
<v Speaker 3>revenue that we get from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1623
01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.540
<v Speaker 3>some of the products you sell and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth goes to help,</v>

1624
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:29.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay for it.</v>

1625
01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.360
<v Speaker 3>People have to pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1626
01:14:31.361 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 3>But we found that they need to have some</v>
<v Speaker 3>skin in the game.</v>

1627
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1628
01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 3>That that enables us to be met halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

1629
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:40.930
<v Speaker 3>we've subsidized the rate where we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>made it.</v>

1630
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:42.640
<v Speaker 3>It's a form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's affordable period.</v>

1631
01:14:42.641 --> 01:14:44.710
<v Speaker 3>But now it's really affordable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1632
01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.920
<v Speaker 3>cause the insurance not taken for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole host of different reasons,</v>

1633
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 3>but so we've made it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now like we used to handle every</v>

1634
01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 3>case individually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the warrior Angels Foundation and,</v>

1635
01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:57.280
<v Speaker 3>and fund them and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just a hipaa mess and,</v>

1636
01:14:57.281 --> 01:15:00.670
<v Speaker 3>and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now we fund them directly and I've</v>

1637
01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:03.820
<v Speaker 3>worked to subsidize these rates and make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it affordable so we can help more people</v>

1638
01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:05.140
<v Speaker 3>get treatment and</v>

1639
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.880
<v Speaker 2>talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about having skin in the game and how</v>

1640
01:15:07.881 --> 01:15:10.250
<v Speaker 2>important that is just psychologically</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>

1641
01:15:10.251 --> 01:15:12.320
<v Speaker 2>It seems like if you give people things</v>
<v Speaker 2>for free,</v>

1642
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:15.020
<v Speaker 2>they just don't appreciate it as much as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make them work for it.</v>

1643
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunate because there's a lot</v>

1644
01:15:18.111 --> 01:15:20.510
<v Speaker 2>of people that really will work hard for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1645
01:15:20.511 --> 01:15:22.250
<v Speaker 2>They just don't have the financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

1646
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:26.060
<v Speaker 2>But there's so many that that applies to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1647
01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:28.310
<v Speaker 2>If you just give it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't appreciate it.</v>

1648
01:15:28.311 --> 01:15:29.780
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes too easy.</v>

1649
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fortunately very few people have</v>

1650
01:15:32.091 --> 01:15:35.120
<v Speaker 3>responded that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vets have been really good.</v>

1651
01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.860
<v Speaker 3>They've heard about us from either your</v>
<v Speaker 3>show or from one of the shows or from</v>

1652
01:15:39.861 --> 01:15:44.030
<v Speaker 3>their colleagues who are in the program</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they see how well it is.</v>

1653
01:15:44.031 --> 01:15:46.220
<v Speaker 3>And they look at the how dismal their</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is,</v>

1654
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:47.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have a choice.</v>

1655
01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Make a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to live the life that Andrew</v>

1656
01:15:50.781 --> 01:15:54.710
<v Speaker 3>had in the past or the enjoyment and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>love of life that he has now.</v>

1657
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:57.260
<v Speaker 3>And how could someone like me donate?</v>

<v Speaker 3>director.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

1668
01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Can you play that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go full screen.</v>

1669
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.170
<v Speaker 2>The average of glass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have travels at 163 miles per hour.</v>

1670
01:16:30.171 --> 01:16:35.171
<v Speaker 2>It says</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great pick.</v>

1671
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:40.950
<v Speaker 2>You got to see this video folks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are just listening to the</v>

1672
01:16:40.951 --> 01:16:43.290
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to see the impact of these</v>

1673
01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:44.110
<v Speaker 2>blasts.</v>

1674
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:47.350
<v Speaker 6>Explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So any type of injury that we needed to</v>

1675
01:16:47.351 --> 01:16:49.990
<v Speaker 6>get into a place that was denied for</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever reason,</v>

1676
01:16:49.991 --> 01:16:52.450
<v Speaker 6>be it a door or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was the guy who would place those</v>

1677
01:16:52.451 --> 01:16:57.451
<v Speaker 6>charges to get us in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not the person that you used to</v>

1678
01:17:07.441 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember things home.</v>

1679
01:17:09.771 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 6>I don't</v>

1680
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.540
<v Speaker 3>know where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five years.</v>

1681
01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:13.220
<v Speaker 3>I've driven that route everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden look up.</v>

1682
01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:14.054
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where you're at.</v>

1683
01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:19.030
<v Speaker 6>I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1684
01:17:19.031 --> 01:17:23.650
<v Speaker 6>this is going to go one of two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I continue on this path and it's going</v>

1685
01:17:23.651 --> 01:17:26.410
<v Speaker 6>to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or I can make a decision to quit blaming</v>

1686
01:17:26.411 --> 01:17:29.010
<v Speaker 6>my circumstance and decide to act.</v>

1687
01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:33.490
<v Speaker 3>And it says in 2014 when you met Mark</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gordon,</v>

1688
01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.890
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficiency and suicide are</v>

1689
01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.593
<v Speaker 7>connected</v>

1690
01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.140
<v Speaker 8>for the people listening to something</v>
<v Speaker 8>you need to see.</v>

1691
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:58.390
<v Speaker 8>It's just a lot of the text on the page</v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about the benefits of this and</v>

1692
01:17:58.391 --> 01:17:59.840
<v Speaker 8>how much it's helped.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Andrew and</v>

1693
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.490
<v Speaker 8>what does the name of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jamie?</v>

1694
01:18:03.491 --> 01:18:04.324
<v Speaker 8>So people get</v>

1695
01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:09.540
<v Speaker 3>quiet explosions and we just started</v>
<v Speaker 3>production this month,</v>

1696
01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.290
<v Speaker 3>right mark?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can donate there.</v>

1700

<v Speaker 3>is a donation three that you guys are</v>

1702
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:21.840
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1703
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:24.810
<v Speaker 3>three different stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All people through the foundation.</v>

1704
01:18:24.811 --> 01:18:27.030
<v Speaker 3>So we have two other crew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible stories.</v>

1705
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:30.420
<v Speaker 3>And then the top minds in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in science,</v>

1706
01:18:30.421 --> 01:18:35.421
<v Speaker 3>in neuroendocrinology and neuroscience</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuropathology are talking about</v>

1707
01:18:35.881 --> 01:18:40.320
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury and the protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of a concussion,</v>

1708
01:18:40.321 --> 01:18:42.270
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Identified a problem.</v>

1709
01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:45.630
<v Speaker 3>We're identifying a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only are we bringing out for the</v>

1710
01:18:45.631 --> 01:18:47.190
<v Speaker 3>first time ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1711
01:18:47.191 --> 01:18:50.670
<v Speaker 3>what is the real underlying condition</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind traumatic brain injury.</v>

1712
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Here's a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's all the science behind it,</v>

1713
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:56.310
<v Speaker 3>here's the specialists in their field</v>
<v Speaker 3>confirming,</v>

1714
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:58.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the literature has been saying.</v>

1715
01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:01.380
<v Speaker 3>And so we hope to bring that out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2019.</v>

1716
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.940
<v Speaker 3>And what are you going to do with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you bring it out?</v>

1717
01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.990
<v Speaker 3>We're just disseminate the information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to release it online?</v>

1718
01:19:06.991 --> 01:19:08.760
<v Speaker 3>You're going to release it in movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>theaters?</v>

1719
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:09.663
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1720
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:10.993
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of that.</v>

1721
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:13.280
<v Speaker 4>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As many places you can.</v>

1722
01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1723
01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure how it's gonna all be</v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed.</v>

1724
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:20.030
<v Speaker 4>The goal right now is to disseminate the</v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1725
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:23.720
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As we have more potential individuals</v>

1726
01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:25.550
<v Speaker 4>who are suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to this,</v>

1727
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been training doctors,</v>

1728
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:31.220
<v Speaker 4>we've been getting through multiple</v>
<v Speaker 4>avenues through the military,</v>

1729
01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:32.350
<v Speaker 4>through the different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1730
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:33.910
<v Speaker 4>divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1731
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.760
<v Speaker 4>getting them on board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>supporting US Navy Seal Foundation has</v>

1732
01:19:37.761 --> 01:19:39.660
<v Speaker 4>supported us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1733
01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:44.780
<v Speaker 4>that's all we're trying to do and we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>got enough ground swell in our</v>

1734
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:48.080
<v Speaker 4>population to justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As Andrew has said,</v>

1735
01:19:48.081 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 4>multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's reproducible,</v>

1736
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.373
<v Speaker 4>predictable,</v>

1737
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:53.550
<v Speaker 2>and there's something that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>impart here.</v>

1738
01:19:53.551 --> 01:19:57.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a stigma with men in particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country when it comes to</v>

1739
01:19:57.931 --> 01:20:00.360
<v Speaker 2>hormones and replacing hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1740
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:02.650
<v Speaker 2>they're very embarrassed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like it.</v>

1741
01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.170
<v Speaker 2>It disturbs them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1742
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>and they start to think of it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating or they start to think of it as</v>

1743
01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:10.770
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at it in</v>

1744
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:16.290
<v Speaker 2>an illogical way and that illogical ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to,</v>

1745
01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I think in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stigmas in our culture that are</v>

1746
01:20:20.791 --> 01:20:24.120
<v Speaker 2>attached to performance enhancing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for cheating in sports in the</v>

1747
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you always hear about them in this</v>

1748
01:20:25.801 --> 01:20:28.890
<v Speaker 2>sort of negative way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of guys that they shy</v>

1749
01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:30.750
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to many friends who are very</v>

1750
01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>smart and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talked to me about testosterone.</v>

1751
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:33.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1752
01:20:33.841 --> 01:20:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I've been on testosterone for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make it changes your life.</v>

1753
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.730
<v Speaker 2>It changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changes the way you function.</v>

1754
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm 50 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body functions like it did when I was</v>

1755
01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:43.950
<v Speaker 2>30 and that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really does.</v>

1756
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.230
<v Speaker 2>And I pushed that motherfucker all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1757
01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:49.790
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you this from just a</v>

1758
01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.000
<v Speaker 2>theoretical standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about from the physical</v>

1759
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.810
<v Speaker 2>action perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tell this to people and you see it</v>

1760
01:20:57.811 --> 01:21:00.930
<v Speaker 2>go in one ear and out the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take any testosterone.</v>

1761
01:21:00.931 --> 01:21:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to a doctor that's</v>

1762
01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 2>gonna get me human growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to look at my hormone</v>

1763
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:07.490
<v Speaker 2>levels and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

1764
01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:11.240
<v Speaker 2>you're depressed and you're tired all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and you're,</v>

1765
01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you're trying all these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1766
01:21:12.691 --> 01:21:16.230
<v Speaker 2>You're taking Zoloft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting magnet therapy.</v>

1767
01:21:16.231 --> 01:21:19.650
<v Speaker 2>I know people who've gotten ketamine</v>
<v Speaker 2>shots and all these different things to</v>

1768
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:20.790
<v Speaker 2>try to cure depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1769
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:23.250
<v Speaker 2>why don't you look at your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>

1770
01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:24.084
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1771
01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can look at,</v>

1772
01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:27.430
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mandate that they have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it,</v>

1773
01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:29.680
<v Speaker 4>but they should know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should know.</v>

1774
01:21:29.770 --> 01:21:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what mark's talking about is your</v>

1775
01:21:32.531 --> 01:21:35.020
<v Speaker 4>physiological optimal level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1776
01:21:35.021 --> 01:21:37.750
<v Speaker 4>And so that hypothetical scenario that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gave earlier,</v>

1777
01:21:37.751 --> 01:21:39.940
<v Speaker 4>if you're out at an 11 you know what I</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean?</v>

1778
01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:42.940
<v Speaker 4>And you're just once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>point above normal.</v>

1779
01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:44.740
<v Speaker 4>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not normal.</v>

1780
01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.710
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on the perceived lower end.</v>

1781
01:21:47.711 --> 01:21:50.380
<v Speaker 4>So he has a completely different sliding</v>
<v Speaker 4>scale to measure that.</v>

1782
01:21:50.381 --> 01:21:54.370
<v Speaker 4>But to me it would like be taken</v>
<v Speaker 4>objective analysis and just get a</v>

1783
01:21:54.371 --> 01:21:58.210
<v Speaker 4>snapshot of where that's at and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe to see what it would be like to</v>

1784
01:21:58.211 --> 01:22:00.370
<v Speaker 4>push it up a little bit and see if life</v>
<v Speaker 4>improved.</v>

1785
01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super physiological,</v>

1786
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:05.560
<v Speaker 4>physiological based on you in normal</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy levels.</v>

1787
01:22:05.561 --> 01:22:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might,</v>

1788
01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.990
<v Speaker 4>you might find out that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1789
01:22:07.991 --> 01:22:09.050
<v Speaker 4>I went up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1790
01:22:09.051 --> 01:22:11.590
<v Speaker 4>10 points and I'm great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you had to push it really high.</v>

1791
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.850
<v Speaker 4>You're different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1792
01:22:12.851 --> 01:22:15.850
<v Speaker 4>different strokes for different folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm trying to figure out is why</v>

1793
01:22:15.851 --> 01:22:20.851
<v Speaker 4>would someone rather take a psychotropic</v>
<v Speaker 4>medication than fixing what God has</v>

1794
01:22:21.011 --> 01:22:24.040
<v Speaker 4>given our body to manufacture that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of trauma,</v>

1795
01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:27.610
<v Speaker 4>because of genetics or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not producing it at the level.</v>

1796
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:32.950
<v Speaker 4>And another fallacy for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fallacy is that as we get older,</v>

1797
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:36.610
<v Speaker 4>it's acceptable to have lower and lower</v>
<v Speaker 4>levels of hormones.</v>

1798
01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about this?</v>

1799
01:22:37.631 --> 01:22:40.420
<v Speaker 4>The reason why they're getting lower and</v>
<v Speaker 4>lower is because of the shitty food</v>

1800
01:22:40.421 --> 01:22:43.540
<v Speaker 4>you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you had 60 years of</v>

1801
01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:46.030
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which have interrupted the brain's</v>

1802
01:22:46.031 --> 01:22:49.600
<v Speaker 4>ability to regulate homeostasis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to regulate your hormone production.</v>

1803
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:53.140
<v Speaker 4>That's the reason why the levels are</v>
<v Speaker 4>lower.</v>

1804
01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.230
<v Speaker 4>So bringing it back to 25 to 35 years of</v>
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>

1805
01:22:56.231 --> 01:23:01.231
<v Speaker 4>which has been the dictum in our office</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the past 27 years has been key.</v>

1806
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that jumped my</v>

1807
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.930
<v Speaker 2>testosterone up a bunch is cutting out</v>
<v Speaker 2>processed carbohydrates.</v>

1808
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:12.580
<v Speaker 2>All the refined carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just jumped it like 50% it was like</v>

1809
01:23:12.581 --> 01:23:14.650
<v Speaker 2>it doubled it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

1810
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it tells you how important the</v>

1811
01:23:17.921 --> 01:23:22.090
<v Speaker 2>biochemistry is of the buddy of the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>to regulate other aspects of it.</v>

1812
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Diet and exercise and sleep and</v>

1813
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>all these different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I saw that my,</v>

1814
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:31.960
<v Speaker 2>my testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it bumped up and then ultimately</v>

1815
01:23:31.961 --> 01:23:33.070
<v Speaker 2>doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1816
01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I was so confused as to why it took me</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long to figure this out,</v>

1817
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.600
<v Speaker 2>that eating pasta and bread and pizza</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the bullshit was having an</v>

1818
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 2>effect not just on like body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's having an effect on your whole</v>

1819
01:23:47.411 --> 01:23:51.100
<v Speaker 2>body being able to process all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals.</v>

1820
01:23:51.101 --> 01:23:55.180
<v Speaker 2>You got to think of yourself as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine and people don't like to do</v>

1821
01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1822
01:23:55.330 --> 01:24:00.010
<v Speaker 2>But think of your body as a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a machine or an engine or</v>

1823
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or can think of it as a vehicle,</v>

1824
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.340
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to have,</v>

1825
01:24:03.450 --> 01:24:05.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need spark plugs.</v>

1826
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:07.480
<v Speaker 2>You need cooling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need gasoline,</v>

1827
01:24:07.481 --> 01:24:11.260
<v Speaker 2>you need all these different factors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have the proper amount of</v>

1828
01:24:11.261 --> 01:24:13.930
<v Speaker 2>engine oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have the spark plugs aren't</v>

1829
01:24:13.931 --> 01:24:15.730
<v Speaker 2>working right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vehicle is not going to work right.</v>

1830
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Your body is far more complex than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

1831
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:23.940
<v Speaker 2>but similar in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The an analogy I like car analogies.</v>

1832
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a brand new porsche nine 11</v>

1833
01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:32.161
<v Speaker 2>carrera with four flat tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choose one of them to fill up and drive.</v>

1834
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.600
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be able to before</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardinal harm hormones of our body and I</v>

1835
01:24:36.601 --> 01:24:39.400
<v Speaker 2>see colleagues of mine who only focus in</v>
<v Speaker 2>on one hormone.</v>

1836
01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:44.650
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to be able to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice level ride if you don't look at all</v>

1837
01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:49.651
<v Speaker 2>for the key hormones and the also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>insanely complex way that all these</v>

1838
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 2>different nutrient levels and hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels interact with each other and that</v>

1839
01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:59.011
<v Speaker 2>they're all a part of this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that takes forever to just</v>

1840
01:24:59.441 --> 01:25:01.380
<v Speaker 2>scratch the surface of understanding.</v>

1841
01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean I read a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just scratched the surface of</v>

1842
01:25:05.681 --> 01:25:08.740
<v Speaker 2>understanding what's going on and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not sure I understand it.</v>

1843
01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.340
<v Speaker 2>It is so complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you see the results,</v>

1844
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:15.190
<v Speaker 2>you know that at least you're down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right pathway.</v>

1845
01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a symphony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1846
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.240
<v Speaker 2>that's what they always say it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>symphony.</v>

1847
01:25:19.241 --> 01:25:21.400
<v Speaker 2>But how better did you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1848
01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:23.620
<v Speaker 2>after cutting out those things and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone better,</v>

1849
01:25:23.670 --> 01:25:25.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like almost immediately like the big one</v>

1850
01:25:25.931 --> 01:25:28.200
<v Speaker 2>was the not needing a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the middle of the day I just</v>

1852
01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:32.520
<v Speaker 2>assumed that I would get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would eat breakfast.</v>

1853
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Then around three I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1854
01:25:33.941 --> 01:25:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I need to crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's testosterone deficiency.</v>

1855
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Three o'clock does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the insulin pump</v>

1856
01:25:38.861 --> 01:25:42.070
<v Speaker 2>right from the shitty process foods and</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates.</v>

1857
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I came off all protocols that 2017 for</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven months for this year.</v>

1858
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause just because I wanted to see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>would happen.</v>

1859
01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.100
<v Speaker 2>One I thought like the brain and body</v>
<v Speaker 2>went back to Nerpa miss of environment</v>

1860
01:25:54.101 --> 01:25:56.530
<v Speaker 2>and the hypothalamus and my pituitary</v>
<v Speaker 2>gland would turn back on.</v>

1861
01:25:56.531 --> 01:26:00.280
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had two labs to followed up.</v>

1862
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.650
<v Speaker 2>But I had to prove to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess emotionally,</v>

1863
01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:04.250
<v Speaker 2>spiritually</v>

1864
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:05.060
<v Speaker 5>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1865
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 5>I could slay that dragon and I could</v>
<v Speaker 5>live life without it.</v>

1866
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:11.800
<v Speaker 5>But it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was no by no means of the imagination</v>

1867
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:13.250
<v Speaker 5>optimized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1868
01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.500
<v Speaker 5>And then when I went back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1869
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 5>like my body composition changed again</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I noticed increased energy and I</v>

1870
01:26:19.971 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 5>thought I was doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was like,</v>

1871
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 5>life is better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a better person when this is</v>

1872
01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:26.450
<v Speaker 5>optimized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1873
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've proven to myself that I can do it</v>

1874
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:30.650
<v Speaker 5>without it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but life is not better.</v>

1875
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:33.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean we use of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We might be looking at some time in the</v>

1876
01:26:33.441 --> 01:26:37.760
<v Speaker 5>near future where they can do something</v>
<v Speaker 5>genetically where they can alter the way</v>

1877
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:40.040
<v Speaker 5>your pituitary gland functions are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the different things with</v>

1878
01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:42.680
<v Speaker 5>Crispr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with many of these genetic manipulation</v>

1879
01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:46.160
<v Speaker 5>tools that they're working on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as of right now,</v>

1880
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 5>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1881
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:52.700
<v Speaker 5>you have to get tested and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>replenish back to physiological levels.</v>

1882
01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:56.050
<v Speaker 5>All the hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a select all of them actually just</v>

1883
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.460
<v Speaker 5>do one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can mess up the whole,</v>

1884
01:26:57.690 --> 01:26:58.550
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1885
01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:03.700
<v Speaker 5>Is there a network of doctors that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've trained that you trust their work</v>

1886
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 5>that you can recommend?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way that people,</v>

1887
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:09.680
<v Speaker 5>so they don't have to travel to</v>
<v Speaker 5>California to meet you?</v>

1888
01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:10.050
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1889
01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:11.370
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the website,</v>

1890
01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:12.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>legal tb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I m e d l e g a l.</v>

1894
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:27.590
<v Speaker 4>under Tbi network and training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has a list of doctors.</v>

1895
01:27:27.901 --> 01:27:32.160
<v Speaker 4>We've trained doctors in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>

1896
01:27:32.161 --> 01:27:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand,</v>

1897
01:27:33.991 --> 01:27:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to Southeast Asia to train a</v>

1898
01:27:37.411 --> 01:27:38.244
<v Speaker 4>group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1899
01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:43.280
<v Speaker 4>in Cambodia and Vietnam for a project,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to establish centers in</v>

1900
01:27:45.331 --> 01:27:48.390
<v Speaker 4>Southeast Asia because there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>retired vets there.</v>

1901
01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.620
<v Speaker 4>Pull it up again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

1902
01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:53.210
<v Speaker 4>A lot of retired vets to set up centers</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they can offer treatment.</v>

1903
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:56.710
<v Speaker 5>And if you look at the website,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's listed all in alphabetical order.</v>

1904
01:27:56.711 --> 01:27:58.990
<v Speaker 5>We have California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's Arizona there,</v>

1905
01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.450
<v Speaker 5>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Florida,</v>

1906
01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.293
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1907
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:05.320
<v Speaker 4>my name's on it are people who are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the process of getting their</v>

1908
01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:08.890
<v Speaker 4>certification.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a four hour exam they have to</v>

1909
01:28:08.891 --> 01:28:13.360
<v Speaker 4>take and pass it with the least 70% and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then present two cases showing they have</v>

1910
01:28:13.361 --> 01:28:16.570
<v Speaker 4>the ability to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>utilize the information.</v>

1911
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:21.830
<v Speaker 5>So there's doctors available in many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many states and that's been our goal to</v>

1912
01:28:21.931 --> 01:28:26.400
<v Speaker 5>make this network of doctors where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can reach people at scale in the same</v>

1913
01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:30.480
<v Speaker 5>way like train trainers are trained</v>
<v Speaker 5>doctors and that's what we're working on</v>

1914
01:28:30.481 --> 01:28:33.840
<v Speaker 5>with the government right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's incredible is it how much you've</v>

1915
01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.610
<v Speaker 5>accomplished in such a short period of</v>
<v Speaker 5>time?</v>

1916
01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:37.590
<v Speaker 5>That's what's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obsessed.</v>

1917
01:28:37.890 --> 01:28:38.940
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It driven,</v>

1918
01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.160
<v Speaker 5>totally driven better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1919
01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.130
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing wrong in obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessed with everything.</v>

1920
01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.460
<v Speaker 5>People have a hard time with that word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think it's like it's gotten away</v>

1921
01:28:47.461 --> 01:28:48.780
<v Speaker 5>from them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Passionate.</v>

1922
01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:51.720
<v Speaker 5>Passionate is good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked that as we're taking the action,</v>

1923
01:28:51.721 --> 01:28:55.320
<v Speaker 5>but like for the right reasons and like</v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunities just continues to present</v>

1924
01:28:55.321 --> 01:28:57.480
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's just the byproduct of a</v>

1925
01:28:57.570 --> 01:28:59.310
<v Speaker 5>right way of doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1926
01:28:59.311 --> 01:28:59.731
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1927
01:28:59.731 --> 01:29:01.190
<v Speaker 5>let's be proactive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's go there.</v>

1928
01:29:01.210 --> 01:29:02.430
<v Speaker 5>Let's make things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1929
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:04.620
<v Speaker 5>let's go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said to me in the beginning,</v>

1930
01:29:04.621 --> 01:29:07.890
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be doing the right things</v>

1931
01:29:07.891 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 5>for the right reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what'll happen is things will shake</v>

1932
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:13.110
<v Speaker 5>out of the trees and land in front of</v>
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

1933
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:15.120
<v Speaker 5>And that's what basically has been</v>
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

1934
01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:16.470
<v Speaker 5>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1935
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.780
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the issue.</v>

1936
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:23.850
<v Speaker 5>Just get the work done in the response</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reaction of our vets.</v>

1937
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reaction,</v>

1938
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:27.470
<v Speaker 5>the response has been incredible as far</v>
<v Speaker 5>as like what I've heard and what,</v>

1939
01:29:27.471 --> 01:29:29.850
<v Speaker 5>what's come to me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1940
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.880
<v Speaker 5>hopefully we're shaking that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

1941
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.800
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
