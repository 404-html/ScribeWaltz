48
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>And that this show roast battle is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why I came back to the</v>

49
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went to see our,</v>

50
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>he was doing his a special and he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to film his first comedy central</v>

51
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>special at the store.</v>

52
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>And I hadn't been in the soar in seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

53
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't even stepped foot inside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

54
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.953
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I'm missing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a,</v>

56
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>had a bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullet,</v>

57
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I had to go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

58
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

59
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>let me just go the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

60
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Ross asked me to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>judges that roast battle.</v>

61
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>And so I was sitting up there and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

62
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

63
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>This is a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this was never here seven years</v>

64
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:52.641
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing,</v>

65
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like really creative writing,</v>

66
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>really like nasty jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then everybody's hugging afterwards,</v>

67
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's the one,</v>

68
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>like one of the rules is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you do it,</v>

69
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you got to hug it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was fucking great.</v>

70
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatively,</v>

71
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>this is so inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so,</v>

72
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>there's so much life to it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then our specialist had fucking them</v>

73
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:14.884
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

74
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.890
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy thing man.</v>

75
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:20.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just also just having you</v>
<v Speaker 2>show up and just be a part of that.</v>

76
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.340
<v Speaker 2>That was one of those things where like</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knew like all the younger</v>

77
00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:24.470
<v Speaker 2>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the open makers,</v>

78
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.680
<v Speaker 2>cause it started as an open mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we saw you come in ever,</v>

79
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.180
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this is different.</v>

80
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Like that's when everyone kind of was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

81
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.030
<v Speaker 2>oh things are changing.</v>

82
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

83
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>things have changed since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the store.</v>

84
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>The store is a crazy place now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

85
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started there in 94 and uh,</v>

86
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>

87
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>there's something that happened before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got there.</v>

88
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Like a bomb had gone off and like these</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

89
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>the survivors had just moved back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

90
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the age of kinison had died,</v>

91
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

92
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>and then there was really no one after</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

93
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>So like I came in the early nineties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinison was like 80,</v>

94
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the early eighties to like 86,</v>

95
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 1>88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I believe he died in like what</v>

96
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>did he die in like 1992 or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

97
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.810
<v Speaker 1>He'd already left the store and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got there it was all these weird</v>

98
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>road comics that were like boat acts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bowtech's boat acts,</v>

99
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>you know to boat act is someone who does</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cruise ships.</v>

100
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>No disrespect to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does cruise ships.</v>

101
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a lot of comics who</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do love doing cruise ships and</v>

102
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:32.360
<v Speaker 1>they're really funny comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

103
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I mean is like there's,</v>

104
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 1>there was certain people that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work anywhere else but like really</v>

105
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>shitty gigs and there was a lot of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the store and I was like,</v>

106
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>this is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was going to be like</v>

107
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor and you know Louie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson.</v>

108
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just going to be killer</v>
<v Speaker 1>after killer after killer.</v>

109
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is now.</v>

110

<v Speaker 1>This is the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Santino boom,</v>

119
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:10.841
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

120
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like kill or after killer young</v>
<v Speaker 1>killers.</v>

121
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Older killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

122
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Ron White is there now just walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

123
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.591
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

124
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>it's actually insane with us in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>back bar.</v>

125
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elder statesmen of standup comedy.</v>

126
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I remember when Ron White came into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>casino I was working at,</v>

127
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was before I moved to Los Angeles for</v>

128
00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just working in the bar and he was</v>

129
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 2>doing a show there and I remember I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

130
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's Ryan White.</v>

131
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt and I talked to him and then now</v>

132
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 2>it's just so crazy to be like at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store is sitting in the back</v>

133
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 2>smoking a joint just talking to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>about comedy</v>

134
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.990
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

135
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:43.800
<v Speaker 1>And we started doing the factory again</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

136
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.930
<v Speaker 1>We did the factory last week and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do it again next week.</v>

137
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.880
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do the factory on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday nights.</v>

138
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Every other Wednesday at 10 o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

139
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:56.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the factory was struggling and</v>

140
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the factory is a good</v>

141
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

142
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had a lot of weirdness in the past</v>

143
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 3>that was connected to it and the store</v>
<v Speaker 3>was always that place to go to.</v>

144
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important when we see these</v>

145
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 3>clubs that were really lucky to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we support them all.</v>

146
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

147
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 3>keep them going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cause it's guys like you,</v>

148
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 3>these guys that are coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

149
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be in the same position</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're in some day where you're,</v>

150
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

151
00:06:20.341 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 3>you're capable of like organizing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>night and fill up a room and then it</v>

152
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 3>pumps up the business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then guys like you get in,</v>

153
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when we did the ice house Wednesday</v>

154
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

155
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>guys like you get in and then you'll be</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that same position someday too.</v>

156
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking cool to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

157
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely just insane to be a part</v>

158
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

159
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to host when we were at the laugh</v>

160
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 3>factory that Wednesday and that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>bananas cause it was just like meeting</v>

161
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 3>the booker and the manager and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and again sick lineup.</v>

162
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just crazy.</v>

163
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

164
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 3>I know you're getting in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like at the door.</v>

165
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.911
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

166
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I remember those days man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>

167
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 3>I know it was never in a position like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in though.</v>

168
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Like your position is better than my</v>
<v Speaker 3>position when I was in like your,</v>

169
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 3>your stages of standup because you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>into something through standup.</v>

170
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I got into something through a Sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a sitcom was like it's okay but</v>

171
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the standup route is the best</v>

172
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 3>route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really odd too because of like just</v>

173
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 3>how many people have seen the roast</v>
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>

174
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Like just the finals.</v>

175
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost feel naive because I didn't</v>

176
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:28.721
<v Speaker 3>realize how many people were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like winning the combine of</v>

177
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 3>like at the NFL combine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for comedy it was,</v>

178
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a big deal.</v>

179
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 3>It was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like guys at the store and girls,</v>

180
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be sexist guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The girls and girls at the store.</v>

181
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were following it like a sports team.</v>

182
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Like we're following it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

183
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>

184
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.681
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's in the lead?</v>

185
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Who's winning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's he at?</v>

186
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.391
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 3>And just the vibe in the room was</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely crazy.</v>

188
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Just like hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a sporting event.</v>

189
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:53.871
<v Speaker 3>It was nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

190
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 3>When I showed up at the store after</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd won,</v>

191
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we were super bowl champs.</v>

192
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tracy.</v>

193
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were like crying,</v>

194
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 3>like other comp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also me winning was such a weird</v>

195
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 3>thing cause it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the La comedy community,</v>

196
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't wanna say like open miker is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

197
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I'm still an open mic or</v>

198
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

199
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Like I still hit open mics comic that</v>
<v Speaker 3>does these things.</v>

200
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 3>So it's like when I won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had see all these guys that I would</v>

201
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 3>see at these open mics and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was like we want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

203

<v Speaker 3>spots,</v>

204
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:25.730

<v Speaker 3>working at the store that's always doing</v>

205
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like a weird sense of pride.</v>

206
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 3>It was like your home team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>

207

<v Speaker 3>it shows you that you can do it.</v>

00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 2>doing it where I'm like hitting my is</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to go on shows.</v>

233
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm really taking it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it harder to do</v>

234
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>get cracking in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

235
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Because there's so much comedy here?</v>

236
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's hard to get cracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's tougher definitely.</v>

237
00:09:43.271 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you're willing to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard because you're surrounded by,</v>

238
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.930
<v Speaker 2>this is something my manager told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>right before I moved because I was</v>

239
00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 2>supposed to get a job and then I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was really better and I wanted to</v>

240
00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:56.470
<v Speaker 2>move to Los Angeles and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can move now and find out you're the</v>

241
00:09:56.471 --> 00:10:00.310
<v Speaker 2>shit and things are going to go great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you could move now and find out</v>

242
00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:03.460
<v Speaker 2>you're not the shit and then work really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard and then get really good.</v>

243
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a good manager.</v>

244
00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:07.000
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solid manager.</v>

245
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.351
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was a,</v>

246
00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:10.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a restaurant manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it was great advice.</v>

247
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't have anything to do with</v>

248
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:13.960
<v Speaker 1>comedy?</v>

249
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just a mall that day.</v>

250
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Come to start an agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it was so logical.</v>

251
00:10:19.121 --> 00:10:22.990
<v Speaker 2>That's why what he said was so logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never hear that from fucking standup</v>

252
00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:25.240
<v Speaker 2>comedy managers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give people the worst advice,</v>

253
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.700
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved here and then it was like,</v>

254
00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:28.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were just like,</v>

255
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:29.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no time in Los Angeles.</v>

256
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:29.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

257
00:10:29.891 --> 00:10:31.360
<v Speaker 2>there's time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're willing to make it,</v>

258
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.080
<v Speaker 2>like I will drive to have mike sign up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive to another mic,</v>

259
00:10:35.081 --> 00:10:36.910
<v Speaker 2>sign up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive back to that first.</v>

260
00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Mike hit a spot tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone that's running a show or a house</v>

261
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that I know is going to just toss me up</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end so I know I could go to that</v>

262
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Mike in two and a half hours while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for this other mic.</v>

263
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

264
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.510
<v Speaker 2>how much are you willing to pay for gas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

265
00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

266
00:10:53.411 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 2>you're investing in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

267
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Well you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

268
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>You're also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

269
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely investing in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

270
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you're growing in some weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when the more sets you do,</v>

271
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:07.670
<v Speaker 1>your act just kind of grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I've done the hat trick</v>

272
00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:08.870
<v Speaker 1>at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do the main room,</v>

273
00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 1>the belly room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the aor or what,</v>

274
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get to that third show,</v>

275
00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on fire,</v>

276
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.040
<v Speaker 2>you're just ready to have fun.</v>

277
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.120
<v Speaker 1>We just talked and in the groove and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where a lot of times new ideas</v>

278
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 1>come from because you're so comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>

279
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you're working on a new pit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out of nowhere this new angle comes</v>

280
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>up and it's the best angle of the bed.</v>

281
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.020
<v Speaker 2>It's cause it's just something you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

282
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like offhand</v>

283
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 1>saw something super satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about seeing someone work hard and</v>

284
00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:38.810
<v Speaker 1>become successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love seeing people succeed.</v>

285
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I can seeing like someone work hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it actually working and then you</v>

286
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.550
<v Speaker 1>see all these people that come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuses and they're always fucking off</v>

287
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:48.920
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not traveling enough,</v>

288
00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:50.750
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing enough sets and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing enough.</v>

289
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:52.730
<v Speaker 1>They're sticking with the same old</v>
<v Speaker 1>material for too long,</v>

290
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

291
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>And now it's different because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a weird position where it's like</v>

292
00:11:57.071 --> 00:11:59.740
<v Speaker 2>most people when something like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll turn off their hour or</v>

293
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like me,</v>

294
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

295
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm a door guy so I've got like 15 maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 good minutes.</v>

296
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 2>But now's the opportunity for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people ask me to headline somewhere</v>

297
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 2>like some random club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

298
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll do 20 minutes sets for the</v>

299
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 2>next year and a half to build that hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I just want to be a good college.</v>

300
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 2>You definitely have to get frantic now</v>
<v Speaker 2>about creating new material and that's</v>

301
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 2>something about those really short sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of times open mikes,</v>

302
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 2>they give you three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 2>what do you get three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes five and then sometimes for</v>

304
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 2>some people giving me a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer just because you know,</v>

305
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to</v>

306
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.060
<v Speaker 3>come on like that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like the setup for a bit</v>

307
00:12:35.061 --> 00:12:36.350
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

308
00:12:36.351 --> 00:12:39.860
<v Speaker 3>like you're just getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just getting the whole sort of</v>

309
00:12:39.861 --> 00:12:42.200
<v Speaker 3>landscape laid out before you go into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

310
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Speaker 3>Kennison used to say that that was a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing about Kennison not liking to do a</v>

311
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.140
<v Speaker 3>late night shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just like,</v>

312
00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't get cooking in five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

313
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 3>because he was used to doing those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would take the late spot at the store</v>

314
00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:55.850
<v Speaker 3>where he would just go as long as he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>

315
00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:58.160
<v Speaker 3>He would have that last spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kinison spot.</v>

316
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what we call it today.</v>

317
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.310
<v Speaker 3>We call it the Kennison spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done it.</v>

318
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'd done it like two or three</v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

319
00:13:03.051 --> 00:13:05.000
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done it in like recent years</v>

320
00:13:05.001 --> 00:13:05.450
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

321
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I got to do one super late spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time I worked a potluck</v>

322
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.570
<v Speaker 2>and usually at the rules of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

323
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.090
<v Speaker 2>the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you first get hired,</v>

324
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't get on friends and family</v>
<v Speaker 2>lists for a few months.</v>

325
00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It's something you have to earn a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I was working there.</v>

326
00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:22.160
<v Speaker 2>So it was like for the first four months</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get any spots you had to keep</v>

327
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:24.140
<v Speaker 2>working there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually the Tachyon potluck</v>

328
00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:27.320
<v Speaker 2>and then if you're good enough to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>you on the name or you put your name on</v>

329
00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:30.200
<v Speaker 2>the list so you have to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was my first night working</v>

330
00:13:30.201 --> 00:13:33.380
<v Speaker 2>potluck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one 30 in the morning and the host</v>

331
00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:36.560
<v Speaker 2>is about to finish the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm talking to one of the guys,</v>

332
00:13:36.561 --> 00:13:36.921
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

333
00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I just got hired here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gotten up.</v>

335
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.940
<v Speaker 2>There's still two people here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no paid regulators.</v>

336
00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Can I just go up at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do like three or five minutes?</v>

337
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And the manager's looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

338
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

339
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.331
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

340
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I got to go up three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did like potluck at one 30 in the</v>

341
00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:55.220
<v Speaker 2>morning in front of two people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like the most funniest I've</v>

342
00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:56.310
<v Speaker 2>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

343
00:13:56.311 --> 00:13:57.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're realizing like,</v>

344
00:13:57.561 --> 00:13:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on stage at the comedy store.</v>

345
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That alone.</v>

346
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually behind a mic in front of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience at the comedy store where</v>

347
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:08.120
<v Speaker 2>everyone else has been that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling these exact same footsteps.</v>

348
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

349
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 3>this is a conversation that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

350
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.230
<v Speaker 3>the other day with a another comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about how there's</v>

351
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.910
<v Speaker 3>certain actors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially I think actors who will treat</v>

352
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

353
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 3>that are like what they call below the</v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

354
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 3>like producers and people who are extras</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people who are,</v>

355
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

356
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not caterers,</v>

357
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.060
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not the PR,</v>

358
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not the executives and they're</v>

359
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:37.660
<v Speaker 3>not the big top people and the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>actors.</v>

360
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 3>So they treat them one way and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the folks that work on the set a</v>

361
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those people are not equal.</v>

362
00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like below the line.</v>

363
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking about how with stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>up everybody at the store is pretty much</v>

364
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>like once you working there and once</v>

365
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your people like you and you're cool,</v>

366
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.570
<v Speaker 1>we're all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Like you get that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's Daniel Tosh or you</v>

368
00:14:59.121 --> 00:14:59.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Burr,</v>

369
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 1>like they'll talk to you like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks to you that like everybody's the</v>

370
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 1>same because we all know that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>

371
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody work in the door that has</v>

372
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>dreams to become a standup is like me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was delivering newspapers or</v>

373
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>driving limos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

374
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.570
<v Speaker 1>We're all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah</v>

375
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 2>it's Angela crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like,</v>

376
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean working at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you put a great point,</v>

377
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 2>like there's definitely a moment where</v>
<v Speaker 2>headliners start taking you seriously</v>

378
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 2>and then treat you like a peer and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an awesome moment and just like,</v>

379
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.080
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting right when it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember when like you know,</v>

380
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you first started talking to me or like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jessel knicker like Jeff Ross first like</v>

381
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>gave me attention just to like talk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could hold their attention like</v>

382
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:44.990
<v Speaker 2>we like it felt like we were peers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just insane feeling to have as a</v>

383
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:46.220
<v Speaker 2>young comic for the first time.</v>

384
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Well that's part of the scary thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

385
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any endeavor,</v>

386
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.010
<v Speaker 1>whether you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to become a,</v>

387
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.490
<v Speaker 1>an artist or a surgeon or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you want to become.</v>

388
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.820
<v Speaker 1>If you have people that you see that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of you that are already doing it,</v>

389
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.770
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the barrier between you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and them as insurmountable and sometimes</v>

390
00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:08.260
<v Speaker 1>just someone saying something to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just someone saying,</v>

391
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:11.440
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody starts out as a beginner.</v>

392
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no instant experts know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start out as a beginner,</v>

393
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and then eventually you figure it</v>

394
00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:21.460
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyone you see that is up there.</v>

395
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.960
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's you.</v>

396
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.880
<v Speaker 1>We're all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just people,</v>

397
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.800
<v Speaker 1>people in the people that are further</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

398
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have an obligation to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

399
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>if you liked the art form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love the art form.</v>

400
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I think stand up comedy is like my still</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite thing to watch.</v>

401
00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:38.710
<v Speaker 1>How all these years of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want more people to succeed.</v>

402
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

403
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a greed thing that some</v>

404
00:16:43.091 --> 00:16:45.190
<v Speaker 1>folks possess where they only want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shine.</v>

405
00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:46.750
<v Speaker 1>They want to be the only person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>shines.</v>

406
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people coming up,</v>

407
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.860
<v Speaker 1>they're like fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm going to keep these fuckers</v>

408
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:52.600
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just my boot motherfucker.</v>

409
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.700
<v Speaker 1>You know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some of that,</v>

410
00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're trying to kick you as</v>

411
00:16:56.261 --> 00:16:57.880
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to climb up behind him.</v>

412
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced that a few times but I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:04.950
<v Speaker 2>oh my mom always told me and my dad too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom always said it was one of the</v>

414
00:17:04.951 --> 00:17:07.110
<v Speaker 2>things we were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you treat everyone the way you want to</v>

415
00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:08.820
<v Speaker 2>be treated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also you also got to remember,</v>

416
00:17:08.821 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have to be nice to have</v>

417
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.830
<v Speaker 2>because you never know who's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you know.</v>

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Well you should just be nice cause it</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels good too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you feel like such a fraud.</v>

440
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel every time I go up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rose back because I got to go</v>

441
00:18:01.221 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 2>up every Tuesday at the roast battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then before it was just like audiences</v>

442
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 2>who kind of like have seen the rose pose</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the fans of it.</v>

443
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 2>But now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first week where people came</v>

444
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 2>to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they were just like,</v>

445
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.770
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>both just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

451
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 2>but now it's like there's a pressure</v>
<v Speaker 2>every Tuesday for me to do something</v>

<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

460
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love working here,</v>

461
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:53.610
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just getting too busy at nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can only work phones.</v>

462
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.660
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>working at the store.</v>

467
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 2>It's the only place that I know of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really has that system where the</v>

468
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:09.030
<v Speaker 2>employees are all comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all so it's so weird to fun</v>

469
00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:11.340
<v Speaker 2>place to work because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best man.</v>

470
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in that picture too,</v>

471
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:15.960
<v Speaker 2>it's one those things where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone called me and was like,</v>

472
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 2>can you work phones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

473
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:18.871
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll work phones.</v>

474
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 2>So I worked phones and then I sat in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>main room because someone couldn't make,</v>

475
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:25.070
<v Speaker 2>cause someone was out of town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sway sat the shift and then every,</v>

476
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 2>and then I had to help with the roast</v>
<v Speaker 2>battle cause they do that anyways.</v>

477
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just part of my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like I did all these things</v>

478
00:19:30.631 --> 00:19:34.920
<v Speaker 2>and then I got to do a set and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to judge the roast battle and Tasi</v>

479
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 2>jokes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause when I judge,</v>

480
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I mostly just write jokes so I can just</v>
<v Speaker 2>say funny things while I'm,</v>

481
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll let everyone else do like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the critiques and stuff.</v>

482
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 2>It's also like who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

483
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.390
<v Speaker 2>But I just an opportunity for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shine and make funny jokes at the people</v>

484
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:50.250
<v Speaker 2>battling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it,</v>

485
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.930
<v Speaker 2>it's all just in today's work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

486
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.970
<v Speaker 2>it's all just work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing about that roast</v>

487
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 2>battle show that's really interesting is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's really a joke writer showcase</v>

488
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:59.500
<v Speaker 2>because everything has to be new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

489
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't use stock jokes and you are,</v>

490
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.760
<v Speaker 2>you're essentially giving an assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

491
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

492
00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 2>hey Frank Castillo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

493
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Smith and you know,</v>

494
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you've got to figure out what's fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up about Bob Smith's head.</v>

495
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 2>That one joke he said about that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will do,</v>

496
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:16.190
<v Speaker 2>is it his forehead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe's forehead?</v>

497
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe's foreheads,</v>

498
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Joe's forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it added a second story on</v>

499
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:21.990
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be more room to think about</v>

500
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:22.824
<v Speaker 2>dicks.</v>

501
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.950
<v Speaker 2>That kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it do,</v>

502
00:20:26.951 --> 00:20:29.730
<v Speaker 2>did have a large forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like that's something that you have</v>

503
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 2>to think up about that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you make a regular forehead joke</v>

504
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.250
<v Speaker 2>and it's not going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

505
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.001
<v Speaker 2>oh okay cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

506
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 2>he's got a big forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

507
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 2>But if you make it and add layers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what it's more funny.</v>

508
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he really is a set up punchline</v>

509
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.720
<v Speaker 2>format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

510
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's it really funny format because it's</v>

511
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 2>a blah</v>

512
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah is so blah blah blah.</v>

513
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.903
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

514
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.440
<v Speaker 1>there's no ranting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no you really,</v>

515
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>you only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go on rants also because</v>

516
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you're really only supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed one line.</v>

517
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I can sometimes people cheat and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw like two and three in wwe.</v>

518
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.120
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the cool thing about it.</v>

519
00:21:05.121 --> 00:21:06.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like boxing.</v>

520
00:21:06.951 --> 00:21:08.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty of the roast battle</v>
<v Speaker 2>show is like,</v>

521
00:21:08.751 --> 00:21:11.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not only writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also performance and it's like the</v>

522
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:12.980
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the finals,</v>

523
00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you can see where like I do some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and then it's also,</v>

524
00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:19.670
<v Speaker 2>that's something I learned from Mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence and the season one where Mike</v>

525
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.091
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>season one,</v>

526
00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:23.450
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the only guys to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start the,</v>

527
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.350
<v Speaker 2>thank you blah blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then go into the joke and then hit</v>

528
00:21:27.351 --> 00:21:28.730
<v Speaker 2>them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

529
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.030
<v Speaker 2>so it's fitting a rebuttal in new your</v>
<v Speaker 2>setup.</v>

530
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.030
<v Speaker 2>And then this season I did something new</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it was like,</v>

531
00:21:35.031 --> 00:21:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I knew that if people hit me with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like joke,</v>

532
00:21:37.731 --> 00:21:41.240
<v Speaker 2>they were going to stop and wait for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughter and then do the rest of their</v>

533
00:21:41.241 --> 00:21:41.840
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>

534
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.110
<v Speaker 2>So in my mind I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I hit them quick with a better looks</v>

535
00:21:45.111 --> 00:21:47.390
<v Speaker 2>like joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll take the momentum out of that last</v>

536
00:21:47.391 --> 00:21:50.480
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it just depends on this joke to</v>

537
00:21:50.481 --> 00:21:51.920
<v Speaker 2>create the momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

538
00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:54.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you're playing chess up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's like boxing.</v>

539
00:21:54.711 --> 00:21:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like jokes or just quick jabs</v>

540
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.200
<v Speaker 2>and then your big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big jokes are you're like an haymakers.</v>

541
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some mean shit that gets said to</v>

542
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.780
<v Speaker 2>all my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some soul searing shift gears</v>

543
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.880
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you will be scarred.</v>

544
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are really bro,</v>

545
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird art form.</v>

546
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

547
00:22:19.161 --> 00:22:22.250
<v Speaker 1>like this whole roast battle things a</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different thing than regular</v>

548
00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:23.084
<v Speaker 1>standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

549
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regular standup is in it.</v>

550
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you still have to like perform.</v>

551
00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:29.220
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like that last battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and Rashard was so good.</v>

552
00:22:29.221 --> 00:22:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Cause prostart is one of the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes I know.</v>

553
00:22:32.221 --> 00:22:35.370
<v Speaker 2>He's a great writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super cool dude and an amazing rose</v>

554
00:22:35.371 --> 00:22:37.170
<v Speaker 2>bachelor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like when you're in that</v>

555
00:22:37.171 --> 00:22:40.020
<v Speaker 2>situation and there's just so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure because it's like you're</v>

556
00:22:40.021 --> 00:22:43.200
<v Speaker 2>getting made fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to memorize these jokes because</v>

557
00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:47.490
<v Speaker 2>they had us memorize the two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pot the guy we were going against and</v>

558
00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:49.380
<v Speaker 2>the two possible winners of the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>bracket.</v>

559
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh how much time did you have to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>these bits?</v>

560
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was think five days,</v>

561
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.340
<v Speaker 2>five days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to write five jokes for jokes.</v>

562
00:22:59.341 --> 00:23:00.990
<v Speaker 2>The first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one possible over time.</v>

563
00:23:00.991 --> 00:23:03.990
<v Speaker 2>And then the finals was five jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One possible over time.</v>

564
00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:08.010
<v Speaker 2>So six trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So total you're writing 1820 jokes,</v>

565
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.620
<v Speaker 2>not including your looks like or your</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick rebuttals.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh Yay.</v>

573
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Season One,</v>

574
00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:32.130
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what they want to do cause</v>

575
00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:34.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like in the finals they want it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a great show.</v>

576
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So for me it wasn't like he was riding</v>
<v Speaker 2>me jokes.</v>

577
00:23:36.571 --> 00:23:40.080
<v Speaker 2>It was like we both sat down and I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of premises and a bunch of</v>

578
00:23:40.081 --> 00:23:42.810
<v Speaker 2>angles and we talked strategy and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went from there.</v>

579
00:23:42.811 --> 00:23:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was like if I'm going to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of Joe,</v>

580
00:23:44.251 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I can't just be making many gay jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get dinged for that.</v>

581
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 2>But it's like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's such a big characteristic of how</v>

582
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 2>he is and how he walks and just like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>he holds himself that it's like you</v>

583
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:56.520
<v Speaker 2>can't not make jokes about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

584
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.750
<v Speaker 2>So it was like if I make jokes about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be silly and it has to come</v>

585
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:04.640
<v Speaker 2>from like a child like ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

586
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:05.710
<v Speaker 2>So I cannot like call him like</v>

587
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.040
<v Speaker 2>like a faggot or something like superman</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

588
00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I just got it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could say it was like he loves but</v>

589
00:24:11.281 --> 00:24:12.160
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

590
00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Like that's just funny and childlike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

591
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

592
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a tone that you have to set</v>

593
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.430
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be too mean.</v>

594
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.770
<v Speaker 1>No because while you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even while you're saying really mean</v>

595
00:24:22.771 --> 00:24:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Shit Zack,</v>

596
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.170
<v Speaker 2>cause you can lose the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

597
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.550
<v Speaker 2>But if you can gain their trust to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where you've said so many silly</v>

598
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:31.100
<v Speaker 2>funny things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where at the end you can really</v>

599
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 2>earn saying something terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as long as it's fun.</v>

600
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Now is it weird to be doing these rows</v>
<v Speaker 1>battles where you're writing all this</v>

601
00:24:39.031 --> 00:24:42.640
<v Speaker 1>new stuff every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you're doing standup</v>

602
00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a lot of stuff that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already done before?</v>

603
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird in the sense that it's like,</v>

604
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it's making me realize that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different like that I can just,</v>

605
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I can create new material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

606
00:24:54.661 --> 00:24:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Because especially in high pressure</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations,</v>

607
00:24:57.331 --> 00:25:00.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if I give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have a goal or a set a set time,</v>

608
00:25:00.631 --> 00:25:04.350
<v Speaker 2>like I can write new material and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm realizing is like I can just do</v>

609
00:25:04.351 --> 00:25:06.420
<v Speaker 2>that with my standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can do that with Rose Battle where</v>

610
00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:09.570
<v Speaker 2>I sit down and write all these jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that with writing packets.</v>

611
00:25:09.571 --> 00:25:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I can do that with my standup and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just getting up and just doing it.</v>

612
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.150
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's that book?</v>

613
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.153
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

614
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.390
<v Speaker 1>This book is the shit after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting mad at me now from</v>

615
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.450
<v Speaker 1>for suggesting this book so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's called the war of art.</v>

616
00:25:27.451 --> 00:25:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's by this Guy Steven Pressfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's essentially about overcoming</v>

617
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.360
<v Speaker 1>what he calls resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what most people call procrastination.</v>

618
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that overcoming this,</v>

619
00:25:37.351 --> 00:25:39.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that keeps you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually putting in the work.</v>

620
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.583
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

621
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about it and he sort of</v>

622
00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:46.440
<v Speaker 1>identifies it and then it gives you</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools to deal with it and explains how</v>

623
00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:49.590
<v Speaker 1>it affected him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was essentially just not doing well</v>

624
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:51.930
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his life until he was about 40 and</v>

625
00:25:51.931 --> 00:25:53.760
<v Speaker 1>then at 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of got his shit together and now</v>

626
00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:58.761
<v Speaker 1>he's just a award winning author and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>written a bunch of great movies and a</v>

627
00:25:59.101 --> 00:26:02.010
<v Speaker 1>bunch of great books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just very inspirational stuff.</v>

628
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.560
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was kind of getting at.</v>

629
00:26:04.561 --> 00:26:07.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that now that you're in this new</v>

630
00:26:07.351 --> 00:26:10.680
<v Speaker 1>spot where everybody knows who you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you won the Rose Battle,</v>

631
00:26:10.681 --> 00:26:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you've got all this heat on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like super important now to take</v>

632
00:26:14.101 --> 00:26:16.260
<v Speaker 1>all that writing to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

633
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I thought it was busy now herb</v>

634
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.270
<v Speaker 2>before just grinding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing these jokes.</v>

635
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I walked into levity and the</v>

636
00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 2>manager knew me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone kind of knows who I am in</v>

637
00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:26.774
<v Speaker 2>a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

638
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

639
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm famous on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just know that I did this thing and</v>

640
00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 2>then there's a window.</v>

641
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.860
<v Speaker 1>He's got to jump through that window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

642
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.000
<v Speaker 1>because some people miss that window and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

643
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.140
<v Speaker 1>You'll run into guys that were on last</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic standing a long time ago and they</v>

644
00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:45.141
<v Speaker 1>had a window where things were happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them and then it blew away and they</v>

645
00:26:45.631 --> 00:26:47.460
<v Speaker 1>never capitalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never jumped through it.</v>

646
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And then some guys like Ralphie may who</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump through it running,</v>

647
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ralphie may probably worked harder than</v>

648
00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 1>anybody after that show was that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>cranking out dvds,</v>

649
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 1>tour in everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

650
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.310
<v Speaker 1>he capitalized phenomenally on his time</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the show,</v>

651
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 1>but other people just did not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just never really,</v>

652
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:06.990
<v Speaker 1>never really got a cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you are,</v>

653
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like in a great spot like right</v>

655
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:11.050
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

656
00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:11.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

657
00:27:11.771 --> 00:27:12.640
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

658
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't plan on stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to do as many sets as I can.</v>

659

<v Speaker 2>I'll still do someone's Quincenera for</v>

671
00:27:39.281 --> 00:27:43.240
<v Speaker 2>that was one of my favorite things was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting working the door and just</v>

672
00:27:43.241 --> 00:27:46.090
<v Speaker 2>watching all the comics go up.</v>

673
00:27:46.091 --> 00:27:47.500
<v Speaker 2>comedy college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>shows and then start doing shows there</v>

<v Speaker 2>as a paid regular,</v>

705
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.690

<v Speaker 1>These people were out of their mind.</v>

709
00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.460
<v Speaker 1>There was a reporter who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

710
00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.420
<v Speaker 1>did you see that one reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Jewish reporter when he tried to shut</v>

<v Speaker 1>him down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to sit down?</v>

712
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

713
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 1>the reporter that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

714
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:13.120
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about what kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>landslide he won the electoral college</v>

715
00:29:13.121 --> 00:29:14.950
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's the greatest landslide</v>

716
00:29:14.951 --> 00:29:16.210
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody did better.</v>

719
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Obama did better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Herbert Walker did better.</v>

720
00:29:23.921 --> 00:29:26.230
<v Speaker 1>George W did better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all did better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

722
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the guy from CNN and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ended up calling him CNN.</v>

723
00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:29.660
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.300
<v Speaker 2>now I got a new name for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very fake news.</v>

725
00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's that guy.</v>

726
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's on Patton Oswalt's twitter page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He retweeted it that someone said about</v>

727
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 1>calling</v>

728
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 5>him out on his lies because he says what</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

729
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he won by the biggest landslide</v>

730
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:48.670
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then this other guy comes in like</v>

731
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 5>someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's that overt with their ego.</v>

732
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 5>Like that's never been a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>White House before.</v>

733
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so strange to see.</v>

734
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 5>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that it seems like already</v>

735
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.350
<v Speaker 5>that's wearing on him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

736
00:30:04.351 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like a crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see it.</v>

737
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:06.611
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

740
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:11.650
<v Speaker 5>And it's also like the people he's got</v>
<v Speaker 5>around him,</v>

741
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

742
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 5>they're not helping him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's out a blunt with tobacco on the</v>

743
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:18.130
<v Speaker 5>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but Charlie Murphy got me on this.</v>

747
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>all they did was smoke weed and one of</v>

749
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 5>my cousins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like a thing with him.</v>

750
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 5>Whenever I'd roll a blunt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd get mad at me if it,</v>

751

<v Speaker 5>but he'd like give me shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

770
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 5>love weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weed's my favorite.</v>

771
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.510
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I had to tell my mom</v>
<v Speaker 5>that your weed smoker.</v>

772
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.460
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she found weed in my,</v>

773
00:31:27.461 --> 00:31:31.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my room and then she told me,</v>

774
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:32.510
<v Speaker 5>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

775
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I ever catch you smoking weed,</v>

776
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 5>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to beat the shit out of you.</v>

777
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.320
<v Speaker 5>But then the second I turned 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was just like,</v>

778
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:41.380
<v Speaker 5>and then it started to become legal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was like the first person to try to</v>

779
00:31:41.381 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 5>get a card.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

782
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 5>why was she worried about you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because she,</v>

783
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 5>when she was young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she did a lot of crazy stuff.</v>

784
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.263
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

787
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.410
<v Speaker 5>get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

788
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 5>the people always resist the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 5>their children are going to become</v>

789
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:00.400
<v Speaker 5>adults,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bothers them.</v>

790
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.970
<v Speaker 5>And it bothers them that their children</v>
<v Speaker 5>are going to face the same tests.</v>

791
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.781

<v Speaker 5>be a beggar,</v>

805
00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:31.410
<v Speaker 5>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm not going to be yachts.</v>

806
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a man.</v>

807
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 5>You're done Zack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He made it through,</v>

808
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

809
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Play this because it's hilarious.</v>

810
00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:40.290
<v Speaker 5>This is the trump something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the reporter</v>

811
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.143
<v Speaker 2>correcting them.</v>

812
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.573
<v Speaker 4>Listen to us.</v>

813
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Is it not going through?</v>

814
00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:49.623
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

815
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 2>We have a little bit of a sound here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Costs,</v>

816
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 2>bring it all the way back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of [inaudible] six electoral</v>

817
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:03.530
<v Speaker 2>college votes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was the biggest electoral</v>

818
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:06.470
<v Speaker 2>college wind since Ronald Reagan.</v>

819
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.210
<v Speaker 6>You said today that you had the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 6>electoral margin</v>

820
00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:17.820
<v Speaker 6>votes for Obama got 365</v>
<v Speaker 6>330 when George Hw Bush 426 when he won</v>

821
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.310
<v Speaker 6>as presence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So why should Americans cross?</v>

822
00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:28.450
<v Speaker 6>We'll no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was told I was given that information.</v>

823
00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:29.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just given,</v>

824
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.760
<v Speaker 6>we had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very big margin.</v>

825
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.990
<v Speaker 6>Why should Americans across from you</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you accused the information they</v>

826
00:33:34.991 --> 00:33:37.690
<v Speaker 6>received from being vague when you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>providing information as well?</v>

827
00:33:37.691 --> 00:33:39.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was giving you that information</v>

828
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually,</v>

829
00:33:40.881 --> 00:33:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that information around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a very substantial victory.</v>

830
00:33:43.941 --> 00:33:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you agree with that?</v>

831
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's good enough.</v>

832
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 6>So yes,</v>

833
00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.880
<v Speaker 2>this is craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

834
00:33:50.881 --> 00:33:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like you saw him adjust it mid</v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence where he was like,</v>

835
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.690
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about Republicans and then</v>

836
00:33:57.691 --> 00:33:59.280
<v Speaker 2>it turns out this guy hit him with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>

837
00:33:59.281 --> 00:34:02.220
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he verbal boxed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he set him up with that because he</v>

838
00:34:02.221 --> 00:34:04.890
<v Speaker 2>had Herbert Walker in his pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He built up,</v>

839
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went Obama and then he hits it.</v>

840
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.210
<v Speaker 2>He is Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why was I was talking about Republicans</v>

841
00:34:09.211 --> 00:34:14.211
<v Speaker 2>and then he held this George Herbert</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walker Bush boom,</v>

842
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.930
<v Speaker 2>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it for 55,</v>

843
00:34:15.931 --> 00:34:17.280
<v Speaker 2>he won by landslides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

844
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what did he do?</v>

845
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.810
<v Speaker 2>What trump did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just goes,</v>

846
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

847
00:34:22.831 --> 00:34:24.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of the information I was</v>

848
00:34:24.421 --> 00:34:27.180
<v Speaker 2>given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to know something funny?</v>

849
00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.940
<v Speaker 2>When I did the roast battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

850
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.420
<v Speaker 2>this is a great moment just for me as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hispanic man.</v>

851
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told that Barron trump joke with,</v>

852
00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did and it was right after the lady</v>

853
00:34:39.271 --> 00:34:40.920
<v Speaker 2>got fired from snl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

854
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.390
<v Speaker 2>And the joke I did was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

855
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.610
<v Speaker 2>and Dan Nolan was the one who wrote it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he kept,</v>

856
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.980
<v Speaker 2>he pushed me so hard to do it and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

857
00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:47.731
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

858
00:34:47.731 --> 00:34:49.020
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do this one.</v>

859
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:50.123
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

860
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

861
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.463
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

862
00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.240
<v Speaker 2>and it could pass for a trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got the body of Millennia,</v>

863
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.280
<v Speaker 2>the brains of Ivanka and her womb is</v>
<v Speaker 2>barren.</v>

864
00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:00.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

865
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a puts a play on words,</v>

866
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.240
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

867
00:35:04.241 --> 00:35:06.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just a good show mean eh,</v>

868
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.790
<v Speaker 2>she's not baron and his amazing woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

869
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.060
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just so funny cause it was like</v>

870
00:35:13.061 --> 00:35:16.900
<v Speaker 2>the next day a conservative website</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote an article about it and the</v>

871
00:35:16.901 --> 00:35:20.050
<v Speaker 2>article was about how good the joke was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were like,</v>

872
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.250
<v Speaker 2>this is how you don't write a joke or</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is swinging down against the</v>

873
00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:27.100
<v Speaker 2>president's son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a great joke on plan where it's,</v>

874
00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 2>and this can get you to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just so funny to see people</v>

875
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.500
<v Speaker 2>look at that and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

876
00:35:31.501 --> 00:35:32.560
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a good joke.</v>

877
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.550
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird that intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>people thought it was okay to attack his</v>

878
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>

879
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

880
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 5>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should never just attack a person,</v>

881
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 5>especially a kid who doesn't mean we</v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

882
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 5>It's weird that people make these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

883
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.950
<v Speaker 5>they just have these decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make like that.</v>

884
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's okay because he's a kid of the</v>

885
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:51.030
<v Speaker 5>enemy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

886
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 5>it's just a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to hold yourself to a higher</v>

887
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:54.810
<v Speaker 5>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I was like making that joke.</v>

888
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Speaker 5>I felt like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a higher standard,</v>

889
00:35:57.691 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 5>but the good that you have that higher</v>
<v Speaker 5>standard because I think we all</v>

890
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 5>recognize that the base idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that base instinct to tax someone's kid</v>

891
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:06.144
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

892
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 5>The best part though was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

893
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 5>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

894
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 5>someone came up to me and they were just</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

895
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 5>we don't want you to not make jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just want you,</v>

896
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:15.680
<v Speaker 5>if you could please,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

897
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 5>not mention Barron trump anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that'd be great.</v>

898
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

899
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.950
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't make a habit of it.</v>

900
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:23.161
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

901
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:24.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna,</v>

902
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 5>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thanks.</v>

903
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:25.231
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

904
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:27.520
<v Speaker 5>that's feels cool that they told me to</v>
<v Speaker 5>not do something.</v>

905
00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:27.931
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

906
00:36:27.931 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 5>that's great dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a rebel.</v>

907
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

908
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:32.010
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a really good joke.</v>

909
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 5>As you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a play on words.</v>

910
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not mean at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not meet at all,</v>

911
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:37.890
<v Speaker 5>nor is it really a joke about him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just his name.</v>

912
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 5>It's a great joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really pretty flawless joke when</v>

913
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:42.700
<v Speaker 5>it comes to that subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

914
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 5>Right on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people would just say,</v>

915
00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 5>you're crossed it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that they're wrong.</v>

916
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's a perfect point</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's like you have to not make</v>

917
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 5>these jokes to fine line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like as Comedians,</v>

918
00:36:57.031 --> 00:36:58.370
<v Speaker 5>that's our job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

919
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.960
<v Speaker 5>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not push the boundaries and like say</v>

920
00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 5>terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like you see a challenge,</v>

921
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.120
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>See how finely you can walk that line</v>

922
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.140
<v Speaker 5>when you see a guy like trump going</v>
<v Speaker 5>through this,</v>

923
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.460
<v Speaker 5>whatever he's going through right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that that's just the,</v>

924
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.510
<v Speaker 5>this is just total speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that's the weight of all</v>

925
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:21.420
<v Speaker 5>these people that are upset at him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that's the magnitude of the</v>

926
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:23.200
<v Speaker 5>job?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think he,</v>

927
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 5>this is just who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this is who he is.</v>

928
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.520
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he definitely,</v>

929
00:37:29.521 --> 00:37:32.820
<v Speaker 5>I think from what we can see is he</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely stepped into a job he thought</v>

930
00:37:32.821 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 5>he could do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now he's just like,</v>

931
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.461
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

932
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 5>Cause there's definitely some times</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you watch them and you see him try</v>

933
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 5>to run it like a business or the way he</v>
<v Speaker 5>talks to people.</v>

934
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Whereas just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

935
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:45.090
<v Speaker 5>that's the way a boss would talk to</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone that he thinks is employed by</v>

936
00:37:45.091 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

937
00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's also going through the</v>

938
00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:52.260
<v Speaker 5>scrutiny of some of the smartest people</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world,</v>

939
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think he ever has been</v>

940
00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 5>through that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think he's gone through the</v>

941
00:37:56.881 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Speaker 5>scrutiny of the general public in an</v>
<v Speaker 5>entertainment sense.</v>

942
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.700
<v Speaker 5>And then as sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

943
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:05.640
<v Speaker 5>a cultural icon census is the term of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this billionaire,</v>

944
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.290
<v Speaker 5>flamboyant character puts his name on</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of these fabulous buildings and runs</v>

945
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:11.760
<v Speaker 5>casinos and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

946
00:38:11.761 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 5>that's how we thought of him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like a bad ironman.</v>

947
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:15.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

948
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's Donald Trump.</v>

949
00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:18.264
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

950
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:23.390
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to be that successful</v>
<v Speaker 5>without some crazy drive to win.</v>

951
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.640
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

952
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.680
<v Speaker 5>you get this blinders sorta almost bull</v>
<v Speaker 5>headed determination forward and guys</v>

953
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:34.320
<v Speaker 5>like that conquered worlds.</v>

954
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.183
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

955
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 5>that's the real deal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

956
00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really what it is.</v>

957
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 5>That mindset that it's not always</v>
<v Speaker 5>correct,</v>

958
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 5>but it's somehow or another almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>always prosperous.</v>

959
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they can get through,</v>

960
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Speaker 5>they can get through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think the guy like that who's so</v>

961
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 5>business savvy and so it was good at</v>
<v Speaker 5>making money and some would argue,</v>

962
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 5>maybe you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I'm wrong.</v>

963
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.890
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he just invested his dad's money.</v>

964
00:38:56.891 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Speaker 5>I've heard all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he still made a lot of fucking</v>

965
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:00.130
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

966
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.930
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

967
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.670
<v Speaker 5>who knows how much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how much money you made and</v>

968
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.640
<v Speaker 5>he's gotten money that's for switches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

969
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like all throughout history,</v>

970
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.610
<v Speaker 5>those guys that have done that have been</v>
<v Speaker 5>like conquerors.</v>

971
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just,</v>

972
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.020
<v Speaker 5>he's just getting to do it in business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

973
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Now he's trying to do it on a global</v>
<v Speaker 5>scale,</v>

974
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.240
<v Speaker 5>but I think that that's almost like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mindset of those like super billionaire.</v>

975
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have like conquerors genetics or</v>

976
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:27.390
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

977
00:39:27.391 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got like a little bit of Alexander</v>

978
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.380
<v Speaker 5>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's just humans like</v>

979
00:39:32.381 --> 00:39:33.051
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

980
00:39:33.051 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 5>But now those humans find themselves in</v>
<v Speaker 5>business like these like super winner</v>

981
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 5>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

982
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 5>fuck what you care about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck what you think.</v>

983
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 5>You know this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do it my way.</v>

984
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.990
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I feel like I have that drive</v>

985
00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

986
00:39:47.831 --> 00:39:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Where it's like now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially where it's like,</v>

987
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:50.680
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>

988
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that driver,</v>

989
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it and let's just work hard and get</v>

990
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:55.390
<v Speaker 5>the shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

991
00:39:55.391 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's what he's got.</v>

992
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it definitely think he's got some of</v>

993
00:39:58.931 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

994
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's definitely misplaced in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>nod direction.</v>

995
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just under the scrutiny of all of</v>

996
00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:08.080
<v Speaker 5>these insanely intelligent people now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just really,</v>

997
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 5>really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that reporter like that,</v>

998
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 5>that kind of interaction is a new thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>to him.</v>

999
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the,</v>

1000
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.440
<v Speaker 5>just the way he communicates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1001
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's ever been in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>situation where I think he's always been</v>

1002
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 5>in a situation where he definitely feels</v>
<v Speaker 5>and thinks,</v>

1003
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:24.040
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm definitely the smartest person in</v>

1004
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:27.160
<v Speaker 5>the room right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like when you put up up against</v>

1005
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:27.994
<v Speaker 5>someone that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1006
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.780
<v Speaker 5>more intelligent and like also have</v>
<v Speaker 5>their shit ready in their facts,</v>

1007
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.900
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't know how to like handle that</v>

1008
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 5>and then he just like breaks down in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense what you just saw,</v>

1009
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:39.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he like change his words and he like,</v>

1010
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really interesting from a</v>

1011
00:40:42.221 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 5>psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1012
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:48.811
<v Speaker 5>Howard stern had a really fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 5>take on it and his take on it was that</v>

1013
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 5>trump really wants to be loved and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a bad job for him because of</v>

1014
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1015
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there's a precedent.</v>

1016
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 5>There's no president that's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 5>universally loved,</v>

1017
00:40:58.931 --> 00:40:59.850
<v Speaker 5>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1018
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:03.470
<v Speaker 5>I have way more like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either people love you or people hate</v>

1019
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.690
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.520
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't say,</v>

1021
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.210
<v Speaker 5>it's never like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh I can live with them.</v>

1022
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1023
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.250
<v Speaker 5>like some people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could live with them.</v>

1024
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 5>With George W after nine 11 his approval</v>
<v Speaker 5>rating went through the roof.</v>

1025
00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:17.021
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1026
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 5>I do because he made us feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did,</v>

1027
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we said,</v>

1028
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well when some shit goes down this is</v>

1029
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 5>the kind of guy you want there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some guy who gives a real good speech</v>

1030
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.590
<v Speaker 5>right afterwards has this strong</v>
<v Speaker 5>military backing and going,</v>

1031
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what we need right now.</v>

1032
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1033
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.940
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ways you know that that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you need after some sort of a,</v>

1034
00:41:38.941 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 3>a global crisis like that you need some</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a leader.</v>

1035
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was probably like the one time</v>

1036
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 3>that I can remember just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't that long before people</v>

1037
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:50.770
<v Speaker 3>giving up on him again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1038
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 3>after mission accomplished maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard that that was like the beginning</v>

1039
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 3>of the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once they did that,</v>

1040
00:41:55.581 --> 00:42:00.581
<v Speaker 3>they had that they had a warship with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant mission accomplished banner in the</v>

1041
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 3>background and the war is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1042
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 3>goes on for another like seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1043
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:09.701
<v Speaker 3>So why did the war end there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much later after that mission</v>

1044
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 3>accomplished at the war actually end my</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite.</v>

1045
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.090
<v Speaker 2>There was a dude whose job it was to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that printed up.</v>

1047
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably would just staring at it</v>

1048
00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:17.950
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1049
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.520
<v Speaker 3>so insanely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone talked to him and they said,</v>

1050
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.570
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

1051
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

1052
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.360
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put up the flag.</v>

1053
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put up the banner.</v>

1054
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that mission accomplished.</v>

1055
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like a scene in a movie,</v>

1056
00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:34.650
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at that photo,</v>

1057
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that real?</v>

1058
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Is that really what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Folks?</v>

1059
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.220
<v Speaker 3>As you get older and you see this thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

1060
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.360
<v Speaker 3>you see these people and you see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidents and you see the White House</v>

1061
00:42:48.361 --> 00:42:50.790
<v Speaker 3>and Congress and you realize after</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awhile,</v>

1062
00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all just people.</v>

1063
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are all just people,</v>

1064
00:42:54.721 --> 00:42:58.500
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are entrapped in this system</v>

1065
00:42:58.501 --> 00:43:03.210
<v Speaker 3>that they've constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In order to dictate where they go,</v>

1066
00:43:03.211 --> 00:43:07.170
<v Speaker 3>when they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much they get and how they can live.</v>

1067
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a series of laws that the,</v>

1068
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:11.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1069
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.590
<v Speaker 3>the Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the general idea is they're there to</v>

1070
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:17.310
<v Speaker 3>protect you and your interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a lot of ways,</v>

1071
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.130
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1072
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.920
<v Speaker 3>we don't trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a system.</v>

1073
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1074
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.250
<v Speaker 3>system of control that we all agree to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:43:23.251 --> 00:43:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1076
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's so funny cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the more stuff that happens with</v>

1077
00:43:27.581 --> 00:43:29.980
<v Speaker 2>him and then just seeing everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more and more,</v>

1078
00:43:29.981 --> 00:43:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't real.</v>

1079
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.010
<v Speaker 2>This is all just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has to be a joke.</v>

1080
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels,</v>

1081
00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:38.080
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't feel real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it never did.</v>

1082
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.570
<v Speaker 3>It feels less and less real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What time though?</v>

1083
00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 2>It does you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you always make this joke where</v>

1084
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:45.760
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a simulation and there's many a</v>

1085
00:43:45.761 --> 00:43:48.880
<v Speaker 2>day where I'll just specially going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road with you just being here just</v>

1086
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:49.990
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

1087
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this was a simulation,</v>

1088
00:43:51.731 --> 00:43:53.860
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely the simulation I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing.</v>

1089
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like this is a fun one to play.</v>

1090
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.890
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's a lot of game</v>
<v Speaker 3>elements in it.</v>

1091
00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.760
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's good decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad decisions,</v>

1092
00:44:02.761 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 3>and the repercussions for each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

1093
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird,</v>

1094
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:13.660
<v Speaker 3>weird world that you live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a popular person wins the</v>

1095
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:18.360
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know like someone who decides that they,</v>

1096
00:44:18.361 --> 00:44:23.150
<v Speaker 3>they're going to run things like there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>never been a guy like trump who's run a</v>

1097
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:26.690
<v Speaker 3>country like that and we just became</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a really popular person and then</v>

1098
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:29.570
<v Speaker 3>just took over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating.</v>

1099
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite,</v>

1100
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 3>just the people that fall</v>

1101
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.360
<v Speaker 5>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

1102
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.300
<v Speaker 5>I love just watching them and talking to</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1103
00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 5>Some people are happy that there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos,</v>

1104
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 5>no mistake about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some people that are happy that</v>

1105
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:44.070
<v Speaker 5>he's in there because they think that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the system that was in place was</v>

1106
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:45.750
<v Speaker 5>insanely corrupt and I think they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1107
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 5>They're banking on him being the</v>
<v Speaker 5>solution to that,</v>

1108
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.470
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because of his business savvy.</v>

1109
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand politics or finances</v>
<v Speaker 5>enough to know if they're right.</v>

1110
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1111
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 5>but I know that like culturally it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>

1112
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.790
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>

1113
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 5>you know the difference between right</v>
<v Speaker 5>and wrong.</v>

1114
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would hope so.</v>

1115
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:08.243
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1116
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:10.030
<v Speaker 5>it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not necessary.</v>

1117
00:45:10.031 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 5>I think it's an impossible job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1118
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.390
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

1119
00:45:13.391 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we should phase it out.</v>

1120
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 5>I think we should figure out how to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>a large group of people,</v>

1121
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.350
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1122
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 5>And I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go as many as like a dozen and</v>

1123
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:27.540
<v Speaker 5>have these people work it out like</v>
<v Speaker 5>really smart people.</v>

1124
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All scientists now.</v>

1125
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:31.110
<v Speaker 5>Different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different disciplines.</v>

1126
00:45:31.111 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 5>I think you'd have to have people from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the medical profession who'd have to</v>

1127
00:45:34.261 --> 00:45:36.390
<v Speaker 5>have people from the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 5>communities,</v>

1128
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.290
<v Speaker 5>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1129
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 5>astrophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to have people that are</v>

1130
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:43.230
<v Speaker 5>predicting like what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 5>asteroids.</v>

1131
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:45.200
<v Speaker 5>We cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is Everything cool or should we just,</v>

1132
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.730
<v Speaker 5>should we just fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do whatever we want?</v>

1133
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 5>Because we're going to get hit by a</v>
<v Speaker 5>giant rock 40 miles wide,</v>

1134
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 10 years.</v>

1135
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 5>So we just chill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>

1136
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:57.300
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need people smarter than me to fucking</v>

1137
00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 5>decide stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that.</v>

1138
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.180
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's one of the things where it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1139
00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 5>like I'm an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm also pretty kind of well versed</v>

1140
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:05.040
<v Speaker 5>on a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.250
<v Speaker 5>But I mean I don't know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 5>finances.</v>

1142
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean I like to think I know a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>bit about politics,</v>

1143
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.980
<v Speaker 5>but I mean if there's a group of</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists and people that are really,</v>

1144
00:46:13.981 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>design,</v>

1145
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:17.070
<v Speaker 5>I'd much rather have that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then one dude,</v>

1146
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 5>he's not a big fan of a certain round</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1147
00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:20.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1148
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know shit about politics,</v>

1149
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 5>but I do know and I talk about it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1150
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:29.030
<v Speaker 5>we shouldn't talk about swim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't shoot.</v>

1151
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even going to study that crazy</v>

1152
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

1153
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.570
<v Speaker 5>I think you can kiss my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People allowed to give you money and</v>

1154
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:40.860
<v Speaker 5>then you do things that they want you to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that donate money to you and then you</v>

1155
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 5>make decisions that benefit them and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're for real.</v>

1156
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to be smart to know that.</v>

1157
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:48.270
<v Speaker 5>That seems a little bit fucking weird.</v>

1158
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:50.100
<v Speaker 5>That systems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just old as fuck.</v>

1159
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 5>And that's how they had to do it in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 hundreds okay,</v>

1160
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.750
<v Speaker 5>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's 2017 we could come up with a better</v>

1161
00:46:54.751 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1162
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.970
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Across the board.</v>

1163
00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like everyone's tripping about the</v>

1164
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.900
<v Speaker 5>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they're deporting illegals and</v>

1165
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:05.520
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They really are,</v>

1166
00:47:05.521 --> 00:47:06.181
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1167
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:09.350
<v Speaker 5>That's so is it more than they used to</v>
<v Speaker 5>deport people cause how much of the used</v>

1168
00:47:09.351 --> 00:47:11.580
<v Speaker 5>to deport you still deporting regular</v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts of people.</v>

1169
00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 5>From what I understand from what I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>looked at,</v>

1170
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:16.560
<v Speaker 5>but the thing that I'm worried about and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that worries me is that it's like</v>

1171
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:22.110
<v Speaker 5>there's certain people that obviously</v>
<v Speaker 5>are illegal here and are getting sent</v>

1172
00:47:22.111 --> 00:47:23.370
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not all of them,</v>

1173
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.310
<v Speaker 5>but just the fact that there's some that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are getting sent back that are American</v>

1174
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 5>concerns me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 5>And there's that are really cool as</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

1176
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Cause I mean I haven't really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

1177
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.910
<v Speaker 2>real fucking cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of really nice people.</v>

1179
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make this joke now where it's like I,</v>

1180
00:47:37.441 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I joke about losing my id and how that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a big problem for me now.</v>

1181
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like if I get stopped and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to convince this dude that I'm</v>

1182
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1183
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:48.970
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that hear me say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>jug or like,</v>

1184
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not real.</v>

1185
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:51.200
<v Speaker 2>That's steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's dumb fear.</v>

1186
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can just talk to them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1187
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1188
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Speaker 2>but what if that guy's having a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad day and also don't you think like</v>

1189
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 2>every other Mexican that gets cotton</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to be trying to give the</v>

1190
00:48:01.481 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 2>exact same speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am 100% man.</v>

1191
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because they're really only</v>

1192
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 2>targeting Mexicans around California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to deport Canadians.</v>

1193
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Hot Blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pan's hot blonde girl from Vancouver and</v>

1194
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.700
<v Speaker 2>sent her home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1195
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.220
<v Speaker 2>the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1196
00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Targeting Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1197
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I would assume white people going crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1198
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It is my favorite limousine liberal.</v>

1199
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 2>My favorite too is that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1200
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I talk about these things and stuff in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very joking manner,</v>

1201
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 2>but these are real problems certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are having.</v>

1202
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.190
<v Speaker 2>And I went to a small show and it was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a house and it was just a lot of like</v>

1203
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 2>white checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white guys,</v>

1204
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:43.360
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1205
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 2>But I could just see some of them start</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get uncomfortable with the things I</v>

1206
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 2>was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

1207
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1208
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 2>A wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A wall.</v>

1209
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like one day that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be real.</v>

1210
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.321
<v Speaker 2>The Wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1211
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the wall is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1212
00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>

1213
00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is a great idea.</v>

1214
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a new world order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like idea,</v>

1216
00:49:05.931 --> 00:49:08.110
<v Speaker 1>like one government to rule the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1217
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.080
<v Speaker 1>But I think it would be really nice if</v>
<v Speaker 1>people could go wherever the fuck they</v>

1218
00:49:12.081 --> 00:49:15.050
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like this idea that you can</v>

1219
00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:18.410
<v Speaker 1>like legally restrict people's movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on patches of dearth they were</v>

1220
00:49:18.411 --> 00:49:22.910
<v Speaker 1>shit out onto is pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like that's going to go</v>

1221
00:49:22.911 --> 00:49:25.610
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't go away a hundred</v>

1222
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:26.720
<v Speaker 1>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go away a thousand years</v>

1223
00:49:26.721 --> 00:49:28.370
<v Speaker 1>from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's preposterous.</v>

1224
00:49:28.371 --> 00:49:28.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1225
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.211
<v Speaker 2>what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

1226
00:49:29.211 --> 00:49:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I talk to people what the</v>

1227
00:49:30.711 --> 00:49:32.120
<v Speaker 2>immigration thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always,</v>

1228
00:49:32.121 --> 00:49:33.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I respect people's opinions.</v>

1229
00:49:33.981 --> 00:49:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen and I'm willing to learn and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll listen where you'd have to say</v>

1230
00:49:38.151 --> 00:49:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and if it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably make fun of you a little</v>

1231
00:49:40.161 --> 00:49:42.080
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how I deal with things.</v>

1232
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like California used to be a</v>

1233
00:49:45.561 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 2>part of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1234
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.280
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we buy it.</v>

1235
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:52.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should say we throw myself into white</v>

1236
00:49:52.611 --> 00:49:54.320
<v Speaker 2>people even though my parents were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants.</v>

1237
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Speaker 2>We're all immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The colonocytes.</v>

1238
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

1239
00:49:57.741 --> 00:49:59.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why I need though people</v>

1240
00:49:59.721 --> 00:50:00.890
<v Speaker 2>do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1241
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1242
00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I would say we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1243
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.890
<v Speaker 2>well we killed all the Indians now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bitch did zero direct connection</v>

1244
00:50:06.891 --> 00:50:09.980
<v Speaker 2>to me and ending Indian deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1245
00:50:09.981 --> 00:50:11.420
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did it.</v>

1246
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we came here,</v>

1247
00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:14.240
<v Speaker 2>we pushed out the native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so wait,</v>

1248
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:17.000
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny that they say pushed out,</v>

1249
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.781
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1250
00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:20.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pushed out in a very nice term.</v>

1251
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.840
<v Speaker 2>So what we did to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1252
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.130
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1253
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:28.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's that we thing it's supernatural</v>

1254
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super easy to get locked up into</v>

1255
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 3>little tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just got to give it up.</v>

1256
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to give it up.</v>

1257
00:50:33.081 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is old and dumb.</v>

1258
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Speaker 3>It's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fine for teams.</v>

1259
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to play sports.</v>

1260
00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:40.650
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cleveland's going to tell you going to</v>

1261
00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 3>the loo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fork and go to a</v>

1262
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 3>representative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need a big asteroid that's fucking</v>

1263
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:47.810
<v Speaker 3>unify everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would do that.</v>

1264
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.020
<v Speaker 3>It definitely would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw what nine 11 did to New Yorkers.</v>

1265
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you if we had some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mega disaster,</v>

1266
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 3>the people that survive who'd be nicer</v>
<v Speaker 3>to each other and they would realize how</v>

1267
00:50:58.941 --> 00:51:00.260
<v Speaker 3>fortunate we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've just,</v>

1268
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 3>we've been in a time of peace for so</v>
<v Speaker 3>long that we,</v>

1269
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 3>we can't intellectualize like we can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a conscious sense,</v>

1270
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:14.230
<v Speaker 3>wrap our head around the fact that at</v>
<v Speaker 3>any moment there could be a 45,000 mile</v>

1271
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 3>an hour chunk of rock that slams into</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1272
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it can happen at any time.</v>

1273
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 3>We all think we're invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1274
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:28.121
<v Speaker 3>Those are scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's supposed to be like 900,000</v>

1275
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:31.190
<v Speaker 3>near Earth objects between us and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter.</v>

1276
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>

1277
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:33.680
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

1278
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hope.</v>

1279
00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's something scary like that at</v>

1280
00:51:40.051 --> 00:51:45.051
<v Speaker 3>some insane number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyson put up a diagram of the earth and</v>

1281
00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:47.290
<v Speaker 3>just the soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyson,</v>

1282
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.770
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be real clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1283
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 3>that's the only Tyson I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1284
00:51:50.991 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just start coding.</v>

1285
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:53.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>

1286
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.310
<v Speaker 3>what did he put up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He posted,</v>

1287
00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:58.460
<v Speaker 3>it was on his instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a diagram of the solar</v>

1288
00:51:58.461 --> 00:52:00.710
<v Speaker 3>system like rotating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it showed like,</v>

1289
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:04.940
<v Speaker 3>cause we're technically flying through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe and then it shows just like</v>

1290
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 3>it's just a group of us just all and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment that I realized that we're not</v>

1291
00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:13.220
<v Speaker 3>stationary and that we're actually just</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving through the universe,</v>

1292
00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:14.480
<v Speaker 3>my had fucking exploded.</v>

1293
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1294
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:16.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1295
00:52:16.501 --> 00:52:21.050
<v Speaker 3>that graphic is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you realize like it's taking a long</v>

1296
00:52:21.051 --> 00:52:24.590
<v Speaker 3>time for it to make that motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at over millions and</v>

1297
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.570
<v Speaker 3>billions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is what it's doing.</v>

1298
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1299
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:34.090
<v Speaker 3>our world is spinning around a giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear explosion that's hurling towards</v>

1300
00:52:36.651 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it looks like is if someone</v>

1301
00:52:39.321 --> 00:52:44.321
<v Speaker 3>launched some sort of a nuclear bullet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're looking at it in slow motion.</v>

1302
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.980
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like have a gun launched a son bullet.</v>

1303
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:54.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just our version of time is so,</v>

1304
00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:00.450
<v Speaker 3>so brief that we can't appreciate that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing is in motion because it's</v>

1305
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:05.900
<v Speaker 3>motion requires billions of years to</v>
<v Speaker 3>complete.</v>

1306
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.190
<v Speaker 3>So it's literally like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bullet getting shot through the Canon</v>

1307
00:53:10.191 --> 00:53:15.191
<v Speaker 3>and all those things around it are</v>
<v Speaker 3>particles that are sort of connected to</v>

1308
00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:17.720
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little fragments of it as it hurls</v>

1309
00:53:17.721 --> 00:53:19.700
<v Speaker 3>through infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just,</v>

1310
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.280
<v Speaker 3>we're just a speck in the history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>

1311
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was in class and they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like in the,</v>

1312
00:53:24.681 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 3>in time of</v>

1313
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 2>history or in the time it was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time of the universe.</v>

1314
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Humanity is just a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:32.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>

1316
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.090
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just a little tiny thing.</v>

1317
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.340
<v Speaker 3>How many more near Earth objects?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1318
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.160
<v Speaker 3>15,629 near Earth objects have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered.</v>

1319
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Some 876 of those are asteroids with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>diameter of approximately one kilometer.</v>

1320
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh or larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1700 God,</v>

1321
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:55.530
<v Speaker 2>potentially hazardous.</v>

1322
00:53:55.630 --> 00:54:00.630
<v Speaker 3>1,785 of these near Earth objects have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been classified as potentially hazardous</v>

1323
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:06.790
<v Speaker 3>asteroids or p h a s Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1324
00:54:06.791 --> 00:54:08.920
<v Speaker 3>when they have just three letters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's serious.</v>

1325
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:14.050
<v Speaker 3>They broke it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Potentially hazardous asteroids.</v>

1326
00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:16.810
<v Speaker 3>1,780</v>

1327
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of last just last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was talking to my friend.</v>

1328
00:54:19.661 --> 00:54:22.810
<v Speaker 2>What if one doesn't hit earth but</v>
<v Speaker 2>crashes into the moon and just fine?</v>

1329
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no bad.</v>

1330
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 2>It's all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still people who think of the</v>

1331
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.720
<v Speaker 2>moon's a hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not real.</v>

1332
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:37.720
<v Speaker 3>There was one that slammed into Jupiter</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the explosion it created.</v>

1333
00:54:37.721 --> 00:54:39.460
<v Speaker 3>It was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1334
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was like almost the size of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth itself.</v>

1335
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1336
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:45.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1337
00:54:45.341 --> 00:54:50.341
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter apparently is the reason why we</v>
<v Speaker 3>are alive because Jupiter is so massive</v>

1338
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.950
<v Speaker 3>that it draws everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like our protector.</v>

1339
00:54:53.951 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like our guard dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1340
00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the fucking impact.</v>

1341
00:54:58.361 --> 00:55:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Watch this impact it is the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1342
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1343
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.750
<v Speaker 3>That's an asteroid will impact on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter.</v>

1344
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.440
<v Speaker 2>It was the size of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the size of birth.</v>

1345
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck man?</v>

1346
00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Why in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The size of the whole earth</v>

1347
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.310
<v Speaker 2>and the size of everything on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

1348
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so insane.</v>

1349
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.420
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those moments that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even like if that happened here on</v>

1350
00:55:25.421 --> 00:55:26.500
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't run from it.</v>

1351
00:55:26.501 --> 00:55:28.180
<v Speaker 2>That's just one of those moms where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it and you're like,</v>

1352
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.130
<v Speaker 2>this is going to happen.</v>

1353
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:30.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1354
00:55:30.581 --> 00:55:34.120
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say earth is that earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>is earth too,</v>

1355
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.500
<v Speaker 3>and that there was an earth one and</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth one got hit by another planet and</v>

1356
00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 3>that's what created the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:43.300
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the most current theory</v>

1358
00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.440
<v Speaker 3>of how the the earth and the moon were</v>
<v Speaker 3>formed to weather so close to each</v>

1359
00:55:47.441 --> 00:55:48.040
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1360
00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great diagram of an asteroid</v>

1361
00:55:50.171 --> 00:55:53.200
<v Speaker 2>hitting the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is what they described as exempt and</v>

1362
00:55:53.201 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 2>then it just shows like how it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>spin off and just a piece of it just,</v>

1363
00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.460
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a good diagram of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty great theory.</v>

1364
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Now Does the moon the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that the moon doesn't</v>

1365
00:56:04.091 --> 00:56:05.680
<v Speaker 3>spin the way the earth spins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1366
00:56:05.681 --> 00:56:08.860
<v Speaker 3>It has a different spin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It spins around us,</v>

1367
00:56:08.861 --> 00:56:10.960
<v Speaker 3>but it does it spin on its axis as well.</v>

1368
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.223
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Is that a stupid question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

1370
00:56:15.701 --> 00:56:16.534
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1371
00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.250
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I should probably shut the fuck up.</v>

1372
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.430
<v Speaker 3>The mood orbits Earth every once every</v>
<v Speaker 3>27.3 to two days.</v>

1373
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.810
<v Speaker 3>It takes probably approximately 27 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the moon moon to rotate on its axis</v>

1374
00:56:31.811 --> 00:56:34.060
<v Speaker 3>as a result of moon does not seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning,</v>

1375
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 3>but appears to observe us from the earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be almost perfectly still.</v>

1376
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Scientists call this synchronous</v>
<v Speaker 3>rotation.</v>

1377
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>

1378
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking cool.</v>

1379
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're both spinning up,</v>

1380
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the way we spin and the way</v>

1381
00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 3>it's bins appears to us that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning.</v>

1382
00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing through the moon is up</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy thing.</v>

1383
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:02.260
<v Speaker 3>There's something one quarter the size</v>
<v Speaker 3>of us,</v>

1384
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 3>it's dead as fuck and it's just floating</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sky.</v>

1385
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:08.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like having a dead body next to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your house that you never talk about,</v>

1386
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:11.920
<v Speaker 3>but you just look at it can't die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's look at it on your way to school.</v>

1387
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 3>There's some dude who's got a skeleton</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of bench and just sitting there.</v>

1388
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:19.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what we could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could easily be that stupid fucking</v>

1389
00:57:19.901 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 3>moon floating in the universe would not</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a shit.</v>

1390
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Now yours doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The universe does not give a fuck if</v>

1391
00:57:25.781 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 3>there's water in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care.</v>

1392
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 3>My favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just seeing the moon during the day and</v>

1393
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:31.180
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wow,</v>

1394
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:33.730
<v Speaker 3>that's trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really fucking cool.</v>

1395
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:36.070
<v Speaker 3>It is so important how people smarter</v>
<v Speaker 3>than us out there.</v>

1396
00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 3>So we could find this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you and I had to figure out</v>

1397
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:40.480
<v Speaker 3>what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1398
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:42.910
<v Speaker 3>we'd be fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd be done.</v>

1399
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 3>We'd just be making fun of stuff here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're showing how it works here.</v>

1400
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:54.420
<v Speaker 3>How has his own spins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every part of it is essentially the same</v>

1401
00:57:56.501 --> 00:57:57.334
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

1402
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.760
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way the earth spins,</v>

1403
00:58:01.761 --> 00:58:05.770
<v Speaker 3>the way the moon spins it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it rotates at such a synchronous order.</v>

1404
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:07.640
<v Speaker 3>It looks like it's not spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

1405
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:09.920
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science is just such a fucking</v>

1406
00:58:09.921 --> 00:58:13.340
<v Speaker 3>incredible thing that someone could</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure that out and they can tell you</v>

1407
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.230
<v Speaker 3>and then you don't have to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your own.</v>

1408
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause that's dish.</v>

1409
00:58:16.581 --> 00:58:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Too much work involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1410
00:58:17.901 --> 00:58:19.490
<v Speaker 3>imagine if you had to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1411
00:58:19.491 --> 00:58:21.080
<v Speaker 3>what is nuclear physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1412
00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:21.914
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1413
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:24.440
<v Speaker 3>what's an atom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it on your own?</v>

1414
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:26.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the weirdest thing about people is</v>

1415
00:58:26.331 --> 00:58:28.970
<v Speaker 3>that we all act collectively whether we</v>
<v Speaker 3>know it or not.</v>

1416
00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.910
<v Speaker 3>We all act collectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And without that,</v>

1417
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have a booger on my nose</v>
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>

1418
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Now you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that so embarrassing?</v>

1419
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Because everybody has boogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1420
00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:40.220
<v Speaker 3>If you'd have a booger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's probably wrong with your</v>

1421
00:58:40.221 --> 00:58:42.590
<v Speaker 3>nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to have one to talk about it goes</v>

1422
00:58:42.591 --> 00:58:43.640
<v Speaker 3>back to like childhood.</v>

1423
00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:45.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1424
00:58:45.981 --> 00:58:47.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you catch a kid's picking their nose.</v>

1425
00:58:47.451 --> 00:58:48.440
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of there.</v>

1426
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Stop digging in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that good feeling.</v>

1427
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:54.440
<v Speaker 3>It's very embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good feeling of picking out a bugger.</v>

1428
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so satisfying,</v>

1429
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:57.980
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ever watched someone do it in traffic?</v>

1430

1432
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:06.620
<v Speaker 3>They had a deviated septum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1433
00:59:06.621 --> 00:59:07.520
<v Speaker 3>after I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1434

<v Speaker 3>after I had my nose fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was blowing out the most disgusting</v>

<v Speaker 3>giant giant,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I showed it to Thompson girl once we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were at the airport</v>

1440

<v Speaker 2>but some more blood than it is a bugger.</v>

1459
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I used to surf and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was bad at it,</v>

1460
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.310
<v Speaker 2>so I would get knocked underwater all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1461
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember the first time I ever went,</v>

1462
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like when you were constantly</v>

1463
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:13.520
<v Speaker 2>surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get water shoved up your nose all</v>

1464
01:00:13.521 --> 01:00:15.770
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's just a moment where</v>

1465
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 2>you'll be out doing something and it'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>all just release because the pressure's</v>

1466
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:21.380
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So remember I was like,</v>

1467
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:23.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was like talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend or something,</v>

1468
01:00:23.151 --> 01:00:26.570
<v Speaker 2>but I was just talking to someone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then just all of a sudden just released</v>

1469
01:00:26.571 --> 01:00:30.230
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just talking to them and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt water all over my face.</v>

1470
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1472
01:00:37.481 --> 01:00:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't have brought that up.</v>

1473
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:42.490
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing that could just change</v>

1474
01:00:42.491 --> 01:00:43.360
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like we just missed one.</v>

1476
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:49.690
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One came between us and the moon didn't,</v>

1477
01:00:49.691 --> 01:00:53.610
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't the one that recently came</v>
<v Speaker 3>between us and the moon and he trumps</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're in a goddamn shooting zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to look a shooting gallery.</v>

1500
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what a Randall Carlson was</v>

<v Speaker 3>could kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asteroid came within the half the</v>

1504
01:01:57.341 --> 01:02:02.341
<v Speaker 3>distance from Earth to the moon flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>through cis lunar space.</v>

1505
01:02:02.561 --> 01:02:06.160
<v Speaker 3>What is CIS lunar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that like the sex it was born with?</v>

1512
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>She didn't talk about space sis lunar</v>
<v Speaker 1>space this morning.</v>

1513
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Scientists at the Catalina Sky Survey</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered the asteroid,</v>

1514
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>which is being called Asteroid Two oh</v>
<v Speaker 1>one seven age 13 on Saturday.</v>

1515
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Discovered it on Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeez.</v>

1516
01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>They discovered it on Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're saying?</v>

1517
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1518
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 to 111 feet across was moving at</v>

1519
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>about 10 miles per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1520
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miles per second with the same size as</v>

1521
01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the asteroid that hit Russia in 2013 the</v>
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

1522
01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:03.660
<v Speaker 1>the asteroid coupled with how fast it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was moving and how low it's Albedo</v>

1523
01:03:03.661 --> 01:03:08.661
<v Speaker 1>brightness made it difficult to view</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a telescope that's fast,</v>

1524
01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it's dark and they can't see it.</v>

1525
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>

1526
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1527
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.060
<v Speaker 5>that's insane to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you rather be on the east?</v>

1528
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:20.500
<v Speaker 5>The fuck out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1529
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 5>Which steps be on the asteroid or on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>

1530
01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 1>You want to be right under where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits.</v>

1531
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't want her to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be eating people.</v>

1532
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't want that to go down.</v>

1533
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get to that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you eating people?</v>

1534
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's where it goes it where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it goes.</v>

1535
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>When it gets down to almost everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead and there's almost no life and</v>

1536
01:03:43.201 --> 01:03:46.830
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no food and there's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you need is one or two aggressive,</v>

1537

<v Speaker 1>asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzed Earth and Moon January 25th what</v>

1540
01:03:56.581 --> 01:03:59.040

01:04:09.231 --> 01:04:10.550
<v Speaker 5>We ain't tripping out to plug in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>asteroids.</v>

1547
01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:12.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found this one on the 20th,</v>

1548
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:16.620
<v Speaker 1>she pass between Earth and the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Late Tuesday night,</v>

1549
01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:18.120
<v Speaker 1>according to the clocks and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americas,</v>

1550
01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:23.121
<v Speaker 1>the asteroid closest approach was 1145</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern time on January 24th,</v>

1551
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.670

<v Speaker 1>Zero Point six eight lunar distances.</v>

1555

<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>

1557
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>52 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slu broadcast a show about this asteroid</v>

1558
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can see in the video above.</v>

1562
01:04:51.011 --> 01:04:52.880
<v Speaker 5>which is an observatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1566
01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:02.080
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if an asteroid is going to hit her,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and you find out the world's going to</v>

1573
01:05:12.551 --> 01:05:15.190
<v Speaker 5>end because of an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you tell everybody,</v>

1574
01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:17.170
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one wants to feel completely</v>

1575
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.120
<v Speaker 5>helpless.</v>

1576
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we absolutely are.</v>

1577
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.940
<v Speaker 3>We've been hit by planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucks.</v>

1578
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.160
<v Speaker 3>We could get hit by a goddamn planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1579
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you guys know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they think there's another fucking</v>

1580
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 3>planet at the end of our solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1581
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.880
<v Speaker 3>They don't know where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they think it's six times bigger</v>

1582
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 3>than the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've actually heard that there's can't</v>

1583
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:40.330
<v Speaker 3>see it because of the shadow steak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1584
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.330
<v Speaker 3>This university's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's rogue planets,</v>

1585
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:47.320
<v Speaker 3>rogue planets go flying around and</v>
<v Speaker 3>slamming other planets like billiard</v>

1586
01:05:47.321 --> 01:05:50.190
<v Speaker 3>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they find a planet that like live</v>

1587
01:05:50.191 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 3>they think is literally just a diamond</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1588
01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:56.020
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was high as fuck once and I went</v>

1589
01:05:56.021 --> 01:06:01.021
<v Speaker 3>outside and it was foggy and the moon</v>
<v Speaker 3>was full and it was foggy and so it was</v>

1590
01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:06.841
<v Speaker 3>this crazy illusion like there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous moon flying in the sky.</v>

1591
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous moon.</v>

1592
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Like many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times larger than the moon itself.</v>

1593
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Like it was almost like another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she's hovering right over us</v>

1594
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:20.920
<v Speaker 3>because of the glow of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember looking at that man and</v>

1595
01:06:20.921 --> 01:06:25.780
<v Speaker 3>thinking to myself that could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be another reality.</v>

1596
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 3>There could be another planet somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there in the universe that is</v>

1597
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:34.600
<v Speaker 3>looking up at this gigantic thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a up another planet,</v>

1598
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.240
<v Speaker 3>just floating row right above you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

1599
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:39.130
<v Speaker 3>they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere.</v>

1600
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:43.360
<v Speaker 3>They keep finding new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are just flying through this shit</v>

1601
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:48.630
<v Speaker 3>storm of planets in nuclear explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man,</v>

1602
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.120
<v Speaker 3>that's crazier than anything that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ever contemplate on this earth while</v>

1603
01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:58.060
<v Speaker 3>we're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the very nature of space itself.</v>

1604
01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a diagram of like the</v>

1605
01:07:00.191 --> 01:07:03.130
<v Speaker 3>biggest son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other biggest star they found in the</v>

1606
01:07:03.131 --> 01:07:05.080
<v Speaker 3>universe and then they compare it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ours.</v>

1607
01:07:05.081 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Current son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1608
01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.220
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfathomably big.</v>

1609
01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.010
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

1610
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:11.010
<v Speaker 7>One of the cool,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1611
01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.360
<v Speaker 7>I guess it's a demo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's an,</v>

1612
01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.150
<v Speaker 7>it's an application on the vr thing I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>got on the HTC vive.</v>

1613
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.310
<v Speaker 7>You can go into space and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1614
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.880
<v Speaker 7>like generate planets and send them into</v>
<v Speaker 7>orbit and you're just standing in the</v>

1615
01:07:22.881 --> 01:07:26.720
<v Speaker 7>middle of it and you can make that Alec</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alpha Centauri Star and then watch what</v>

1616
01:07:26.721 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 7>it looks like when you send the earth</v>
<v Speaker 7>around it and then they explode into</v>

1617
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:32.750
<v Speaker 7>each other and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can just keep making them pop up and</v>

1618
01:07:32.751 --> 01:07:33.950
<v Speaker 7>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just stand there for hours.</v>

1619
01:07:33.951 --> 01:07:35.180
<v Speaker 7>It looks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's super cool.</v>

1620
01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.530
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

1621
01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:38.630
<v Speaker 7>Damn University.</v>

1622
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:42.140
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend's super into science and</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy things and stuff.</v>

1623
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:44.210
<v Speaker 3>So this is literally all we talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1624
01:07:44.211 --> 01:07:47.090
<v Speaker 3>I think that you're going to get to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where virtual reality is going to</v>

1625
01:07:47.091 --> 01:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>be able to recreate a journey through</v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

1626
01:07:49.371 --> 01:07:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I can age d oh you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they can,</v>

1627
01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.760
<v Speaker 3>if they can figure out a way to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good photos,</v>

1628
01:07:55.761 --> 01:07:58.520
<v Speaker 3>like some of the more recent photos</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been able to take with those</v>

1629
01:07:58.521 --> 01:08:03.170
<v Speaker 3>satellites that they launch into space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the incredible detail of all</v>

1630
01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:07.400
<v Speaker 3>these different planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to be able to do that,</v>

1631
01:08:07.401 --> 01:08:11.600
<v Speaker 3>like to put on one of those htc vives</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fly through space insane and</v>

1632
01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 3>just feel what it would be like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>circled Jupiter and like look at it.</v>

1633
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all you get lost in for.</v>

1634
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to do just weed and</v>

1635
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:21.380
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be crazy.</v>

1636
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:22.850
<v Speaker 3>He might not even need it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1637
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:24.920
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might go into a natural psychedelic</v>

1638
01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 3>state if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could get something or you could</v>

1639
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 3>in a float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put on an htc vive and go for real.</v>

1640
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Go flying through like the rings of</v>

1641
01:08:36.651 --> 01:08:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Saturn and to be like that close and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to,</v>

1642
01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.530
<v Speaker 3>to have like the correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1643
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Watch this incredible moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An Indian rocket releases over 100</v>

1644
01:08:47.151 --> 01:08:49.700
<v Speaker 3>satellites into space in a new world</v>
<v Speaker 3>record.</v>

1645
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1647
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.770
<v Speaker 3>space junk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1648
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:59.420
<v Speaker 7>The aid of a merchant are going to try</v>
<v Speaker 7>to take a picture of earth every single</v>

1649
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.510
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

1650
01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 7>It seems like they're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly almost what you were trying to</v>

1651
01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:03.710
<v Speaker 7>talk about right there.</v>

1652
01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a,</v>

1654
01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:12.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a plan to collect space junk that</v>

1655
01:09:12.901 --> 01:09:14.790
<v Speaker 3>failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about that?</v>

1656
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 4>That is nearby.</v>

1657
01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stays Japanese.</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1660
01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Space junks insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I,</v>

1661
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:24.740
<v Speaker 3>that's where the part we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1662
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.480
<v Speaker 3>we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where we got to build something</v>

1663
01:09:26.481 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 3>to go collect all the space junk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1664
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:31.580
<v Speaker 3>we're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We left shit floating in the sky above</v>

1665
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:34.250
<v Speaker 3>our head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got metal.</v>

1666
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.030
<v Speaker 3>We left metal in the sky above our head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1667
01:09:38.031 --> 01:09:39.410
<v Speaker 3>it failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1668
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:42.920
<v Speaker 3>The Japanese space junk remover</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment has failed in orbit.</v>

1669
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:43.461
<v Speaker 3>Would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1670
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:44.750
<v Speaker 3>what happened to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it saying,</v>

1671
01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that mean that there's more junk</v>

1672
01:09:46.341 --> 01:09:48.620
<v Speaker 3>now in space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that,</v>

1673
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:50.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they made it back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't catch it.</v>

1674
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:56.840
<v Speaker 3>The system designed by a Japanese space</v>
<v Speaker 3>agency and a fishing net company should</v>

1675
01:09:56.841 --> 01:10:01.841
<v Speaker 3>have unfurled a 700 meter a tether from</v>
<v Speaker 3>space station risks resupply vehicle</v>

1676
01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:08.900
<v Speaker 3>that was returning to earth according to</v>
<v Speaker 3>j a x a scientist.</v>

1677
01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system appears to have faltered.</v>

1678
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Space junk is a growing problem in low</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth orbit since the beginning of the</v>

1679
01:10:17.151 --> 01:10:20.750
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Age Debris as small as flecks of paint.</v>

1680
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enlarge as whole satellites and parts of</v>

1681
01:10:23.631 --> 01:10:28.460
<v Speaker 3>rocket boosters have been accumulating</v>
<v Speaker 3>and is estimated that over 100 million</v>

1682
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:30.740
<v Speaker 3>individual pieces of junk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1683
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Tens of thousands of peep pieces that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are over 10 centimeters in size are</v>

1684
01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:40.421
<v Speaker 3>whizzing around our planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like moving shrapnel.</v>

1685
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so crazy.</v>

1686
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.760
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are so bananas.</v>

1687
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 3>They just keep launching new shit up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1688
01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:52.094
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1689
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.610
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's launch a hundred more new ones.</v>

1690
01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.300
<v Speaker 7>Didn't Elan Musk said they want to</v>
<v Speaker 7>launch a certain,</v>

1691
01:10:58.310 --> 01:11:00.020
<v Speaker 7>like a crazy number of a space,</v>

1692
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 3>one a month or one a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1693
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Are they leaving debris in space too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1694
01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that bringing the thing back?</v>

1695
01:11:06.751 --> 01:11:07.830
<v Speaker 3>So maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1696
01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can get something that you can</v>

1697
01:11:09.601 --> 01:11:12.270
<v Speaker 3>shoot up there and then bring back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you go to space.</v>

1698
01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:13.620
<v Speaker 3>If you good puck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

1699
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't even just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it was just like top and then</v>

1700
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:18.150
<v Speaker 3>come right back down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A whole joke about that.</v>

1701
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I go look up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're already in space going out there.</v>

1702
01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like just go into a Shittier</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>

1703
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to check out the shit and</v>

1704
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:26.510
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1705
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:28.710
<v Speaker 3>you're getting planes all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it just went a little higher?</v>

1706
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly will.</v>

1707
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:31.490
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I get in place.</v>

1708
01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1709
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I think there's going to get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the planes are going to get to</v>

1710
01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:37.830
<v Speaker 3>places faster.</v>

1711
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna use the orbit and go up</v>
<v Speaker 3>high and then come right back down.</v>

1712
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Or you smoke a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to Joshua tree and lay on your back</v>

1713
01:11:43.771 --> 01:11:47.190
<v Speaker 3>and realize you are already in space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're already here.</v>

1714
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.620
<v Speaker 3>We're in space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just in the best possible</v>

1715
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:51.810
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just be thankful.</v>

1716
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Just be super lucky that we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1717
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:56.940
<v Speaker 3>we weren't shit out on the moon where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no air.</v>

1718
01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:58.080
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1720
01:11:59.701 --> 01:12:01.080
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might want to just see what it was like,</v>

1721
01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:05.100
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like things that will definitely</v>

1722
01:12:05.101 --> 01:12:05.830
<v Speaker 3>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1723
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:08.310
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the like going into space can</v>

1724
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.330
<v Speaker 3>definitely kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1725
01:12:09.331 --> 01:12:10.230
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1726
01:12:10.231 --> 01:12:11.041
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes wrong.</v>

1727
01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:13.680
<v Speaker 3>A lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes wrong a lot on those folks.</v>

1728
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm terrified of heights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'll probably never go,</v>

1729
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:18.000
<v Speaker 3>but that movie gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1730
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Don't be freaked me the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1731
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.870
<v Speaker 3>That's sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

1732
01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:23.730
<v Speaker 3>get back down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get down,</v>

1733
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:26.940
<v Speaker 3>get down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her anxieties.</v>

1734
01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.270
<v Speaker 3>So real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of it.</v>

1735
01:12:28.271 --> 01:12:30.240
<v Speaker 3>The fuck out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're floating in space.</v>

1736
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:33.600
<v Speaker 3>You hear the things crashed together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't make any sound or you see</v>

1737
01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:35.550
<v Speaker 3>them crash together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no sound.</v>

1738
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.910
<v Speaker 3>That was a freaky part of that movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's no sound in space because</v>

1739
01:12:38.911 --> 01:12:40.380
<v Speaker 3>there's no oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no air,</v>

1740
01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>

1741
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:42.400
<v Speaker 3>It's no APP.</v>

1742
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.820
<v Speaker 5>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear it.</v>

1743
01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.130
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1744
01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Just real quick on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The asked for the hit Jupiter,</v>

1745
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.040
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't the size of earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The explosion was the size of earth,</v>

1746
01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.630
<v Speaker 5>however difference that makes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the explosion was the side of the</v>

1747
01:12:58.631 --> 01:12:59.330
<v Speaker 5>road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1748
01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:00.830
<v Speaker 5>I think we said that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure.</v>

1749
01:13:00.831 --> 01:13:01.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm just making sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the astro was decided if</v>

1751
01:13:04.931 --> 01:13:06.860
<v Speaker 5>it was a big dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be like another planet flying around.</v>

1752
01:13:06.861 --> 01:13:07.671
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1753
01:13:07.671 --> 01:13:09.770
<v Speaker 5>that has happened though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're saying.</v>

1754
01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean who knows how often does it</v>

1755
01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 5>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they think that's how what were</v>

1756
01:13:14.031 --> 01:13:17.270
<v Speaker 5>saying before the debts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if he could find that earth one in</v>

1757
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.100
<v Speaker 5>earth too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what they're saying,</v>

1758
01:13:19.101 --> 01:13:23.630
<v Speaker 5>that that was the most recent theory of</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the moon was created,</v>

1759
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:28.830
<v Speaker 5>that the moon is actually made out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same shit that were made out of just</v>

1760
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:30.470
<v Speaker 5>dead as fuck floating in the sky.</v>

1761
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:33.440
<v Speaker 5>Our brother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's her dead brother floating over our</v>

1762
01:13:33.441 --> 01:13:35.780
<v Speaker 5>head every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's only like 10 that's why so</v>

1763
01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:36.980
<v Speaker 5>little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like the one that's still</v>

1764
01:13:36.981 --> 01:13:38.930
<v Speaker 5>attached to us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1765
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is what it's like,</v>

1766
01:13:39.921 --> 01:13:40.754
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1767
01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.880
<v Speaker 5>That could be us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't be as,</v>

1768
01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:44.930
<v Speaker 5>we're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's what I'm going to work hard bitch</v>

1769
01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:48.620
<v Speaker 5>and complain</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weird Times.</v>

1770
01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it will all this information,</v>

1771
01:13:51.381 --> 01:13:56.060
<v Speaker 5>like I'm sure it was probably around</v>
<v Speaker 5>when my parents were my age,</v>

1772
01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.130
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in order to go get it,</v>

1773
01:13:58.131 --> 01:14:00.560
<v Speaker 5>you had to do a lot of traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had to read books.</v>

1774
01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:02.480
<v Speaker 5>He had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had to go to school.</v>

1775
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:05.210
<v Speaker 5>Like you couldn't just google it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1776
01:14:05.211 --> 01:14:09.160
<v Speaker 5>everything's so readily available now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think like for comics it's</v>

1777
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.210
<v Speaker 5>like the best time ever for creating</v>
<v Speaker 5>material?</v>

1778
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1779
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.440
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I talk about trump and stuff all</v>

1780
01:14:14.441 --> 01:14:17.220
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I've never seen a</v>

1781
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:19.720
<v Speaker 2>president that's just given us so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff to work with.</v>

1782
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.710
<v Speaker 2>A comic said this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1783
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:23.320
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1784
01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna write any trump jokes.</v>

1785
01:14:24.621 --> 01:14:25.181
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1786
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that dude's doing funnier shit</v>

1787
01:14:27.011 --> 01:14:28.550
<v Speaker 2>than anything I'll ever be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>

1788
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad about it.</v>

1789
01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Is it just fit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel,</v>

1790
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:38.540
<v Speaker 3>this is my feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel like everybody's happy</v>

1791
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.700
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's not happy and when people</v>

1792
01:14:40.701 --> 01:14:44.660
<v Speaker 3>aren't happy on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this seems to be all this fucking,</v>

1793
01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:48.620
<v Speaker 3>it seems super tense right now.</v>

1794
01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:49.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we were talking about this</v>

1795
01:14:49.761 --> 01:14:51.920
<v Speaker 2>early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's willing to listen and learn.</v>

1796
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's just willing to shout as loud</v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

1797
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just kind of be nice.</v>

1798
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I like doing stand up</v>

1799
01:14:58.101 --> 01:15:01.100
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's like if I can make both sides</v>

1800
01:15:01.101 --> 01:15:04.660
<v Speaker 2>laugh at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stupid things I'm saying when</v>

1801
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:08.990
<v Speaker 2>they're in a way agreeing with me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then in a way can hopefully learn a</v>

1802
01:15:08.991 --> 01:15:10.160
<v Speaker 2>little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1803
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I think we're too much of a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>babies to have a left side and a right</v>

1804
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:15.490
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're too,</v>

1805
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.670
<v Speaker 3>we're too much of babies were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were squawking too much.</v>

1806
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1807
01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I think if we could figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of that,</v>

1808
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:28.660
<v Speaker 3>that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole inclination to want a left</v>

1809
01:15:28.661 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 3>and a right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole inclination just seems to me</v>

1810
01:15:32.441 --> 01:15:37.180
<v Speaker 3>that it's just so easy to pick a team</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to get locked into that team's</v>

1811
01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:39.790
<v Speaker 3>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Locked in that team's goals locked in</v>

1812
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:43.000
<v Speaker 3>that team's ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say the shit that the other people in</v>

1813
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:45.370
<v Speaker 3>the team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see so many people that have right</v>

1814
01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:48.190
<v Speaker 3>their tweets now and afterwards they</v>
<v Speaker 3>write sad.</v>

1815
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1816
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:54.580
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of funny in an ironic way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they mean it.</v>

1817
01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Ironically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

1818
01:15:56.830 --> 01:16:01.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really funny when they don't mean</v>

1819
01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:01.770
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ironically,</v>

1820
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.180
<v Speaker 3>and they were like mimicking the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump tweets.</v>

1821
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>

1822
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.970
<v Speaker 3>It's so common now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got sad</v>

1823
01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.050
<v Speaker 2>president of the tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1824
01:16:10.051 --> 01:16:11.130
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1825
01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:12.900
<v Speaker 2>hope it doesn't tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1826
01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:13.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1827
01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:15.410
<v Speaker 2>He don't know what the fuck they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1828
01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.410
<v Speaker 2>That was taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad trump impression.</v>

1829
01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.800
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matthew were shark should have won.</v>

1830
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:23.040
<v Speaker 2>He has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

1831
01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:24.990
<v Speaker 2>This is what I could find on that</v>

1832
01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:28.980
<v Speaker 3>giant impact creates moon the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist's theory on a giant impact</v>

1833
01:16:28.981 --> 01:16:31.200
<v Speaker 3>model seeking to explain the moon's</v>
<v Speaker 3>creation.</v>

1834
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Experts believe that an object that</v>
<v Speaker 3>crashed into earth led to debris that</v>

1835
01:16:35.881 --> 01:16:39.060
<v Speaker 3>later form the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Theory says that incident also</v>

1836
01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:40.860
<v Speaker 3>created a smaller second moon.</v>

1837
01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's that?</v>

1838
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:44.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's these two minutes right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1839
01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 2>day they collided to create what we see</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1840
01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really hard finding stuff on this</v>

1841
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:52.810
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One earth to stuff really brings up just</v>

1842
01:16:52.811 --> 01:16:54.280
<v Speaker 2>a lot of stuff on DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1843
01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:55.200
<v Speaker 2>How would they figure it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These</v>

1844
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.110
<v Speaker 3>fucking people are so goddamn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1845
01:16:58.111 --> 01:17:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Their theory also says the slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the slow impact force,</v>

1846
01:17:01.381 --> 01:17:05.850
<v Speaker 3>most of the smaller moon to attach to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the side of the moon as a thick new</v>

1847
01:17:05.851 --> 01:17:08.490
<v Speaker 3>layer of the lunar cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did you figure that out?</v>

1848
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>They're destined to</v>

1849
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.690
<v Speaker 5>collide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way out.</v>

1850
01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should freak out,</v>

1851
01:17:14.581 --> 01:17:17.340
<v Speaker 5>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone should freak out and then let's</v>

1852
01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:18.330
<v Speaker 5>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1853
01:17:18.331 --> 01:17:20.490
<v Speaker 5>yikes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what's the most important thing</v>

1854
01:17:20.491 --> 01:17:24.450
<v Speaker 5>to realize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter what we're in space no matter</v>

1855
01:17:24.451 --> 01:17:25.950
<v Speaker 5>what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter what you're saying.</v>

1856
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:26.541
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1857
01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.320
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality of what you're looking at,</v>

1858
01:17:28.321 --> 01:17:30.780
<v Speaker 5>what you're focusing on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look close to your,</v>

1859
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.990
<v Speaker 5>your neighborhood or your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1860
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:37.620
<v Speaker 5>your city or your country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of it is taking place in this ball</v>

1861
01:17:37.621 --> 01:17:39.930
<v Speaker 5>hurling through infinity ass like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1862
01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:41.980
<v Speaker 5>it's all figurative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1863
01:17:41.981 --> 01:17:44.220
<v Speaker 5>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're creating all of these social</v>

1864
01:17:44.221 --> 01:17:45.120
<v Speaker 5>constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1865
01:17:45.121 --> 01:17:46.710
<v Speaker 5>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to deal with them.</v>

1866
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.530
<v Speaker 5>You mean you got to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences of,</v>

1867
01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.513
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1868

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These Hitler felt fellows and when you</v>

1870
01:17:58.081 --> 01:18:00.330
<v Speaker 5>get a Hitler really got to do something</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>

1871

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not going to get to,</v>

1872
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.960
<v Speaker 5>you can't just hug it out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:06.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course it talking about Hitler.</v>

1876
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:12.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't talking about him like,</v>

1877
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.360
<v Speaker 5>like what people call other people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like Hitler.</v>

1878
01:18:15.361 --> 01:18:18.060
<v Speaker 5>I never used that term and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is like Hitler.</v>

1879
01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:18.961
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1880
01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:20.640
<v Speaker 5>he's not because he's not killing</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1881
01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:21.730
<v Speaker 5>Then also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1882
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.390
<v Speaker 5>they Hitler's a whole total different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1883
01:18:24.391 --> 01:18:25.990
<v Speaker 5>Hitler was Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1884
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Like it's solar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so stupid.</v>

1885
01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:30.900
<v Speaker 5>I think borough had a bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has on his new specials.</v>

1886
01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:32.970
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen his,</v>

1887
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:34.530
<v Speaker 5>especially special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so great.</v>

1888
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.780
<v Speaker 5>I saw him do the stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need,</v>

1889
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.310
<v Speaker 5>I need to sit down and watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was one of my favorites.</v>

1890
01:18:38.311 --> 01:18:40.410
<v Speaker 5>My favorite is watching him pop into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>store and do it.</v>

1891
01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:43.350
<v Speaker 5>And I watched him do that bit and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>such a funny bit cause he's got a great</v>

1892
01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:44.760
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1893
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.590
<v Speaker 5>he definitely does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's a tired word now is,</v>

1894
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:52.680
<v Speaker 5>and no one's going to bring that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>mustache back though.</v>

1895
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:54.930
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think so?</v>

1896
01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:55.740
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll bring it back.</v>

1897
01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.610
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just kidding.</v>

1898
01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.830
<v Speaker 5>Already did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More it on stage.</v>

1899
01:18:58.831 --> 01:19:00.660
<v Speaker 5>People were so angry at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1900
01:19:00.661 --> 01:19:01.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could do it.</v>

1901
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:06.180
<v Speaker 5>I would you pass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny.</v>

1902
01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.490
<v Speaker 5>It's funny the things that we find</v>
<v Speaker 5>offensive.</v>

1903
01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird time for that.</v>

1904
01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.573
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

1905
01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.400
<v Speaker 5>People are getting really upset,</v>
<v Speaker 5>upset at,</v>

1906
01:19:14.401 --> 01:19:15.690
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people talking about,</v>

1907
01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:18.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty much any subject that isn't about</v>

1908
01:19:18.361 --> 01:19:20.040
<v Speaker 5>them as an individual.</v>

1909
01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.120
<v Speaker 5>And then if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1910
01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.940
<v Speaker 5>if you do a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a white man,</v>

1911
01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:27.120
<v Speaker 5>you should be writing entirely about</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a white man does,</v>

1912
01:19:27.121 --> 01:19:28.170
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1913
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.170
<v Speaker 5>Just about white men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even then you shouldn't be doing it</v>

1914
01:19:31.171 --> 01:19:33.060
<v Speaker 5>because you should shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

1915
01:19:33.061 --> 01:19:33.894
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.270
<v Speaker 5>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was things like you can say whatever</v>

1917
01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.190
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe in freedom of speech more than</v>

1918
01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:40.170
<v Speaker 5>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also believe that you have to deal</v>

1919
01:19:40.171 --> 01:19:42.300
<v Speaker 5>with the consequences of what you say</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck Yo.</v>

1920
01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:46.860
<v Speaker 5>But it's also like we have to stop</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at each other as groups,</v>

1921
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.400
<v Speaker 5>white man as groups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as white women as group.</v>

1922
01:19:50.401 --> 01:19:51.480
<v Speaker 5>So it was taught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's silly.</v>

1923
01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:54.630
<v Speaker 5>We're just a bunch of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got to stop looking each other as</v>

1924
01:19:54.631 --> 01:19:58.200
<v Speaker 5>these groups based on what we look like</v>
<v Speaker 5>or what part of the country we're in and</v>

1925
01:19:58.201 --> 01:20:00.240
<v Speaker 5>that's eventually going to move to other</v>
<v Speaker 5>countries.</v>

1926
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:02.940
<v Speaker 5>It's just going to take time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wonder when,</v>

1927
01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:05.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause the kind of relationship that we</v>

1928
01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 5>have with each other all in together in</v>

1929
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 3>a city like this and live in so</v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortably and for the most part like</v>

1930
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.450
<v Speaker 3>relatively low crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in a place like Los Angeles,</v>

1931
01:20:14.451 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 3>if you really consider it that never</v>
<v Speaker 3>existed in history.</v>

1932
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:20.340
<v Speaker 3>This is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people get better at life,</v>

1933
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:23.460
<v Speaker 3>they get better at figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're better now than ever</v>

1934
01:20:23.461 --> 01:20:24.930
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though we still fuck it up.</v>

1935
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're,</v>

1936
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:30.480
<v Speaker 3>we're real close to one day recognizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>other countries just like states,</v>

1937
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.040
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1938
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 3>like you could just pack up and move to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>

1939
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:34.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1940
01:20:34.591 --> 01:20:38.220
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be situations like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people just go all over the world</v>

1941
01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:39.120
<v Speaker 3>and go wherever they want.</v>

1942
01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be weird.</v>

1943
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.451
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1944
01:20:41.451 --> 01:20:44.480
<v Speaker 2>it's also just progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone said it's like progress is</v>

1945
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:47.450
<v Speaker 2>measured generate or by tombstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By tombstone.</v>

1946
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

1947
01:20:48.861 --> 01:20:50.840
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like I look at my grandfather</v>

1948
01:20:50.841 --> 01:20:53.360
<v Speaker 2>and like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love him to death and he was an</v>

1949
01:20:53.361 --> 01:20:57.560
<v Speaker 2>immigrant to this country and he felt a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way around about other people</v>

1950
01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:59.690
<v Speaker 2>and races and it was one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>

1951
01:20:59.691 --> 01:21:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>

1952
01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.120
<v Speaker 2>growing up around that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized it's like,</v>

1953
01:21:02.121 --> 01:21:03.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just kind of the way he thinks.</v>

1954
01:21:03.831 --> 01:21:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can treat people nice and be cool with</v>

1955
01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:10.190
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1957
01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more apparent now than</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever before.</v>

1958
01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:14.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1959
01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I think that some people were more aware</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1960
01:21:17.381 --> 01:21:18.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1961
01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:22.300
<v Speaker 3>the similarities that we all share</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus the differences more than ever</v>

1962
01:21:22.301 --> 01:21:26.050
<v Speaker 3>before and people were more vocal I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think anytime in my life that I can</v>

1963
01:21:26.051 --> 01:21:27.580
<v Speaker 3>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that during the civil rights</v>

1964
01:21:27.581 --> 01:21:29.740
<v Speaker 3>movement people were very vocal about</v>
<v Speaker 3>racial,</v>

1965
01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.720
<v Speaker 3>racial rights and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1966
01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:32.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1967
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:35.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting out of stomping out racial</v>

1968
01:21:35.711 --> 01:21:38.140
<v Speaker 3>hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't remember it being like as</v>

1969
01:21:38.141 --> 01:21:41.710
<v Speaker 3>much in the public forum as it is during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last,</v>

1970
01:21:41.711 --> 01:21:46.240
<v Speaker 3>like say like maybe 10 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the people have,</v>

1971
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.720
<v Speaker 3>they're much more organized in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to,</v>

1972
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:51.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to protest,</v>

1973
01:21:51.761 --> 01:21:53.860
<v Speaker 3>to educate people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to explain things,</v>

1974
01:21:53.861 --> 01:21:56.830
<v Speaker 3>to show things that people might not</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been aware of before.</v>

1975
01:21:57.670 --> 01:21:58.380
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a lot of</v>

1976
01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.100
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1977
01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 2>social media and just the Internet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>having all that just readily more</v>

1978
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:04.980
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1979
01:22:04.981 --> 01:22:07.960
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people like,</v>

1980
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I think people arguing having these</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations are super important.</v>

1981
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Even if they do get shouty and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's,</v>

1982
01:22:14.611 --> 01:22:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that's how you learn is you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have these awkward hard</v>

1983
01:22:16.921 --> 01:22:17.754
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>

1984
01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're there.</v>

1985
01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:20.420
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1986
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:21.820
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1987
01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:26.290
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to think that every time you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you buy anything,</v>

1988
01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.470
<v Speaker 3>anytime you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1989
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.640
<v Speaker 3>anytime you do any kind of interacting</v>
<v Speaker 3>with someone,</v>

1990
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.080
<v Speaker 3>you're these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the stuff that you're getting</v>

1991
01:22:35.081 --> 01:22:40.000
<v Speaker 3>is coming from places where people live</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard lives like really hard lives.</v>

1992
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people will argue,</v>

1993
01:22:42.401 --> 01:22:43.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1994
01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.470
<v Speaker 3>this is what we've talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

1995
01:22:44.471 --> 01:22:44.861
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1996
01:22:44.861 --> 01:22:45.281
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1997
01:22:45.281 --> 01:22:48.580
<v Speaker 3>that's how countries grow and prosper</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1998
01:22:48.581 --> 01:22:50.440
<v Speaker 3>they have to start out this way and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this,</v>

1999
01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution,</v>

2000
01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.500
<v Speaker 3>industrial revolution and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2001
01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:58.090
<v Speaker 3>they start manufacturing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A status of life goes up,</v>

2002
01:22:58.091 --> 01:23:01.360
<v Speaker 3>the quality of life goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your living much better than they ever</v>

2003
01:23:01.361 --> 01:23:02.770
<v Speaker 3>lived before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2004
01:23:02.771 --> 01:23:04.360
<v Speaker 3>But they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't live like us.</v>

2005
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2006
01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>

2007
01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:07.850
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2008
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2009
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:12.450
<v Speaker 3>went from mud house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mud huts to Straw or whatever.</v>

2010
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 3>A better comparison while we were at</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about those Foxconn employees as</v>

2011
01:23:17.351 --> 01:23:20.410
<v Speaker 3>folks that work and make i-phones well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2012
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:22.060
<v Speaker 3>the jump off the roof so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have,</v>

2013
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:26.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people were stuck in terrible</v>

2014
01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:28.630
<v Speaker 3>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me that when you read a history</v>

2015
01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 3>book a thousand years from now and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about what kind of barbarians we</v>

2016
01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>are at 2017 they will start to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the rise of the machine.</v>

2017
01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was talking about the cell phone and</v>

2018
01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 3>they would like the people covered it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cell phone so much that they,</v>

2019
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 3>they found a way to compartmentalize</v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideas about slave labor to the</v>

2020
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:50.080
<v Speaker 3>point where these people work 16 hours a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day in a gigantic concrete structure</v>

2021
01:23:50.081 --> 01:23:53.380
<v Speaker 3>making their beloved phones and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>hated the job so much and they jumped</v>

2022
01:23:53.381 --> 01:23:54.280
<v Speaker 3>off the building so much.</v>

2023
01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:59.460
<v Speaker 3>They put nets around the building but</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people kept buying phones but,</v>

2024
01:24:00.211 --> 01:24:02.290
<v Speaker 3>but didn't they have enough phones are</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready?</v>

2025
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

2026
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:06.070
<v Speaker 3>They didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted new phones,</v>

2027
01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.120
<v Speaker 3>new phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi Amar.</v>

2028
01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Jumpers for features that the saints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that what the pyramids maybe</v>

2029
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:20.730
<v Speaker 3>potentially created by slave labor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were worshiped things for ideally</v>

2030
01:24:20.831 --> 01:24:24.520
<v Speaker 3>like a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they used to think it was slave</v>

2031
01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:25.750
<v Speaker 3>labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know for sure.</v>

2032
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think they don't think that now.</v>

2033
01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:32.440
<v Speaker 3>Now think the most recent theory is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were very skilled workers because</v>

2034
01:24:32.441 --> 01:24:34.300
<v Speaker 3>of the food that they got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:37.740
<v Speaker 3>They were almost like praise because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they could do.</v>

2036
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Go back to the ancient Greece or ancient</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rome and they're giant,</v>

2037
01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places of worship,</v>

2038
01:24:42.881 --> 01:24:44.110
<v Speaker 3>their gods and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure</v>

2039
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.680
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

2040
01:24:47.681 --> 01:24:49.750
<v Speaker 3>like those things were like really like</v>
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>

2041
01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I think we look at buildings a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit different when we think about like</v>

2042
01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:55.510
<v Speaker 3>someone being forced to build something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 3>We think of the person who's being</v>
<v Speaker 3>forced to build it as being like a low</v>

2044
01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 3>paid worker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in those environments,</v>

2045
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 3>that person might've been a goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 3>superstar,</v>

2046
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:07.810
<v Speaker 3>like a guy who could build a marble</v>
<v Speaker 3>because coliseum,</v>

2047
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:10.900
<v Speaker 3>you know guys who build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>built in those pillars bit people who</v>

2048
01:25:10.901 --> 01:25:14.950
<v Speaker 3>are figuring out how to stack these</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic stones perfectly on top of each</v>

2049
01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:18.100
<v Speaker 3>other and make stone pillars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did they figure that out?</v>

2050
01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Got The smart guy wasn't lifting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was telling all the rest of the guys,</v>

2051
01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:26.110
<v Speaker 3>maybe yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe they were all together.</v>

2052
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 3>I think more likely you had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart people and then you had a few like</v>

2053
01:25:30.341 --> 01:25:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Leonardo da Vinci's who were fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>super geniuses who had figured out a</v>

2054
01:25:34.451 --> 01:25:37.730
<v Speaker 3>bunch of crazy shit and was designing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and drawing things and these,</v>

2055
01:25:37.731 --> 01:25:42.731
<v Speaker 3>these people were just like these rare</v>
<v Speaker 3>blips of like super power creativity</v>

2056
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.120
<v Speaker 3>that exists all throughout history and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they propel us forward.</v>

2057
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a who?</v>

2058
01:25:47.261 --> 01:25:49.240
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be jobs then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2059
01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.220
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of those kinds of guys.</v>

2060
01:25:51.221 --> 01:25:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Davinci.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember which artist it was,</v>

2062
01:25:54.311 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 3>but they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would make all these ideas and</v>

2063
01:25:57.521 --> 01:26:01.780
<v Speaker 3>they'd have like their understudies or</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were almost as skilled as</v>

2064
01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:03.450
<v Speaker 3>them do these things and them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2066
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:06.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that's what happened with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pyramids and stuff.</v>

2067
01:26:06.021 --> 01:26:07.430
<v Speaker 5>They probably had these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>planning,</v>

2068
01:26:07.431 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 5>but you also still need skilled workers</v>
<v Speaker 5>to build these.</v>

2069
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think will particularly something like</v>

2070
01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 5>the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a tremendous amount of math</v>

2071
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:17.900
<v Speaker 5>involved and they're all doing this</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another.</v>

2072
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:20.210
<v Speaker 5>When they didn't even have steel?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2073
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.240
<v Speaker 5>they supposedly had copper tools and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured out some way to grind these</v>

2074
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:28.190
<v Speaker 5>stones so perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just sit on top of each other.</v>

2075
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:33.460
<v Speaker 5>Just completely flat level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>barely stick a card in the crease up to</v>

2076
01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.780
<v Speaker 5>stuff on the foxconn factories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remembered the said the reason why are</v>

2077
01:26:37.781 --> 01:26:40.400
<v Speaker 5>they at least that was their argument</v>
<v Speaker 5>why they weren't in America's,</v>

2078
01:26:40.401 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 5>because they had upwards of like 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanical engineers and electronical</v>

2079
01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:47.750
<v Speaker 5>engineers at the ready.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So those would be your skilled workers</v>

2080
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:48.990
<v Speaker 5>right in the store.</v>

2081
01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:52.220
<v Speaker 5>Slave labors underneath them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but those are the extra people that</v>

2082
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:53.540
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's why it's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2083
01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:56.150
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I guess with something like that</v>

2084
01:26:56.151 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 5>where the demand is so high and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>quality of the standard so high,</v>

2085
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 5>like I phones think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say what you want about iphones.</v>

2086
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 5>I've dropped this fucking stupid think</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven or eight times.</v>

2087
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:06.590
<v Speaker 5>It works great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2088
01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:09.200
<v Speaker 5>I love this thing to death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can take a beating man.</v>

2089
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can take a fucking beating.</v>

2090
01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.930
<v Speaker 5>These things are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When these things take over.</v>

2091
01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:17.060
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to be an apple robot</v>
<v Speaker 5>that takes,</v>

2092
01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:20.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm resisting that watch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's looking tempting and it tells</v>

2093
01:27:20.331 --> 01:27:23.390
<v Speaker 5>you your heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought my girlfriend one and she loves</v>

2094
01:27:23.391 --> 01:27:26.130
<v Speaker 5>it and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be at home.</v>

2095
01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.500
<v Speaker 5>Phones are going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The new iphone is going to be cool.</v>

2096
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:30.920
<v Speaker 5>They announce it soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God dammit stop.</v>

2097
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:34.640
<v Speaker 5>They can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get back on Yo.</v>

2098
01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:35.690
<v Speaker 5>What up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guilty.</v>

2099
01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:38.540
<v Speaker 5>That machine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2100
01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 5>just people are having romances</v>
<v Speaker 5>connected to each other,</v>

2101
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:43.040
<v Speaker 5>looking at each other through glass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weather,</v>

2102
01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:46.040
<v Speaker 5>wearing goggles and making phones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only socialize and get to do.</v>

2103
01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.640
<v Speaker 5>Do you think we might have a bounce back</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment where it rebounds a little bit</v>

2104
01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 5>and a Mumford and sons take over?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not like that,</v>

2105
01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:55.400
<v Speaker 5>but like there might be a day where we</v>
<v Speaker 5>see like,</v>

2106
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:58.880
<v Speaker 5>you know if</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can stop it,</v>

2107
01:27:58.881 --> 01:28:01.250
<v Speaker 5>but like we need to stop all of our jobs</v>
<v Speaker 5>from being taken.</v>

2108
01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:04.940
<v Speaker 5>We're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're already this drinking out of Mason</v>

2109
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.250
<v Speaker 5>Jars and wearing fucking suede boots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit.</v>

2110
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.160
<v Speaker 5>You just resisting the inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2111
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.550
<v Speaker 5>All in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're on the porch with a fiddle with</v>

2112
01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:16.180
<v Speaker 5>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>non ironically singing together and</v>

2113
01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:18.170
<v Speaker 5>perfect tune.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How dare you.</v>

2114
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.380
<v Speaker 5>If you're not going to stop the rock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's headed this way,</v>

2115
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:26.660
<v Speaker 5>that music by going how many thousand</v>
<v Speaker 5>feet to be figured out.</v>

2116
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 5>10 miles a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

2117
01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:34.490
<v Speaker 5>I can't even comprehend how fast that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it makes my whole body hurt.</v>

2118
01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 5>Just hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just hearing that.</v>

2119
01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:38.350
<v Speaker 5>I just like go limp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Ooh.</v>

2120
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:43.400
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember I was living in San Jose when</v>

2121
01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:46.700
<v Speaker 5>I found out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember it was like really great</v>

2122
01:28:46.701 --> 01:28:49.520
<v Speaker 5>science teacher and he would just blow</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mind all the time and I remember</v>

2123
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:52.610
<v Speaker 5>listening to him and he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about how when you look at stars,</v>

2124
01:28:52.611 --> 01:28:56.510
<v Speaker 5>you're actually looking in the past</v>
<v Speaker 5>technically because it's been,</v>

2125
01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:59.930
<v Speaker 5>because the light's just hitting us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's taking so long to travel.</v>

2126
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 5>This is something that's happened a long</v>
<v Speaker 5>time ago.</v>

2127
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:02.683
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2128
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.730
<v Speaker 5>When they look deeper and deeper into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the University of literally looking into</v>

2129
01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 5>like a time machine.</v>

2130
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:09.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So sane or my mind.</v>

2131
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:10.440
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just hard.</v>

2132
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.880
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for your stupid little head to</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out what these people figured</v>

2133
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.210
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they all had to agree on it.</v>

2134
01:29:15.211 --> 01:29:17.580
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know this is gonna sound crazy,</v>

2135
01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.360
<v Speaker 5>but what I'm thinking is when we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at those stars,</v>

2136
01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.390
<v Speaker 5>we're looking back in time like that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I was going to say,</v>

2137
01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:26.000
<v Speaker 5>but I sound too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2138
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 5>Are we right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at this.</v>

2139
01:29:28.081 --> 01:29:28.880
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neat.</v>

2140
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 5>Get the pads out and start calculating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>calculating it and like,</v>

2141
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:32.521
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do we,</v>

2142
01:29:32.521 --> 01:29:34.500
<v Speaker 5>when do we go public with us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2143
01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.510
<v Speaker 5>I think we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

2144
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>then we have discovered that the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 4.7 billion years old and people just</v>

2145
01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:48.330
<v Speaker 1>telling us these calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're waking up in the middle of</v>

2146
01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:50.400
<v Speaker 1>this trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we are literally on a</v>

2147
01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 1>spaceship and the spaceship is hurling</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards somewhere and in the middle of</v>

2148
01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:56.640
<v Speaker 1>this waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to learn how to speak.</v>

2149
01:29:56.970 --> 01:30:01.170
<v Speaker 1>We have to learn how to remember to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write things down that we've already</v>

2150
01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:04.020
<v Speaker 1>figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be able to save those things,</v>

2151
01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:06.450
<v Speaker 1>send them down to the next people so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to figure it out on</v>

2152
01:30:06.451 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next people,</v>

2153
01:30:07.831 --> 01:30:09.210
<v Speaker 1>the next people that everybody worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2154
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And while this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're waking up in the middle of a</v>

2155
01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.390
<v Speaker 1>spaceship and it's flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Scifi movie.</v>

2156
01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It is a Scifi movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2157
01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.260
<v Speaker 1>we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It literally is what's happening.</v>

2158
01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Think about how much information has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been lost throughout time.</v>

2159
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2160
01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Like the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example.</v>

2161
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:29.580
<v Speaker 1>The Great Pyramid of Giza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at all those insane</v>

2162
01:30:29.581 --> 01:30:31.530
<v Speaker 1>photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do those three days,</v>

2163
01:30:31.531 --> 01:30:33.320
<v Speaker 1>when they go over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2164
01:30:33.321 --> 01:30:36.060
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a drone and film it and you just</v>

2165
01:30:36.061 --> 01:30:36.710
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go this,</v>

2166
01:30:36.710 --> 01:30:41.710
<v Speaker 1>that is an insane accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't imagine what it feels like</v>

2167
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.890
<v Speaker 1>to be there in real life for wish</v>

2168
01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.820
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't such a sketchy part of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world right now.</v>

2169
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:48.580
<v Speaker 5>I would like to go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2170
01:30:48.581 --> 01:30:49.730
<v Speaker 5>I'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just gotta go to the beard,</v>

2171
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.190
<v Speaker 5>had a little bit longer and be quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

2172
01:30:51.191 --> 01:30:52.960
<v Speaker 5>you had slipped right in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have a nice one.</v>

2173
01:30:52.961 --> 01:30:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Then the little hats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white hats with the lingerie style.</v>

2174
01:30:57.130 --> 01:30:59.200
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't get back in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would totally,</v>

2175
01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.750
<v Speaker 5>totally building shell whip right in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

2176
01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:05.410
<v Speaker 5>No problem man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let that hair gets a little bit scraggly</v>

2177
01:31:05.411 --> 01:31:07.300
<v Speaker 5>or in your beard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're good.</v>

2178
01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:08.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2179
01:31:08.261 --> 01:31:09.730
<v Speaker 5>and just talk like you got a sore</v>
<v Speaker 5>throat.</v>

2180
01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:15.460
<v Speaker 5>So</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the jokes that I'm doing</v>

2181
01:31:15.461 --> 01:31:16.930
<v Speaker 5>now that I add,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really had fun with,</v>

2182
01:31:16.931 --> 01:31:20.590
<v Speaker 5>which is like the idea of me getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>deported and going back to Mexico and</v>

2183
01:31:20.591 --> 01:31:23.260
<v Speaker 5>having just to be quiet the whole time</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he can't speak Spanish.</v>

2184
01:31:23.261 --> 01:31:25.630
<v Speaker 5>I can't speak Spanish and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>like let them know,</v>

2185
01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.830
<v Speaker 5>does that piss off some Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some Mexican Americans that you can't</v>

2186
01:31:29.831 --> 01:31:33.130
<v Speaker 5>speak Spanish in San Jose did a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>bit grown up some,</v>

2187
01:31:33.190 --> 01:31:35.650
<v Speaker 5>well older Mexicans cause it's like they</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at me and they're just like,</v>

2188
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what have we done?</v>

2189
01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.070
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like at what cost is our freedom and our</v>

2190
01:31:39.071 --> 01:31:41.080
<v Speaker 5>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

2191
01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:42.310
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2192
01:31:42.370 --> 01:31:46.420
<v Speaker 5>I didn't learn because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment for my grandparents and my mom,</v>

2193
01:31:46.421 --> 01:31:47.440
<v Speaker 5>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it was like,</v>

2194
01:31:47.441 --> 01:31:50.140
<v Speaker 5>we don't want him to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't want people to know he's,</v>

2195
01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:51.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hispanic like,</v>

2196
01:31:51.521 --> 01:31:52.930
<v Speaker 5>cause it was like almost looked down</v>
<v Speaker 5>upon that.</v>

2197
01:31:52.931 --> 01:31:55.390
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're speaking Spanish and bright,</v>

2198
01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:57.100
<v Speaker 5>you have to speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blah Blah.</v>

2199
01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:01.420
<v Speaker 5>But now it's the point where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's much of a benefit to learn multiple</v>

2200
01:32:01.421 --> 01:32:02.680
<v Speaker 5>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2201
01:32:02.681 --> 01:32:06.130
<v Speaker 5>I would think if you're a guy who could</v>
<v Speaker 5>speak Spanish,</v>

2202
01:32:06.131 --> 01:32:09.410
<v Speaker 5>you could work in all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 5>countries and South America too.</v>

2203
01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2204
01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 5>we just had a serious leak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2205
01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.230

2207
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had a serious leak in our building.</v>

2208
01:32:28.111 --> 01:32:31.500
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking raining cats and dogs out</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2209
01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:32.610
<v Speaker 5>Megan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This building wet,</v>

2210
01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we in trouble.</v>

2211
01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2212
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.960
<v Speaker 4>it depends where it is.</v>

2213
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:38.890
<v Speaker 5>What if it hits electricity?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're saying,</v>

2214
01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should we get the fuck Outta here?</v>

2215
01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

2216
01:32:42.461 --> 01:32:45.330
<v Speaker 5>I told you I'm not good with electricity</v>
<v Speaker 5>once a day full of,</v>

2217
01:32:45.331 --> 01:32:46.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2218
01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:48.170
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever happened,</v>

2219
01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.610
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me like water pooled up</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere and then,</v>

2220
01:32:50.611 --> 01:32:53.100
<v Speaker 5>then the least.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like it's right above us on</v>

2221
01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:54.900
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where,</v>

2222
01:32:54.901 --> 01:32:57.870
<v Speaker 5>if there's electronic wires up there or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatnot or how it could it came in or</v>

2223
01:32:57.871 --> 01:33:01.640
<v Speaker 5>what could probably look the drama.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I be a great credit just to,</v>

2224
01:33:01.641 --> 01:33:04.620
<v Speaker 5>it was like to die on Joe Rogan's</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast do don't die.</v>

2225
01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:07.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh well this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can avoid this disaster again.</v>

2226
01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:11.990
<v Speaker 5>The Sky is letting us know probably up</v>
<v Speaker 5>until we have no control.</v>

2227
01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:14.700
<v Speaker 5>The future and the university is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys gotta stop talking about</v>

2228
01:33:14.701 --> 01:33:17.280

<v Speaker 5>You don't want to talk in the dark?</v>

2255
01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:16.220
<v Speaker 5>Let's just see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel good about this.</v>

2256
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:17.420
<v Speaker 5>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2257
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:18.743
<v Speaker 5>just a leak.</v>

2258
01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.360
<v Speaker 5>Just the water pouring down on us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're evacuating parts of northern</v>

2259
01:34:26.491 --> 01:34:27.390
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

2260
01:34:27.391 --> 01:34:28.770
<v Speaker 5>I think that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to,</v>

2261
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I think it was notification in case</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's road.</v>

2262
01:34:31.130 --> 01:34:32.580
<v Speaker 5>It's probably because we're near the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the hills.</v>

2263
01:34:32.581 --> 01:34:34.680
<v Speaker 5>There's case to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're an area where your roads get me</v>

2264
01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:36.830
<v Speaker 5>any closer to the one slide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where to go be,</v>

2265
01:34:36.831 --> 01:34:38.890
<v Speaker 5>be ready to leave in case you have to or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

2266
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:42.870
<v Speaker 5>I went down Laurel and there was a house</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fell off the side of the cliff.</v>

2267
01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:46.340
<v Speaker 5>That's that driving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>driving and watching,</v>

2268
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:48.150
<v Speaker 5>like looking at those houses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just it's,</v>

2269
01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.510
<v Speaker 5>I get anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2270
01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:53.040
<v Speaker 5>Just watching those houses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a giant back porch and it just</v>

2271
01:34:53.041 --> 01:34:55.140
<v Speaker 5>broke off and slid down the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>hill.</v>

2272
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 5>I imagine just being that guy that made</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much money</v>

2273
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.530

<v Speaker 3>finally I get to enjoy my porch.</v>

2274
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 3>It's raining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to look at all the Hollywood hills</v>

2275
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:04.910
<v Speaker 3>have worked so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's just like,</v>

2276
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a life changing disaster</v>

2277
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 3>when your house breaks and slides down a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hill,</v>

2278
01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 3>that will change your fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a whole house that's slid down</v>

2279
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:14.690
<v Speaker 3>the hill.</v>

<v Speaker 3>or five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a house that's slid off the</v>

2293
01:35:40.651 --> 01:35:42.090
<v Speaker 3>side of the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2294
01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.190
<v Speaker 3>And you could drive by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the house.</v>

2295
01:35:44.191 --> 01:35:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't like that much of a hill</v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

2296
01:35:46.021 --> 01:35:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2297
01:35:47.670 --> 01:35:50.370
<v Speaker 3>it's decent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever was behind it was the</v>

2298
01:35:50.371 --> 01:35:53.340
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It like kind of pushed it forward like</v>

2299
01:35:53.341 --> 01:35:53.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2300
01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:56.760
<v Speaker 3>the ground broke loose above it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed it forward and there was like a</v>

2301
01:35:56.761 --> 01:36:00.450
<v Speaker 3>big ass lawsuit and lasted forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would always drive by looking at</v>

2302
01:36:00.451 --> 01:36:02.100
<v Speaker 3>that place going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2303
01:36:02.970 --> 01:36:05.310
<v Speaker 3>this is supposed to happen like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the earth.</v>

2304
01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:06.570
<v Speaker 3>It just shifts constantly.</v>

2305
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:09.000
<v Speaker 3>Like our idea that we could just pitch a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tent forever.</v>

2306
01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.010
<v Speaker 3>That'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

2307
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.180
<v Speaker 3>Earth's crust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that deep.</v>

2308
01:36:12.181 --> 01:36:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not deep enough for my tastes.</v>

2309
01:36:14.611 --> 01:36:15.444
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2310
01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:18.090
<v Speaker 3>I just laugh at the bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

2311
01:36:18.091 --> 01:36:19.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably gonna say something real</v>

2312
01:36:19.261 --> 01:36:20.730
<v Speaker 3>stupid Ligo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like seven miles deep,</v>

2313
01:36:20.731 --> 01:36:22.740
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like it's not that deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2314
01:36:22.741 --> 01:36:24.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that much more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2315
01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I know there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this mining operation,</v>

2316
01:36:25.981 --> 01:36:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to find out what the exact</v>
<v Speaker 3>number is.</v>

2317
01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:30.750
<v Speaker 3>There was some mining operation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2318
01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.530
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2319
01:36:31.530 --> 01:36:34.680
<v Speaker 3>they were doing this article about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>many miles is it Jamie?</v>

2320
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

2321
01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:37.770
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2322
01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:39.720
<v Speaker 7>Crust average.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2323
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:41.540
<v Speaker 7>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Initially I had the radius,</v>

2324
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:43.620
<v Speaker 7>it sits about 4,000 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's the radius.</v>

2325
01:36:43.621 --> 01:36:47.250
<v Speaker 7>So it's a average is about 18 miles</v>
<v Speaker 7>under the continents,</v>

2326
01:36:47.251 --> 01:36:49.020
<v Speaker 7>but it's only about three miles under</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ocean.</v>

2327
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's only about three miles out of the</v>

2328
01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:56.330
<v Speaker 3>ocean and then lava.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how like Hawaii gets brought up.</v>

2329
01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.970
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's deemed enough for</v>

2330
01:36:58.971 --> 01:37:00.260
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems weird.</v>

2331
01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.880
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a ball of live under our feet.</v>

2332
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:09.140
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet we're just the crust over the sun.</v>

2333
01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:10.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2334
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:12.740
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2335
01:37:12.930 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2336
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:16.250
<v Speaker 3>some article I was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I read about a mining operation</v>

2337
01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 3>where they were talking about how warm</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got.</v>

2338
01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:22.490
<v Speaker 3>As you got lower and lower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper and deeper into the earth,</v>

2339
01:37:22.491 --> 01:37:26.160
<v Speaker 3>that you could literally feel the heat</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fucking lava.</v>

2340
01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:28.790
<v Speaker 3>These assholes are drilling next to how</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick,</v>

2341
01:37:28.791 --> 01:37:29.930
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit wrong one.</v>

2342
01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hit wrong.</v>

2343
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:35.050
<v Speaker 3>You can't even speak yet one wrong vein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's terrifying.</v>

2345
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:38.630
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they have that down to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

2346
01:37:38.631 --> 01:37:41.000
<v Speaker 3>Obviously they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do they know exactly that?</v>

2347
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.840
<v Speaker 3>They're never going to like drill a hole</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the lava and have it spew out</v>

2348
01:37:44.841 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 3>through the top like a Zit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This gotta be mistakes had been made.</v>

2349
01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Did you imagine if that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine if these guys really</v>

2350
01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.420
<v Speaker 3>trying to get more diamonds like work</v>
<v Speaker 3>this more diamonds there?</v>

2351
01:37:53.421 --> 01:37:54.920
<v Speaker 3>But here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh foot.</v>

2352
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:57.150
<v Speaker 3>The diamonds is the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking earth.</v>

2353
01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>So don't drill two going to have to wear</v>
<v Speaker 3>space suits that won't allow you to use</v>

2354
01:38:01.321 --> 01:38:04.290
<v Speaker 3>your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say everything's going to be done in a</v>

2355
01:38:04.291 --> 01:38:06.390
<v Speaker 3>key pad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to ipad strapped to</v>

2356
01:38:06.391 --> 01:38:08.400
<v Speaker 3>you and you're going to have to program</v>
<v Speaker 3>it like this.</v>

2357
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:13.380
<v Speaker 3>And they'll try to suck the last diamond</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and then they'll see the bubble of</v>

2358
01:38:13.381 --> 01:38:17.610
<v Speaker 3>red with that last diamond hole was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that's the last thing they say</v>

2359
01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:19.050
<v Speaker 3>is the explosion.</v>

2360
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:23.010
<v Speaker 3>As that hot lava shoots passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a broken fire hydrant.</v>

2361
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:26.100
<v Speaker 3>She goes boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and right out of the surface of the</v>

2362
01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:31.101
<v Speaker 3>earth just sprays lava into the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This for years and years,</v>

2363
01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:35.570
<v Speaker 3>that's probably one check was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want that time.</v>

2364
01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:40.560
<v Speaker 3>How big that's the diamond and killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody and I need it for you to show</v>

2365
01:38:40.561 --> 01:38:44.010
<v Speaker 3>me about mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a person like that out there,</v>

2366
01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:44.940
<v Speaker 3>you know there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2367
01:38:44.941 --> 01:38:46.590
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get mad people.</v>

2368
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Sexual stereotypes are disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm looking at diamonds,</v>

2369
01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:55.200
<v Speaker 3>actually not diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an emerald dude.</v>

2370
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Engagement rings or brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2371
01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.550
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those goddamn things aren't even worth</v>

2372
01:38:59.551 --> 01:39:00.420
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2373
01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:03.900
<v Speaker 3>there are definitely people buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason why people buy it for so</v>

2374
01:39:03.901 --> 01:39:05.580
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they've stockpile always</v>

2375
01:39:05.581 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 3>fucking diamonds and they control the</v>
<v Speaker 3>price.</v>

2376
01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:08.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2377
01:39:08.041 --> 01:39:09.750
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so smart.</v>

2378
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:14.890
<v Speaker 3>And we kind of give it up for the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but up strong marketing strategy when it</v>

2379
01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:16.531
<v Speaker 3>cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

2380
01:39:16.531 --> 01:39:20.040
<v Speaker 3>are they the Jews that run the diamonds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad thing to say.</v>

2381
01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:22.920
<v Speaker 3>People would say that that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you it's not racist.</v>

2382
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:25.530
<v Speaker 3>If it's a positive quality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're awesome at business.</v>

2383
01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.550
<v Speaker 3>How is that racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was everybody so sensitive that you</v>

2384
01:39:29.551 --> 01:39:33.630
<v Speaker 3>can't even say something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay Ingest about a person's positive</v>

2385
01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:35.830
<v Speaker 3>attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when people think you're racist,</v>

2386
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jews are good about business.</v>

2387
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:39.780
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing.</v>

2388
01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:41.160
<v Speaker 3>It's good thing to be good with</v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

2389
01:39:41.161 --> 01:39:43.800
<v Speaker 3>You fuckhead my uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I told him I had an agent,</v>

2390

<v Speaker 3>he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one piece of advice to give you.</v>

2393
01:39:47.911 --> 01:39:48.870
<v Speaker 3>what kind of manager you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2394

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like a,</v>

2396
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:51.110
<v Speaker 3>This company was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2397
01:39:51.111 --> 01:39:53.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't like what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2398
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:54.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's Jewish.</v>

2399
01:39:54.181 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good job.</v>

2400
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:57.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2401
01:39:57.031 --> 01:39:57.751
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the business.</v>

2403
01:39:58.381 --> 01:39:58.981

<v Speaker 3>that was all he said to me and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2405
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:02.370
<v Speaker 3>that's the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so funny to me.</v>

2406
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing the Jewish folks</v>
<v Speaker 3>because um,</v>

2407
01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:11.550
<v Speaker 3>especially like European Jews is more</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobel prize winning new Europe,</v>

2408
01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:15.790
<v Speaker 3>European,</v>
<v Speaker 3>European Jews that I think anybody truly</v>

2409
01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:17.160
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a,</v>

2410
01:40:17.161 --> 01:40:21.170
<v Speaker 3>there's a pillar of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of science or just a,</v>

2411
01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:26.180
<v Speaker 3>a pillar of pillars on a good word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a collective of incredible minds that</v>

2412
01:40:26.431 --> 01:40:29.040
<v Speaker 3>have come out of European Jews for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange reason.</v>

2413
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they're all hilarious to</v>
<v Speaker 3>European Jews.</v>

2414
01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like name one.</v>

2415
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:36.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>

2416
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.051
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

2417
01:40:37.051 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I was just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2418
01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:38.700
<v Speaker 3>just sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taught</v>

<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2420

<v Speaker 3>You one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>

2421
01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I love smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He don't just take the high and say this</v>

2422
01:40:45.961 --> 01:40:46.800
<v Speaker 3>is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

2423
01:40:47.110 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write it out</v>

2424
01:40:50.650 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 3>where you big stoner got grown up or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not until I was 30.</v>

2425
01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you say,</v>

2426
01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

2427
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:59.320
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever seen the people that dig</v>

2428
01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:02.380
<v Speaker 7>for like diamond dust and gold dust in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the streets in New York that like,</v>

2429
01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:04.480
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know exactly what street it is,</v>

2430
01:41:04.481 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's like that area at the diamond</v>

2431
01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 7>area and they're all like doing</v>
<v Speaker 7>exchanges and whatnot.</v>

2432
01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 7>When they're looking at them in their</v>
<v Speaker 7>car and whatnot.</v>

2433
01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 7>Dust gets on their pants and little</v>
<v Speaker 7>little flecks fall off and they get into</v>

2434
01:41:14.321 --> 01:41:16.490
<v Speaker 7>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 7>into the dust and here's like a,</v>

2435
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 7>here's a video.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a gut and make,</v>

2436
01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:20.140
<v Speaker 7>it's probably more people that do it now</v>
<v Speaker 7>obviously,</v>

2437
01:41:20.141 --> 01:41:23.110
<v Speaker 7>but like they just dig through the dirt</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the dust and the street cracks and</v>

2438
01:41:23.111 --> 01:41:25.300
<v Speaker 7>whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they can take it home and they can</v>

2439
01:41:25.301 --> 01:41:30.301
<v Speaker 7>find hundreds or thousands of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 7>worth of like diamond dust and gold dust</v>

2440
01:41:31.631 --> 01:41:34.270
<v Speaker 7>and diamond flex and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 7>occasionally they fuck,</v>

2441
01:41:34.271 --> 01:41:36.220
<v Speaker 7>they get like really lucky and find a</v>
<v Speaker 7>whole one,</v>

2442
01:41:36.221 --> 01:41:38.920
<v Speaker 7>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just based off of that.</v>

2443
01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:41.530
<v Speaker 7>That's where all of it is happening on</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that one block in New York.</v>

2444
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old school panning yet.</v>

2445
01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.110
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're panning for gold in front of</v>

2446
01:41:48.111 --> 01:41:51.740
<v Speaker 3>these diamonds doors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's probably not they found</v>

2447
01:41:51.741 --> 01:41:53.150
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2448
01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:55.430
<v Speaker 3>I heard about this couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought maybe you'd heard about</v>

2449
01:41:55.431 --> 01:41:57.470
<v Speaker 3>it since you not there or dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2450
01:41:57.471 --> 01:41:59.870
<v Speaker 3>I never lived in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in new Rochelle.</v>

2451
01:41:59.871 --> 01:42:02.930
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't afford to live in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing though.</v>

2452
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:06.290
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted to move to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York's crazy,</v>

2453
01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:09.440
<v Speaker 3>but when I was living there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was po and I couldn't afford the</v>

2454
01:42:09.441 --> 01:42:10.940
<v Speaker 3>parking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a,</v>

2455
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:13.310
<v Speaker 3>if I would've had to get a really shitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment,</v>

2456
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I had my apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Rochelle is pretty shitty too,</v>

2457
01:42:16.161 --> 01:42:19.190
<v Speaker 3>but I would have had to get a parking</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

2458
01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to pay every month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2459
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:24.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be a lot of money to like</v>

2460
01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:24.860
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

2461
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's as high as it could go.</v>

2462
01:42:26.701 --> 01:42:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what like a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a good monthly rate for parking</v>

2463
01:42:31.041 --> 01:42:32.810
<v Speaker 3>in a parking structure in New York City?</v>

2464
01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.000
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard comics talk about,</v>

2465
01:42:35.001 --> 01:42:37.940
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of them don't keep cars because</v>

2466
01:42:37.941 --> 01:42:39.610
<v Speaker 3>now you can just uber anywhere you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2467
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Take cabs and go all over the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But back in the day,</v>

2468
01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:45.860
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to live there and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to do road trips,</v>

2469
01:42:45.861 --> 01:42:47.420
<v Speaker 3>you had to have a place to keep your</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

2470
01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:50.420
<v Speaker 3>And it was like insurmountable for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

2471
01:42:50.421 --> 01:42:53.690
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like Ed my in my day,</v>

2472
01:42:53.691 --> 01:42:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I remember it being like something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>$700 a month just to park your car.</v>

2473
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:58.910
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2475
01:42:58.970 --> 01:43:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Even then there's just so much traffic</v>
<v Speaker 3>in New York.</v>

2476
01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is back when I was making like</v>

2477
01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:06.140
<v Speaker 3>three 50 a week on average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2478
01:43:06.141 --> 01:43:07.520
<v Speaker 3>So it was ridiculous.</v>

2479
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:09.930
<v Speaker 7>It's probably less than that now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's different areas.</v>

2480
01:43:09.931 --> 01:43:14.040
<v Speaker 7>It looks like it's anywhere from 300</v>
<v Speaker 7>plus up to three 75 there's different</v>

2481
01:43:14.041 --> 01:43:14.874
<v Speaker 7>garages now.</v>

2482
01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:18.560
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can get it as low as 300 bucks.</v>

2484
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Find some that say two 50 what's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive one?</v>

2485
01:43:24.230 --> 01:43:27.680
<v Speaker 3>The ones that I saw that were cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stack you on top of each other.</v>

2486
01:43:27.681 --> 01:43:29.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really nuts.</v>

2487
01:43:30.110 --> 01:43:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I remember it was 700 bucks.</v>

2488
01:43:32.301 --> 01:43:33.710
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean stack on top of each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>

2489
01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:38.740
<v Speaker 3>They stick them into these machines and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the machines lift up and then another</v>

2490
01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:41.750
<v Speaker 3>car gets driven in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The machine continues to lift up.</v>

2491
01:43:42.170 --> 01:43:46.700
<v Speaker 3>And so like you have to drive the cars</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and then bring the thing down and</v>

2492
01:43:46.701 --> 01:43:48.770
<v Speaker 3>drive that car out and bring the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2493
01:43:48.771 --> 01:43:50.210
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you might have to do that with like</v>

2494
01:43:50.211 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 3>three or four cars at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

2495
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking crazy.</v>

2496
01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.400
<v Speaker 3>That sounds terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is so crazy that they could do that.</v>

2497
01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:02.150
<v Speaker 3>So this is the way they saved space and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stack cars and it actually does work.</v>

2498
01:44:02.151 --> 01:44:03.970
<v Speaker 3>But Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how weird is that?</v>

2499
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:06.170
<v Speaker 3>They have your car up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2500
01:44:06.171 --> 01:44:08.480
<v Speaker 3>tell me one of these guys who works</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2501
01:44:08.481 --> 01:44:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Can't fuck up one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just people.</v>

2502
01:44:11.451 --> 01:44:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be an accident that's</v>

2503
01:44:13.911 --> 01:44:15.290
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People fuck things up.</v>

2504
01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a car is fallen off that thing and</v>

2505
01:44:17.121 --> 01:44:18.420
<v Speaker 3>landed on someone's head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2506
01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:19.910
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2507
01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.010
<v Speaker 3>That's had to have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think?</v>

2508
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I've seen valet drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe I was wrong about how much it</v>
<v Speaker 3>costs or maybe I had a very expensive</v>

2510
01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:33.170
<v Speaker 3>one near me and maybe it's because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>stack them.</v>

2511
01:44:33.171 --> 01:44:36.440
<v Speaker 3>They can do it for 300 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever the amount was,</v>

2512
01:44:36.441 --> 01:44:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't make any fucking money back</v>

2513
01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:40.670
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way it was going to work.</v>

2514
01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Where are you serving back then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2515
01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:43.270
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then it was a,</v>

2516
01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.260
<v Speaker 3>that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I lived in new Rochelle is my,</v>

2517
01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:50.320
<v Speaker 3>my first attempt at living off stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my first actual attempt where,</v>

2518
01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:55.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I'd always had day jobs and a day</v>

2519
01:44:55.581 --> 01:44:59.240
<v Speaker 3>job driving limos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a day job delivering newspapers.</v>

2520
01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.450
<v Speaker 3>And so then I went from there to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2521
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 3>to New York and when I went to New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like almost making money,</v>

2522
01:45:06.231 --> 01:45:08.810
<v Speaker 3>doing stand up like almost almost like</v>
<v Speaker 3>some months.</v>

2523
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made it this month,</v>

2524
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:11.011
<v Speaker 3>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2525
01:45:11.011 --> 01:45:12.350
<v Speaker 3>can I have any gigs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2526
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:14.900
<v Speaker 3>it was like almost being able to pull it</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

2527
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:18.450
<v Speaker 3>So whatever the amount for a parking and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then living in New York City.</v>

2528
01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Plus the thing about New York City is</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York's amazing and it's,</v>

2529
01:45:21.850 --> 01:45:24.470
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible that you can hop around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go from club to club to club.</v>

2530
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:28.370
<v Speaker 3>But it was harder at the time at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do long sets.</v>

2531
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.990
<v Speaker 3>So like I wanted to do like sets that</v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare me for headlining on the road.</v>

2532
01:45:32.991 --> 01:45:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I want it to like keep doing that set</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even during the weekday.</v>

2533
01:45:36.111 --> 01:45:38.960
<v Speaker 3>So I just try to get it stronger and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all as a whole.</v>

2534
01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:43.310
<v Speaker 3>And that was really only available on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the road for a guy like me.</v>

2535
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:46.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's kind of where I'm at</v>

2536
01:45:46.101 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I don't,</v>

2537
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I can find this for the first month I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was ever able to pay my bills and</v>

2538
01:45:51.201 --> 01:45:52.070
<v Speaker 3>everything off his standup.</v>

2539
01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:54.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a great failing of the drug.</v>

2540
01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.000
<v Speaker 3>The launching pad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2541
01:45:56.001 --> 01:45:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's gotta be smarter about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2542
01:45:57.081 --> 01:46:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Cause I mean now that I have money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all just going to rent so I can</v>

2543
01:46:01.941 --> 01:46:05.660
<v Speaker 3>afford to be on the road and to build</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time to where I can,</v>

2544
01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:08.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feature regularly and then make that</v>

2545
01:46:08.871 --> 01:46:10.160
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to be for you too.</v>

2553

<v Speaker 3>just live off,</v>

2554
01:46:28.551 --> 01:46:29.660
<v Speaker 3>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was scary.</v>

2555
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think I was going to make it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then Moses was,</v>

2691
01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:38.560
<v Speaker 2>if he wasn't like a big brother,</v>

01:51:44.051 --> 01:51:45.220
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did.</v>

2696
01:51:45.221 --> 01:51:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I stayed and I just kept battling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept doing standup and then the</v>

2697
01:51:49.301 --> 01:51:50.890
<v Speaker 2>opportunity came and knocked it out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the park.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the launching pad of crying God studio</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2706

<v Speaker 1>from looking at your instagram page for</v>

2707
01:52:13.731 --> 01:52:14.780

2708
01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I see your instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2709
01:52:16.071 --> 01:52:17.120
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid's hungry.</v>

2710
01:52:17.121 --> 01:52:18.740
<v Speaker 1>He's out there grinding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2711
01:52:18.741 --> 01:52:21.380
<v Speaker 1>constantly doing spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those hotspots.</v>

2712
01:52:21.570 --> 01:52:23.970
<v Speaker 2>What was you telling me that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it was like,</v>

2713
01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:26.070
<v Speaker 2>just listen to you talk about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>

2714
01:52:26.071 --> 01:52:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's also hearing you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to go up after prior,</v>

2715
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:33.810
<v Speaker 2>especially if such a hard time for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like having to do those things and</v>

2716
01:52:33.811 --> 01:52:35.240
<v Speaker 2>it was like five weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2717
01:52:35.250 --> 01:52:36.083
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

2718
01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:36.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2719
01:52:36.611 --> 01:52:40.360
<v Speaker 1>It was the sad era of prior went before</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died.</v>

2720
01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:44.350
<v Speaker 1>He was in real bad shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he still wanted to go on stage and</v>

2721
01:52:44.351 --> 01:52:46.580
<v Speaker 1>he would go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was under medication,</v>

2722
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:47.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a serious issue.</v>

2723
01:52:47.751 --> 01:52:50.630
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't walk and they would carry</v>
<v Speaker 3>him up there and they'd crank the mic</v>

2724
01:52:50.631 --> 01:52:53.570
<v Speaker 3>like shh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so loud.</v>

2725
01:52:53.571 --> 01:52:55.970
<v Speaker 3>It was like hissing in the room and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

2726
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:57.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could barely talk and he would drink</v>

2727
01:52:57.951 --> 01:52:59.870
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just real weird,</v>

2728
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was real weird.</v>

2729
01:53:00.921 --> 01:53:02.210
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't,</v>

2730
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:06.440
<v Speaker 3>couldn't really do stand up anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't really look form the</v>

2731
01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 3>sentences with the punch lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least not in this sets that I saw.</v>

2732
01:53:09.730 --> 01:53:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Every one of them that I saw was hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>

2733
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:15.560
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a giant Richard Pryor Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2734
01:53:15.561 --> 01:53:18.080
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably the all time,</v>

2735
01:53:18.081 --> 01:53:20.330
<v Speaker 3>number one in my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's number one.</v>

2736
01:53:20.331 --> 01:53:24.380
<v Speaker 3>If I look back at like all the comics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their influence on people and the</v>

2737
01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:27.290
<v Speaker 3>honesty that he had on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean without Lenny Bruce,</v>

2738
01:53:27.291 --> 01:53:30.560
<v Speaker 3>there's no one right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But essentially,</v>

2739
01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:32.930
<v Speaker 3>and George Carlin plays a giant factor</v>
<v Speaker 3>there too.</v>

2740
01:53:32.931 --> 01:53:34.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys that play a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>factor,</v>

2741
01:53:34.221 --> 01:53:37.700
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like prior was the guy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this day,</v>

2742
01:53:37.701 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll go back and watch his stuff when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>go in 1975.</v>

2743
01:53:41.301 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 3>This was just genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at everything that was going on</v>

2744
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:46.950
<v Speaker 3>in 1975 he came out as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2745
01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2746
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:50.380
<v Speaker 2>and that was the thing like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>loved prior,</v>

<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>

2749
01:53:54.370 --> 01:53:56.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing that I liked the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most about him was like,</v>

2750
01:53:56.590 --> 01:54:00.370
<v Speaker 2>he could talk about these subjects and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these jokes and it didn't matter what</v>

2751
01:54:00.371 --> 01:54:02.320
<v Speaker 2>kind of background you came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could relate to</v>

2752
01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:04.100
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was,</v>

2753
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:04.950
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2754
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:06.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially</v>

2755
01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:11.120
<v Speaker 3>the godfather of this style of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like without him,</v>

2758
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:17.210
<v Speaker 3>like what would it have been like back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>

2759

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who else was like,</v>

2760
01:54:18.561 --> 01:54:23.561
<v Speaker 3>even remotely is controversial and as</v>
<v Speaker 3>insightful and the way he could perform,</v>

2761
01:54:26.210 --> 01:54:28.550
<v Speaker 3>the way he announced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hated his words.</v>

2762
01:54:28.551 --> 01:54:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean he had some fucking bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They God damn camera,</v>

2763
01:54:32.001 --> 01:54:33.530
<v Speaker 3>which specialist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been</v>

2764
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:36.270
<v Speaker 2>the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>

2765
01:54:36.271 --> 01:54:38.910
<v Speaker 2>it shows him walking out on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lights are still up,</v>

2766
01:54:38.911 --> 01:54:42.120
<v Speaker 2>people aren't fully sat down at their</v>
<v Speaker 2>seats and he just walks in and says,</v>

2767
01:54:42.121 --> 01:54:43.800
<v Speaker 2>all right guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just starts getting them to come</v>

2768
01:54:43.801 --> 01:54:44.634
<v Speaker 2>in and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hill.</v>

2770
01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:48.030
<v Speaker 2>And he'd just get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2771
01:54:48.031 --> 01:54:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he gets right into it,</v>

2772
01:54:49.951 --> 01:54:50.790
<v Speaker 2>but he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2773
01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.760
<v Speaker 2>it's seamless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2774
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:53.733
<v Speaker 2>to to remember him</v>

2775
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:56.620
<v Speaker 3>would joke about lighting himself on</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

2776
01:54:56.650 --> 01:54:57.790
<v Speaker 3>So funny,</v>

2777
01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:00.300
<v Speaker 2>right after the freebasing thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

2778
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>who has the balls to joke about lighting</v>

2780
01:55:05.411 --> 01:55:07.780
<v Speaker 3>themselves on fire from Free Basin?</v>

2781
01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2782
01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:12.670
<v Speaker 2>when peewee Herman came back out after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that huge thing happened and he walks</v>

2783
01:55:12.671 --> 01:55:15.370
<v Speaker 2>out and I think it was like the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing he was hosting right afterwards or</v>

2784
01:55:15.371 --> 01:55:17.230
<v Speaker 2>something or presenting and he comes out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

2785
01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:19.600
<v Speaker 2>it's dead silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are like just kind of looking at</v>

2786
01:55:19.601 --> 01:55:21.580
<v Speaker 2>him and his right after he got caught</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff and he goes,</v>

2787
01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:25.390
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys here have a any funny jokes</v>

2788
01:55:25.391 --> 01:55:28.120
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was right at the time that</v>

2789

<v Speaker 2>jokes about him being with thing and it</v>

2790
01:55:32.411 --> 01:55:33.244
<v Speaker 2>was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2791
01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:36.880
<v Speaker 2>someone that can take some of that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be serious and then</v>

2792
01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.353
<v Speaker 3>still</v>

2793
01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:42.010
<v Speaker 2>humanize themselves in a way like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why the roast battle</v>

<v Speaker 2>so cool.</v>

2886
01:59:25.211 --> 01:59:27.760
<v Speaker 5>together and they know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it just humans collectively as</v>

2910
02:00:25.901 --> 02:00:28.720
<v Speaker 5>it all started off from them jerking off</v>
<v Speaker 5>the htc vive on.</v>

2911
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:29.950

<v Speaker 5>I told my girlfriend I wanted to,</v>

02:00:37.421 --> 02:00:39.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I get the,</v>

2915
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.260

<v Speaker 5>but when I do,</v>

2916
02:00:41.710 --> 02:00:43.810
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to just get it in cash and just</v>

2917
02:00:43.811 --> 02:00:46.930
<v Speaker 5>throw it at her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when she gets bruised she can call</v>

2918
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:48.760
<v Speaker 5>the cops and they can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened?</v>

2919
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:50.370
<v Speaker 5>How did these brews come up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm just like,</v>

2920
02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:53.920
<v Speaker 5>it was approximately $10,000 in damage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2921
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:56.940
<v Speaker 5>she left but on pump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2922
02:00:57.910 --> 02:01:00.610
<v Speaker 5>taking her to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hawaii's good spot.</v>

2923
02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:02.170
<v Speaker 5>Which island?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maui.</v>

2924
02:01:02.171 --> 02:01:04.660
<v Speaker 5>I think now he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all awesome.</v>

2925
02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.490
<v Speaker 5>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big island is crazy because you</v>

2926
02:01:09.491 --> 02:01:11.440
<v Speaker 5>could actually fly over the volcano.</v>

2927
02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:14.350
<v Speaker 5>You can get in one of those helicopters</v>
<v Speaker 5>will take you to the place where the</v>

2928
02:01:14.650 --> 02:01:18.970
<v Speaker 5>volcano empties into the ocean and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like creating more island as you fly</v>

2929
02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:21.460
<v Speaker 5>over and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

2930
02:01:21.490 --> 02:01:24.070
<v Speaker 5>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He sleep weird at night with that</v>

2931
02:01:24.071 --> 02:01:25.280
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2932
02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:26.690
<v Speaker 5>Then it can just go to anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2933
02:01:26.691 --> 02:01:28.420
<v Speaker 5>You were on the side of an active</v>
<v Speaker 5>volcano.</v>

2934
02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those people live there and harmony</v>

2935
02:01:30.671 --> 02:01:32.200
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting.</v>

2936
02:01:32.201 --> 02:01:35.740
<v Speaker 5>I think that being that connected to</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature the way they are because they</v>

2937
02:01:35.741 --> 02:01:37.780
<v Speaker 5>have the ocean there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not to say that Hawaiian people</v>

2938
02:01:37.781 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 5>don't have their problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like everybody has their problems,</v>

2939
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.780
<v Speaker 5>but Hawaiian people have a more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what they'll call like island</v>

2940
02:01:44.781 --> 02:01:49.370
<v Speaker 5>style way about them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in some way is probably</v>

2941
02:01:49.371 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 5>influenced by the humility that you just</v>
<v Speaker 5>naturally get by being so connected to</v>

2942
02:01:53.661 --> 02:01:55.280
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ocean right there,</v>

2943
02:01:55.281 --> 02:01:56.270
<v Speaker 5>the mountains right there.</v>

2944
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:58.730
<v Speaker 5>It's just like they're so connected to</v>
<v Speaker 5>it since they're,</v>

2945
02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:01.820
<v Speaker 5>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have never had city blinders on.</v>

2946
02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:03.740
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe a little bit in Honolulu,</v>

2947
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:06.590
<v Speaker 5>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but out there on the big island,</v>

2948
02:02:06.591 --> 02:02:09.500
<v Speaker 5>there's no city blinders man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're looking at something like really</v>

2949
02:02:09.501 --> 02:02:12.770
<v Speaker 5>insanely intense all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mountains and ocean.</v>

2950
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:14.960
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're on a volcano sun,</v>

2951
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:18.890
<v Speaker 5>it's beautiful and has a bunch of times</v>
<v Speaker 5>in history where the towns have had to</v>

2952
02:02:18.891 --> 02:02:21.500
<v Speaker 5>evacuate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lava is coming over the hill and it just</v>

2953
02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:23.750
<v Speaker 5>wipes out the whole talent town doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>even exist anymore.</v>

2954
02:02:24.610 --> 02:02:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Then Dude's put up these little shacks</v>
<v Speaker 5>on where the lava is and they rope it</v>

2955
02:02:28.671 --> 02:02:33.180
<v Speaker 5>off and that's like their land now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they go back and land is like,</v>

2956
02:02:33.210 --> 02:02:37.550
<v Speaker 5>like gps doubt and they like put stakes</v>
<v Speaker 5>in and make like a little fence over the</v>

2957
02:02:37.551 --> 02:02:40.430
<v Speaker 5>fucking lava and then they put like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>house there.</v>

2958
02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:43.910
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if you can find some photos of that.</v>

2959
02:02:43.911 --> 02:02:45.260
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so bizarre.</v>

2960
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:48.680
<v Speaker 5>I was almost born in Hawaii houses on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big island,</v>

2961
02:02:49.210 --> 02:02:51.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to like temporary houses in the big</v>

2962
02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:54.170
<v Speaker 5>island over lava fields because these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2963
02:02:54.171 --> 02:02:55.400
<v Speaker 5>they lost everything and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2964
02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.320
<v Speaker 5>this is the only thing I have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just going to put a trailer up</v>

2965
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:59.450
<v Speaker 5>where my fucking house is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

2966
02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:00.770
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine.</v>

2967
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:02.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine just watching that go down where</v>

2968
02:03:02.781 --> 02:03:05.780
<v Speaker 5>your house burns down and you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let it start over.</v>

2969
02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:08.540
<v Speaker 5>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would they should have is land set</v>

2970
02:03:08.541 --> 02:03:11.570
<v Speaker 5>aside for people whose houses get fucked</v>
<v Speaker 5>up by volcanoes.</v>

2971
02:03:11.610 --> 02:03:12.860
<v Speaker 5>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2972
02:03:12.861 --> 02:03:15.140
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happens enough where you should</v>

2973
02:03:15.141 --> 02:03:17.480
<v Speaker 5>probably have like a backup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they do they have to have</v>

2974
02:03:17.481 --> 02:03:18.320
<v Speaker 5>insurance or something.</v>

2975
02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:19.990
<v Speaker 5>I think they'd probably have insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be,</v>

2976

<v Speaker 5>of nature is.</v>

3033

3042
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:56.800
<v Speaker 5>slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen videos of just lava taking</v>

3055
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:26.420
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're looking at the actual lava itself</v>

3056
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:30.140
<v Speaker 5>oozing and when you look at it as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>liquid rock,</v>

3057
02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:35.240
<v Speaker 5>like a hot liquid rock,</v>

3060
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:44.660
<v Speaker 5>There's people who go to those places</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just get super close and study that.</v>

3061
02:06:44.661 --> 02:06:47.510
<v Speaker 5>That scares the shit anime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They study it real close.</v>

3062

<v Speaker 5>There's been a few scientists have died</v>
<v Speaker 5>from that.</v>

3063
02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:51.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't melt things as quick as it</v>

3096
02:08:11.471 --> 02:08:13.930
<v Speaker 5>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe it doesn't ask Christ to come</v>

<v Speaker 5>to the creek to it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and also it alleviates,</v>

3135
02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:39.370
<v Speaker 5>you have a certain amount of tension</v>
<v Speaker 5>that comes with you're a failing body.</v>

3136

3137
02:09:42.791 --> 02:09:45.910
<v Speaker 5>like two years out of high school and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the most fun I've ever had</v>

3138
02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:49.030
<v Speaker 5>because I wouldn't compete or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was just like I could eat</v>

3139
02:09:49.031 --> 02:09:51.100
<v Speaker 5>whatever I wanted and I would still just</v>
<v Speaker 5>say the same.</v>

3140
02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:53.170
<v Speaker 5>I felt great about myself and it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

02:09:53.530 --> 02:09:54.970
<v Speaker 5>it was nice while I started doing it</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna look into it right after.</v>

3167
02:10:54.711 --> 02:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Like to repost their stuff cause I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go there instead of looking at</v>

3168
02:10:58.911 --> 02:11:00.060
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3169
02:11:00.070 --> 02:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>And maybe people find out about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos but they have the best collection</v>

3170
02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:08.930
<v Speaker 1>of like sick moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sick like move after move.</v>

3171
02:11:08.931 --> 02:11:09.681
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3172
02:11:09.681 --> 02:11:11.990
<v Speaker 1>and you can add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are real moves that like,</v>

3173
02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing Jujitsu for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I haven't seen before.</v>

3174
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:17.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the most knowledgeable guy when</v>

3175
02:11:17.001 --> 02:11:20.120
<v Speaker 1>it comes to Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know enough about it that when I</v>

3176
02:11:20.121 --> 02:11:23.790
<v Speaker 1>see some completely new choke variation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've never seen before and</v>

3177
02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:24.770
<v Speaker 1>everybody starts doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3178
02:11:24.771 --> 02:11:27.230
<v Speaker 1>okay that wasn't around like this guy.</v>

3179
02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:29.870
<v Speaker 1>This guy has come up with some new thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people come up with a new thing.</v>

3180
02:11:30.170 --> 02:11:31.580
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty regular.</v>

3181
02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite rep watching</v>

3182
02:11:33.021 --> 02:11:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just see people just the game is</v>

3183
02:11:35.181 --> 02:11:36.830
<v Speaker 1>always changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best part.</v>

3184
02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what it is like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the same thing with striking.</v>

3185
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 1>When you see it at its highest level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

3186
02:11:42.410 --> 02:11:45.650
<v Speaker 1>it's when it's only striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Striking at its highest level expression</v>

3187
02:11:45.651 --> 02:11:50.651
<v Speaker 1>for me is either professional boxing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional kickboxing or Muay Thai.</v>

3188
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:55.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to me really I like Muay Thai</v>

3189
02:11:55.611 --> 02:11:57.800
<v Speaker 1>the best because it seems like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing everything.</v>

3190
02:11:57.801 --> 02:12:00.620
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to agree to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up,</v>

3191
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:03.470
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like you should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want to do when you're</v>

3192
02:12:03.471 --> 02:12:05.660
<v Speaker 1>standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like elbows,</v>

3193
02:12:05.661 --> 02:12:07.700
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense to limit</v>

3194
02:12:07.701 --> 02:12:08.534
<v Speaker 1>clinching.</v>

3195
02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's like the number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up thing as far as like what I</v>

3196
02:12:12.471 --> 02:12:14.750
<v Speaker 1>want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the only way you get to see like the</v>

3197
02:12:14.751 --> 02:12:16.970
<v Speaker 1>highest level of expression as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no takedowns.</v>

3198
02:12:17.210 --> 02:12:20.330
<v Speaker 1>If this is no submissions cause then</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause as soon as there's takedown,</v>

3199
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.940
<v Speaker 1>soon as their submissions guys have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different way,</v>

3200
02:12:22.941 --> 02:12:25.750
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as his ground and pound guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a totally different way of,</v>

3201
02:12:25.751 --> 02:12:27.650
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of competing and moving and you're not</v>

3202
02:12:27.651 --> 02:12:32.120
<v Speaker 1>going to see the same as high a level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression and just true striking and</v>

3203
02:12:32.121 --> 02:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>the same as what Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see a lot of crazy moves and</v>

3204
02:12:35.991 --> 02:12:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu that me might not see if you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer kicks or stomps.</v>

3205
02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:43.610
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't for a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because there's a lot of stuff</v>

3206
02:12:43.611 --> 02:12:47.090
<v Speaker 1>that people could do to mitigate your</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement that they're agreeing not to</v>

3207
02:12:47.091 --> 02:12:47.540
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3208
02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:49.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you're just totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling them,</v>

3209
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:52.490
<v Speaker 1>but to get the highest level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling to watch it,</v>

3210
02:12:52.670 --> 02:12:54.350
<v Speaker 1>you really Kinda have to have only</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling.</v>

3211
02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause then it's like these are rules</v>

3212
02:12:56.631 --> 02:13:00.110
<v Speaker 1>were agreeing to and then from there you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can really start to learn how to bend</v>

3213
02:13:00.111 --> 02:13:01.070
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3214
02:13:01.071 --> 02:13:02.390
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3215
02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:05.060
<v Speaker 1>it really is like when you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about with the verbal boxing,</v>

3216
02:13:05.061 --> 02:13:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like that in many ways like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy based approaches to things and</v>

3217
02:13:09.250 --> 02:13:10.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that happens with Jujitsu.</v>

3218
02:13:10.881 --> 02:13:14.450
<v Speaker 1>What happens with striking and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's really interesting about</v>

3219
02:13:14.451 --> 02:13:16.100
<v Speaker 1>martial arts more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3220
02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:17.930
<v Speaker 1>like people look at it in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3221
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:19.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3222
02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:22.880
<v Speaker 1>exciting violent thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Rah Rah Macho thing,</v>

3223
02:13:22.881 --> 02:13:24.350
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly is.</v>

3224
02:13:24.351 --> 02:13:26.990
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely certainly a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the appeal of MMA.</v>

3225
02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:32.230
<v Speaker 1>But also what the appeal is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's insanely to do and you have</v>

3226
02:13:32.941 --> 02:13:35.460
<v Speaker 1>to be insanely brave to choose to do it.</v>

3227
02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:40.230
<v Speaker 1>For a living and in and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insanely dangerous cause you're,</v>

3228
02:13:40.231 --> 02:13:41.850
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get shinned in the face.</v>

3229
02:13:41.851 --> 02:13:44.390
<v Speaker 1>You give my kid flying knee knockout</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

3230
02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:45.960
<v Speaker 1>like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3231
02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:48.510
<v Speaker 1>a recent fight bitchin Chris Weidman and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoel Romero.</v>

3232
02:13:48.511 --> 02:13:49.344
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

3233
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I saw a club Ood Weidman was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well in that fight too and Yoel</v>

3234
02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Romero launched this flying knee that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit him dead in the head.</v>

3235
02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.080
<v Speaker 1>She goes boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just crushed him.</v>

3236
02:14:02.010 --> 02:14:05.010
<v Speaker 1>And I remember watching that going and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Chris Weidman.</v>

3237
02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not like a regular dude that's</v>

3238
02:14:07.621 --> 02:14:09.450
<v Speaker 1>former UFC champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Weidman,</v>

3239
02:14:09.451 --> 02:14:13.650
<v Speaker 1>one of the baddest motherfuckers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet earth and Yoel Romero just did</v>

3240
02:14:13.651 --> 02:14:16.610
<v Speaker 1>that to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does that.</v>

3241
02:14:16.670 --> 02:14:19.410
<v Speaker 1>That is a sport that is like no other</v>
<v Speaker 1>any given Sunday.</v>

3242
02:14:19.411 --> 02:14:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna say?</v>

3243
02:14:20.431 --> 02:14:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Jamie George Saint Pierre signs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>return to the UFC.</v>

3244
02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

3245
02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my friend Stephie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crooklyn from twitter,</v>

3246
02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:32.640
<v Speaker 1>a Steffi Hayes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writer,</v>

3247
02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:33.600
<v Speaker 1>and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3248
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:34.620
<v Speaker 1>tell me about this.</v>

3249
02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:36.300
<v Speaker 1>She actually was the one to break the</v>
<v Speaker 1>news to me.</v>

3250
02:14:36.690 --> 02:14:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So George Saint Pierre is going to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3251
02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:39.241
<v Speaker 1>Good for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3252
02:14:39.241 --> 02:14:40.920
<v Speaker 1>It took some time off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chilled out.</v>

3253
02:14:41.730 --> 02:14:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still still training.</v>

3254
02:14:44.370 --> 02:14:46.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about George never got</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of shape at all.</v>

3255
02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Constantly training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly learning.</v>

3256
02:14:49.171 --> 02:14:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I bet he's better than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody comes back and people think that</v>

3257
02:14:51.781 --> 02:14:53.670
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have loss of step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he's better than ever.</v>

3258
02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't be coming back.</v>

3259
02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:56.160
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3260
02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:58.200
<v Speaker 1>And I've been hearing crazy shit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>his grappling.</v>

3261
02:14:58.230 --> 02:15:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been hearing it's grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So off the chain,</v>

3262
02:15:00.210 --> 02:15:05.100
<v Speaker 1>it was just a better than ever that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimating someone is a huge</v>

3263
02:15:05.250 --> 02:15:08.130
<v Speaker 1>advantage and a tool we'll specially at</v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>

3264
02:15:08.131 --> 02:15:11.310
<v Speaker 1>George and George St Pierre did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>become George Saint Pierre.</v>

3265
02:15:11.311 --> 02:15:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Now by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not knowing what's up,</v>

3266
02:15:14.190 --> 02:15:16.080
<v Speaker 1>he knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's coming back,</v>

3267
02:15:16.081 --> 02:15:18.720
<v Speaker 1>it's because he knows he's healed up it.</v>

3268
02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Probably better than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is going to be really</v>

3269
02:15:20.941 --> 02:15:25.180
<v Speaker 1>interesting to watch him return because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's different in the way he approaches</v>

3270
02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:27.840
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think than almost anybody before him.</v>

3271
02:15:27.841 --> 02:15:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And he influenced so many people after</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and that he's like almost has no ego</v>

3272
02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3273
02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:39.000
<v Speaker 1>like listening to his coaches and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbing information and uh,</v>

3274
02:15:39.001 --> 02:15:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being taught need you see him rolling</v>

3275
02:15:41.341 --> 02:15:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and training and drilling with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had the opportunity to,</v>

3276
02:15:45.170 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 1>to drill with him and do some kick moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>

3277
02:15:47.610 --> 02:15:51.090
<v Speaker 1>go over some stuff and he's just so open</v>
<v Speaker 1>minded and so fucking smart.</v>

3278
02:15:51.330 --> 02:15:55.560
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a really interesting dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's not a mean guy at all.</v>

3279
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:58.020
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would never think if you met him that</v>

3280
02:15:58.021 --> 02:16:01.950
<v Speaker 1>he was this world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the greatest,</v>

3281
02:16:01.951 --> 02:16:04.500
<v Speaker 1>if not the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the greatest welterweight of</v>

3282
02:16:04.501 --> 02:16:05.334
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

3283
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:07.950
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that he would beat Damien</v>

3284
02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Maia a hundred percent of the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3285
02:16:09.031 --> 02:16:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean he would be tyron woodley</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not.</v>

3286
02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at his accomplishments,</v>

3287
02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:16.350
<v Speaker 1>he was in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest welterweight of all time</v>

3288
02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>and super nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3289
02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:22.080
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speaks two languages,</v>

3290
02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:26.040
<v Speaker 1>fluent English and fluent French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Fascinating Guy,</v>

3291
02:16:26.041 --> 02:16:26.874
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he's,</v>

3292
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:29.100
<v Speaker 1>if he's coming back after this amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time off,</v>

3293
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:30.460
<v Speaker 1>he knows what the fuck he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3294
02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna come strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to,</v>

3295
02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:35.860
<v Speaker 1>he's going to look awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

3296
02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3297
02:16:39.390 --> 02:16:43.290
<v Speaker 5>Also today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a way drinks opened up from Mcgregor</v>

3298
02:16:43.290 --> 02:16:45.690
<v Speaker 5>Mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How can you do that if it hasn't really</v>

3299
02:16:45.691 --> 02:16:49.950
<v Speaker 5>been so fast?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to take place before May 31st,</v>

3300
02:16:49.950 --> 02:16:51.780
<v Speaker 5>2018 so like if it doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the batch just go away.</v>

3301
02:16:51.781 --> 02:16:54.810
<v Speaker 5>That kind of happens from time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the card has to happen before your</v>

3302
02:16:54.811 --> 02:16:57.750
<v Speaker 5>fight for your bed to actually be legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

3303
02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:00.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

3304
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:03.180
<v Speaker 5>I'll just say he opened up as a minus</v>
<v Speaker 5>2,525 to one.</v>

3305
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:07.470
<v Speaker 5>I think it's Berto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He opened up at minus 4,000 so I don't</v>

3306
02:17:07.471 --> 02:17:09.780
<v Speaker 5>know if that's saying that Mcgregor's</v>
<v Speaker 5>got a better chance to win,</v>

3307
02:17:09.781 --> 02:17:12.510
<v Speaker 5>but usually it's just set up 25 to one</v>
<v Speaker 5>is not so hot.</v>

3308
02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mcgregor's plus 1100 yeah.</v>

3309
02:17:15.121 --> 02:17:18.630
<v Speaker 5>I think conventional wisdom is that a</v>
<v Speaker 5>floyd boxes the shit out of him.</v>

3310
02:17:19.170 --> 02:17:19.890
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3311
02:17:19.890 --> 02:17:21.750
<v Speaker 5>Teddy Atlas had something very</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting to say.</v>

3312
02:17:21.751 --> 02:17:26.751
<v Speaker 5>He thinks that floyd is not recognizing</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that conor might just decide to</v>

3313
02:17:27.091 --> 02:17:29.700
<v Speaker 5>get disqualified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That like if,</v>

3314
02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:32.790
<v Speaker 5>if it starts getting crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if they're in the middle of a fight</v>

3315
02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:37.200
<v Speaker 5>and he decides he can't beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might decide to just fucking flip him</v>

3316
02:17:37.201 --> 02:17:40.800
<v Speaker 5>on his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Atlas Mcgregor would cheat against</v>

3317
02:17:40.801 --> 02:17:43.050
<v Speaker 5>mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think proclaim himself as king of the</v>

3318
02:17:43.051 --> 02:17:43.940
<v Speaker 5>ring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

3319
02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.070
<v Speaker 5>That's an interesting thought.</v>

3320
02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

3321
02:17:46.261 --> 02:17:49.480
<v Speaker 1>If Mcgregor decided to start kicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd and,</v>

3322
02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and decided to take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd is a dead man.</v>

3323
02:17:52.590 --> 02:17:52.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3324
02:17:52.911 --> 02:17:54.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a hundred percent dead.</v>

3325
02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:59.340
<v Speaker 1>There's not a thing unless he catches</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor coming in with the haymaker to</v>

3326
02:17:59.341 --> 02:18:02.130
<v Speaker 1>end all haymakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can take that iris assassin out with</v>

3327
02:18:02.131 --> 02:18:04.110
<v Speaker 1>one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connor's going to grab him.</v>

3328
02:18:04.410 --> 02:18:06.660
<v Speaker 1>If he grabs him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna rag him to the ground.</v>

3329
02:18:06.690 --> 02:18:09.090
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do whatever the fuck he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to do once he's there.</v>

3330
02:18:09.091 --> 02:18:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And if he doesn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kicked,</v>

3331
02:18:10.361 --> 02:18:12.720
<v Speaker 1>come from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can hit him from a place.</v>

3332
02:18:12.721 --> 02:18:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Floyd can't even touch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll just side kicked the shit out of</v>

3333
02:18:16.171 --> 02:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll stay on the outside moving around.</v>

3334
02:18:18.931 --> 02:18:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Connor's a fast man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not slow.</v>

3335
02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:24.660
<v Speaker 1>And in the first round in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first round,</v>

3336
02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:26.790
<v Speaker 1>if he decides to start kicking floyd's</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs,</v>

3337
02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.830
<v Speaker 1>like if they agreed on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of a,</v>

3338
02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:30.690
<v Speaker 1>a Gnocchi versus Ali match.</v>

3339
02:18:30.810 --> 02:18:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3340
02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:33.151
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

3341
02:18:33.151 --> 02:18:37.800
<v Speaker 1>1960s Mohammed Ali had a match against a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enoki.</v>

3342
02:18:37.801 --> 02:18:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Who's this famous guy who was a pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestler?</v>

3343
02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:43.680
<v Speaker 1>What does Antonio in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you say his first name?</v>

3344
02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that's Antonio and Gnocchi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry for people who are big fans of</v>

3345
02:18:49.621 --> 02:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>

3346
02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:52.200
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just forgot his name.</v>

3347
02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:57.180
<v Speaker 1>So he fought Ali and what he did was he</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid on his back and kicked Ali and the</v>

3348
02:18:57.181 --> 02:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Ali would come near him and like he</v>

3349
02:19:01.291 --> 02:19:03.760
<v Speaker 1>was gonna Jab and a Gnocchi with look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was going,</v>

3350
02:19:03.761 --> 02:19:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any gloves on either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird because I don't know if it</v>

3351
02:19:08.730 --> 02:19:11.640
<v Speaker 1>like what the rules of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he goes.</v>

3352
02:19:11.641 --> 02:19:15.870
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like Ali's should have known</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this dude could kick his legs.</v>

3353
02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see he would kick his legs and he kept</v>

3354
02:19:18.151 --> 02:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>doing it over and over again and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ollie's kicking him and holding on to</v>

3355
02:19:20.791 --> 02:19:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3356
02:19:21.661 --> 02:19:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't hold the ropes,</v>

3357
02:19:22.890 --> 02:19:25.470
<v Speaker 1>but you can kick the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't hold the ropes.</v>

3358
02:19:25.471 --> 02:19:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3359
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess when</v>

3360
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:31.160
<v Speaker 5>Ali was probably look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's kicking the inside of his legs.</v>

3361
02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:34.790
<v Speaker 5>This is probably when Ali was band.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>

3362
02:19:34.791 --> 02:19:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Is that when they did it [inaudible] 76</v>
<v Speaker 5>it said,</v>

3363
02:19:37.010 --> 02:19:38.030
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's way past that.</v>

3364
02:19:38.031 --> 02:19:39.770
<v Speaker 5>Then I pass that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3365
02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:42.080
<v Speaker 5>So this is must ben.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just needed the money or they offered</v>

3366
02:19:42.081 --> 02:19:44.360
<v Speaker 5>him a shitload of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is when he was the heavyweight</v>

3367
02:19:44.361 --> 02:19:45.081
<v Speaker 5>champ then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3368
02:19:45.081 --> 02:19:47.990
<v Speaker 5>Is that the case?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was Ali the champ at the time?</v>

3369
02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:50.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's kicking the fuck out of his leg.</v>

3370
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:54.350
<v Speaker 5>Could just but scooting and kicking his</v>
<v Speaker 5>legs and looking to,</v>

3371
02:19:54.770 --> 02:19:57.430
<v Speaker 5>looking to get them in a leg lock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

3372
02:19:58.960 --> 02:19:59.810
<v Speaker 5>just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

3373
02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:02.780
<v Speaker 5>he was allowed to kick the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we've talked about this.</v>

3374
02:20:02.781 --> 02:20:05.990
<v Speaker 5>They might've must have had some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>an agreement that it was okay to kick</v>

3375
02:20:05.991 --> 02:20:06.824
<v Speaker 5>the legs</v>

3376
02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:09.320
<v Speaker 7>is the reigning heavyweight champion.</v>

3377
02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:12.270
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How nuts is that?</v>

3378
02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3379
02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:16.700
<v Speaker 7>6 million.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was offered $6 million for the fight.</v>

3380
02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:18.250
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

3381
02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:22.620
<v Speaker 5>Is that enough?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3382
02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:24.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he won.</v>

3383
02:20:24.251 --> 02:20:26.590
<v Speaker 5>Did he win or did he get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing about boxing is the</v>

3384
02:20:26.591 --> 02:20:27.830
<v Speaker 5>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3385
02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:30.070

<v Speaker 5>Answer Mcmahon Sr was involved too.</v>

<v Speaker 5>33,000 people showed up for that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>see him box.</v>

3392
02:20:43.410 --> 02:20:44.850
<v Speaker 5>So where does it say about the rules</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3393
02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:46.500
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

02:20:46.810 --> 02:20:47.643
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>

3395
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3396
02:20:50.890 --> 02:20:52.840
<v Speaker 7>very.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There were varying rule or varying</v>

3397
02:20:53.470 --> 02:20:55.870
<v Speaker 7>claims over the years over what the</v>
<v Speaker 7>rules actually work.</v>

3398
02:20:55.980 --> 02:21:00.980
<v Speaker 5>It says no limitations on kicking or</v>
<v Speaker 5>grappling and all types of kicking,</v>

3399
02:21:01.621 --> 02:21:04.770
<v Speaker 5>throwing and grappling were allowed in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bell was the referee.</v>

3400
02:21:04.771 --> 02:21:09.300
<v Speaker 5>So Jean labelle was the referee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course he was.</v>

3401
02:21:09.630 --> 02:21:11.040
<v Speaker 5>He's Jane Labelle.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's awesome.</v>

3403
02:21:13.621 --> 02:21:15.840
<v Speaker 5>He's been on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

3404
02:21:16.290 --> 02:21:18.720
<v Speaker 5>a legendary guy in the world of martial</v>
<v Speaker 5>arts.</v>

3405
02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:21.400
<v Speaker 7>This last quote too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>from professional breasts.</v>

3406
02:21:21.450 --> 02:21:23.560
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Brett Hart was working for Nokia at the</v>

3407
02:21:23.561 --> 02:21:27.340
<v Speaker 7>time and he claimed in an autobiography</v>
<v Speaker 7>that the black Muslims who are backing</v>

3408
02:21:27.341 --> 02:21:29.890
<v Speaker 7>Ali made it clear that if a Gnocchi laid</v>
<v Speaker 7>a finger on their champ,</v>

3409
02:21:29.891 --> 02:21:32.500
<v Speaker 7>they would kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why Gnocchi lay on his back for</v>

3410
02:21:32.501 --> 02:21:35.920
<v Speaker 7>15 rounds kicking Ali in the Shin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So not to use his hands.</v>

3411
02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:37.380
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

3412
02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:40.920
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so he didn't have any gloves on.</v>

3413
02:21:40.921 --> 02:21:42.420
<v Speaker 5>He was allowed to punch it with no</v>
<v Speaker 5>gloves.</v>

3414
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:43.603
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>

3415
02:21:43.650 --> 02:21:45.390
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was allowed to maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he didn't.</v>

3416
02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:48.970
<v Speaker 5>But other forces outside and told him</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if they,</v>

3417
02:21:49.090 --> 02:21:51.430
<v Speaker 5>that's what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Claim made by Bret Hart.</v>

3418
02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:54.460
<v Speaker 5>But you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bret harts and entertainer,</v>

3419
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:55.380
<v Speaker 5>isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3420
02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:57.820
<v Speaker 5>He didn't like entertainers make</v>
<v Speaker 5>entertaining stories.</v>

3421
02:21:59.350 --> 02:22:00.430
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

3422
02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:03.250

<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3424
02:22:06.821 --> 02:22:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Whenever you merge into the world of pro</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling and then another pro wrestler</v>

3425
02:22:10.391 --> 02:22:11.081
<v Speaker 5>tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3427
02:22:12.491 --> 02:22:15.370
<v Speaker 5>The illuminati came down and gave him an</v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimatum.</v>

3428
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:19.660
<v Speaker 5>Lose the match to the undertake or we</v>
<v Speaker 5>will take your house.</v>

3429

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows,</v>

3430
02:22:22.061 --> 02:22:23.920
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all a plot lines for those folk.</v>

3431
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 5>Where are you big fan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3456
02:23:11.970 --> 02:23:14.460
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling fans are dying were so mad at</v>

3457
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:16.230
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were so mean.</v>

3458
02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:18.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's great though.</v>

3459
02:23:20.010 --> 02:23:21.180
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was funny in high school,</v>

3460
02:23:21.181 --> 02:23:22.740
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you that I had a friend in</v>

3461
02:23:22.741 --> 02:23:26.820
<v Speaker 5>high school who was training to become a</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestler and I remember people would</v>

3462
02:23:26.821 --> 02:23:28.980
<v Speaker 5>give him shit about it all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then he was like,</v>

3463
02:23:28.981 --> 02:23:29.550
<v Speaker 5>no man.</v>

3464
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Wrestling training camps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no joke.</v>

3465
02:23:30.991 --> 02:23:33.390
<v Speaker 5>And then he came in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he took his shirt off and he had just</v>

3466
02:23:33.391 --> 02:23:36.000
<v Speaker 5>bruises because I guess when they would</v>
<v Speaker 5>practice,</v>

3467
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:41.001
<v Speaker 5>they would hit each other as hard as</v>
<v Speaker 5>possible so they know exactly how hard</v>

3468
02:23:41.911 --> 02:23:43.560
<v Speaker 5>it is that they're going to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3469
02:23:43.561 --> 02:23:47.460
<v Speaker 5>So they can judge the palms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we offer each other and they would just</v>

3470
02:23:47.461 --> 02:23:50.910
<v Speaker 5>practice that over and over and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>practicing all the falls and stuff and</v>

3471
02:23:50.911 --> 02:23:53.220
<v Speaker 5>like how to get it right and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3472
02:23:53.221 --> 02:23:54.330
<v Speaker 5>if they fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

3473
02:23:54.331 --> 02:23:55.980
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they really can hurt themselves,</v>

3474
02:23:55.981 --> 02:23:56.850
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3475
02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.970
<v Speaker 5>They definitely can mean wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3476
02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:00.870
<v Speaker 5>involves a lot of contact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3477
02:24:00.871 --> 02:24:03.270
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so brutal on the body.</v>

3478
02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:07.740
<v Speaker 5>All those wrestlers that at some point</v>
<v Speaker 5>in time wind up getting badly injured.</v>

3479
02:24:07.741 --> 02:24:09.510
<v Speaker 5>Like Dan Gable was like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>greatest,</v>

3480
02:24:09.511 --> 02:24:10.890
<v Speaker 5>if not the greatest of all time.</v>

3481
02:24:11.130 --> 02:24:14.790
<v Speaker 5>He's got like all kinds of replacements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hip replacements and all shit and all</v>

3482
02:24:14.791 --> 02:24:17.640
<v Speaker 5>that kind of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just had this indomitable will that</v>

3483
02:24:17.650 --> 02:24:21.030
<v Speaker 5>sort of outran his own joints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loved entertaining the people.</v>

3484
02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:22.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was an animal man.</v>

3485

<v Speaker 5>People get so caught up in that though.</v>

3623
02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:53.770
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to support those Goddamn</v>

3624
02:29:53.810 --> 02:29:56.690
<v Speaker 5>lefties and their crazy ideas about blue</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

3625
02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.830
<v Speaker 5>The blue people deserve to live giant</v>
<v Speaker 5>blue people that ride dragons,</v>

3626
02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:03.290
<v Speaker 5>shoot bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That movie was the shit.</v>

3627
02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.120
<v Speaker 5>It was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So good.</v>

3628
02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.910
<v Speaker 5>The only thing I'm bummed out about is</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to do a,</v>

3629
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:11.330
<v Speaker 5>part two is going to be underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that means no bows and arrows.</v>

3630
02:30:11.331 --> 02:30:13.300
<v Speaker 5>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love heart pounds,</v>

3631
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:15.170
<v Speaker 5>like bows and arrows better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

3632
02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 5>That was a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My was a great movie.</v>

3633
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:22.520
<v Speaker 5>I just don't understand people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't appreciate that.</v>

3634
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:24.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's one of the things where</v>

3635
02:30:24.951 --> 02:30:27.560
<v Speaker 5>like people just have gotten to this</v>
<v Speaker 5>point where they're like,</v>

3636
02:30:28.050 --> 02:30:29.690
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say my opinion matters</v>

3637
02:30:29.691 --> 02:30:30.071
<v Speaker 5>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3638
02:30:30.071 --> 02:30:31.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one can just enjoy something anymore.</v>

3639
02:30:31.731 --> 02:30:35.480
<v Speaker 5>Everyone was asked to have either a</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty opinion on it or like a really,</v>

3640
02:30:35.481 --> 02:30:39.830
<v Speaker 5>really not so shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I see people use all sorts of</v>

3641
02:30:39.831 --> 02:30:42.410
<v Speaker 5>different things to sort of make their</v>
<v Speaker 5>point and I see if you were trying to</v>

3642
02:30:42.411 --> 02:30:46.090
<v Speaker 5>make your point about some anti</v>
<v Speaker 5>corporate movie like you would see like</v>

3643
02:30:46.091 --> 02:30:46.970
<v Speaker 5>this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3644
02:30:47.050 --> 02:30:51.470
<v Speaker 5>it's what I see is like dynamics that</v>
<v Speaker 5>make a good storyline where you're</v>

3645
02:30:51.471 --> 02:30:54.710
<v Speaker 5>invested in the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking at it as a propaganda</v>

3646
02:30:54.711 --> 02:30:57.440
<v Speaker 5>film because it's in fucking Spain's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3647
02:30:57.441 --> 02:31:01.010
<v Speaker 5>and they have floating islands and none</v>
<v Speaker 5>of that's real.</v>

3648
02:31:01.290 --> 02:31:05.990
<v Speaker 5>The dragons aren't real either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not real that marine guys,</v>

3649
02:31:05.991 --> 02:31:08.420

3650
02:31:08.421 --> 02:31:10.610
<v Speaker 5>star wars movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh it's so amazing.</v>

3653
02:31:15.491 --> 02:31:17.420
<v Speaker 5>to force diversity and the star wars</v>
<v Speaker 5>movies.</v>

3654
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:18.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking storm trooper.</v>

3657

<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood see we doing,</v>

3658
02:31:27.350 --> 02:31:31.590

<v Speaker 3>Try to take away our glory.</v>

3659
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Glory of white people dominating science</v>
<v Speaker 3>fiction movies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>than white people have dominated science</v>

3661

<v Speaker 3>fiction movies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come to you.</v>

02:33:21.431 --> 02:33:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Are we looking at diversity and did they</v>
<v Speaker 3>bounce off that guy in the far right and</v>

3699
02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:27.660
<v Speaker 3>making wider to sort of balance it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that guy's white as fuck.</v>

3700

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But tell me you can make an android.</v>

3702
02:33:31.741 --> 02:33:34.560
<v Speaker 3>It looks exactly like a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't make his face not white as</v>

3703
02:33:34.561 --> 02:33:35.820
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 3>face?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also he paid his fucking hands.</v>

3706
02:33:41.421 --> 02:33:43.290

<v Speaker 3>And it's also like,</v>

3707
02:33:43.291 --> 02:33:46.540
<v Speaker 3>why is the white guy so logical?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know the other guys just so he</v>

3708
02:33:46.541 --> 02:33:49.320

<v Speaker 3>on the pop star Trek.</v>

3709

3712
02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the movie alien.</v>

3715
02:33:59.250 --> 02:34:01.830
<v Speaker 3>No black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ender's game actually had a great</v>

3716
02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Allianz rather was anders anders game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

3717
02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:07.680
<v Speaker 3>if you read the book cause uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other,</v>

3718
02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:10.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of skepticism where his</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3719
02:34:11.650 --> 02:34:13.110
<v Speaker 3>politicalness lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

3720
02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:15.230
<v Speaker 3>but they would say that's a word sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I made it.</v>

3721
02:34:15.390 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say that he references</v>

3722
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.100
<v Speaker 5>a lot and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it talks a lot about like the Vietnam</v>

3723
02:34:21.101 --> 02:34:22.930
<v Speaker 5>war in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the ender's game book.</v>

3724
02:34:22.931 --> 02:34:25.690
<v Speaker 5>Like they say that the certain races</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's talking about,</v>

3725
02:34:25.691 --> 02:34:28.720
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he alludes to them being like the</v>

3726
02:34:28.721 --> 02:34:30.790
<v Speaker 5>Vietnamese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I could be making all this up</v>

3727
02:34:30.791 --> 02:34:33.520

<v Speaker 5>but Anders Anders Games are really good</v>

3728
02:34:33.521 --> 02:34:35.410
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>

3729
02:34:35.411 --> 02:34:38.920
<v Speaker 5>it's all about like this alien race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's eventually coming to attack and</v>

3730
02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:42.460
<v Speaker 5>they have these kids do this game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the whole time,</v>

02:34:42.610 --> 02:34:44.800
<v Speaker 5>spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're actually fighting and they're</v>

3732
02:34:44.801 --> 02:34:48.850

02:36:19.061 --> 02:36:20.560
<v Speaker 5>really crazy movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mad.</v>

3778
02:36:21.250 --> 02:36:23.590
<v Speaker 5>He'd played a fucking complete nut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was great.</v>

3779
02:36:23.610 --> 02:36:26.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like an actor that can play a villain</v>

3780
02:36:27.310 --> 02:36:29.980
<v Speaker 5>that's plays it so well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll still hate the actor</v>

3781
02:36:29.981 --> 02:36:31.590
<v Speaker 5>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3782
02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:32.463
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what you mean.</v>

3783
02:36:32.470 --> 02:36:33.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3784
02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:37.060
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the weird thing about</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching an actor,</v>

3785
02:36:37.061 --> 02:36:38.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're agreeing,</v>

3786
02:36:38.201 --> 02:36:40.850
<v Speaker 5>you know that that's Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're agreeing that he's on a space</v>

3787
02:36:40.851 --> 02:36:43.240
<v Speaker 5>ship and he's targeting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3788
02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:48.310
<v Speaker 5>you can like the day after tomorrow is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that tomorrow movie because they have to</v>

3789
02:36:48.311 --> 02:36:51.320
<v Speaker 5>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they changed the name to it's day after</v>

3790
02:36:51.321 --> 02:36:53.500
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow and it's like a weird subtitle</v>
<v Speaker 5>on it too,</v>

3791
02:36:54.370 --> 02:36:57.070
<v Speaker 5>which is in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one of the most overlooked science</v>

3792
02:36:57.071 --> 02:36:57.970
<v Speaker 5>fiction movies ever.</v>

3793
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:59.910
<v Speaker 5>It was a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

3794
02:36:59.911 --> 02:37:02.020
<v Speaker 5>that's a edge it tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tomorrow.</v>

3795
02:37:02.050 --> 02:37:03.490
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Edge of tomorrow.</v>

3796
02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:04.750
<v Speaker 5>Which one would have to tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3797
02:37:05.110 --> 02:37:06.280
<v Speaker 5>what did that one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3798
02:37:06.281 --> 02:37:09.700
<v Speaker 5>that was the ice with the Quaid Fella.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With the Queen Fella.</v>

3799
02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:10.653
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>

3800
02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:14.260
<v Speaker 5>that was a super bad movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That end of the world movie.</v>

3801
02:37:14.261 --> 02:37:16.280
<v Speaker 5>That was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love bad movies too.</v>

3802
02:37:16.281 --> 02:37:18.410
<v Speaker 5>Cause then you usually laugh at them all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day after tomorrow,</v>

3803
02:37:18.411 --> 02:37:19.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was called.</v>

3804
02:37:19.430 --> 02:37:20.181
<v Speaker 5>Live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>die,</v>

3805
02:37:20.181 --> 02:37:21.350
<v Speaker 5>repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3806
02:37:21.351 --> 02:37:23.480
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3807
02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:25.550
<v Speaker 5>That's a great science fiction movie</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

3808
02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:30.760
<v Speaker 5>And it is white as fuck white people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white people,</v>

3809
02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:34.610
<v Speaker 5>oblivion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think our eyes Elysium sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Tom Cruise did that movie edge of</v>

3812
02:37:39.111 --> 02:37:40.850
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow and then he also did a</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bolivian,</v>

3813
02:37:40.851 --> 02:37:42.560
<v Speaker 5>I think like within months of each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

3814
02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:43.820
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3815
02:37:43.821 --> 02:37:45.650
<v Speaker 5>They probably were confusing as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3816
02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:47.840
<v Speaker 5>They're both science fiction movies.</v>

3817

<v Speaker 5>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3821
02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:58.760
<v Speaker 5>But with a guy like Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you watch it,</v>
