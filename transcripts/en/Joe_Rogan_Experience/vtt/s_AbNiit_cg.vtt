00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So this the vidcon thing that you went to,</v>

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>who puts this together?</v>

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Hank and John Green.</v>

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.723
<v Speaker 1>And who are they?</v>

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>The vlog brothers.</v>

8
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>They're famous youtubers.</v>

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

10
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I find it very interesting when it needs,</v>

11
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>who is calling me a shithead and garbage human and that's a direct violation of</v>

12
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>our code of conduct.</v>

13
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And did they do anything about it?</v>

14
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.733
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

15
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>because she's a feminist because she's a woman.</v>

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

17
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Because she gets special cause she was in Esaw keys and because she gets special</v>

18
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>treatment because at this point she's basically become the avatar feminism.</v>

19
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>If she fails,</v>

20
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God I didn't know what I mean.</v>

21
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Is she respected in that world?</v>

22
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.471
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

23
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:42.541
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

24
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

25
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.553
<v Speaker 1>Everyone hates her.</v>

26
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Why did they still proper up?</v>

27
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Because she's in his sock.</v>

28
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Keizan if she doesn't make any sense,</v>

29
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

30
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.923
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a myth that's built up around to and get word.</v>

32
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

33
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

34
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>and they've all propped her up.</v>

35
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>They've all propped her up level,</v>

36
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>said good things about him.</v>

37
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>They've will defended her.</v>

38
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>And if it turns out that she is in fact an abuser,</v>

39
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>which she did according to the Vidcon code of conduct,</v>

40
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>which is the code of conduct.</v>

41
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember it verbatim,</v>

43
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>but I write down a video.</v>

44
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

45
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my latest videos.</v>

46
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>it was just a quick message to Hank and John Green and a,</v>

48
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I know that thousands of people email them saying,</v>

49
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:21.211
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

50
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:21.451
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

51
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>she did violate your code of conduct from a position of institutional privilege</v>

52
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>at Vidcon.</v>

53
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.761
<v Speaker 1>She was on the panel.</v>

54
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.571
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a microphone.</v>

55
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:28.404
<v Speaker 1>She had a microphone.</v>

56
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>She's calling me names.</v>

57
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>She's accusing me of things aren't true.</v>

58
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.621
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

59
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>and she was doing that while you were in the audience directly looking me in the</v>

60
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>

61
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.271
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

62
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

63
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.703
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

64
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.461
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

65
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

67
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>And they've done nothing.</v>

68
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>They have done nothing.</v>

69
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>They've said nothing.</v>

70
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:45.684
<v Speaker 1>You talk.</v>

71
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards,</v>

72
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>all I got from her fans and,</v>

73
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>and I mean like,</v>

74
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of messages,</v>

76
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>and I've just retweeted them all night with exactly the same language she uses</v>

77
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>when she's displaying.</v>

78
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:57.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

79
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>look at that nasty messages.</v>

80
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing of people calling me eight garbage human,</v>

81
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>which is what she called me.</v>

82
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And so she has done absolutely nothing different.</v>

83
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.421
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

84
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

85
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.453
<v Speaker 1>Hank and John,</v>

86
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>she's violated your code of conduct.</v>

87
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.051
<v Speaker 1>Her fans,</v>

88
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>she's incited a cyber model harassers exactly as she claims I do.</v>

89
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>But she has actually done this.</v>

90
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Then on the Saturday she was due to be on a panel about cyber harassment.</v>

91
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.931
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

92
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:29.931
<v Speaker 1>But it can't be harassment when she's a woman and you're a man because you are</v>

93
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the oppressor.</v>

94
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same thing as racism and the black person being raised against a</v>

95
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.561
<v Speaker 1>white person.</v>

96
00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:40.561
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible the only reason to do this then to not to take no action is if</v>

97
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you are highly ideological.</v>

98
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly,</v>

99
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>it's so you feel like they're high d I highly ideological.</v>

100
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly biased.</v>

102
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>But why are they,</v>

103
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>if they're youtube stars,</v>

104
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

105
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>aren't they like,</v>

106
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>don't they understand they're very progressive,</v>

107
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:54.931
<v Speaker 1>very progressive.</v>

108
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>But you're fairly progressive to know I'm a liberal,</v>

109
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm not progressing.</v>

110
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between a liberal,</v>

111
00:02:58.591 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>a liberal called sales opportunity?</v>

112
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

113
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.641
<v Speaker 2>progressive ones,</v>

114
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.474
<v Speaker 2>quality of outcome.</v>

115
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>When I was little,</v>

116
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I told my dad,</v>

117
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

118
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>can we get rid of the apostrophe?</v>

119
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I was young,</v>

120
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I was like 12.</v>

121
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.683
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

122
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.553
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

123
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.551
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

124
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>it's just a sucks.</v>

125
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Like we're,</v>

126
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

127
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.371
<v Speaker 2>like what is it?</v>

128
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Like people always mispronounce it and he's like,</v>

129
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 2>you should be proud of that.</v>

130
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

131
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.473
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

132
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.493
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

133
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.333
<v Speaker 2>and then</v>

134
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking I'm not,</v>

135
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 2>it's just the Boston 13 that's rough.</v>

136
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

137
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.421
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

138
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

139
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 2>and then I started to like it,</v>

140
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:30.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:31.271
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm like,</v>

142
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:31.421
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

143
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is my name.</v>

144
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:32.651
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it,</v>

145
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

146
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

147
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.361
<v Speaker 2>but when I was little,</v>

148
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to change.</v>

149
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.381
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 2>but just like maybe just at least at the dinner table,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've never had anyone really tried to pick a fight with me.</v>

223
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I had a guy at a concert once,</v>

226
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.830
<v Speaker 3>And it was standing with me cause people kept trying to cut through to get,</v>

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking chest up even bigger.</v>

298
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.331
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like,</v>

299
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 3>he looks like he's going to walk away,</v>

300
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:01.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever I'm saying,</v>

301
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.731
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

302
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:02.031
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

303
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

304
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.381
<v Speaker 3>do your own thing.</v>

305
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

306
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

307
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 3>he's just getting even more looked up and funny points his finger out and I'm</v>

308
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:07.821
<v Speaker 3>laughing at him.</v>

309
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 3>And the girl who,</v>

310
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

311
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.710
<v Speaker 3>who was,</v>

312
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

313
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 3>does Jujitsu and was a fighter,</v>

314
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 3>she reaches out and grabs the whole disguise risks and pulls his hand out and</v>

315
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:15.951
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

316
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 3>don't you don't want to do that.</v>

317
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 3>And then he looks at her and he looks at me and I'm just smiling and he pulls</v>

318
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 3>his hand back and I go,</v>

319
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 3>I know what must have gone through his head is just like,</v>

320
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 3>this girl's grip is serious.</v>

321
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 3>And she's telling me,</v>

322
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 3>don't fucking do it.</v>

323
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a good idea not to fucking do it,</v>

324
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 3>probably exactly what.</v>

325
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 3>But other times there have been like,</v>

326
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

327
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not impervious to getting an a mood.</v>

329
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes I've been out and about and someone was being a dickhead and I</v>

330
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 3>see it and it's like,</v>

331
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.303
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

332
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

333
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.220
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

334
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 3>he's clearly trying to egg something on somehow.</v>

335
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe I,</v>

336
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

337
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 3>add a little something to that scene,</v>

338
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.220
<v Speaker 3>a feel if he'll,</v>

339
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

340
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.440
<v Speaker 3>he'll bite and just happen,</v>

341
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

342
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 3>or I've had some people go,</v>

343
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:02.001
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

344
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:02.301
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

345
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.021
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to fight you.</v>

346
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:03.561
<v Speaker 3>They know who you are.</v>

347
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:03.801
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

348
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 3>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

349
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm some sort of d list celebrity.</v>

350
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows who the fuck I am.</v>

351
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 3>So get away with a lot.</v>

352
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

353
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 3>if a guy who had a fight,</v>

354
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 3>he would know who you are.</v>

355
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

356
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 3>I was a fan of fighting.</v>

357
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 3>He would know who you are.</v>

358
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 3>And those guys would be way less likely to pick a fight in the first,</v>

359
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 3>there was one dude who was at this bar and Fullerton and he's being just</v>

360
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:22.161
<v Speaker 3>belligerent.</v>

361
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 3>He's being an asshole and this place and,</v>

362
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 3>and my buddy hammer,</v>

363
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 3>he was the door guy at the time and the southern and they're like,</v>

364
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.881
<v Speaker 3>come on and he's,</v>

365
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 3>this guy's fucking getting all riled up.</v>

366
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 3>And I'm standing there with hammer and just looking at this dude.</v>

367
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 3>And eventually the other tour guy comes over and he's like,</v>

368
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.251
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

369
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 3>you fucking dumb ass.</v>

370
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 3>You're wearing the fucking tee shirt of that guy right there.</v>

371
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 3>So maybe you might want to shut the fuck up.</v>

372
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 3>It's this guy's wearing one of my affliction shirts.</v>

373
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 3>And the guy looks at the shirt and he looks at me and he's like,</v>

374
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.213
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

375
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 3>this is stupid.</v>

376
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Getting your ass kicked because</v>

377
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 4>you picked a fight with a guy whose shirt you have on like you,</v>

378
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:00.301
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

379
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 4>you're wearing a Josh Barnett shirt.</v>

380
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:11.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
